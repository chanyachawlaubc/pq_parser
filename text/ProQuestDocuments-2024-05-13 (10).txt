Abstract: The Agent's Take: "It was in a very good location just a block away from Eglinton, so you've got the bus stop there, Shoppers Drug Mart and tons of restaurants," says agent [Randi Kwinta]. "Those bungalows are being knocked down and new homes are being built there, so that whole little pocket is being transformed."

The Action: Just a few doors north of local businesses and the upcoming light-rail transit line along Eglinton Avenue West, this detached bungalow on a 25-by-110-foot lot was closely scrutinized by about 20 buyers with private showings and large crowds the agents-only open house and first public open house. A second public open house was cancelled after it sold to the highest bidder in a multiple offer situation.
What They Got: In the past decade, this traditional brick residence from the 1940s was given a modest facelift with new roofing, eavestroughs, windows, chimney and custom wrought-iron porch railing, in addition to updated wiring and kitchen with tile floors and ceramic backsplashes.
* The main floor is laid out with two rear bedrooms, including one with access to a secluded garden via a sunroom, a central dining area and front living room with a wood-burning fireplace with an original stone mantle.
* Off the mutual driveway, a separate side door leads down to an office, recreation area and smaller of two bathrooms.
The Agent's Take: "It was in a very good location just a block away from Eglinton, so you've got the bus stop there, Shoppers Drug Mart and tons of restaurants," says agent Randi Kwinta. "Those bungalows are being knocked down and new homes are being built there, so that whole little pocket is being transformed."
However, this property won't be eradicated by the buyer.
"It had the character of the time it was built - like the wood panelling, stained glass and beautiful hardwood floors - in addition to being very well kept," says agent Danny Freeman, who was also impressed by how the seller groomed the grounds.
"It was full of peonies blooming and roses that it left a very good impression on someone walking up the steps to a handsome Tudor bungalow."

Abstract: Shortly after we meet Mr. [Zhang Jiangxing] for tea to discuss the events of the last year, a thin man in a dark jacket walks in through the tea house's open door. "Who are you? Give me your business card," he shouts, grabbing my shoulder. When I ask him to give me his own card first, he releases his grip on me, hands Mr. Zhang a handwritten note and walks out without getting my name. "He's a police informant," Mr. Zhang says with the shrug of someone who sees such people every day.

Full text:   Seven decades ago, Mao Zedong and his Red Army were surrounded and on the verge of defeat at the hands of the nationalist Kuomintang. The Communists broke out into coastal Guangdong province and began what became known as the Long March, a strategic retreat that took them west into China's interior and then north until they reached the safety of their base in the city of Yan'an, in Shaanxi province.
The much-mythologized march allowed the Communists to regroup for Mao's eventual victory in the Chinese civil war, setting the stage for the birth of the People's Republic in 1949.
Six decades on, photographer John Lehmann and I are - very loosely - retracing the route, travelling by rail along the path the Red Army walked, stopping along the way to examine the challenges Mao's latest successor, Xi Jinping, will face in the decade ahead.
How will Mr. Xi deal with the demands for greater press and democratic freedoms in Guangdong, the province where his father helped establish the first capitalist "special economic zones" in the early 1980s? What can he propose to help China's interior and west deal with the growing economic divide between urban and rural populations, as well as the mounting demographic challenges?
Will Mr. Xi continue to pursue growth at all costs, as his predecessors did, or will he apply the brake in part to spare the country from further environmental ruin? And what about the restive ethnic minorities?
The journey ends at Yan'an, which also happens to be near the cave where Mr. Xi lived for seven years after his father was purged by Mao during the Cultural Revolution. Despite Mao's murderous excesses, his photo still hangs over Tiananmen Square in Beijing, and appears on every denomination of China's currency. He is still the primary symbol of the Party and the state.
Will Mr. Xi, a man who personally suffered under Mao, be the Chinese leader to speak openly about his crimes? If he doesn't, can China move forward fast enough to meet the growing demands of its people ?
**********
CHINESE DEMOCRACY
Welcome to Wukan, the journey's starting point, where protests over a land grab led to elections and an independent local government
If you want to visit Wukan - the tiny village hailed as a Chinese experiment in democracy - it's best that you don't call ahead.
"If you call [to make appointments], you probably won't be able to see anybody," Zhang Jiangxing, a 21-year-old blogger, warns as our car approached his hometown on China's southeast coast.
Just show up, he advises. So we do.
It's not that Wukan leaders are inhospitable. Quite the opposite. But others higher up in the Chinese power structure seem unenthusiastic about outsiders coming to visit the little democracy inside the People's Republic. "Even as I speak to you, there is someone else listening," Mr. Zhang explains over his own mobile phone.
Wukan is the starting point of our journey of discovery overland through China, one that will stretch over thousands of kilometres and several weeks. Nearly all of this cross-China trip over the next few weeks will be by rail.
But it begins here, a three-hour drive south of Guangzhou railway, to see what Chinese democracy looks like one year after a mini-uprising that produced the country's most independent, and arguably most responsive, local government.
In late 2011, Mr. Zhang used his accounts on Twitter and Weibo, its Chinese equivalent, to tell the world that Wukan's 1,300 residents had taken over the village's main square, demanding the right to choose their own representatives. After a months-long standoff with police, the villagers were allowed to hold an election last Feb. 1 and vote for their own leaders.
What we find is a hardscrabble village - Wukan is home to rice farmers and fishermen - whose leaders are struggling to deliver on the promises they made to their electorate. The electorate, meanwhile, is beginning to wonder if choosing their own leaders has made things any better.
The Wukan uprising has been declared (by the academic who advised China's new leader Xi Jinping on his doctoral thesis) to have "historic significance" because it showed democracy and social stability could coexist in China. But the new village council remains just a tiny brick at the bottom of a vast, corrupt and authoritarian power structure. And that power structure is obsessively monitoring the democrats of Wukan.
Shortly after we meet Mr. Zhang for tea to discuss the events of the last year, a thin man in a dark jacket walks in through the tea house's open door. "Who are you? Give me your business card," he shouts, grabbing my shoulder. When I ask him to give me his own card first, he releases his grip on me, hands Mr. Zhang a handwritten note and walks out without getting my name. "He's a police informant," Mr. Zhang says with the shrug of someone who sees such people every day.
The system is pushing back against Wukan's uprising in subtler ways, too. Members of the seven-person village committee (only the village chief, Lin Zuluan, is a Communist Party member) say they've hit a wall in their efforts to reclaim villagers' land that was illegally sold to real estate developers by the previous committee.
That land grab sparked the initial protests in late 2011. A failure to recover most or all of the villagers' land will be viewed by many here as a failure of the new council, and perhaps even of the experiment with democracy.
"On one side, the villagers are pushing us to go faster [in recovering the land]. But the upper levels of government do not move very quickly. We are the meat pressed in the sandwich," says Hong Ruichao, a 28-year-old salesman elected to town council following the protests. "This past year has not been simple."
On Wukan's central square, where the protesters first gathered in 2011, some say that if the village council can't get the land back, the villagers will have to again resort to the only tactic that has thus far delivered results: protest.
*********
THE ROUTE OF THE LONG MARCH
Encirclement
The Long March took place during a period of civil war. Vastly outnumbered, the Red Army's winding escape - through snowy mountains and across rushing rivers, from pursuing soldiers, artillery and the aerial bombings of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Army (Kuomintang) - is a tale of desperation, guerrilla tactics and endurance.
It begins in Jiangxi province, where the Communists were in control and had established a government, and where the Red Army faced annihilation in the autumn of 1934 as the result of an encirclement strategy. The Communists had to break out.
Jiangxi
In October of 1934, more than 80,000 Chinese Communists broke through the blockade. "Moving like a lumbering elephant train, the Red Army made its way to the southwest corner of the soviet zone and slipped over the border..." writes American historian Harrison Salisbury in his book The Long March: The Untold Story .
Deals with Chinese warlords and intelligence failures committed by Nationalists meant that the Red Army moved easily and enjoyed early success in its escape from Jiangxi, explains Mr. Salisbury.
River crossing
The Red Army set out to cross the Xiang River with the Nationalist Army in pursuit. Aerial bombings wreaked havoc on the Communists trying to cross the river in November, 1934.
The estimated number of Communists killed in the river crossing and the battle varies widely, with some claiming that 50,000 people, or two-thirds of the Red Army, were killed. Others put the number of dead at 15,000, suggesting that the diminished force was the result of desertions.
Mao's rise
A key politburo meeting in Zunyi - following Mao's military advice to target the poorly defended city - allowed the Communists to take stock and assign blame for the events that led to the flight from the southeast base they had occupied and the heavy losses that followed.
Mao was already a key figure, and while it would be some years before he would fully consolidate his power, the Zunyi meeting in January, 1935 strengthened his position.
Evasion
Following heavy Communist losses, it was crucial to evade both Kuomintang soldiers and aerial bombs.
"Instead of an arrow-like advance, they [the retreating Red Army] began a series of distracting manoeuvres, so that it became more and more difficult for Nanking planes to identify the day-by-day objective of the main forces," writes American journalist Edgar Snow, who travelled to interview Mao in northern China.
The strategy added to Mao's reputation as a skilled military thinker, argues author Sun Shuyun. "Mao himself regarded it as his tour de force."
Luding Bridge
Few moments in the Long March feature more prominently in Chinese Communist mythology than the events at Luding Bridge, where thousands of Red Army soldiers made a dangerous crossing of the Dadu River in Qinghai province, dodging bullets and flames.
Crossing the river meant walking the planks of a foot bridge - except the planks had been removed by the Nationalist army, so the story goes.
Historians now debate the size of the Nationalist force that confronted the Communists at the bridge and how many planks were actually missing from the bridge.
Mountains
Perhaps the most treacherous section of the Long March was the crossing of the Great Snowy Mountains.
A much-diminished Red Army, on the command of Mao in June of 1935, began climbing a section of the mountain range. At altitudes of more than 4,250 metres they experienced frostbite, a lack of oxygen and snow-blindness. Some carried packs of up to 36 kilograms with food and cooking equipment.
"Men joined hands to keep from falling. Fog and mist alternated with sudden storms. Small avalanches crashed down from the peaks. Bodyguard Wei became dizzy and lost strength," writes American historian Harrison Salisbury in his book The Long March: The Untold Story .
Yan'an, Shaanxi
Only a tenth of the original Red Army, an estimated 8,000 people, made it to Shaanxi province in north-central China by October, 1935 - safe from the Nationalist troops that had pursued the Communists for a year. It would take another year for other Chinese Communist forces to join Mao and rebuild the Red Army.
There would be many more battles - with the Japanese and, once again, with the Nationalist forces - but the Long March inspired many to Mao's movement and gave Communists a powerful tool.
"The Long March is a manifesto. It has proclaimed to the world that the Red Army is an army of heroes, while the imperialists and their running dogs, Chiang Kai-shek and his like, are impotent. It has proclaimed their utter failure to encircle, pursue, obstruct and intercept us," said Mao in a party conference report in December, 1935.

Stranger than Agatha Christie fiction: Death by cyanide followed big lottery win

Author: Moore, Oliver

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/stranger-than-agatha-christie-fiction-death/docview/1267228262/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "The thing about it is that it's not one of those poisons that's tasteless," she said. "It has a really strong, bitter taste, so you would know you had swallowed something bad if you had swallowed cyanide. But if you had a high enough dose it wouldn't matter, because ... a good lethal dose will take you out in less than five minutes."

Full text:   It reads like the plot of a whodunit: a lottery winner poisoned so skilfully that the death is not viewed as suspicious - until a mysterious caller urges the medical examiner to look again.
Urooj Khan was an immigrant success story, an Indian who went to the United States and started a small chain of dry-cleaning businesses in Chicago. He also dabbled in real estate, renting out a number of condominiums he owned, but he struggled with a weakness for playing the lottery.
Mr. Khan had sworn off the lottery after making an Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, a local paper said, but waffled last summer. He bought two tickets for $60 (U.S.) and then "jumped two feet in the air" after realizing he'd won $1-million. Accompanied by his wife, daughter and some friends, he picked up the oversized cheque - saying that the moment "means everything to me" - and went home to wait for the actual money to arrive. Opting to take a smaller amount as a lump sum, he would be $425,000 richer after taxes.
The cheque was issued on July 19. But Mr. Khan never enjoyed the reward. He went to bed after dinner, woke up screaming and died the next day. The money, under the normal process, would have gone to his estate.
It was a death worthy of Hercule Poirot, without even the whiff of almonds that writer Agatha Christie often used to signal cyanide poisoning to her fictional sleuth.
Basic tests, which looked for carbon monoxide and some illegal drugs, came up negative and investigators were ready to deem Mr. Khan's death the result of natural causes. Hardening or thinning of the arteries, they believed. But then came an unexpected phone call.
Medical Examiner Stephen Cina told the Chicago Tribune that, within a week of the death, a concerned relative asked his office to take a closer look at the case. "Forensics is not a static field," he told CNN. "If new evidence comes to light, we'll revisit cases."
In this case, that meant more intensive toxicology tests. By early September they had revealed there was cyanide in Mr. Khan's blood, prompting a relabelling of his cause of death to "pending." In late November or early December, according to reports, a more detailed blood analysis came back showing "a lethal level of cyanide" and the death became a murder case.
Authorities now plan to dig up his body to find out just how how much cyanide he ingested. And police are probing whether there is a link between the killing and his lottery win.
Exhuming the body could allow investigators to do more tests on tissue samples that could bolster evidence if the case goes to trial, Cook County Medical Examiner Stephen Cina said Tuesday. "It's always good if and when the case goes to trial to have as much data as possible."
He hopes to exhume the body in the next few weeks, once a judge has approved it.
Cyanide can get into the body by being inhaled, swallowed or injected. Mr. Cina told The Associated Press that cyanide poisoning is extremely rare, and that he's had only one or two cases of the 4,500 autopsies he'd done.
Experts say the poison is difficult to obtain and normally easy to detect, often leaving blue splotches on a victim's skin, and can be apparent to victims. Deborah Blum, author of The Poisoner's Handbook , told AP that it kills "in this explosion of cell death" that makes victims feel as though they're suffocating.
Very little of the poison is needed.
"The thing about it is that it's not one of those poisons that's tasteless," she said. "It has a really strong, bitter taste, so you would know you had swallowed something bad if you had swallowed cyanide. But if you had a high enough dose it wouldn't matter, because ... a good lethal dose will take you out in less than five minutes."

Capitol gains: H Street's revival

Author: Ritter, Judith

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/capitol-gains-h-streets-revival/docview/1267019594/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: So far, H Street is primarily a weekend destination. "It's where you want to go when you want to go somewhere really different," says actor Will Gartshore, a native of Sault Ste. Marie who works as a lobbyist for the World Wildlife Fund. "H Street has the closest vibe to Parkdale, West Queen West [in Toronto]." He favours the "great scrappy" Rock & Roll Hotel, known for live acts such as Toronto's Dragonette and its popular scatological spelling bees.

Full text:   The inauguration equals party time in Washington. But the historic Atlas District is always hopping
It's 10 p.m. on H Street NE, and the queue of clubgoers waiting to hear a band is a block long. A group of sexy tomboys walks past, headed to girls' night at a sleek lounge. A few doors down, a cheer goes up for a big score in skeeball. Welcome to party central Washington.
And while there's no bigger celebratory moment in this city than the presidential inauguration on Jan. 21, you won't find this sort of fun on Capitol Hill.
Behind the bustling Union Station, about a kilometre north of the government buildings, lies the H Street Corridor (a.k.a. the Atlas District). It was once home to immigrants, Pullman porters, teachers and shop owners. From the 1930s, until the riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968, it was the city's second busiest commercial district. Now, after a down-and-out few decades, H Street NE is roaring back.
Late at night, trustafarian white guys with skinny pants and gals sporting scarlet lipstick and vintage frocks pour in, queuing up at nightspots with such clever names as Jimmy Valentine's Lonely Hearts Club; the area's African-American partygoers head to the rooftop of Twelve, the coolest boîte on the strip.
By day, the lunch-pail crowd still hangs out at Mason's barbershop and snacks on fried-fish sandwiches at Horace and Dickies, a carry-out joint more than 20 years old.
H Street is a checkerboard of narrow storefronts, some selling hardware and workwear - others housing hot new restaurants and yoga studios. The neighbourhood is a clutter of early 20th-century buildings on little side streets. (As with other parts of D.C., evening visitors might not want to stray too far away from the main drag.)
One thing you won't see much of is tourists - "yet!" says Anwar Saleem emphatically. As executive director of H St. Main Street, a non-profit working to reinvigorate the neighbourhood, Saleem is its biggest booster. He reminisces as we stroll through the blocks where, as a kid, he shined shoes or ran errands for shopkeepers.
"That was before the '68 riots decimated everything," he says sadly, gesturing to a strip mall where family businesses stood. But in a millisecond he's upbeat again, noting that the area is also the site of the Beatles' first U.S. concert.
"Even when there was crack and crime here," Saleem says, "this was a warm place with good neighbours. It took us years of working with the city, but the residents brought H Street back." In less than a decade, 180 businesses have opened. New sidewalks line the streets, and locals are betting on the launch of a streetcar later this year to bring in shoppers and tourists.
So far, H Street is primarily a weekend destination. "It's where you want to go when you want to go somewhere really different," says actor Will Gartshore, a native of Sault Ste. Marie who works as a lobbyist for the World Wildlife Fund. "H Street has the closest vibe to Parkdale, West Queen West [in Toronto]." He favours the "great scrappy" Rock & Roll Hotel, known for live acts such as Toronto's Dragonette and its popular scatological spelling bees.
That kind of playfulness is common. In one venue, millennials indulge in arcade games. At the bar/Mexican restaurant H Street Country Club, patrons munch on duck tacos and play shuffleboard, skeeball or Washington-themed mini-putt.
More upscale fare is on the way, says Joe Englert, an early investor in the bar scene. "It's time for more sophisticated places." This spring he will launch Vendetta, an Italian soul food joint with indoor bocce and, he adds with a laugh, "an all-star collection of plaster saints on the back patio." So still irreverent, but tonier.
Despite all the development, this is a community with deep roots. On my walk with Saleem, we're greeted by old-timers who still tip their hats to ladies. News that sitcom star Neil Patrick Harris just dined on ramen at Toki Underground leaves long-time residents unimpressed. But everyone is thrilled that President Barack Obama has eaten at Smith Commons and Boundary Road, and that the first lady considers Sticky Rice a favourite. The black population in Washington, although still the majority, has declined over the past decade, and areas such as H Street NE are increasingly attracting more young, white, middle-class home buyers. For now, the neighbourhood maintains a delicate balance between hipsterization and its historic African-American culture. It helps that much of the change is community driven. "We want the area to grow," D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray, tells me, "but we want the diversity and affordability to remain intact."
Fundrise, a groundbreaking program, may be part of the answer. It crowd-sources real-estate investment, giving the community a say in what's built. The first project is Maketto, a market/coffee shop opening this spring.
For now, H Street seems far enough away from the policy wonks to set itself apart. "It feels like you are at the outer boundary of D.C. here," Gartshore says. "That's what's fun."

Full text:   The legend of Danny Murphy: How a PEI hospitality empire was built on a foundation of doughnuts and double-doubles
Former policeman Ron Joyce was scrambling to build a national doughnut and coffee chain called Tim Hortons, and trouble was brewing in the little market of Prince Edward Island. The local franchisee, who had opened the island's first two outlets, was feeling family pressure to move back to Ontario, leaving a hole in Mr. Joyce's doughnut growth ambitions.
The PEI franchisee had a candidate in mind to replace him. But Mr. Joyce wasn't convinced Danny Murphy, a kid fresh out of university who at 24 was already itching to run his own show, was ready for the big leap from baker to businessman.
"I was reluctant to sell to him because of his age," Mr. Joyce says. But in 1980, he finally took a chance on the brash young man, who drew on family support and came up with the $255,000 price.
Thirty-two years later, Mr. Murphy is now a charter member of the Tim Hortons millionaires, the elite franchisees who have ridden the double-double wave through the past three decades to become huge success stories in their local communities. "It's been a great ride," the 56-year-old says.
A great ride, indeed, that has spawned a family network of 70 fast-food outlets across the country - 50 under the Tim Hortons banner - as well as a cluster of hotel, resort and restaurant businesses on Prince Edward Island that make the Murphy name the dominant factor in the island's hospitality industry.
It all spun out of the Tim Hortons phenomenon, where today owning one outlet provides a very good living, but four strong stores can net $1-million a year in profits for a hard-working owner, industry estimates suggest. In the Tim Hortons universe, it is common to own multiple outlets, although no one can touch Moncton's Gary O'Neill, Mr. Joyce's first franchisee in Atlantic Canada in 1974 and now the biggest Tims franchise operator with 34 restaurants.
Mr. Murphy is in that league, having gone from two smoky doughnut shops in Charlotteown to owning all 20 Tim Hortons restaurants in PEI, as well as 10 Wendy's stores in PEI and Montreal.
More than that, he has drawn his large, striving family into the Tim Hortons camp: Danny and three brothers (he has six brothers and one sister) own a total of 50 Tims outlets, from Charlottetown to Saint John to suburban Ottawa.
The Murphy tentacles even stretch west to Fort McMurray where Danny's wife Martie owns the two busiest Tim Hortons in the country.
In the fast-food industry, "Tims is Canada's great growth story," restaurant consultant Doug Fisher says. But the Murphys are distinctive in how they have leveraged that story into something much, much bigger. They played central roles in the astounding rise of Tim Hortons Inc. as a Canadian fast-food icon, helping to take it from 130 stores when Danny Murphy signed on to more than 4,000 today.
But Tim Hortons also played a crucial role in creating the legend of the Murphys. The outlets generated valuable early cash flow that sowed the seed of the Murphys' food and hospitality cluster, now the biggest collection of enterprises on the island, rivalled only by the New Brunswick Irvings who have potato processing and growing operations in PEI. The Murphys - all impossibly good looking with charm to burn - are the local power family, PEI's version of the Boston Kennedys, and are often referred to by first names alone: "Danny" or "Kevin" (a younger brother and a restaurant-hotel entrepreneur on his own) or "Shawn" (older brother, lawyer and former Liberal member of Parliament).
The Murphy story has outgrown its Tim Hortons roots to become a rare entrepreneurial saga in which everything the family touches seems to turn into a business venture, and everyone who joins the family circle seems to share an appetite for commerce.
Now the Murphys are poised to become more of a national story as Danny assembles a string of hotels throughout Atlantic Canada, while Kevin, the full-service restaurateur in the family, adds more pieces to his domination of the Charlottetown dining and drinking scene, which is a summer magnet for tourists and for travellers rolling off visiting cruise ships. And Kevin is hatching plans to take his microbrewery brand, Gahan Beer, across the country.
The Tim Hortons side of the story is not all roses - an Ontario franchise group sued the company over its conversion to more centralized baking, and U.S. expansion has failed to meet expectations.
Still, Douglas Hunter, author of the book Double Double: How Tim Hortons Became a Canadian Way of Life, One Cup at a Time , points out that head office maintains a database of 3,000 aspiring store owners. Running a Tim Hortons is a lot of work, he says, but it is regarded, along with McDonald's Restaurants, as "the elite of the franchise experience in Canada."
These franchisees are now facing more heated competition, particularly from McDonald's, and especially in the crucial coffee segment of the menu. "McDonald's has woken up to the coffee business," Mr. Murphy acknowledges.
More than ever, the company will need the grassroots energy that built this fast-food colossus in places like PEI.
Big things, small beginnings
Prince Edward Island is the smallest of small markets, with 140,000 people scattered across its red-dirt fields and windswept beaches - and for years it was an afterthought for any expanding retail or food chain.
That worked out well for Danny Murphy. Like most quick-service food concepts, Tim Hortons saw real estate as an intrinsic part of its business model, and insisted on choosing the sites and then owning them. But Mr. Murphy was the rare franchisee who got to pick and own the real estate. As Ron Joyce was preoccupied with opening franchises for the chain he had co-founded with the late hockey great Tim Horton, he gave Mr. Murphy a lot of freedom on the island. Mr. Murphy suspects PEI was not a big part of the Tim Hortons game plan, and the real estate became a useful asset in a business where store owners have limited opportunity to build equity.
Always a good operator, Mr. Murphy was given a lot of leeway in carving out his own territory and then expanding outside Tim Hortons. "When you have a Tim Hortons or McDonald's, you aren't really allowed to be running around in other businesses," he explains. "I was an exception, and they never came to me and said, 'You should be paying attention.' "
He gives Mr. Joyce huge credit for making him what he is today. At times, he accompanied the Tim Hortons co-founder as he flew around the country - on his plane, which was called Doughnut One - picking out locations. "He was something to watch," Mr. Murphy says. "He would fly in to Goose Bay or Moose Jaw, and he'd be looking at the streets [for new sites] and he was relentless."
In time, Mr. Joyce's obsession with growth and fresh coffee and doughnuts turned Tim Hortons into a cash machine, and Mr. Murphy rode the wave - convincing three other brothers, D'Arcy, Joey and Stephen, to get into the business in Saint John and the Ottawa area.
Danny does not underestimate the role of luck. He has seen pizza joints and burger bars come and go, but he had the good fortune to grab on to the one concept that was a winner. "Imagine if I had gone into friggin' anything else except Tim Hortons," he marvels.
But as the years passed, the relationship between Ron Joyce and Danny Murphy became strained, particularly in the period after Mr. Joyce sold his Tim Hortons control stake to Wendy's in 1995. One factor in the falling out was Danny's decision to go into Portland, Me., with two Tim Hortons outlets to take on the established Dunkin' Donuts. "I got my pants kicked" before pulling out after nine difficult months, Danny says.
Mr. Joyce, no longer the majority owner, opposed the move from the start, feeling it was doomed. And he was right. "The [U.S.] Northeast is Dunkin' Donuts territory," Mr. Joyce says. It was a microcosm of Tim Hortons' continuing challenges in cracking the U.S. market.
But Mr. Joyce speaks warmly of Mr. Murphy as a good store owner who was the front-runner in the chain's movement to non-smoking outlets (although he temporarily had to back-track because of strident customer resistance), and an early adopter of Tim Hortons-Wendy's combo stores. "He was always willing to step up to the plate," Mr. Joyce says.
All in the family
If Mr. Joyce was Danny's mentor, the Murphy family, with its PEI roots going back to the early 1800s, has been his rock. Kevin and Danny talk almost every day, even though they do not do any business with each other. And that may also be the formula for harmony - very early, the brothers went their own ways in business.
As Danny was making strides at Tim Hortons in the early 1980s, Kevin got out of university, and their lawyer brother Shawn suggested they get into hotels. The three brothers bought a couple of hostelries in Charlottetown. In the first hotel deal, Danny was able to delay some regular deposits to Tim Hortons, preserving that cash so that the brothers could make the hotel down payment.
By the late 1980s, Kevin wanted to run his own business, and Shawn had a growing law practice. In tiny PEI, his practice kept bumping into conflicts with his brothers' expanding operations. And so they amicably split. Danny devoted his energies to quick service, and Kevin focused on his great passion for full-service restaurants and fixing up heritage buildings. He invested with other family members in an old downtown hotel property that became the Great George Hotel, a boutique inn now consisting of 16 buildings on a city block.
Danny owns the biggest business in the family, with 1,400 employees and revenue of close to $80-million a year. But Kevin's growing enterprise grosses about $20-million. These are not big businesses by global standards, but huge in PEI. And they don't include all the other Murphy-related interests across Canada, because the family keeps drawing kindred spirits into its orbit.
One of those spirits emerged when Danny visited Toronto for a Wendy's advisory meeting in 1985, and he got to know another franchise owner, a divorced Alberta woman named Martie Tollestrup. The two courted by long distance and married - not just a wedding but a fast-food merger, for the now Martie Murphy owns the two Fort McMurray units of Tim Hortons, as well as a brace of Wendy's outlets in Alberta. The couple have built a stone mansion on a 50-acre estate called Gingerwood near the Atlantic Ocean where they raise horses and hold charity events - for the Murphys are also known for giving back.
Last fall was a rough time for Danny, who was laid low by a mysterious virus and grappled with an outbreak of the Norwalk virus at his Stanhope Beach Resort, which forced an early closing to the seasonal inn. But his health is back, Mr. Murphy insists, and the resort is ready for its regular opening next year.
And what about the next generation of Murphys? Danny's widowed mother Kathleen, now 85, has 28 grandchildren who are just starting to make a mark. Danny, who has six children but none yet in the business, recently took on an associate, Shawn's 31-year-old son Paul, a lawyer and accountant who is his chief financial officer. Having Paul as the "go-to guy" frees Danny for the deal making that he still loves. He hands a lapel pin to a visitor with the imprint of the numbers "20-30-40." It sums up his new dream, to own 40 hotels in the Atlantic region by 2030. He already has eight.
Hotels are a business like fast food - built on customer service, location and aligning with strong brands, with the added charm of a real estate play. And Danny knows the customer: These are the baby boomers who grew up with Tim Hortons, and they have made him rich. Now they are moving into retirement with money to spend and an appetite for travel. He is betting that some of them end up in his Atlantic hotels.
But Danny Murphy will never ignore the business that got him here. He despairs of franchise owners who just coast on the Tim Hortons brand name and don't keep their premises clean and their operations efficient. "We look after the golden goose and make sure it is profitable and shiny," he says.

Full text:   The big gains in Toronto house sales that occurred in the first half of 2012 were entirely wiped out during the latter half, with steep year-over-year declines from June right through to December.
The number of homes sold over the Multiple Listing Service in the Greater Toronto Area came in at 85,731 for 2012, down from 89,096 the prior year.
While the average selling price of $497,298 was up nearly 7 per cent from the 2011 figure, shrinking sales have begun putting pressure on prices.
The local real estate board, noting last year's showing is still strong by historical standards, pointed the finger at Ottawa's stricter mortgage guidelines and Toronto's land transfer tax.
The federal government implemented tighter mortgage insurance rules in July to cool the rise in consumer debt levels and house prices.
Sales of existing condos in the downtown 416 area code dropped 26.9 per cent in December compared with a year earlier, and prices fell 1.8 per cent.
Detached homes downtown saw a sales drop of 12.3 per cent, with prices rising 2.4 per cent. Meanwhile, fewer downtown dwellers are putting houses up for sale: there were 1,679 new listings during the month, down from 2,015 a year earlier.
Re/Max agent Brian Persaud said that with rents for condos remaining strong , some owners wanting to sell have decided to keep their units and rent them out rather than lower their prices.
"Inventory that came on in the summer carried over into the fall and is still there now. I had a listing that was priced lower than the exact same unit sold for last year and I had zero showings in December."
Steep sales declines were also recorded in the suburban 905 area code, where condo sales fell 26.3 per cent and detached home sales fell 13.6 per cent.
But prices fared better in that region, with condo prices rising 2.1 per cent and detached home prices rising 8.1 per cent. New listings came in at 2,616, down from 2,759 a year earlier.

New listings, sales down as Vancouver residential market cools

Author: Jang, Brent

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/new-listings-sales-down-as-vancouver-residential/docview/1266315292/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Mr. [Eugen Klein] noted that during the region's real estate slowdown, an measurement known as the sales-to-listings ratio has tumbled. To arrive at the ratio, take the number of homes sold in a month and divide it by the number of active listings for that month. December's ratio of sales-to-active listings works out to 8.2 per cent - indicating it is clearly a buyer's market in Greater Vancouver, Mr. Klein said.

Full text:   Potential home sellers are pulling back in the Vancouver region, reducing the supply of new listings as the real estate market cools and seeks to regain its balance.
There were 1,380 new listings in Greater Vancouver in December, down 50 per cent from November, and a drop of 15.3 per cent from December, 2011.
December marked the seventh consecutive month of year-over-year declines in the number of new listings.
"Demand got crimped last July when Ottawa introduced tighter mortgage insurance rules," said Bryan Yu, the Vancouver-based economist at Central 1 Credit Union.
"However, some sellers are pulling off supply, and that tends to firm up pricing. Interest rates are remaining low, so home sellers aren't in a position where they are forced to sell their properties. They have the option to stay on the sidelines for a while," he said.
The number of residential properties sold in Greater Vancouver fell 22.7 per cent in 2012, while house prices posted a relatively small drop.
The December home index price, which strips out the most expensive properties, was $590,800 for sales on the multiple listing service (MLS), a drop of 2.3 per cent from the same month in 2011.
A total of 25,032 single-family detached homes, condos and townhouses changed hands in 2012, down from 32,387 in 2011, the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said Thursday, adding that the slowdown in sales volume last year was off 25.7 per cent from the 10-year average.
Prices would have fallen further were it not for the reduction in new listings.
"Some prospective sellers don't have confidence that they will be able attain their price. Rather than reducing their price expectations, they aren't putting their homes on the market," said board president Eugen Klein.
The average number of days a home stayed on the market increased to 73 days for properties sold in December, compared with 64 days December, 2011.
Those averages do not factor in historical data for homes that languish on the market and start the clock ticking again by being relisted.
Index prices for single-family detached homes on Vancouver's closely watched west side in December came in at $2-million, down 9.1 per cent over the previous six months but a smaller loss of 5.5 per cent year-over-year.
December prices for single-family properties in Richmond slid 6.5 per cent year-over-year, but other local markets strengthened slightly, notably Coquitlam, Burnaby South, Maple Ridge, Port Coquitlam, Port Moody and Vancouver's east side.
Sales volume on the MLS reached 1,142 in December, a drop of 31.1 per cent from same month in 2011 and down 38.4 per cent from the 10-year average of 1,855 for December sales.
Mr. Klein noted that during the region's real estate slowdown, an measurement known as the sales-to-listings ratio has tumbled. To arrive at the ratio, take the number of homes sold in a month and divide it by the number of active listings for that month. December's ratio of sales-to-active listings works out to 8.2 per cent - indicating it is clearly a buyer's market in Greater Vancouver, Mr. Klein said.
In the Fraser Valley, which includes the sprawling and less-expensive Vancouver suburb of Surrey, there were 13,878 residential sales last year, or an 11-per-cent decline from 2011.
December benchmark prices rose 0.5 per cent year-over-year to $420,600 in the Fraser Valley.

Full text:   TRANSPORTATION REPORTER
Once a target of mockery by the car rental industry, Zipcar Inc. is now Avis Budget Group Inc.'s $500-million (U.S.) acquisition.
When car-rental giant Avis announced Monday its acquisition of car-sharing leader Zipcar, Avis chief executive officer Ron Nelson reminded analysts that he had once ridiculed the emergence of car-sharing companies such as Zipcar.
Not any more. Traditional car-rental companies and even auto makers are now quickly recognizing that car-sharing networks are catering to a new kind of automobile user, underscoring the fact that our relationship to the car is changing quickly.
Drivers increasingly want convenient access to cars without actually owning them. Many want to be able to hop into cars located in neighbourhood parking lots or in general areas of the city. Many use car-sharing services, but rarely if ever bother with traditional car rentals. It's akin to owning music in one format or another: MP3s or CDs.
Avis's Mr. Nelson acknowledged this fast-changing environment Monday.
"Some of you may recall that I've been somewhat dismissive of car sharing in the past. What I've come to realize is that car sharing, particularly on the scale that Zipcar has achieved and will achieve, is complementary to our traditional car-rental model."
Especially, "it enables us to serve new, younger, more wired consumers that our existing brands don't always connect with," he added. Avis's acquisition of Cambridge, Mass.-based Zipcar is expected to be completed this spring.
Unlike traditional car rentals, car sharing works on a membership basis.
Users pick up and return vehicles to designated parking spaces throughout a city. They then pay an hourly or daily rate. Payment, registration and car reservations are done online and through mobile apps, catering to customers with smartphones.
Kevin McLaughlin, president of AutoShare - Car Sharing Network Inc. in Toronto, a competitor of Zipcar, noted that car-sharing customers tend to reserve cars for three to four hours (such as a drive to see the in-laws or a trip to the local IKEA store).
Others, such as Daimler AG's Car2go, have different market niches. Car2go's service can be more expensive, although customers can simply park cars at their destinations, making it more suited to very short, one-way trips, like a self-driving taxi service.
In total, all car-sharing services in Canada surpassed 100,000 members.
One of the main draws of car-sharing services for traditional rental companies is their technology, in which customers hold their membership cards up to a card reader on the windshield to gain access to a vehicle.
This allows car-share cars to be rented at locations throughout the city, making for a very different experience than going to a staffed, centralized rental-car location.
"For rental companies, car-sharing is a natural extension to its current product offerings. Avis can also leverage the Zipcar's [information technology] mobility platform to enable rentals using smartphones and bring that technology to its traditional business of car rentals and, in turn, have more rental pick up and drops flexibility in big cities, as opposed to owning expensive real estate space," industry analysts Sarwant Singh and Mohamed Mubarak wrote in a report for research company Frost and Sullivan in Mountain View, Calif.
The report added that Avis has been struggling to get a foothold in this sector of the industry, while Hertz Global Holdings Ltd. has been building its Hertz on Demand car-sharing business since 2008 and Enterprise Rent-A-Car has been acquiring car-sharing companies.
The question is whether this is a growing industry.
Industry observers say that it is, while noting how much the rental trade is being fragmented. Users simply want access to cars in increasingly different ways.
"Is it going to grow at a rate to satisfy venture capital?" said AutoShare's Mr. McLaughlin. "That I can't answer."
*******
RENTING AND OWNING
$78
Cost per day, gas and insurance included, of sharing a Zipcar vehicle midweek in Toronto.
$58
Approximate cost a day, depending on gas and insurance options, of renting a car midweek with pickup and return in Toronto.
$807
Approximate cost a month of owning and operating a four-door coupe. That would pay for more than 10 days of Zipcar use, the company says.

B.C. housing pauses to 'catch its breath'

Author: Jang, Brent

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/b-c-housing-pauses-catch-breath/docview/1266141717/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The odds of deeply discounted Vancouver house prices in 2013 are slim, Mr. [Cameron Muir] said, adding that local real estate markets might even strengthen slightly over the next 12 months. "Some home buyers are sitting on the fence and I think many of them will come back into the market in 2013 when they realize they aren't going to buy a home in Vancouver for 50 cents on the dollar," he said.

Full text:   Assessed values have declined, particularly for high-end homes, but the overall market is strong, data show
Assessed values for high-end homes and recreational properties have declined in pockets of the Vancouver region, but new data shows that the B.C. housing market has avoided a widespread downturn.
Most B.C. homeowners, who have watched their property values steadily rise over the past dozen years, will see little change when they receive their assessment notices in the mail this month, according to BC Assessment. The provincial Crown corporation estimates values on behalf of B.C. municipalities, which in turn use the data to determine tax rolls.
On Bowen Island, however, a typical single-family detached home on the waterfront had an assessment of $1.3-million last July 1, down 23 per cent from the previous evaluation on July 1, 2011.
Grant McDonald, deputy assessor for the Vancouver Sea to Sky region at BC Assessment, said Wednesday that housing markets also softened in parts of the Sunshine Coast, Pemberton and Whistler, with certain assessed values slipping in the range of 2 per cent to 13 per cent.
On Vancouver's coveted west side, the year-over-year valuation fell 5.5 per cent on a representative single-family home on a 10-metre (33-foot) wide lot last July 1. Since then, the district's home prices have continued to slide, hurt by Ottawa's moves to tighten rules for mortgage borrowing, effective last July 9.
Some industry experts say the single-family detached index price in key neighbourhoods of Vancouver's west side will be down roughly 8 per cent to $2-million when new statistics for December are released Thursday.
Amid some pockets of decline, many B.C. markets experienced increases in assessed values in the range of 1.5 per cent to 5 per cent.
"When you crunch the numbers, the majority of homeowners will be within 5 per cent of the prior assessment roll. The market is catching its breath," Mr. McDonald said. "Sharp drops were perhaps reflective of overly exuberant and particularly aggressive listings. People are being more realistic about what the market actually will bear now."
Cameron Muir, chief economist at the B.C. Real Estate Association, said that as house prices eased in 2012, some prospective buyers opted to stay on the sidelines, especially in Greater Vancouver and the Fraser Valley.
"While we have seen prices come off in some neighbourhoods, we have also seen a pullback in the number of new listings being added. Many potential home sellers are not putting their homes on the market. That tends to have a balancing effect on the overall marketplace," Mr. Muir said.
Some Vancouver-area markets sagged, such as Richmond's Thompson district, where statistics show the trend down 2 per cent for a single-family home's assessment last July 1. But BC Assessment's values rose elsewhere, including in parts of Surrey, White Rock, Burnaby and New Westminster.
The odds of deeply discounted Vancouver house prices in 2013 are slim, Mr. Muir said, adding that local real estate markets might even strengthen slightly over the next 12 months. "Some home buyers are sitting on the fence and I think many of them will come back into the market in 2013 when they realize they aren't going to buy a home in Vancouver for 50 cents on the dollar," he said.
Mr. Muir said positives include forecasts for solid population growth and the continuation of interest rates near historic lows this year.
BC Assessment pointed out that the total assessment roll for City of Vancouver residential properties, including new construction, climbed 2 per cent last July 1, compared with the same date in 2011.

Beyond the cliff, watch for risks in Canadian, Chinese banks

Author: Barlow, Scott

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/beyond-cliff-watch-risks-canadian-chinese-banks/docview/1265999820/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Canadian banks are going to come under pressure, but China's banks face an even more treacherous outlook. Wealth management products (WMPs), a form of short-term savings vehicle, have come from nowhere five years ago to represent $2-trillion (U.S.) or 15 per cent of the country's bank deposits. Credit rating agency Fitch Ratings has warned of the possibility that interest payments on some WMPs are being funded by sales of new products rather than through returns they have generated on their own.

Full text:   Markets will be focused on the political circus around the U.S. "fiscal cliff" in early 2013, but Canadian investors should keep their eyes fixed on two lesser known stories that have the potential to dominate domestic headlines as the year progresses.
The first is a slowdown in the profitability of Canadian banks. This is, to some degree, a global phenomenon. Central banks around the world have engineered low interest rates to support economic growth but those low rates are severely limiting bank profits from the core business of lending.
Banks make money on the difference between what they pay on short-term deposits and what they charge borrowers for long-term loans. The broader this gap, the better for banks' profits. As recently as 2010, the difference between short-term and long-term rates was more than 3 per cent. Today, it's less than 1 per cent. Banks are paying almost as much in interest payments as they are receiving from lenders.
To compensate for lower profits on lending, Canadian banks have expanded their operations in more cyclical businesses such as capital markets trading and credit cards. Bank of Nova Scotia, for instance, has doubled credit card revenue since 2006. Year over year, Royal Bank has tripled its revenues from bond trading and investment banking.
All of this leaves the banks highly sensitive to any slowdown in market activity or consumer credit. The combination of outsized household debt and a slowing real estate market is likely to reduce profits from loans further in 2013, squeezing profit growth for all the major banks.
Canadian banks are going to come under pressure, but China's banks face an even more treacherous outlook. Wealth management products (WMPs), a form of short-term savings vehicle, have come from nowhere five years ago to represent $2-trillion (U.S.) or 15 per cent of the country's bank deposits. Credit rating agency Fitch Ratings has warned of the possibility that interest payments on some WMPs are being funded by sales of new products rather than through returns they have generated on their own.
According to Beijing-based Caixin Media, the recent default of a relatively small WMP caused a near riot in Shanghai. China's Ministry of Finance is attempting to limit the growth in WMPs, particularly those issued by arms of local governments, but this may expose the already treacherous financial health of governments in many regions. If so, expect the volatility in China's financial system to be reflected in commodity prices and the share prices of many Canadian miners.

The race to make a meal of India's fast-food market

Full text:   The subcontinent's appetite for pizza and fries is growing as fast as the majors can stoke it
When Domino's Pizza Inc. came to India in 1996 - in the first wave of international fast-food brands to enter the country - the company had to start with some basic education of its market.
"We had to do, 'This is a pizza and it's made from ingredients you are familiar with, but the shape is different,'" said Harneet Rajpal, vice-president for marketing of Domino's Pizza India.
Indians embraced it, enthusiastically enough that Domino's now has 513 outlets across 112 cities in India, with a restaurant and delivery business. But a couple years ago, Domino's concluded it needed to start a second round of vigorous education: Convincing a new group of Indians they belong in restaurants.
"People acknowledged the pizza was very good, the service was very good, but the biggest hindrance in our category was that people perceived that Domino's was a very expensive brand. We said we have to break the perception," Mr. Rajpal explained. Only a tiny tranche of Indian society, the top tier of the middle class, particularly those with experience living or travelling abroad, was in the habit of routinely eating out. For everyone else, restaurants - if they went there ever - were only for the most special of occasions.
That middle class is estimated at about 250 million people, no small market in itself, but far smaller than Domino's envisaged for a country of 1.2 billion. "We have to be a mass market brand to open stores at the rate we want to," Mr. Rajpal said.
Domino's, working through its master franchisee Jubilant FoodWorks Ltd., put its product developers to work designing a pizza they could sell for under a dollar. The big savings came in cheese, when the company replaced mozzarella with what it calls "liquid cheese sauce." In 2008, Domino's India launched its first Pizzamania, priced at 35 rupees (about 65 cents).
"It opened doors for a lot of Indians who had never tried Domino's or ordered us at home," Mr. Rajpal said. "We see a lot of new people who had never tried pizza coming to us - and over time graduating to other products. ... It's democratic consumption now."
This strategy is also being aggressively pursued by the other big players in the $12.5-billion Indian fast-food industry. While organized retail has only 5 per cent of the fast-food market (the rest is made up of stand-alone restaurants and road-side dhabas ), it is growing with explosive speed, about 36 per cent last year, dominated by a handful of international brands.
McDonald's Corp. is the clear leader, according to a market analysis by Euromonitor released in October, with 2 per cent of the quick-service market. Pizza Hut Inc. and KFC Corp. - which, like McDonald's and Domino's, entered India in 1996 - each have close to 250 outlets. Subway, which arrived in 2002, is playing a fast game of catch-up with 320 stores in 60 cities and plans to top 400 sites next year; Baskin-Robbins has locked up the dessert market, with 425 stores in 95 cities, including many far from the country's major urban hubs.
All of these firms have relied on the international cachet of their brands, said Piyush Sinha, who heads the Centre for Retail at the Indian Institute for Management in Ahmedabad, to get people in the store.
And all are now using a "sub-dollar pricing" strategy to try to convince a new segment of consumers that regular visits to a fast-food outlet are feasible for them.
KFC has been the market leader here, with a "Streetwise" range offering a hot chicken meal starting from 25 rupees. Domino's Pizzamania is now priced at 44 rupees. McDonald's offers a full hot lunch for under a dollar. Pizza Hut has 60-cent "iPan" pizzas for delivery.
Subway, which struggled initially because of the higher cost of its ingredients, this year experimented with a "toastie," a 60-cent open-face sandwich, that marketing manager Sanjiv Pandey said appeals both to Indians' love of hot food and the low-budget market. "It is a phenomenal entry level price point and it's worked fantastically well for us."
All of this ultralow pricing is paired with aggressive print and television marketing, showing people who clearly cover a wide socioeconomic range eating in the outlets. Prof. Sinha said there are signs it's working.
Jagan, 32, takes his wife and son on regular trips to a Domino's not far from their working-class neighbourhood in Delhi. Mr. Jagan, who uses only one name, runs a tiny shop selling paan (betel leaf for chewing) and earns about $200 a month. Their favourite order, he said, is the barbeque meat pizza - and, of late, garlic sticks, a new discovery for the family. Mr. Jagan said they also visit McDonald's on occasion, and although the family struggles financially, "we can afford this treat." Their usual bill for a twice-monthly visit is about $4.
A confluence of factors is driving the expansion of quick-service restaurants here: There is rapid urbanization, not just in the megalopolis cities such as New Delhi and Mumbai, but especially in small towns and mid-sized cities. India's urban population is expected to double in the next seven years, and two-thirds of it is under the age of 30.
"The rising number of nuclear families, exposure to global trends, the increasing number of employed women, an increase in the number of dual-income households, they have all had a significant impact on eating-out habits," said Amit Jatia, vice-chairman of Hardcastle Restaurants Pvt. Ltd., a franchisee that operates McDonald's restaurants in the west and south of India. That has made the fast-food segment the fastest growing part of the restaurant market, he noted.
Hardcastle plans to double its India stores (currently 153 of the 280 in India) over the next three years with an investment of $100-million. Yum Brands India , parent company for Pizza Hut and KFC (and which recently brought Taco Bell to India) says it will open 1,000 outlets - half of them KFC stores - and generate $1-billion (U.S.) in revenue from India by 2015.
Prof. Sinha noted that the standard ingredients for a fast-food restaurant - such as high hygiene standards, stylish presentation and refrigerated delivery chains - don't come cheaply in India, while real estate is prohibitively expensive in most urban areas. That means companies have to have high-frequency visits and large orders from their customers; only the big brands can afford to float an Indian venture. "India is a big market - but ask seriously how many of them are making money and when they will make money?"
Mr. Jatria said Hardcastle has been "break-even at the store level for a few years now" and "has witnessed strong double-digit growth in same-store sales continuously for the last six years."
Prof. Sinha said the ultralow-cost items are being used as bait but companies are gambling that the strategy will pay off. "For a large business like McDonald's or Pizza Hut, what you're losing in India is a small part of your overall picture - but it's clear you can't make money with that infrastructure on that price point."
Sandeep Kataria, chief marketing officer of Yum Restaurants India, said the company started to see the payoff in audience growth in 2010, and that wooing the consumers of small towns is the core of its plans. "We've seen great success in smaller towns," he said, listing fairly obscure centres such as Bairelly, Manipal and Vijayawada among those where KFC opened this year.
*****
DOING AS THE LOCALS DO
Every fast-food business has "Indianized" its menu.
McDonald's offers chicken tandoori and aloo (potato) patty sandwiches. Subway offers mint, chili and eggless mayonnaise (for strict vegetarians) as toppings. Chicken is the main meat offering; most restaurants do not serve beef or pork, in deference to Hindu and Muslim sentiments.
Domino's pioneered delivery, startling customers with its "30 minutes or it's free" promise (a massive logistics achievement in cities such as New Delhi and Mumbai that regularly experience total traffic gridlock). McDonald's has since taken the lead in delivery, with a 24-hour call centre and online ordering. It has also been the first to experiment with drive-throughs and gas-station outlets.

Full text:   Twenty-one years ago, Krishna Bansal made his way from a small town in Punjab to the throbbing streets of Mumbai. For the previous decade, he had been slogging in the local theatre scene, and he was convinced that he was ready for the big time. And indeed, it took him just three days to land his first role, a bit part in a soap opera. Bollywood glory, he was sure, was just around the corner.
Today, Bansal, 49, has appeared in 225 films and more than 300 "serials," as the tearjerker soaps are known. He has acted in scenes with Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan, some of the biggest names of Bollywood. But his longest stretch of dialogue was about five sentences; again and again he has been cast as a hapless police officer, a dopey clerk or an eccentric Hindu holy man. Twenty-one years in, he is still waiting for his big break.
"Too much talented, too much struggle," is how he summarizes his plight in his excitable English.
Nevertheless, Bansal wakes each morning and checks his cellphone for text messages from other actors reporting on auditions or shoots, then he heads into the streets of Lokhandwala. This neighbourhood in the north of Mumbai is the nerve centre of the film industry, home to studios, animators, costume shops and casting offices. And thousands of actors - not the big stars, who live in south Mumbai with a view of the sea. Lokhandwala is home to actors such as Bansal who play Angry Villager and Second Police Constable and Wedding Aunty in the countless movies and TV serials that are made in this city each year.
Bansal and his wife live in a windowless room five feet wide by 10 feet deep; a cement slab is the "kitchen," with a toilet and shower pipe at the back. There is barely room for the mattress that is their only piece of furniture. Their room lies in a stinking tunnel-like lane off an alley, and the sense of crowd, in the identical rooms stacked above and below and alongside, is crushing.
In every lane and every alley in this neighbourhood, there are actors such as Bansal, stepping into the street with hair slicked and carrying glossy postcards of their face and phone numbers, looking for the shoot where a director will finally realize their potential.
Ramesh Goyal, 57, came to Mumbai from Agra in the northern province of Uttar Pradesh in 1973, and got his first part as an extra five days later. He has had roles in 150 films, including at least one hit with Amir Khan ( Sarfarosh ) in which he played a police inspector. In fact, he plays a lot of police inspectors; they're the bane of his existence.
"I've been typecast - they only want to give me the inspector role, or servant, or gardener, or goonda [a hired thug]," he says. "I can't get a big role. I'm trying my level best. I'm seeking out producers and telling them I can do a better role, but they are not convinced. I have given it 39 years and I have failed to convince them. I want to be Male Villain - Full Villain, Major Villain - but I am not getting. I can do it! I am deserving."
Goyal has a regal bearing, a bristly salt-and-pepper mustache and a booming voice; he wears a rope of wooden beads over his tweedy Nehru vests, which gives him that artistic look. He offers his best villain face; it's not terribly persuasive. He does, however, make a very good police inspector. "I have given 39 valuable years," he says wistfully, before hastening to add, "But I am still very fresh!" He heads to auditions each day still convinced his big break awaits him.
"I know only acting, nothing else," he says. (This is not strictly true: Others in the community reveal that Goyal keeps himself in middle-class comfort in an airy flat on the edge of Lokhandwala by dealing in real estate, but he does not like to discuss such crass material pursuits.) "I want to be an actor, that's all. I want to die on the set."
Half a mile down the road from Goyal's flat is a huge gleaming box called the Infiniti Mall; its supermarket, shoe stores and cinemas target middle-class denizens of the neighbourhood. But the benches in its atrium and most of the seats in its food court are occupied all day long by Bollywood hopefuls who come and sit in the hope of getting discovered. Everyone in the neighbourhood knows someone, it seems, who was spotted by a casting agent buying groceries, or who got talking to a director in the coffee line and sold him a script.
Kareila Krishav, for example, comes to the mall each morning. He says he began in the business at 17 and over the past 40 years has had minor roles in about 2,000 films. Typically, he says, he plays Member of Public Passing; in his longest-ever onscreen appearance, seven years ago, he played Villager and was on screen in seven separate scenes. He says he earns $400 a month and rarely has to audition: "Directors know me, I'm the guy who fits in, so they call me directly."
In marked contrast to the would-be stars on the benches around him, Krishav insists he has deliberately eschewed the fame that might come with a bigger role. "I have a more free life being a small star - no big star could sit at this table and enjoy a chat, their lives are restricted. But I earn enough to support my family and I am not restricted."
These days when he goes to Infiniti he is accompanied by his neighbour Hafezullah Khan. He wears a white fur fez, a tunic studded with rhinestones and silver jewellery around his neck and wrists and fingers. His nose is so dramatically crooked it crosses his face at a 45-degree angle. Not long ago he took a break from his usual job - running a small fleet of auto-rickshaws - to accompany Krishav on a shoot, and he was instantly enamoured with the lights and cameras. Now he has decided, at 77, to break into showbiz, certain his unique personal style will catch the eye of a director at the mall.
"Why not? It's not a bad life," Krishav says. His bedizened friend nods silently.
Few struggling actors share the men's equanimity, however. Young women who come here to break into movies often find the lines between acting, modelling and the sex trade are fluid; female extras who don't get bigger roles usually leave the business in a year or two, and the roles for Angry Female Villagers are played by a handful of regulars.
Bansal's years at the margin of the industry have given him a theory about his lack of success. "The people who are big in the industry now are riding on their father's name, uncle's name. I am no-name," he says. "Established actors come from rich backgrounds. If a poor person who is a better actor comes along, they put pressure on the director to cut his role out - it's criminal."
He has kept himself alive washing dishes in hotels, vending biscuits in kiosks and working as a nail-clipper salesman. When things got really bad, he did a Charlie Chaplin-esque shtick on the sides of busy roads, living on the small rupee notes that motorists tossed him.
In his last acting gig, a one-day shoot a few weeks ago, he played a Hindu priest in a soap opera. He'll be paid about $70 for it, in three months' time.
"Everyone around me gave up and left, they thought it was enough," he says. "I'm still here, struggling for my acting career. Because I know, I believe, that I am extremely talented."

Abstract: "If someone says he's from Gangnam, you know he must be rich. And if they actually say, 'I'm from Gangnam,' you know they're proud of it," said Oh Han-jong, a 54-year-old who lived in Gangnam until his travel business went bust. He now works as a driver and lives in another part of town. Despite his poor turn of fortune, Mr. Oh remains "proud I was able to keep my kids in Gangnam schools."

Full text:   In South Korea's capital, Gangnam is an upscale neighbourhood, and Gangnam style describes one of its nouveau riche residents - not someone dancing as though riding a horse
If you want to fit in among the people who linger in the cafes and boutique shops of Seoul's Tehran Boulevard, do yourself a favour and don't dance like you're riding a horse.
Tehran Boulevard's eight lanes run through the heart of Gangnam, an upscale district of the South Korean capital that happens to have one of the most overused and poorly understood names on the planet.
To most of the world, "Gangnam" is just the word between "hey sexy lady" and "style" in the chorus of the Korean pop song that unexpectedly became the biggest hit of 2012. The video, in which rapper Psy gets bowlegged and crazy all over Seoul, has become the most watched YouTube clip of all time, surpassing one billion views on Dec. 21.
It's spawned countless tribute and parody videos, with everyone from NASA scientists to American troops in Afghanistan recording and uploading their own versions of the dance.
Psy has said that, for him, the song title means "dress classy, dance cheesy." But in South Korea, having Gangnam style means to be among, or at least to behave like, the city's privileged nouveau riche .
The Gangnam neighbourhood (the name means "south of the river" - and until recently south was the wrong side of the Han River to live on) has been transformed over the past three decades from an area where farmers grew cabbage and pears on the outskirts of Seoul proper into an affluent 40 square kilometres that is at once the Silicon Valley and the Beverly Hills of South Korea.
Here in Seoul, saying you've got Gangnam style means you can afford the $10,000-per-square-metre cost of real estate (only 1 per cent of South Koreans live in Gangnam). It also means you're willing to spend piles to put your kids in the local schools, considered the best in the country. It's where international companies like Google, Toyota and IBM have their South Korean head offices.
"If someone says he's from Gangnam, you know he must be rich. And if they actually say, 'I'm from Gangnam,' you know they're proud of it," said Oh Han-jong, a 54-year-old who lived in Gangnam until his travel business went bust. He now works as a driver and lives in another part of town. Despite his poor turn of fortune, Mr. Oh remains "proud I was able to keep my kids in Gangnam schools."
Most people come to Gangnam only to browse and ogle. "Gangnam is not quite Beverly Hills, but it's probably the closest that Korea has," said Hans Schattle, associate professor of political science at Seoul's Yonsei University. "It's a place for upscale women to shop and spend the money their husbands made, or maybe they themselves made."
Or as the 34-year-old Psy put it in the song's lyrics: "A classy lady who can afford a relaxing cup of coffee, but whose heart starts burning when night comes."
Psy (short for "psycho" - the singer's real name is Park Jae-sang) returns to the cup of coffee later, boasting playfully that he can down his own "boiling cup" in one shot. But he's ridiculing, rather than romanticizing, the Gangnam life. Many Koreans see Gangnam's numberless coffee shops - where a cup of java can cost several times as much as a full meal in other parts of Seoul - as a symbol of pointless, conspicuous consumption.
"People from Gangnam live the way they want," said Lee Tae-jin, a 39-year-old theatre actor who lives in the area. "Psy is a very good symbol for Gangnam. Even though he's not handsome, he's individualistic."
The video suggests Psy doesn't think Gangnam style is as wonderful as it seems. In the opening shot, he's reclining - in a white shirt and pink trousers - in what appears to be a beach chair on perfect white sand. Then the camera angle widens and you can see he's actually lying in a children's playground. Later, he appears to be luxuriating in a five-star swimming pool that turns out to be a public bath.
"Psy is making fun of people that are so vain and materialistic," Jea Kim, a Korean living in Minnesota, wrote on her blog. "Most Koreans are fed up with all those 'nouveaux riches' in Gangnam who became rich because their real-estate values skyrocketed overnight."
So are Koreans sick of the song yet? Not quite, it seems, although there are signs that moment is imminent. First of all, Park Geun-hye, the country's new president-elect, used it during her campaign, even attempting to do the horse dance - surrounded by back-up dancers dressed in red - at one election stop. A politician using a pop song, anywhere in the world, means the end of its coolness is certainly nigh.
Even Ms. Park seemed to sense this. In the last days before her narrow election win, she was no longer doing the horse dance on the campaign trail. The girls in red were still dancing as the candidate left the stage, but they were doing the Macarena.

SEASON- TICKET HOLDERS STAND BY THEIR TEAMS

Abstract: "It feels like we're being held hostage. I've had to pay our deposits, and the interest that's building up on that money isn't going into my pocket. But I'm not at the point where I'd give them up. I'd never be able to get tickets that good ever again ... although from a fan standpoint, it sure hasn't been fun."

Full text:   There are more than 100,000 Canadians who hold season tickets for their local NHL team, but fewer than 200 are believed to have cancelled during the lockout so far.
That means if there is going to be any resounding anger directed at the league over missing another huge chunk of games due to a work stoppage - the NHL's third in 18 years - it likely won't be evident among the hard-core members of the seven Canadian teams' fan bases.
Three of the teams contacted this week were willing to put an exact figure on the number of cancellations they have had over the past 31/2 months: The Winnipeg Jets reported no cancellations; the Toronto Maple Leafs indicated they had had just one; and the Montreal Canadiens noted only eight people had given up their tickets.
"We've got extremely passionate and loyal fans," Canadiens senior vice-president Donald Beauchamp said.
The Vancouver Canucks, meanwhile, said they have "averaged a couple of cancellations per week," while the Ottawa Senators have had less than 1 per cent of their 11,300 season-ticket base walk away.
The Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers declined to comment.
Beyond their love of hockey, Canadian season-ticket holders have been hanging on for two major reasons.
No. 1 is that if fans give up their seats, they know they may never get them back. There are thousands of people paying a $50 to $100 annual fee simply to sit on waiting lists until tickets become available.
In Vancouver, where the season-ticket base is capped at 17,000, there are nearly 7,000 more seats spoken for on their wait list. In Montreal and Winnipeg, where fans waited 16 years for the return of their franchise last season, the number is closer to 8,000.
The other way Canadian NHL teams have kept their fans in the fold is by giving them options for what to do with their money during the lockout. In most cities, fans have been able to either receive refunds as games have been cancelled or collect interest on their cash if they leave it with the team.
For most, that has been enough.
Door No. 3 - cancelling their tickets for good - has been far less common, despite all of the outrage and disappointment over the NHL's inability to get back on the ice.
With reports from David Ebner in Vancouver, Allan Maki in Calgary, David Shoalts in Toronto and Sean Gordon in Montreal
********
Vancouver
"I don't miss the NHL that much. I've compensated with watching more Premier League soccer, plus I finally got around to watching The Wire. Oh, and spending more time with my family. If there is a season this year, I don't plan on going to any regular-season games.
"I haven't decided what I'll do if there are playoffs. I'll probably cave and end up going. And as much as I'd like to send a message that I'm angry, I'm going to keep my season tickets. They're too valuable to give up."
Earl Gordon, a management consultant, has had Canucks tickets since 2003.
Calgary
"I told myself that if this season was a write-off, I would no longer be a season-ticket holder, and I'm staying firm to that word. I can't say that I won't be a fan any more or suddenly stop watching the Flames. But attending games, season-ticket holding and buying merchandise? The Flames and the NHL can kiss that goodbye.
"This whole lockout brings back bitter memories. The Flames went to the Stanley Cup finals in 2004 and then that lockout came and just crushed any momentum we had. I sided with the owners last time, and I remain with that stance this time. Although in this lockout, honestly, both sides are stubborn and idiotic if a full season is lost."
Jay Kent, a financial analyst in the oil industry, cancelled his Flames tickets after three seasons despite being a hard-core fan who lives near the Saddledome.
Edmonton
"I've moved back to the East Coast, and I can't sell the tickets because of the lockout. I've got a product to sell that nobody wants. I've had one person call me about the tickets: a guy from Red Deer. That was a couple of months back.
"I'm almost hoping they cancel the season so I can get a refund, but I feel guilty saying that. I'm surprised the NHL could lose two seasons in that short a period of time."
Marcus Peck, a government worker, had Oilers season tickets last year but is trying to sell this year's after returning to live in St. John's.
Winnipeg
"Even though I am very frustrated about this lockout, I never contemplated cancelling my season tickets. You must understand that we in Winnipeg waited 15 years to get our team back and whenever the NHL returns from the lockout, I will be there for the opening faceoff. Jet tickets are gold in Winnipeg!
"We are very fortunate to have the ownership group that we have here, and I am definitely on their side. If someone offered me a 50-50 partnership in revenues, and I didn't have to invest any money or take any risk, I am all in for that deal. I firmly believe the players want to play, but Donald Fehr is negotiating for his ego and not with a passion for the game."
Paul Kuzina, a sales associate in commercial real estate, was one of the Jets' 13,000 season-ticket holders for the franchise's first season back in the city.
Toronto
"At this point, I'm quite pleased there isn't any hockey because we've been receiving a substandard product for a premium price. Any other industry would not tolerate that, but people are trapped into the licences. They've got to keep paying, otherwise they lose the licences.
"The owners are greedy, the players are greedy, and ultimately the fans are the ones who pay the price when the league gets going, at least in Toronto. I'm not [angry] at the players. It's really the management providing a substandard product."
Romas Krilavicius, a long-time Leafs season-ticket holder through his company, Rutherford Global Logistics, said his seat licences for two platinum seats are now worth much more than the $20,000 he paid for each of them, and their value will rise whenever the NHL resumes playing. Getting rid of the licences now would not make business sense.
Ottawa
"Cancelling my package was not an easy decision. I really like what the club does here in Ottawa. I think the people are good, committed individuals who want a successful club with strong ties to the community. Collective-ly they do good deeds in the community. Ottawa is better for having them. And I really enjoyed the unexpected excitement of last year's team. I really want the club to be successful.
"But I am really pissed off at the NHL. My only leverage is my money. So I had to pull out to send my tiny message of protest. To its credit, the club did not put up a hard fight when I sent them the request. They are between a rock and a hard place. I suspect that the strategy is that if they are reasonable at the local level, they mitigate the overall alienation that the NHL is fostering. And they may be right.
"But I am definitely not going back if this season ever gets started, or next season either. There have to be consequences for the decisions to date. The NHL cannot count on me returning, but I will always keep an eye on the Sens even if they don't get any of my money."
Valerie Wutti, a public servant, cancelled her Senators season tickets after six years because of the lockout.
Montreal
"I've had the tickets since the last lockout, actually. The person who used to own them just got sick and tired of it all. It's the only way I could ever have got hold of them. I'm a die-hard Canadiens fan, but one of the reasons I wanted the tickets was because I figured the last contract would give us something solid for the long run. I guess I was wrong.
"It feels like we're being held hostage. I've had to pay our deposits, and the interest that's building up on that money isn't going into my pocket. But I'm not at the point where I'd give them up. I'd never be able to get tickets that good ever again ... although from a fan standpoint, it sure hasn't been fun."
Sylvain Archambault, who owns and runs a financial-management company, plans to hang on to his choice seats behind the Canadiens bench at the Bell Centre.

India opens the door to international retailers

Author: Nolen, Stephanie

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/india-opens-door-international-retailers/docview/1244705439/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The law can break the "hegemony" of traditionally influential traders who flourished at the expense of producers and consumers, according to Prof. [Ray Titus]. "This ... is very important if India wants to be open to global business," he said. "It's not just retail. It's everything - real estate, education, mining."

Full text:   New legislation signals reform effort to move away from 'nation of shopkeepers' toward more formal business structures
Picture this: you're a working mum in Hyderabad (or Delhi, or Mumbai). The kids leave on the school bus and you take stock. There's nothing in the fridge that could be assembled into dinner - no milk, and no rice flour for idli .
Your son has a cricket game tomorrow, but he's lost his jersey. Your mop-haired daughter needs hair barrettes, and exercise books for school. And on his way out the door, your husband hollers that there is no shampoo left.
Better hit Walmart on the way home from work, right?
Well, no. Today, you'll have to get vegetables from a man with a cart in the market a five-minute rickshaw ride from home; buy milk by lining up at the co-op booth at the end of your block; and hunt out barrettes in one tiny store near the market and notebooks in another. Then after work you'll need to take the metro across town to a sports store, which sells just one brand of everything, for the all-important jersey.
But that could soon change. After a bruising political fight that nearly brought down the government, the Indian parliament has passed legislation to permit foreign direct investment (FDI) in multibrand retail. In other words, it threw open the country's doors to Walmart and other giant international retail chains.
Passage of this law is being taken to mean that the India growth story is once again on track. "The steps that we have taken recently are only the beginning of a process to revive our economy and take it back to its trend growth rate of 8 to 9 per cent," Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told a conclave of major business leaders after the law made it through parliament.
Reforms passed earlier this year allowed FDI in single-brand retail, and many foreign firms are already here as minority owners with an Indian partner. Walmart, for instance, already has a cash-and-carry business dealing to traders, as a minority partner with the Indian conglomerate Bharti Enterprises.
But Walmart retail stores and big supermarkets such as the British chain Tesco or the French Carrefour - which have exploded into the rest of the Asian market - have until now been barred from direct access to India's 1.2 billion shoppers. The next question is, now that it's legal, will they come?
The multibrand retail law has taken on outsize importance. It cost the government a couple of key coalition partners, who said the onslaught of foreigners would crush local business. It came to symbolize the economic reform agenda on which the ruling Indian National Congress won a second term in 2009 and has since completely fumbled, sending growth numbers free-falling and creating a thick cloud of gloom that drove off investors, both foreign and domestic.
Ray Titus, who teaches marketing at Alliance University in Bangalore, described the reform as a clear signpost. He said: "This is India moving away from being that 'nation of shopkeepers' to becoming more formal in the way it runs its businesses [and] more structured, and lessening the power of that middle-man lobby" that has blocked progress in everything from grocery stores to giant infrastructure projects such as airports and highways.
The law can break the "hegemony" of traditionally influential traders who flourished at the expense of producers and consumers, according to Prof. Titus. "This ... is very important if India wants to be open to global business," he said. "It's not just retail. It's everything - real estate, education, mining."
The local business press has reported Walmart is looking at sites in Hyderabad or Mumbai for its first megastores, although Arti Singh, a spokeswoman for Walmart in India, said the company has made no decision if or where it would open here. The government of the national capital region, meanwhile, is pitching hard to have the first international retailers come to Delhi.
Those stores will not look like their counterparts in Canada, as Prof. Titus pointed out. Land acquisition is complex and difficult in India, although the government has a draft reform law in the works, and population density means international companies will have to tweak their business models to accommodate much smaller stores, possibly through franchising. Fewer than 10 per cent of the population owns a vehicle, so customers won't be coming to shop in cars. The complete lack of any kind of cold-chain and refrigerated transport industry will shape what the retailers can deliver. And houses here are small, refrigerators are tiny by Canadian standards and electricity supply is unreliable. All of that will also shape what people will buy.
Nevertheless, these stores will bring a much wider range of products - 50 or 60 brands in a given category, instead of the current nine or 10, Prof. Titus predicted. Walmart and the others will likely deal directly with farmers, cutting out the middlemen who currently skim off the lion's share of earnings, and whose inefficient market-gaming distribution systems cause huge amounts of what India grows to rot before it ever gets to the stores. Farmers today earn only an estimated 15 per cent of the sale price of their crops.
For Indian consumers, the entry of foreign retailers into the market will offer direct and indirect benefits. The big-box retailers may not be any cheaper than the neighbourhood shops, or kirana , as they are known, because the small shops tend to keep costs down by using unskilled labour and spending almost nothing on their operations. But the international chains will offer consumers a cleaner, brighter, more modern shopping experience, and Prof. Titus said that alone may lure them in.
India's middle class - future Walmart shoppers - consists of about 325 million people, just a quarter of the population at best. Even if the other three-quarters won't be shopping in the big foreign chain stories, though, the new retail landscape could benefit those people who are lower on the income scale. Most significant is the promise of higher earnings for the 52 per cent of Indians who are farmers. And other jobs would also be created. (Wal-Mart employs more than 100,000 people in China.)
Pulapre Balakrishnan, an economist who heads the Centre for Development Studies in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, argues that improved productivity will mean higher real incomes, and that in turn will drive new demand. "This is an important reform because it's about engaging with the global economy," he said.
*****
THE CHANGING FACE OF INDIA
The Indian government instituted a recent flurry of reforms in an effort to revive the economy.
What has changed A special cabinet committee has been created to streamline approval for major infrastructure projects (more than 100 of them are stalled in the approvals process); part of the subsidy on the price of diesel has been removed; a cap was placed on the number of subsidized cooking-gas cylinders each household can buy; the banking law was amended to hike voting rights of shareholders; foreign investors can now own up to 49 per cent of airlines.

Abstract: These days, when people talk about the "mayor" of the Junction, they likely aren't talking about Felice Scala or his son, [Ralph]. After Ralph pleaded guilty to 49 charges in 2009, including vandalism, threats and intimidation, and [Felice] was charged for failing to comply with his probation, neither are allowed near their Quebec Avenue home (Felice owns a condo in Etobicoke, and both have charges due in court in January).

Full text:   Emerging neighbourhood has come a long way since the rough-and-tumble turf wars of its recent past
Before he was arrested, Felice Scala liked to call himself the "mayor" of the Junction. As he watched the street from the front porch of the house he'd owned on Quebec Avenue for more than 30 years, and as he went for walks with his son, Ralph, down Dundas Street West, neighbours knew to stay out of their way.
But as the neighbourhood began to change in the early 2000s - his working-class immigrant neighbours began moving out, and younger couples and professionals moved in - the dynamic began to shift on his street. The "mayor" and his son felt threatened by the changes, neighbours said, and clashes ensued. For the next eight years, the father and son terrorized the neighbourhood, resulting in neighbours old and new having their windows smashed and car tires slashed over any perceived slight.
"It was a turf thing," said Karen Hoffman, a Quebec Avenue resident who saw 17 of her tires slashed over a three-month period. "Gentrification - perhaps they felt threatened by it."
The Junction, known for its rough-and-tumble past, has seen rapid changes in the past decade: Used appliance shops and empty stores with old tin cans in the window no longer represent the Junction so much as reclaimed furniture shops and brunch spots do. But for some residents of Quebec Avenue, the Scalas' arrest in the summer of July, 2008, was the real turning point - the moment that crystallized in their minds that the Junction had gone from rough around the edges to officially up and coming.
Anyone who doubts the Junction is changing need only look at the intersection where Felice and Ralph were arrested, Quebec Avenue and Dundas Street West, and the dramatic changes it has seen in the four years since the police takedown. Instead of empty storefronts and run-down buildings, the intersection today has all the obvious signifiers of gentrification: a Starbucks, two specialty coffee shops, and a doggy daycare. But with changes happening so quickly, residents are wondering whether their strip of Dundas Street West could some day go the way of Bloor West Village or Queen Street West.
When Felice Scala bought his Quebec Avenue house in 1975, homes in the Junction were cheap, due largely to pollution from the nearby railway tracks (hence the name "Junction"), and odours that would waft down from the abattoirs and meatpacking factories in the Ontario Stockyards up on St. Clair Avenue West, where many of his neighbours worked. But two key developments in the 1990s caused all of this to change: the Stockyards shutting down in 1993 (where the site has since been rebuilt into big-box shopping centres) and residents voting in 1997 to strike down an almost century-old law banning the sale of alcohol. On top of that, the city undertook a major revival of the area's streetscapes in 1999, burying unsightly wires and transformers and putting up new streetlights.
After these changes, restaurants and businesses, attracted by the area's cheap rents and proximity to High Park and downtown, began moving into the empty storefronts on Dundas Street West, and were soon followed by young families.
These days, it seems like there's a trendy new business on every block of the Junction - one of the newest being 3030 Dundas West, a 4,000-square-foot bar and restaurant that plays host to a range of events, including live concerts, movie screenings and trivia nights. Because of the neighbourhood's unique mix of residents - families, artists and long-time residents - businesses in the area need to be creative in catering to a range of demographics, said Nathan Hunter, 3030 Dundas West's programs manager.
"When we started doing this place, we were really geared towards people who graduated from the Ossington and Queen West scene," he said. "But a lot of nights, we put on a concert and I see people in their early 20s standing next to people in their 50s."
On a recent afternoon in the Junction, both old and new residents co-existed happily, with old bakeries selling their cakes and cookies next to shops offering vegan, gluten-free ones, and elderly customers at the trendy new coffee shops eyeing mason jars filled with artisanal pickles. Down the street at a local bar, a greying regular flirted with his 26-year-old bartender, joking that "she won't stop calling me - she has me under 'C' for cuddling."
But while most residents seem to agree that the changes to the neighbourhood have been generally positive, some worry about incoming development - such as a proposed seven-storey condo building on Dundas Street West, and a new 554,000-square-foot retail mall being built on St. Clair Avenue West named "the Stockyards" - and the potential impact these could have. Others worry about the area becoming too expensive for long-time residents.
"There used to be one of everything: banks, produce stores, hardware stores," said Ellen Dooley, who's lived in the Junction for 14 years and worries higher rent prices will squeeze out the smaller independent retailers. "A lot of them are gone now."
Sal D'Angelo, a real estate broker in the Junction, said average rental prices for commercial space have doubled in the past five years, from about $10 to $15 per square foot to $20 to $30. He said average home prices also doubled in the past five years, with the average entry-level home now selling for around $450,000. A Quebec Avenue house that Mr. D'Angelo helped sell in September last year for $638,000 was flipped and sold for $850,000 this year.
Despite this, long-time residents such as Shirley Carter, who is 69 and has lived in the Junction all her life, aren't too worried. She's seen the area go from boom in the 1950s, when streetcars would deliver cars full of shoppers, to bust in the latter half of the 20th century, and back up again now. Though she's not pleased with the idea of condos going up, she's been in the Junction long enough to know these things come and go. "When I was a kid growing up on Indian Grove, they tore down the rows of houses to build factories," she said. "And what happened after? They tore down the factories and built rows of houses back up again."
These days, when people talk about the "mayor" of the Junction, they likely aren't talking about Felice Scala or his son, Ralph. After Ralph pleaded guilty to 49 charges in 2009, including vandalism, threats and intimidation, and Felice was charged for failing to comply with his probation, neither are allowed near their Quebec Avenue home (Felice owns a condo in Etobicoke, and both have charges due in court in January). Instead, they're more likely referring to Dave McManus, 61, a local musician who helped build the Junction's now lively music and art scene. Initially, Mr. McManus said, his musician friends nicknamed him "King of the Junction" for corralling other artists to come to the area, but he didn't like the name. "How about something more democratic?" he suggested to them. "How about the mayor?"

WET VS. DRY
After leading a series of failed attempts to strike down the Junction's nearly century-old prohibition law, Vesuvio Pizzeria and Spaghetti House owner Ettore Pugliese said that by the mid-1990s, he was "probably an inch away from moving" out of the neighbourhood.
The Dundas Street West restaurant had been open in the Junction since 1957 and was a fixture among locals. Even after shutting down the dining room and becoming a take-out-only restaurant, business still wasn't as good as he knew it could be.
The original alcohol ban was prompted by drunken rowdiness of railway and stockyard workers, who frequented bars along Dundas Street West in the early 1900s.
In 1997, Mr. Pugliese and a number of other restaurant owners decided to try fight the ban once again. "There were 23 of us who first started," he said of the campaign to strike down the prohibition law. "But when it came down to the nitty-gritty, and having to put down a few bucks, there were only three of us left."
The referendum, which divided the neighbourhood between "wets" and "drys," was held later that year, and was decided in Mr. Pugliese's favour.
"Ever since those days, the Junction revolutionized," he said. "Thank God it's going so well."

Full text:   The former head of the McGill University Health Centre left behind a financial mess in Montreal
When Arthur T. Porter blew into Montreal to run the McGill University Health Centre in 2004, a well-spoken, deal-making whirlwind touched down on the city. The oncologist deftly worked the city's cocktail party circuit, forging close ties with some of Quebec's most influential people and securing several high-profile private- and public-sector positions: landing a spot on the board of Air Canada; forging relationships with a former premier as well as a Quebec Liberal health minister; and lastly - the appointment for which he is best known because it was handed to him by Prime Minister Stephen Harper - chairing the civilian committee that oversees Canada's spies and how they gather secrets.
With his colourful bowties, immense frame and the air of grandeur that peppers his speech ("It's not the sort of things one does, it's really what one has been able to accomplish"), he quickly charmed much of Montreal's anglophone establishment before he resigned his position this time last year and left the country.
But the problem with forces of nature that powerful is that they leave unseen cracks after they head out of town, and it wasn't until this week that Montrealers realized just how much of a mess Dr. Porter left behind.
On Tuesday, the Quebec government released the results of an audit that found the MUHC's planned deficit of $12-million has ballooned to $115-million - a financial state so precarious that the hospital network has been assigned a special overseer to monitor its spending. The Health Ministry called the move one step short of trusteeship.
But that's just the beginning of the MUHC's problems. Quebec's anti-corruption task force has also alleged that the hospital network was the victim of fraud in connection with its planned $1.3-billion superhospital, which is due to be unveiled in 2015. In November, police charged two former executives at SNC-Lavalin, the engineering firm that was awarded the contract during Dr. Porter's tenure, with multiple criminal charges, including fraud and using falsified documents.
As for Dr. Porter, his exact whereabouts are unknown. A few months ago, reporters with La Presse traced him to a gated community in the Bahamas, where he runs a private cancer clinic. When McGill University recently sued him for $317,000, most of which was provided as part of a low-interest loan, it filed e-mail exhibits in court where he claimed he had returned to his native country, Sierra Leone. He has not responded to numerous requests for interviews from The Globe and Mail, including phone calls, e-mails and one letter.
Meanwhile, the MUHC has said publicly that it is reconsidering its choice of name for the main street running into the new superhospital - Arthur Porter Way.
But what was Arthur Porter's way? Is he to blame for all of this?
The Globe interviewed numerous people from Montreal's medical community, including doctors, former executives and former directors at the MUHC, who had dealings with Dr. Porter. Most of them agreed to interviews on the condition that they would not be identified, explaining that they had not been given permission to speak publicly about closed-door meetings. What emerged is a portrait of a man obsessed with cultivating relationships, so much so that he created an environment at the MUHC that allowed him to exert control over the people, namely the board of directors, who were supposed to keep him in check.
That description comes as no surprise to the medical community in Detroit, where Dr. Porter first cut his teeth as a hospital administrator.
A cautionary message
It was in 2003 when John Crissman, the dean of the medical school at Michigan's Wayne State University, received a call from a headhunting team from Montreal.
Dr. Crissman's message about Dr. Porter was straightforward: Proceed with caution.
"Dr. Porter is a talented administrator but often dilutes his efforts," Dr. Crissman recalled saying, trying his best to diplomatically wave red flags about Dr. Porter's web of private business pursuits around the globe. "I told them to be very careful about their agreement and to include language to control Arthur's multiple outside interests."
Throughout Dr. Porter's tenure as the CEO of the Detroit Medical Center, where Dr. Crissman was a board member, the hospital was under constant financial strain. A Cambridge-educated oncologist, Dr. Porter had been vaulted into the role of CEO after a private consulting group recommended a massive overhaul of the hospital network, a non-profit corporation that struggled to bring in revenue while serving some of America's poorest neighbourhoods.
Dr. Porter acted decisively, and, by the time he was done trimming, he had reduced the size of the staff from 20,000 to 13,000. Those sorts of deep cuts usually bear a political price, but Dr. Porter had a unique talent for appeasing different sides. Born in the civil war-ravaged country of Sierra Leone, he connected well with the medical centre's most important demographic - Detroit's urban black community. Sources both in Montreal and Detroit said he was fond of describing his ability to bridge racial divides with an oft-repeated line: "I look black but I speak white."
But it wasn't his cost-cutting at the hospital, nor his remarkable rise from an impoverished African country, that pushed him onto the front pages of the local media. More often than not, he found himself in the news because of concerns about his ability to manage both the hospital and his many private investments.
By the end of his tenure, reporters with the Detroit Free Press, relying on public records, identified Dr. Porter and an associate as the principals behind a dozen private businesses, including a cancer clinic in the Bahamas, an auto-parts company, a medical real-estate company and several IT firms. How he was able to effectively juggle all of these duties seemed a legitimate concern, but it was not enough to deter a selection team from Montreal when they came calling.
Around that time, Dr. Porter had threatened to seek bankruptcy protection for the Detroit Medical Center if the state of Michigan didn't provide a funding infusion - which it promptly did, pledging $50-million. In some circles, this move was courageous, given that such a public threat would almost certainly cost him his job. The other interpretation, of course, was that Dr. Porter had failed to accomplish what he was hired to do and right the DMC's finances.
The Montreal recruiters - a selection committee of doctors and directors, plus professional headhunters - were more inclined to believe the former narrative over the latter. They were in a desperate hunt for a decisive leader with teeth - someone who could cut through the morass of the Quebec bureaucracy and finally build Montreal's new superhospital, which had been nothing more than a discussion for six years. And here was Dr. Porter, a man with a vocal distaste for red tape and the ideological bona fides to prove it; he was a self-identified Republican whose walls were adorned with photos of himself alongside George H.W. Bush and former vice-president Dick Cheney.
The headhunting firm, Egon Zehnder International, declined an interview request but issued a statement, through a public-relations company, that called its search "long and rigorous." It's not clear if that search included a review of publicly available court records, which turns up considerable litigation involving Dr. Porter.
A month before the search began, a medical-equipment financing company, DVI Financial Services, launched a $5-million lawsuit against Dr. Porter and two of his business partners in a California radiology clinic after they allegedly failed to pay back a loan. The suit would follow Dr. Porter all the way to Montreal, but not before lawyers unsuccessfully tried to seize Dr. Porter's property and garnish his wages. During the same period, a Nevada company, the Medical Construction Resource Group, had also sued him and his business partners after they allegedly failed to pay a $137,000 debt. (Court records show the two sides settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.)
But the alarm bells weren't confined to court records. During Dr. Porter's final months at the Detroit Medical Center, a number of board members resigned. Oscar Feldman, a prominent Detroit tax lawyer and a former owner of the NBA's Detroit Pistons, was blunt about his reason for leaving - Dr. Porter.
"My departure stemmed from the fact that too often his prognostications on DMC finances proved untrustworthy," he said in an e-mail to The Globe.
But none of this slowed down Dr. Porter. When he landed in Montreal in the spring of 2004, he sized up his surroundings and - if his subsequent actions are any indication - he came to a realization.
This was a city where he could do business.
Broad networking
In his new home, Dr. Porter didn't confine his networking to one political party.
He created an MUHC think tank on health policy, and named former New Brunswick premier Bernard Lord as its "scholar in residence." He identified a key ally in then Liberal health minister Philippe Couillard, hosting him at his many parties and dabbling in business with Mr. Couillard when he retired. (Mr. Couillard was a witness to Dr. Porter's unique ability to navigate different worlds, when the pair travelled to Baltimore in the summer of 2005 to the annual Shriners convention. The mission was to persuade the organization of fez-wearing philanthropists to keep their pediatric hospital in Montreal, which they did, thanks in part to Dr. Porter's decision to become a Shriner in a secret ceremony held in Montreal.)
Observers of Dr. Porter say another significant political associate was then-senator David Angus, who became chair of the MUHC's board in 2007. A Montreal lawyer and long-time Conservative fundraiser dating back to Brian Mulroney's reign, Mr. Angus became a vocal supporter of Dr. Porter, and the two were frequently together, including posing for photographs at events with Mr. Harper, both at the hospital and a 24 Sussex Dr. garden party.
In an e-mailed statement, Mr. Angus said that all of his interactions with Dr. Porter were entirely "business related" and that he never socialized with him outside of their official duties. "My relationship with Dr. Porter may be characterized as that which you would expect to exist between a diligent and engaged board chairman and a competent CEO. It was at all times professional and of the highest quality and standard," he said.
Mr. Angus declined to answer questions about what role he played, if any, in the appointments that soon flowed Dr. Porter's way - appointments that came from corporate and Conservative circles with which Mr. Angus has long had affiliations.
In 2006, Dr. Porter was named a director at Air Canada, which was where Mr. Angus served as a director for nearly two decades. One former director described Dr. Porter as keenly interested in forging relationships with other directors. "He was always talking about ... Harper and other Tories. He said they always took his calls," the source said.
Given Dr. Porter's penchant for self-promotion, it's not clear if that is true. What is true is that in 2008, Mr. Harper announced that he was appointing the doctor to the Security Intelligence Review Committee - the five-person body that is supposed to keep tabs on the operations of Canada's spy agency, CSIS. In order to legally serve in this position, Dr. Porter was sworn in as lifetime member of the Queen's Privy Council and, according to the committee's own literature, given clearance to examine "all information held by CSIS, no matter how highly classified that information may be."
It seemed that Dr. Porter hadn't learned anything about his experience in Detroit and the risks that come from spreading himself too thin. If anything, his appetite for ventures only became more voracious.
The most infamous of these was his commercial relationship with a former arms dealer, and a self-described former spy, Ari Ben-Menashe, which was first revealed in the National Post last year. In 2010, Dr. Porter signed a consultancy agreement with Mr. Ben-Menashe, a deal that would require Mr. Ben-Menashe to secure a $120-million grant from Russia for "infrastructure development" in Dr. Porter's native Sierra Leone. In return, a company controlled by Dr. Porter's family, the Africa Infrastructure Group, would manage whatever facilities or projects were constructed with the funds. The deal fell apart, neither party could agree why and Mr. Ben Menashe spoke openly about the failed plans with a reporter - which led to Dr. Porter's resignations from both the MUHC and the Security Intelligence Review Committee.
But that was hardly the only business that Dr. Porter launched while steering the MUHC and its 12,000 employees. He threw himself into multiple mining ventures in Quebec and Sierra Leone and sat on the boards of investment funds and a bio-tech start-up. He also leaped into another growth industry - the solar-power business. And this time, the chair of Canada's spy watchdog aligned himself with the former vice-president of a company controlled by the family of Vito Rizzuto, the Montreal mob boss.
In 2010, Dr. Porter became the principal investor in Liberation Energy Inc., a partnership between himself and Lou Gallucci. Mr. Gallucci had the unfortunate history of working as an executive vice-president for OMG, a small advertising company that gained notoriety in the early 2000s after it emerged that it was secretly owned by gangsters and their family members, including the Rizzutos, as well as Juan Ramon Fernandez, later convicted of drug trafficking and a murder conspiracy.
Mr. Gallucci declined to comment for publication, but has vehemently denied he was aware of any connection between his previous employer and the Mafia. He once said in an affidavit that he would never forget the day "my child asked me what the mob was and whether I was a member."
Liberation appears to have done very little business; one staff member was previously the manager of an establishment in Toronto's nightclub district. The company and Dr. Porter are being sued by an Ontario numbered company, registered to a Toronto accountant named David Foley, for failing to make good on a $250,000 promissory note.
Not surprisingly, given his myriad commitments, the staff at the MUHC's six hospitals noticed something about Dr. Porter: He was often absent.
"In one period from January to April, I'm told that he was here eight days," said one former MUHC executive. "So he'd come for a board meeting and leave again, and he was running the hospital on his BlackBerry."
The former directors and executives who spoke to The Globe said a number of them were openly frustrated by Dr. Porter's wandering attention, but efforts to rein him in fell under the purview of a committee within the larger board. Dr. Porter told CBC Radio in an interview that this committee, which was called the Nominating and Governance Committee and included Mr. Angus as well as the vice-chair, Montreal businessman Claudio Bussandri (who has since been named chairman), was given access to a dossier that listed all of Dr. Porter's outside business pursuits.
Since Tuesday, when the Quebec government released its scathing review of the MUHC's finances, several criticisms have been levelled at the board of directors for not properly overseeing Dr. Porter. The former directors who spoke to The Globe said it wasn't that Dr. Porter was never challenged - he was, after all, surrounded by some of Montreal's most accomplished citizens, including academics, lawyers, physicians and business executives. Rather, it appeared the board was structured so that his most outspoken critics had less power.
The former directors also said Dr. Porter excluded all staff and managers from board meetings, so that basic questions about waiting times and costs went unanswered.
"Arthur was so far away from the operations that he didn't know the answers," a former director said. "Or maybe he didn't choose to answer. Who knows? The consequence of it is that we were given a binder full of mundane reports prepared by junior people that didn't tell you anything."

I've been doing this since 2010 and rates today are pretty much as low as ever.

It didn't take me long to fall back into old habits in 2012.
You'd think I would have learned not to keep highlighting the challenges investors will face when interest rates start to rise. I've been doing this since 2010 and rates today are pretty much as low as ever. But they'll move higher some day, and that's why I'm not going to categorize my column on bonds from last January as a complete miss in this annual accountability of the Portfolio Strategy column.
It was on Jan. 28 that I did a Q & A with Hank Cunningham, fixed income strategist at Odlum Brown, in which we agreed it made no sense for investors to be making bond funds as popular as they were. The big risk at the time was rising interest rates, which had been long expected but not yet seen. Rates didn't rise, but bond funds had only a so-so year. The most popular mutual funds in the category were up 2 to 3 per cent for the year through Dec. 19, while the S & P/TSX total return index (includes dividends) was up 6.1 per cent.
Looking ahead to 2013, the headline on a recent TD Economics report sums things up nicely: "Rates lower for longer as Canada struggles to make progress." TD sees the Bank of Canada's overnight rate staying at 1.0 per cent until the fourth quarter of next year. That suggests short-term interest rates will stay low. Longer rates could edge higher - TD forecasts the yield on the five-year Government of Canada bond will rise from current levels around 1.3 per cent to 1.9 per cent in a year's time. I'm leery of bond funds in 2013, but you know my track record on this. Read the Jan. 28 column on bonds online at tgam.ca/DlCf.
On March 3, I reviewed an investing strategy called Dividend Deluxe that I developed back in 2007. The idea is to buy dividend growth stocks and hold them over the long term so that the yield on your initial investment keeps rising. It's a great concept because dividend growth over the years can help offset inflation by giving you more cash per quarter.
But as I found in updating the strategy, you have to be careful in monitoring your dividend growth stocks because they can run into problems. Take the big banks, for example. To varying degrees they had to curtail dividend increases as a result of the financial crisis, and they're just getting their momentum back. And then there's SNC-Lavalin , a dividend growth stalwart that fell about 20 per cent in a day in March after the firm announced an unexpected loss and an investigation into undocumented payments. One positive here is that dividend stocks of all types had a pretty good run in 2012. Don't expect this to be repeated every year. Read the Dividend Deluxe column at tgam.ca/DddF.
On April 28, I looked into those yield-oriented dividend and balanced exchange-traded funds that are so popular right now. Readers had been complaining about getting part of their payouts in the form of a return of capital rather than dividends or bond interest. It turns out that it's tough to find an income-focused ETF with level monthly distributions that doesn't have a return of capital component in its distributions. Read the column on income ETFs at tgam.ca/De2M.
On May 12 and 19, I urged investors to consider investing outside Canada. Part one of the argument was based on the constraints the Canadian stock market operates under as a result of its near 45-per-cent skew to resource stocks. With the global economy struggling for traction, investors haven't been as excited as they used to be about energy and mining stocks.
Part two looked at how the sectors powering the U.S. market, technology and health care, were inconsequentially small in Canada, particularly after the decline of Research In Motion stock. Late in the year, the Nasdaq, S & P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average had all at least doubled the return of the S & P/TSX composite index. Unless global economic growth revives in 2013, there's no reason to think Canada can regain its one-time supremacy versus the U.S. market. Market upsets caused by the "fiscal cliff" negotiations reflect political discord, not underlying financial or economic fundamentals. Read the column about buying into the U.S. market: tgam.ca/Dgez.
I surveyed a variety of money managers for my June 9 column to find out what their assumptions were for investment returns in the years ahead. The 10-year annualized return projections for a portfolio 60-40 weighted to stocks and bonds, respectively, were mainly in the 6-per-cent range, before fees. Looking ahead to 2013, keep your return projections reasonable and mind the impact fees are having on your results. Don't allow any double-digit return projections to creep into your analysis. Read the column about return assumptions at tgam.ca/DdtJ.
On Sept. 1, I wrote about a theme that continues to be relevant: The tendency of many investors to value safety above all. You can avoid stock market stress by investing safely, but can you reach your financial goals? Here's a guideline offered by Bill Horton, chief investment officer at MD Physician Services, about who should avoid stocks. "If our clients have less than a three-year time horizon, we say, don't invest in equities." Read the column on taking too little risk: tgam.ca/DiOS.
On Oct. 13, I anticipated the boom in real estate investment trusts by a month and a half in a column that concluded REITs still made sense for income-seeking investors, even after strong price increases in recent years. REITs suddenly shot to prominence in early December as a consortium led by a private equity firm made a bid for Primaris REIT , and Loblaw Cos. announced plans to create a REIT from its real estate holdings.
It's interesting to see a burst of activity in commercial real estate as the residential market cools. As noted in the Oct. 13 column, REITs today are arguably in a sweet spot of low rates and modest economic growth. Read the column on REITs: tgam.ca/DikX.
On Nov. 3, I returned to the theme of investors hoarding money in do-nothing cash. Moshe Milevsky, finance professor at York University's Schulich School of Business, offered this no-nonsense take on the subject: "Every dollar in cash is a waste." For those who aren't budging from cash, the column offered a few suggestions on ways to maximize returns. Among them were investment savings accounts that can be bought and sold like mutual funds and offer yields around 1.25 per cent. Read the column on cash at tgam.ca/Djb8.
Topics on my to-do list for 2013: The argument for not investing in dividend stocks, the dollars-and-cents cost of fee-only financial advice and best bond ETFs for a rising rate world. If there's anything you'd like to have me write about, drop me a note at rcarrick@globeandmail.com.

Abstract: The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said earlier this month that, while sales plunged almost 29 per cent in November, prices slipped just 1.7 per cent as "home sellers appear more inclined to remove their properties from the market today rather than lower prices to sell their properties."

Full text:   Calgary alone reports rise in house sales as sellers in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal pull out from market
House sales may be plunging in many Canadian cities, but prices are still holding up as sellers retreat rather than opt for less.
Observers expect to learn that national sales dropped by about 12 per cent in November from a year earlier, when the Canadian Real Estate Association releases its monthly report, expected Monday.
Certain local real estate boards, such as those in Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal and Calgary, have already reported, with all but the latter showing broad declines.
The early reports have led Douglas Porter of BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. to estimate the 12-per-cent drop on a national basis. He also expects the MLS home price index, released the same day, to show an increase of more than 3 per cent from a year earlier.
"After a deceptively mild result in October, the descent in Canadian home sales looks to have resumed in earnest in November," Mr. Porter said.
Among the major centres he monitors, Calgary alone registered a rise in sales, of almost 10 per cent.
"So far, the drop in sales has not translated in a broad slide in prices, as sellers are choosing to pull their house from the market," Mr. Porter said.
The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said earlier this month that, while sales plunged almost 29 per cent in November, prices slipped just 1.7 per cent as "home sellers appear more inclined to remove their properties from the market today rather than lower prices to sell their properties."
In Toronto, the other city that has troubled observers, particularly where the condo market is concerned, sales fell 16 per cent in November, and average prices rose 1.6 per cent.
At least some of the cooling has been attributed to new mortgage restrictions from Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, which came into effect in July.
He wanted to engineer a soft landing for Canada's housing market, and most observers believe that will be the outcome.
Canada's real estate market is cooling as the U.S. market picks up after its protracted slump.
"Real home prices are rising moderately on [a year-over-year] basis, though are still down roughly 30 per cent from their 2005-06 peak," said Adrienne Warren of Bank of Nova Scotia, referring to the United States.
"At the same time, Canadian housing activity has geared down, with average inflation-adjusted home prices moderately below year-ago levels for a third consecutive quarter in Q3."

CASINO FEVER

Author: Church, Elizabeth; Kiladze, Tim

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/casino-fever/docview/1238497047/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "People are going crazy," says Toronto city councillor Doug Ford, who once had his own flamboyant plans for the Port Lands that included a Ferris wheel and monorail. Mr. Ford says he's been taken aback by the number of land owners trying to work the casino angle. "Everyone with a postage stamp is looking to put a casino on it," he says, shaking his head.

Full text:   With talk of a Toronto casino (or two) comes a rush to profit from one of the country's most lucrative gaming licences. As developers eye prime waterfront and downtown locations, the city must decide how much it is willing to gamble. Elizabeth Church and Tim Kiladze report
Nowhere are the duelling visions for the city clearer than in two proposals for Toronto's Port Lands.
In one set of plans, the corner of Cherry and Commissioners streets is home to a riverside park, playgrounds and paths that hug the shores of a naturalized mouth for the Don River, part of a new community of homes and businesses.
In the other, 4,300 slots and 150 gaming tables fill four temporary buildings, ringed by rows of parking that stretch to the water's edge, an easy-to-assemble setup that could put gambling on downtown's doorstep within months of approval.
In the coming weeks Toronto residents will get a chance to weigh in on all the options as the city begins public consultations on the contentious topic of adding a casino to the downtown landscape.
Those on the side of casinos say the city can't turn its back on the millions gaming could bring - money that could be used for roads and transit and the kind of transformation represented by the redevelopment of the Port Lands.
"It's a very nice plan, but without money, nothing is going to happen," says real-estate developer Jerry Sprackman, owner of The Docks, who is shopping around his pop-up casino plans for the Port Lands, as well as drawings for a full resort on the site of his Polson Pier night club. He says his dream has attracted the interest of two unnamed casino companies.
Mr. Sprackman is wading into a crowded field.
Talk of a casino in downtown Toronto has created a frenzied competition, with developers and gaming operators manoeuvring for a shot at one of the country's most lucrative gaming licences. The city announced plans for public consultations Friday, including a new website dedicated to the casino debate, and the city manager is expected to make recommendations to the city's executive committee in March. City council will then decide in April if it backs the province's plans to expand gambling in Toronto. In the meantime, the prospect of a new casino worth as much as $3-billion is at the centre of a land rush across the GTA.
"People are going crazy," says Toronto city councillor Doug Ford, who once had his own flamboyant plans for the Port Lands that included a Ferris wheel and monorail. Mr. Ford says he's been taken aback by the number of land owners trying to work the casino angle. "Everyone with a postage stamp is looking to put a casino on it," he says, shaking his head.
The potential for partnerships is so high that Newton Glassman, the majority owner of Gateway Casinos & Entertainment Ltd., which operates gambling sites in British Columbia and Alberta, says he's been approached "numerous times" by developers, even though he hasn't thrown his hat in the ring.
The game
Toronto's take from a casino and entertainment complex - the kind of "golden mile" on the waterfront envisioned by Ontario Finance Minister Dwight Duncan - was pegged by a city report at as much as $195-million annually in hosting fees and taxes, although that number has been criticized as optimistic. The report focused on three downtown sites - Exhibition Place, the Metro Convention Centre on Front Street and the Port Lands.
Within real estate circles and at city hall, other locations also are being floated - along with the concept of a temporary facility that would start generating money for the city and the province within a matter of months while a complex is being constructed.
Rod Phillips, head of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp., said temporary casinos have operated in the past and that is an option for Toronto if the city supports it. A temporary gambling floor could be located near the permanent site or in another part of town, he said.
New sites being mentioned as possible locations for a temporary or permanent facility include the former Unilever property at the foot of the Don Valley Parkway and the LCBO headquarters on Lake Shore Boulevard.
But how realistic are all these plans, and how many more permutations will come? Everyone is jockeying for space - including mega U.S. casino operators - but the OLG still hasn't released terms of the cuts for these operators, or how long their operating contracts could last.
"It's difficult, if not impossible, for anybody to have a credible - credible being the critical word - business plan without knowing what the rules are," says Gateway's Mr. Glassman.
Operators are not the only ones wondering about the details of the provincial deal. The province began its reforms of the gaming system with an eye to its own bottom line. The OLG contributed $1.9-billion to provincial coffers in 2011 and the expansion comes as Ontario faces mounting pressure to find new sources of revenue and tackle its deficit. The province is staying mum on the slice of profits it would give to Toronto and to potential operators.
Mr. Phillips at OLG said some of those details are available in bid documents now available for other regions of the province. He said details of a Toronto agreement would be available by the time council makes its decision in April, but not for the January public meetings.
Toronto's decision is central, he said, to the provincial plan and to municipalities throughout southern Ontario who are considering a casino as well. "It's hard to overstate the importance of the decision in the GTA," he said.
City manager Joe Pennachetti says his focus remains on the three downtown sites as well as the Woodbine Racetrack. Public consultations will begin the second week of January, with five open houses. Online workbooks and feedback forms will be available in the new year. "We are going as fast as we can," he said.
Councillor Michael Thompson, chair of the city's economic development committee, expects even more options will surface if the city approves a casino plan. "We could be surprised with something else coming forward," he said. "I don't know what that something else is, but we know people are around trying to find other locations."
While the consultation process unfolds, city councillor Paula Fletcher says she is worried about the disruption the casino fever is having on existing land planning, especially when private individuals are promoting development on public lands. Ms. Fletcher, who represents the area that includes the Port Lands, points out the area was the subject of a year-long study by the city and Waterfront Toronto on ways to speed the transformation of the vast industrial precinct. Both agreed a casino was not in the cards.
"Did we waste our time for a whole year?" Ms. Fletcher asks. "We're back into one of these Port Lands fiascos starting up again."
Toronto Port Lands Corp., the city agency that holds the property, says it is aware of Mr. Sprackman's plans, but is taking no position on the casino question.
The players
Several U.S. operators - MGM Resorts International, Caesars World Inc., Las Vegas Sands Corp. and Wynn Resorts, Ltd. have come to town to scout sites. Closer to home, Onex Corp. head Gerry Schwartz , owner of the Tropicana, who also has four Alberta casinos, has indicated interest in the Toronto area, but not necessarily the downtown. Developer Larry Tanenbaum, chair of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd., also signalled his interest in partnering with a major casino operator in a Toronto bid.
Until now, the vocal casino operators have been the U.S. players. MGM Resorts is making no secret about its intention to build at Exhibition Place, and Caesars has released conceptual plans for a Convention Centre project proposed by Toronto developer Oxford Properties Group Inc.
If Toronto rejects the downtown option, MGM spokesman Alan Feldman says the company will look at Markham or Vaughan, not Woodbine. As for the spate of speculation, Mr. Feldman said it is standard when a casino comes to town. "The first level of activity is going to come from land owners, local developers. They hear about this and they think, wait a minute, rather than build personal storage units or whatever, we could build a casino and make a lot more money doing that," he said.
For his money, Doug Ford says he still favours the city-owned Port Lands property as the downtown option because of its location and the rental income it would generate for the cash-strapped municipality.
He figures the waterfront site, Exhibition Place and the Metro Convention Centre on Front Street are the only three that are really in the running. "Unless someone comes up with some wild idea," he adds.
********
IN THE ZONE
Everyone is talking about whether the city is ready for a casino, but is it ready for two?
The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation's plan to increase the number of casinos province-wide includes the creation of 29 "gaming zones" with one facility in each. Two of those zones include land within Toronto.
The first zone includes three areas: the downtown waterfront; a region to the west that extends from south Etobicoke into Mississauga; and another north of Steeles Avenue that includes Markham and Richmond Hill. The second zone is a strip that runs on either side of Highway 427 north into parts of Vaughan and Brampton and includes the Woodbine Racetrack, home to an existing OLG casino.
If Toronto rejects a casino downtown, it could still expand Woodbine or build a casino in the other zones.
Since the province has said it will not force a casino on an unwilling community, operators are considering multiple sites in case one is taken off the table. But the zone that includes downtown Toronto is the only one of the 29 that does not have an agreement with at least one municipality. In some, such as the Kingston region, local governments are competing for the right to host a facility, says Rod Phillips, head of the OLG.

LIFE AFTER HIGH RISE

Abstract: Attractive physical expansiveness is only part of the Lighthaus story. Tad Putyra, Great Gulf's president and CEO for low-rise development, explained to me that the project is being pitched to consumers who are more than usually attuned to environmental issues. "Many families don't want to have to choose between city and suburban amenities, or between luxurious living and being environmentally responsible," Mr.

Full text:   Where do Toronto's thousands of condo dwellers go when familes start to grow and the box in the sky gets too tight? Building on a European template, a Parkdale townhouse project may be the urban family-friendly answer. John Bentley Mays takes a peek below the surface
jmays@globeandmail.com
Though not quickly enough to keep inner-city Toronto from becoming a fiefdom of twenty-somethings and empty nesters, new low-rise housing with both credible architectural flair and ample space for raising families does occasionally rattle off the real-estate assembly line in the downtown core.
The 20-unit townhouse complex known as Lighthaus, an offering from Great Gulf Group, is an interesting example of what I'm talking about.
Designed by the local firm of STAMP Architects, it is shelter with an exterior that's too timidly modern, but that at least shuns the faux-historical cliches of much recent family-friendly residential construction in the central city is located in Parkdale, a short walk north of the Gladstone Hotel on Queen Street West.
It will provide opportunities for young veterans of the condo towers and aficionados of downtown living to get on with the business of starting families without having to move into an old house or out to suburbia to do so. Located in Parkdale a short walk north of the Gladstone Hotel on Queen Street West, it will provide opportunities for young veterans of the condo towers and aficionados of downtown living to get on with the business of starting families without having to move into an old house or out to suburbia to do so.
That said, Lighthaus is not for every couple who's done with the club scene and is now ready to settle down. The price of home ownership is steep: A typical unit is on the market for just over $1.4-million, with all the suites tagged only a little less or a little more than that.
So what does a million and a half get you in downtown Toronto these days?
If you buy into Lighthaus, it gets you a three-storey, three-bedroom home that, at more than 3,000 square feet in area, will give a family of four plenty of legroom, but that won't seem too vast after the children grow up and move away. It gets you a finished basement that could be turned into a storage locker, a lair for a teenager, or a home gym as the needs of the family change. It also buys you underground parking spaces for two compact cars.
And if there's little in the way of a garden or backyard - you still have to go to the suburbs or into an old dwelling to find room for the kids to run around outside - the urbane interiors by Anna Simone, founding partner in the Toronto-based international design firm Cecconi Simone Inc., are notably spacious and chic. Most of these townhomes are more than 17 feet wide and all are 40 feet deep. Ceiling heights vary from 10 feet on the main living level, to eight on the second, to nine feet on the third floor, which is wholly taken up by the master bedroom and bathroom and dressing room ensemble.
But attractive physical expansiveness is only part of the Lighthaus story. Tad Putyra, Great Gulf's president and CEO for low-rise development, explained to me that the project is being pitched to consumers who are more than usually attuned to environmental issues. "Many families don't want to have to choose between city and suburban amenities, or between luxurious living and being environmentally responsible," Mr. Putyra said in a statement. "With Lighthaus, they can have it all."
The standards that are guiding the design and outfitting of this complex have been inspired by those formulated by the Active House Alliance, a non-profit, industry-sponsored European organization similar to the Canada Green Building Council. As with the Council, the alliance has published an exacting schedule of criteria for evaluating the "greenness" of a given structure. The goal of the Active House Alliance, according to its website, is to promote "architectural quality [and] human health, comfort and well-being." Lighthaus is the first Canadian attempt to do architecture the Active House way.
Time will tell if the building envelope of Lighthaus is as extraordinarily tight and efficient as Great Gulf says it will be and the Active House people say it should be. But I have little doubt that, in certain key regards, this project will outperform many other condo developments I've had a chance to investigate.
Take, for example, the light. In traditional tower apartments and townhomes, the middle of the interior is typically dark. Not so here. A light well lets illumination spill from the roof into the heart of the house and down to the ground floor, where it brightens the kitchen area. Air quality is another department in which Lighthaus could excel. At the top of the light chute is a computer-operated, climate-controlling skylight engineered by high-tech wizards at the London office of Foster + Partners, in collaboration with the Danish manufacturer Velux - a bit of hardware that will act as the nose of the house, drawing in fresh air, and warming it before sending it into the middle of the building.
For the sake of Hogtown's aesthetically challenged public realm, I wish the exterior styling of Lighthaus were less plodding than it is. But the trimly modern interiors promise to be lovely - and a good thing, too, since inside is where we dwellers in these northern latitudes spend most of our time.

Abstract: Growing up, our best friend had a mechanic's shop. He knew everything about cars. If he needed to sell a house, I'd take care of it. If I needed to sell a car, he'd take care of it. When you put a lot of value into a home, you can make a really decent return. Unless you really know what you're doing with a vehicle, a vehicle is a depreciating asset. I don't have the expertise - for me, it wouldn't be a wise investment to dump a lot of money into a vehicle.

*****
He's a seasoned real estate expert who turned his passion for home investing into a hit TV reality show.
Drew Scott and his twin brother, Jonathan Scott, a licensed contractor, are better known as the Property Brothers. The two are breaking ground again, but this time with an all-new series called Buying and Selling , which debuts on W Network in January.
When he's on the set at the job site, Drew drives a 2013 BMW 328xi, which he just upgraded to from a 2009 BMW 328xi.
Why did you buy another BMW 3-Series?
I've driven BMW for a long time - I absolutely love it. It's my fourth BMW. When I came here to Toronto to film a few years ago, I was trying to find something with all-wheel-drive. I want something that's sporty, a little classy, and luxurious, but I didn't want to get away from an all-wheel drive car, especially if I'm in a Toronto climate.
I live in Vegas, but I didn't want to have that kind of car up here without all-wheel-drive. I ended up buying the exact same vehicle.
I'm picky. I've had a Ford Fusion in the past, which was great, too, but it wasn't a luxury or high-performance vehicle like this is.
Will you drive it home to Vegas when you're done shooting in Toronto?
I don't actually drive down. I ship the car wherever I film. We just finished filming eight months in Austin, Texas, so I shipped it down there. For a lease, they love me because my kilometres are always 30,000 under what the max is when they get it back.
The new one I'll ship back to Vegas after the holidays and then we'll see where we're filming after that.
What don't you like about your Bimmer?
The navigation system. A lot of times I have a street address that I know is in the city and it has been there for many years and it won't have it in the system. That's very frustrating.
There is a search option on the navigation as well for points of interest. But I've used other vehicles that have a Garmin system or something else installed that is much easier to find points of interest like a local restaurant. That's a little frustrating.
You know your way around home renovations. What about cars?
I'm not a big engine guy. All I need to know is that I have a car that looks good, a car that if I have to pass someone that is driving like an idiot on the road, I can pass them. I need to have a bit of muscle in my vehicle.
Growing up, our best friend had a mechanic's shop. He knew everything about cars. If he needed to sell a house, I'd take care of it. If I needed to sell a car, he'd take care of it. When you put a lot of value into a home, you can make a really decent return. Unless you really know what you're doing with a vehicle, a vehicle is a depreciating asset. I don't have the expertise - for me, it wouldn't be a wise investment to dump a lot of money into a vehicle.
What was your first car?
The very first vehicle we had was an Oldsmobile, a little four-door, back in 1993. We turned 16. At the time Jonathan was in Alberta and I was in B.C. and my parents were building a ranch in Alberta. Jonathan started working on that house - it was the first one he built as a teenager with my dad. We were going to share the vehicle when we eventually would be in the same city.
In the two weeks he had the vehicle, before I even had a chance to see my new car, he ran through a stop sign and crashed it. The first time I saw the car, it was crumpled into a tiny little thing.
Then we replaced that with the Chrysler E-Class - it was a talking car.
It had a voice system, which is not something you get in a lot of cars unless it's a high-end car. It would say, your door is ajar or your washer fluid is low. And my washer fluid was always low even though I topped it up.
We're a little tech savvy and we actually changed the voice at one point to one of our friend's voices, saying different things. That was us being nerds.
Any mishaps with any of your cars?
We had an '88 T-Bird, turbo coupe. We were driving along and I spun out and I bumped into the bumper of this van. It was nothing big - it was a parked vehicle and there was just a little ding in the bumper. I decided to be honest and tell the guy I hit his vehicle and I'm sorry. He's like, no worries.
I said, 'Can we keep this away from insurance?' The guy said, 'No problem.' And the guy sends me a quote for $3,000! He was trying to get me to replace the bumper and all the side panels where he had previous damage and paint the entire vehicle.
That was my first accident. I ended up going through insurance and they told the guy no way you're getting that.
This interview has been edited and condensed.

NOTABLE QUOTE
Any pet peeves in your car?
I'm a neat freak. ... I don't want scratches in my leather.
Jonathan cannot borrow my car to pick up anything from Home Depot. He borrowed my car the other day when we were on set. He went to Home Depot and got 2x4s and had them in my car.
When we were younger, he borrowed my car once and he cracked my back window with a 2x4 and never told me. I didn't notice until the next time I looked out my rear-view mirror: 'What happened to my window?'
My trunk is pristine, too. If you have anything dusty or dirty, they go in a bag. I have a couple of bags I keep on standby so everything is sealed.

Painting over an art gallery's plan

Abstract: VAG director [Kathleen Bartels] was not sent [Bob Rennie]'s proposal directly, and says she has not had a chance to review the document.

Full text:   With the deadline looming for the Vancouver Art Gallery to prove its case for a new home on city-owned land, local art collector/philanthropist Bob Rennie has presented a detailed proposal for his alternative vision.
The 22-page document was sent to some key players last week, including the VAG's chair, the B.C. premier and Vancouver's mayor. It calls for exhibition and storage space at seven newly created or reimagined distinct venues, including the VAG's current home downtown.
Rennie, who made his fortune marketing condominiums and owns a private gallery in Vancouver, co-wrote the proposal with consultant David Baxter. Rennie first floated the idea - in more general terms - at a panel last summer. When The Globe and Mail wrote about the proposal, it sparked a discussion - and some criticism of Rennie, who famously does not get along with VAG director Kathleen Bartels.
Their proposal outlines what they call "the $150-million solution" for a Vancouver Art Gallery System. The current VAG building would be renovated to house a gallery of historical Canadian art (works by Emily Carr, the Group of Seven) and a gallery of conceptual photography, built around local stars such as Jeff Wall and Stan Douglas.
A new gallery of contemporary art would be built downtown, and four smaller thematic exhibition spaces would be built around Vancouver over the next 15 years. Arguing there's no point in paying downtown rates for storage, the proposal also calls for an administration and storage facility in which the VAG would be the lead partner. The VAG's space at the Shangri-La Hotel would remain as is, for an eighth venue.
Exhibition space would increase more than fourfold to 180,000 square feet.
The schedule would see the contemporary gallery opening in 2018, at which point it would become the temporary home to the VAG, with renovation on the current building then beginning and ready to open in 2020.
The authors say their vision can be realized for $150-million ($125-million for construction plus $25-million for acquisitions), rather than the $300-million new building discussed by the VAG.
The document suggests the VAG scale back its ambitions - particularly in terms of fundraising.
"In this new economy, no one institution should seek a disproportionate share of ... resources, thereby attempting to cannibalize the funding from either public resources or private philanthropy for other institutions."
The VAG has said for years its facility is inadequate, and has been working on a plan for an iconic facility on city-owned land known as Larwill Park. In February, 2011, city council gave the VAG two years to prove its case for that land - including demonstrating public support and a solid business plan. The VAG now faces a Feb. 1, 2013, deadline.
VAG director Bartels was not sent Rennie's proposal directly, and says she has not had a chance to review the document. "This will be I'm sure one of many suggestions that come forward and it certainly is not the first, and we'll continue to be open and accessible to ideas because this is a community organization, and I feel that we have tremendous support for our vision to build a new purpose-built art gallery on the Larwill Park site," she said.
Bartels has said the multi-venue model would not be ideal for a number of reasons, including higher operating costs. When Rennie first proposed the idea of creating several smaller gallery venues, some dissenters argued that as a real-estate magnate, Rennie could benefit by the impact on property values.
When asked about this on Tuesday, Rennie was adamant. "The document has to do with community-building, arts and culture, and the public good," he said from Paris. "This has nothing to do with condominiums."

Gift-giving for that architect in your life

Author: Leblanc, Dave

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/gift-giving-that-architect-your-life/docview/1223427987/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Speaking of prints, Toronto painter Rob Croxford has a limited-edition series of retro-inspired ones available at his Etsy site (enter "robcroxford" in the Etsy.com search box). Based on his original paintings, there's the Gooderham "Flatiron" building, New City Hall, Ontario Place, the Scarborough Bluffs, and a TTC subway design.

Full text:   There are plenty of fun presents you can give lovers of buildings and streetscapes, and here's where to find them
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
For all the slot-car sets, Micronauts, Star Wars stuff and walkie-talkies I received throughout my childhood, the merriest Christmas gift I remember was Lego Police Headquarters (for purists, that's set #370, released in 1976). However, my fond memories take place after I put it together as instructed: that's when I took all the wall bricks, flat roof panels, windows and door frames, and built buildings of my own design. One day, I'd trace out an L-shaped foundation to make a ranch house, the next, a square to build a tiny tower. It never got old.
That's the beauty of Lego, even today. So when I brought home Mies van der Rohe's famous Farnsworth House (part of Lego's Architecture series), I wanted to get that first build over with so I could create my own design.
For the record, building Mies' masterpiece, as directed, took quite a while. At the 45-minute mark, all that was done was the home's deck, stairs and pilasters. "This is so precise," said Shauntelle, referring to the tiny pieces that make up floor tiles, interior cabinetry and tiny furniture. In fact, box opening to final product was two hours and 14 minutes. Well, it took Shauntelle that amount of time while I watched Will Ferrell's Elf on television and kept our cat, Isaac, at bay. I know what you're thinking, but my wife has the patience for this; I'm more of a free-form, no rules kinda guy ... when it comes to Lego. I was good, however, at shouting directions as I thumbed through the amazing instruction booklet, with its history section and archival photographs.
Once we had snapped a few photos, we took it apart and threw the pieces back in the box randomly, so when it comes out again closer to Christmas, I can create my Modernist opus. Anyhow, I'm confident architecture fans will love finding Lego-Mies (or Frank Lego Wright, for that matter) under the tree. At least until the company commits to the design and release of Montreal's own Habitat 67 by Moshe Safdie, which placed first in an online competition held earlier this year.
Architecshirts
Of course, since I'm a local booster, I'd be remiss if I didn't offer great Toronto-specific gift ideas for the Architourist in your life.
Type "architecshirts" in the Zazzle.ca search box. Up will pop seven shirt designs, all featuring Toronto buildings, with three of these showcasing the work of local legends Uno Prii, E.J. Lennox and Raymond Moriyama (if you count Frank Gehry as a local boy, make it four). With depictions of the space age apartments Mr. Prii designed at 44 and 35 Walmer, 20 Prince Arthur, and 666 Spadina, the "Prii-Fab" shirt is high on my wish list.
Fliess house in wooden blocks
Readers of this space know I'm a big fan of the original architecture of Don Mills, and Henry Fliess' house designs in particular. Jen Bulthuis of Fidoodle has designed sets of wonderful wooden blocks with "city," "country" and "suburbs" themes. As well as depicting street hockey and a sun-hatted mom driving a station wagon, the suburbs blocks have a very accurate representation of a ground-hugging Fliess house. Then again, Ms. Bulthuis is married to Heritage Toronto's chief cistorian, Gary Miedema, so this should come as no surprise (fidoodle.com for where to find them).
Celebrate the acorn
Lovers of Toronto's fast disappearing "acorn" street signs would be wise to visit Telegramme Prints (Queen East in Leslieville or on Ossington Avenue). There, ask for illustrator Dave Murray's Streetsign series of prints: Designed using hundreds of reference photos as guide, these celebrate not only the iconic acorn on top, but, says shop owner Ian Gillies, the "weathered, rusted and oft-repainted letters," that spell out Augusta, Roncesvalles or Ossington avenues (to name just a few). Also, check out Mr. Murray's already popular "Toronto Type Maps," which employ different word sizes spelling out things such as "coffee," "bar," "no parking," or "condos" to make up the familiar street-block shapes of Toronto neighbourhoods.
Toronto-inspired prints
Speaking of prints, Toronto painter Rob Croxford has a limited-edition series of retro-inspired ones available at his Etsy site (enter "robcroxford" in the Etsy.com search box). Based on his original paintings, there's the Gooderham "Flatiron" building, New City Hall, Ontario Place, the Scarborough Bluffs, and a TTC subway design. Also on Etsy, look up "thingstoronto" for fabulous jewellery made with beads, each with an "iconic image" of Toronto: Eaton's, Simpson's, Fran's, the Blue Jays, Mars Foods, Sam the Record Man and many others. If you surf Etsy long enough, you'll come across old TTC tokens re-purposed as cufflinks, countless Hogtown maps suitable for framing (BlogTO recommends the ones from jennasuemaps, and I agree), and the very cute "Toronto with timbits" print by Barry Gott.
Metro Magnets
Always on the vanguard, the folks at Spacing magazine have just released a collection of linkable magnets with subway route map symbols, "Metro Magnets," so the infrastructure aficionado in your life can create the perfect transit system on the fridge door (at spacingstore.ca).
The merriest news, however, is that each of these gifts cost less than $100.
My warmest wishes to all Globe Real Estate readers for a happy holiday season.

CRTC calls for input to fix telecom services in North

Full text:   TELECOM REPORTER
Canada's telecom regulator is launching a landmark consultation that promises to transform communications services in the Far North.
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission said on Thursday it wants citizens to participate in a public process that will scrutinize how NorthwesTel Inc. offers telecom services to northern Canadians.
NorthwesTel, which is a subsidiary of Montreal-based BCE Inc., is often the only choice for residential and business customers in Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. NorthwesTel also serves northern areas of British Columbia and Alberta.
The CRTC's goal is to provide northern Canadians with communications services that are on par with those in the rest of the country. About 107,200 people live across the three territories. A persistent lack of affordable telecom choices and modern networks are barriers to providing basic services such as banking, health care, education and policing.
A robust communications infrastructure is seen as crucial to ensuring Canada's Arctic sovereignty and spurring economic development - both priorities for the federal government. In spite of a burst of investment from mining and exploration companies, the dearth of communications infrastructure remains a stumbling block for northern businesses.
"Canadians expect to have a choice of high-quality telecommunications services, regardless of where they live," CRTC chairman Jean-Pierre Blais said. "Last year, we expressed concern about the services available to northern Canadians and required NorthwesTel to develop a plan to modernize its aging network. The consultation launched today will allow us to conduct a comprehensive review of NorthwesTel's services and its planned improvements."
The CRTC has grown increasingly impatient with NorthwesTel in recent years, noting it "failed to make the necessary investments in its network" despite receiving about $20-million a year in contribution subsidies to improve local telephone services.
That frustration culminated in a December, 2011, decision by the CRTC that opened up the North to local telephone competition, prompting companies such as Iristel Inc. and SSI Micro to announce plans to offer competitive services.
"Northwestel is proud of its long history of providing state-of-the-art communications services to Northerners across some of the most challenging terrain in the world, and we encourage Northerners to participate in the CRTC consultations," spokeswoman Emily Younker said in an e-mail.
Rich Thompson, chief executive officer of Northern Vision Development LP, a real-estate development, property management and hotel company based in Whitehorse, said a shortage of competitive options and spotty service are key challenges.
"NorthwesTel has worked hard over the years to make sure that services are updated, but there's no question that we struggle in the North," Mr. Thompson said.
"It is speed of Internet access and the cost of having quality Internet access for our guests. So, we struggle to get the right packages for our hotel from the telephone company that will allow our guests to experience the Internet the way they would expect to in any other hotel when they are travelling across Canada."
This year, NorthwesTel proposed a five-year, $273-million modernization plan to provide all 96 northern communities it serves with wire-line and wireless services comparable to those in the rest of Canada. The CRTC is asking Canadians to share their opinions on the company's modernization plan and other issues including regulations, subsidies and competition in northern markets. The CRTC also plans to hold public hearings on June 17, 2013, in Inuvik, and June 19, 2013, in Whitehorse.
Dean Proctor, chief development officer of the SSI Group of Companies, applauded the CRTC for calling hearings in those northern communities.
"They are treating communications in the North in a very fundamental manner," Mr. Proctor said. "With respect to Canadian sovereignty ... how do you ensure that the people who live in the North are actually part of Canada and living the life that Canadians deserve to have?"

Full text:   A move to make urban centres more pedestrian friendly leads to economic benefits
In Canada and around the world, urban planners are finding out that if you want your city to run, first you have to walk.
Walkability, often a neglected afterthought in planning, is back, and in cities around the world making life easier for pedestrians is becoming a priority.
Or a necessity. The walkable city is where ergonomics meets economics. Cities are building or adding pedestrian malls, wider sidewalks, underground passageways, overpasses and scramble intersections (where the pedestrians cross in all directions while the cars have to wait).
The benefits include higher real estate values, fewer health care costs, less smog and even a more robust local economy. Glenn Miller, vice-president of education and research for the Canadian Urban Institute, cites a study where a street in Brighton, England, was made more pedestrian friendly. "They looked at retail performance and the street showed huge improvements in revenue."
Some cities look to augment their pedestrian-friendly planning with technology - for example, Hong Kong with its 1.4-kilometre Peak Tram funicular, or a proposed (though now stalled) plan for a gondola at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C., that people could walk to and reduce commuting time to six minutes from 17 minutes.
But the most cost-effective ways to keep cities moving are the simplest, says Brent Toderian, former chief planner for Vancouver and now head of Toderian Urban Works.
"The strongest arguments for making a city more walkable are financial. On a dollars and cents basis it's the cheapest way to move people around. Even transit trips start and end with your feet," he says.
Planning neighbourhoods and business districts to be more pedestrian-friendly might be the only way for cities to escape financial ruin.
Traffic congestion cost the Greater Toronto Area an astounding $3.3-billion in lost productivity in 2009, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development; in the Chicago area, the tab is $8.2-billion annually.
People, particularly youth, are actually giving up their cars and losing interest in driving. In Japan it's called "demotorization" - the status of having a car is being replaced with cachet from having the latest smartphone or computer, which you can carry as you walk.
In the United States, a study by the University of Michigan found that the percentage of 19-year-olds with drivers' licences dropped by 17 per cent from 1983 to 2010, and keeps going down. Similar downward trends are showing up in Europe and Australia.
The property market is responding. Witness the condo boom in Toronto and Vancouver and the corresponding move of major companies such as Telus and Google from suburban spaces to downtown sites.
It's also leading to design changes that reverse planning assumptions dating to the 1960s.
"We're seeing something interesting - a huge shift in the real estate market both in commercial and residential building, toward a major reorientation to more walkable spaces," says architect and planner Ken Greenberg, head of Toronto-based Greenberg Consultants.
"We're seeing it in commercial development, by people in the business of building office buildings, or science buildings, labs or anything involved in the new economy," Mr. Greenberg says.
"We had several decades where people were going out to cheap spaces by the highway. Now they look to build where there is a mix of things that people can do when they walk out of their office space."
It's not just happening in downtown cores, Mr. Greenberg says. He was part of a group of experts hired to help Mississauga make its recently built and still growing city centre more pedestrian friendly.
"We're seeing this trend happening in suburban locations. At sites on the highway, people building suburban sectors are trying to replicate downtown walking spaces," he says.
Shifting our cities from car culture to foot traffic requires thinking differently, Mr. Toderian says. "The key to walkability is getting the right density, design and mix."
The density consideration is the opposite of how you plan for cars, where the object is to separate the vehicles and leave as much room as possible. "Cars don't like other cars, but walkers like more walkers," Mr. Toderian says.
This means that it's okay, sometimes even desirable, to plan a city-walking route that will be crowded.
People will gravitate toward the same routes time and again, Mr. Miller of the Canadian Urban Institute says.
"The more a route gets used, the more it becomes a pedestrian pathway. You see it all the time, places where people wear away the grass."
In captive routes such as those at airports, there's a limit to how far people are willing to walk, which is why moving pathways are installed. But contrary to what many people think, distance is not the strongest factor for city pedestrians.
"The truth is that it has to do with the quality of the design," Mr. Toderian says. "People will walk longer if it's a pleasant environment and they won't walk at all if it's harsh or unsafe."
Good designs give walkers interesting things to see - store windows, ads, street vendors, flowers and trees. Bad designs are blank walls or repetitive architecture, Mr. Miller says. "People don't want to walk where there's nothing to look at."
Mix, the third consideration, has to do with the variety of buildings and their purposes, Mr. Toderian says. Put peoples' homes near work, shopping and schools, and you'll find they walk more. It's the power of nearness."

Full text:   Public Works quietly cancels its 'leniency exemption' to crack down on companies that have engaged in practices such as bid-rigging
Ottawa has changed its contracting rules to block firms that engage in bid-rigging from simply paying a fine and then getting back in line for more federal work.
Under the old system, firms that were suspected of cheating by the Competition Bureau could enter into the agency's "leniency program." After collaborating with the bureau's investigation, pleading guilty and paying a fine, the firms were eligible to bid on additional federal government contracts.
However, Public Works quietly cancelled its "leniency exemption" in November, retroactively blacklisting firms that were recently involved in the program. The move is seen as a clear signal in Ottawa that the federal government is cracking down on suppliers that engage in unethical business practices.
Federal and industry sources added that the rule change is linked to a recent bid-rigging case involving the Corporate Research Group (CRG), a company that has received more than $30-million in federal contracts over the past decade.
The Competition Bureau announced last July that the firm had pleaded guilty to a charge of bid-rigging in relation to one of its contract proposals. In addition to having paid a $125,000 fine to settle the case, CRG has now lost the federal government as a potential client because of its involvement in the Competition Bureau's leniency program.
The move puts an end to the long-standing - and at times rocky - relationship between CRG and the real-estate division of Public Works and Government Services Canada. According to internal documents and a number of sources, the department has conducted an extensive investigation into an alleged conflict of interest between CRG president Brian Card and Tim McGrath, the assistant deputy minister in charge of real estate at Public Works from 2005 to 2009.
The investigation was launched in late 2008, when a whistleblower filed a formal complaint under the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act. The matter was handled by the Special Investigations Directorate at Public Works, which looked through Mr. McGrath's cellphone records, e-mails and expense statements.
Records show that investigators found thousands of phone calls over a two-year period between Mr. McGrath and Mr. Card, usually early in the morning and sometimes on weekends. In addition, investigators found that Mr. McGrath had received hockey tickets from Mr. Card (Mr. McGrath said he paid for them in cash). It was also determined that Mr. McGrath attended a birthday party for Mr. Card's wife at the Château Laurier with one of his employees.
Mr. McGrath said his relationship with Mr. Card was "strictly business," but investigators said it crossed the line into the realm of friendship and concluded that the allegations of a conflict were "founded."
In addition, records show that investigators looked into Mr. McGrath's use of his government-issued AMEX credit card, including purchases at hotels in the Ottawa-Gatineau area. According to the records, Mr. McGrath told officials at Public Works that he used the card "from time to time to rent local hotel rooms in order to be in the city for early morning" committee hearings on Parliament Hill.
The investigation's findings went up to the then-deputy minister, François Guimont, who threatened to impose "disciplinary measures" against Mr. McGrath. In late 2009, Mr. McGrath quietly retired from the department.
Federal investigators continued to look into Public Works' dealings with CRG. Under a contract obtained in 2004, CRG received nearly 100 per cent of all real-estate consultancy deals with Public Works between 2004 and 2007.
When the contract expired and went back to tenders, Public Works decided the winner of the competition would get 50 per cent of the work and the second-place company 30 per cent, with the remaining 20 per cent for the third-place bidder.
Investigators at Public Works looked back at the various bids that were submitted, including the winning bid from CRG and the one from second-place finisher First Porter Consultancy. The investigators determined that the two bids were "almost identical" and transferred the file to the Competition Bureau.
The agency found that CRG and First Porter Consultancy concluded a secret agreement before submitting their bids in 2007 in an attempt to share 80 per cent of the contract, which led to the charge of bid-rigging against CRG.
In a statement, the Competition Bureau praised its leniency program for offering "incentives for parties to address their criminal liability by cooperating with the Bureau in its ongoing investigation and prosecution of other alleged cartel participants."
In a recent newsletter, however, CRG's lawyers at McMillan LLP decried the fact that the new contracting policy at Public Works "applies retroactively to companies that are already participating in or have exited from the leniency program.
"At the time of entry into the leniency program and negotiation of their guilty plea, such companies expected to be able to continue to do business with the federal government," the lawyers said.
Mr. McGrath and Mr. Card did not respond to requests for comment.

Full text:   Work starts on the key residential elements in an ambitious project to redefine the city
On a clear day from the site of Surrey's new civic-centre-in-progress, you can see all the way to downtown Vancouver.
One of the highest points in the Lower Mainland, the site of the new Bing Thom-designed library and the city hall designed jointly by Kasian and Moriyama & Teshima is part of a brave new experiment in city-building.
Today, it's a construction zone bordered by the SkyTrain and built on the bones of the kind of suburban retail and commercial real estate that still surrounds it. But in a few short years, developer Sean Hodgins of Century Group hopes it will become a new urban village.
In fact, his 3 Civic Plaza - the biggest mixed-use project south of the Fraser and flanked by the library and city hall - is the first substantial residential response to Surrey's new urbanization plan spearheaded by Mayor Dianne Watts: two towers on a podium that will contain a hotel, office space and a residential building, and complement the city's plans to densify, increase walkability and improve public transit access. A partner in the project is the SCDC (Surrey City Development Corporation) and the city is one of a handful in Canada that has created its own civic entity to encourage growth in such a hands-on manner.
Almost halfway through the six-year, $400-million-plus Build Surrey plan that also includes new recreational centres, firehalls, parks and arts space, Mr. Hodgins says the new urban experiment is all about "the public leading the private", and that the key is context.
"You can't create residential projects in a vacuum," he explains over coffee at the new library - already a community focal point some 14 months after its opening. Looking through the criss-crossed window frames into the giant construction pit bordered by the SkyTrain, he points to spots where he hopes new amenities will help complete the development. The city-backed plan - part of which has entailed its purchase of more traditional suburban retail to free up land for public projects - also encourages the opening of cafes, restaurants and bars to augment the social aspect of the new real-estate reality. The aim is to help mitigate the dreaded post-5-p.m. "dead zone" that is the scourge of so many high-density urbanist interventions (and not just in suburban Surrey, but even in parts of Vancouver's highly residential downtown). Animation of the plaza is a key component of the new project.
It's certainly an improvement on many nearby towers, designed as inward-looking, suburban-style developments, divorced from their surroundings and devoid of interaction with the streetscape.
In fact, the new 3 Civic Plaza, as designed by architect Patrick Cotter, is all about connecting to and acknowledging architectural and environmental context.
"The city wanted an 'iconic' tower," notes Mr. Cotter, "but I'm not interested in ego-driven architecture that doesn't fit within the existing urban fabric."
Instead, the new 541-foot, 48-storey residential tower - which will break ground in early 2013 to become one of the tallest in Western Canada - is designed in direct relationship to its neighbours.
"The library (which sits opposite the site of the future building, scheduled for completion in 2015) is all about walls and windows," says Mr. Cotter, noting the tension between solidity and transparency that plays out in Bing Thom's design. "The new city hall is all about the roof."
Referring to a "hierarchy" of buildings in the new civic centre, Mr. Cotter was careful to design 3 Civic Plaza so it would complement, rather than overpower, the existing buildings.
The key lies in the podium which engages directly with the plaza and contains the entrance for the five floors of office space above it on the north side of the plaza, the residential tower and the 144-room hotel. Its transparent glass lobby opens up directly onto the street and blurs all the social spaces into one - encouraging a sense of community (and a sense of safety augmented by the 24-hour nature of the hotel business.)
It's been designed to be several feet lower than the "star" library, and also mirrors the angle of the library's eastern edge, creating a subtle symmetry. Its flat roof references that of the city hall, while the offices, hotel and residential tower have all been angled 15 degrees away from the plaza, in a kind of architectural deference. Through variegated and judicious use of scale and massing, Mr. Cotter has created a design for a tower that respects rather than overwhelms its neighbours.
Instead of opting for a traditional tower design with a rigid core, Mr. Cotter has chosen to create an external concrete shearwall structure that supports the 48-storey residential tower. Even here, the context of neighbouring buildings is taken into consideration, as the structured concrete shearwall is broken up by a series of guitar-pick-shaped openings that reference the interplay between solidity and transparency inherent in the library. They also offer a softer, more organic contrast to the strong, rectilinear nature of the podium, hotel, and residential components.
A new four-sided, silicon-glazed window wall system, gives the building a high-end commercial feel, that complements its mixed-use nature.
With hopes high for new businesses to be attracted to the civic centre, the whole area could well become an economic hub. But much will hinge on who will buy suites in the new tower (which will contain 108 two-bedroom units and 240 one-bedrooms). While the price is attractive - its per-square-foot price is approximately half of downtown Vancouver's - it's not Vancouverites the Century Group is counting on as b uyers, but rather, says Mr. Hodgins, locals who "have an investment in the community - either in terms of family or workplace."
The walkability factor for employees of city hall, the new hotel and the nearby Simon Fraser University campus is another key component.
But it could take a while to introduce a more urban mindset into traditionally suburban Surrey.
While it may be on the vanguard in terms of new public architecture, residential habits here die hard. A security guard at the library who lives in a nearby bungalow said she had concerns about the site being so close to the SkyTrain. And a construction worker, who told me she already owned condos in Vancouver and Richmond, said she preferred to stay in her 2,000-square-foot home a few miles away.
"Once you get used to all that space," she said, "it's hard to go back to a condo."
Meanwhile, construction continues enthusiastically, and with it, hopes for a more urbanized future for Surrey.
"City-building takes a long time," says Jim Cox, CEO of the SCDC, who admits that Surrey is a community in transition. "It's not going to happen overnight. But by increasing density and adding vitality to the city centre, 3 Civic Plaza will be a critical element in that process."
Above all, he sees it as key to changing the public perception of Surrey.
"The new building and its striking architecture will make a statement," he says. "That this place is changing."

In Cairo's tattoo subculture, a revolution makes its mark

Full text:   The real estate on her body is up for debate - perhaps somewhere along the upper back, or near the collarbone - but the young Egyptian who visits Laurice Matta's shop knows what she wants: a profile of Queen Nefertiti, wearing a gas mask.
In the back of her small beauty salon in the Cairo neighbourhood of Zamalek, Ms. Matta provides a rare service in this mostly conservative country. As the owner of one of Egypt's very few tattoo parlours, she has seen the steady evolution of what was once a nearly non-existent subculture in the Middle East.
Even as their country faces a constitutional crisis that could enshrine sharia law, the rebellious spirit of the revolution is thriving in its tattoo parlours.
More and more young Egyptians are commemorating their country's transformation on their bodies. "A lot of people are asking for Arabic font, a lot of people are asking for calligraphy ... for horeya ," says Ms. Matta, referring to the Arabic word for freedom.
Ms. Matta, who opened her beauty salon following the 2011 uprising in an affluent district just a block away from the Nile, herself bears the marks of Egypt's burgeoning tattoo culture on her own skin. Across her forearm is a heavily stylized illustration of the word "Muslim." When she flips her arm, the illustration instead appears to spell the word "Christian."
According to many interpretations of Islam, permanently marking the skin is forbidden. Yet, tattoos have a long, quiet history here. For generations, female members of the country's Bedouin tribes traditionally inked beauty spots on their faces. Today, some Egyptian women opt to remove their eyebrows completely and tattoo artificial ones in their place.
Tattoos also have a long history within the country's Coptic Christian minority. Many Christians have small, discreet crosses on their palms or wrists. During a spate of violence against them following the 2011 revolution, some churches refused entry to anyone who didn't have those markings. Today, the election of a President with deep ties to the Muslim Brotherhood has sparked a kind of oppositional rebelliousness in some segments of Egypt's Christian community which is readily seen in the country's parlours.
"After the Brotherhood took over, the crosses got bigger," says Noora, who helps run an underground parlour in downtown Cairo called Deviant Subkulture. Like the other artists at the parlour, she asked that her last name not be used, and the precise location of the studio not be revealed, for fear of attracting attention from more conservative elements of Egyptian society.
On a Sunday night at the Deviant Subkulture studio - a dimly lit apartment building drowning in cigarette smoke, where pictures of everything from classic cars to old Egyptian-movie artwork hang on the walls - a reporter finds Venezuelan and Jordanian tattoo artists, and the studio's half-Egyptian, half-Scottish founder. In addition to societal difficulties, Egypt's tattoo parlours face a host of region-specific challenges, such as trying to get supplies past the country's customs officials. Some prospective customers are also apprehensive about getting the procedure done in a country with relatively high hepatitis rates. Many within the Egyptian tattoo community are also wary of less expensive, fly-by-night operations.
"There's a guy named Sou' Sou' in Shobra," Ms. Matta says, referring to one of Cairo's most run-down neighbourhoods. "But don't get any work done from him - he's really a barber."
But if the country's tattoo community must struggle to operate within the confines of traditional Egyptian society, it also represents a fairly diverse segment of that society. Local customers include Muslims and Christians. Foreigners have come in asking for the pre-1953 Egyptian flag, which features a crescent and three stars. And, of course, a deluge of locals and foreigners want whatever it is David Beckham has on his back.
With massive street protests against Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi looming, nobody in the Deviant Subkulture studio can predict exactly where Egypt will be in a few months' time. But they can agree that the spirit of revolution has been very good for the tattoo business.
"There's no sense of censorship right now - in art, cinema, parties, you name it," says Tim, the founder. "People are emboldened. It's a good time for creativity in Egypt."

When State Building Group and Madison Homes acquired an infill site just south of Upper Canada College in Forest Hill, the developers recognized the demand for large condominium suites from locals downsizing from estates in the surrounding residential neighbourhood.
Since sales began in October, the team not only to designed a luxury high-rise with units ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 square feet - it also granted buyers' requests to combine adjacent suites to form one larger one.
"There are some [projects] in the vicinity that have larger suites mixed with smaller suites, so you could have a 2,000 square foot suite in the building that'll also have a 500- or 600-square-foot home as well," says Franco Crispino, sales and marketing manager of State Building Group.
"We wanted to build something strictly with two bedrooms plus a den to appeal to end users who [are] going to make this a full-time residence ... as opposed to an investor-driven building."
The size of the models will also limit the number of residences available, creating a close-knit community feel within the 18-storey building on Avenue Road just south of Lonsdale Road.
"There are only 90 units, so we refer to it as a boutique building, yet it still has all the amenities of the much larger buildings," Mr. Crispino states.
For instance, this classic brick and tinted glass development designed by E. I. Richmond Architects will have a fireside lobby with 24-hour concierge and guest suites, as well as a gym, hot tub, indoor pool, a party room with a kitchen and a landscaped terrace.
All other amenities can be found in the immediate vicinity, including the Beltline Trail, reputable schools, established shops and cafes and restaurants in Forest Hill Village and Bloor-Yorkville. Public transit and highways also offer easy access to the downtown core.
"It's an excellent spot," says Mr. Crispino. "We're just steps from Forest Hill, which is probably one of the most well-known communities or neighbourhoods in the area."
The sales pavilion on site replicates a 1,515-square-foot model featuring spacious principal rooms with picture windows and a private balcony, an open kitchen with an extended breakfast bar off a peninsula and a master suite with walk-in closets and private bathroom.
Standard finishes will generally be of a high calibre in every unit, from nine and 10-foot ceilings and stainless steel Miele appliances to pre-engineered hardwood, marble and porcelain tile finishes.
A locker and at least one-car parking will come with each unit, plus monthly fees of 55 cents per square foot.
Occupancy is slated for spring of 2015.

With nearly every unit sold out in 12 hours, the developers of a boutique condominium project in Burlington say they have tapped into the desires of style-conscious young professionals such as themselves.
The principals of the local development team, Adi Development Group, plan to live in the modern mid-rise themselves, along with the design-savvy buyers who scooped up a majority of the 78 units during the grand opening this month.
"We were 95-per-cent sold in 12 hours, so it went really, really well. The market really reacted to the product that we put out," says chief executive officer Tariq Adi, who, along with brother and partner Saud, is eager to move in upon completion in August, 2014.
The main draw to this four-storey midrise, which will be co-developed with Fortress Real Developments, is its modern, urban design.
Icon Architects devised a glass, onyx brick, natural wood and stone exterior with striking lines and angles displayed on Guelph Line, north of the QEW, just a 30-minute drive west of Toronto.
"Buildings that are smartly designed, efficiently laid out and are in an already established, mature community is key, and that's new for Burlington because a lot of the development in Burlington that does happen is typically low-rise stuff that's urban sprawl," says Mr. Adi.
"There are a lot of people in that demographic between 30 to 45 who would love to stay in Burlington if they had the option to."
Contemporary style will also permeate the fireside lobby, a social space with private dining and a rooftop terrace overlooking Lake Ontario.
For privacy, there will be balconies and patios for each unit. "Our ground floor units have big patios," Mr. Adi states. "One of our ground-floor units has a 2,000 square foot patio." The interiors of these one- and two-bedroom suites will also benefit from open concept plans with nine- and 10-foot ceilings, wide-plank laminate floors, granite counters and Energy Star appliances.
"That's all stuff that would typically be an upgrade in Burlington, but it's coming as standard at Mod'rn," Mr. Adi adds.
While their style influences come from metropolitan cities, the developers have lived and travelled worldwide and they are happy to anchor themselves in Burlington, which was recently ranked the second-best place to live in Canada by MoneySense magazine.
"It's got a great living standard out here, centrally located between Toronto, Oakville, Mississauga, Niagara region and the U.S., so what better place to be where you can get affordable living with high design that competes with things elsewhere," Mr. Adi asks.
"Not to mention, you're getting amenities in the area that will not only will appeal to a single person, but a family or young couple."
The infill site is within walking distance to everything from schools, parks and trails to restaurants and stores, and a short drive to the Burlington GO Station, QEW and Highway 407.
Parking is part of the package, but lockers will be $3,000. Monthly fees will be 33 cents per square foot.

Full text:   SKI RESORT Its critics call it a white elephant, and condemn it as an outmoded scheme and an environmental blight. But backers swoon over its beauty and say a glacier resort would be the jewel of the B.C. mountains
Grant Costello is ripping through British Columbia's Purcell Mountains in a 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The narrow gravel route is 36 kilometres of washboard and rockfall and stream crossings and sharp corners. On one, the rear end slides wide. Mr. Costello hits the gas and the vehicle straightens out. He barrels on, and smiles. The old Jeep has clocked nearly 250,000 kilometres. It's still going strong.
"I can't believe how tough this is," he says, practically patting the dashboard. "It just pounds through the potholes."
Pounding across rough road has become something of a specialty for Mr. Costello, who has driven this particular stretch of B.C. back road hundreds of times, chasing a billion-dollar dream that lies at its end. Here, the gravel runs into a chattering stream once crossed by a bridge that has now washed out. Mr. Costello pilots the Jeep across rocks submerged in knee-deep water to the other side. He stops, grabs a roll of architectural plans, and spreads it on the ground.
This, in a quiet forest in the midst of the Purcell Mountains some 500 kilometres northeast of Vancouver, is the spot where Jumbo Glacier Resort could one day lie. Its shape is drafted onto the architectural roll, a thin two-kilometre stretch of hotels and condos and shops paralleling Jumbo Creek, the namesake for this valley and for the resort itself - not to mention a rallying cry for opponents who, until this year, had managed to keep this particular dream on hold.
When the B.C. government approved its master development agreement in March, Jumbo sprung back to life - 21 years after its backers first formally applied, and more than four decades after Mr. Costello first came to this valley. This week, it took another step forward, when the B.C. government approved a mountain resort municipality - complete with mayor and two councillors - for Jumbo. It is a move that promises a simpler decision-making process as the resort slowly takes shape.
The plans for Jumbo are staged, starting with summer snowcat tours to the Farnham glacier that could begin next year. Then, a $25-million to $50-million first phase of the ski development: a gondola, a chair lift and three T-bars, accompanied by a restaurant and lodge. Accommodations will come later - as will the other elements of the grand billion-dollar plan, drafted by Vancouver architect Oberto Oberti, that Mr. Costello has unfurled on the ground. It could see 6,250 housing units, plus a total of 23 ski lifts. It could take 50 years to do it all.
That is, if it can be built. B.C. has become a killing ground for outsized mountain ambitions. Garibaldi at Squamish, a $2.9-billion proposal to build 123 ski runs, two golf courses and 21,922 beds, backed by some of Vancouver's most prominent families, has faded away after being turned down on environmental grounds. Similarly ambitious plans for the Cayoosh Ski Resort, backed by skier Nancy Greene, also foundered years ago.
Jumbo is, relatively speaking, a more modest proposal. But it has stoked an outsized opposition - environmentalists and first nations argue that it will industrialize a region that should be protected for grizzlies and ecological integrity - and hefty skepticism. It is, its critics will tell you, a white elephant that will never succeed. It is, its backers will tell you, a chance to build a jewel in the B.C. mountains. Jumbo's construction will depend in large measure on the ability of those backers to bring new dollars to a project on a continent stung by recent ski resort failures, at a shaky moment in the global economy.
The project's ultimate success, however, may depend on whether the Jumbo Valley, and the glaciers that surround it, hold the same appeal with the public as they do for Mr. Costello.
"It's my life's project," he says. "At the end of the day, we're going to have people skiing on glaciers in Canada." None of the plans for Jumbo Glacier Resort make much sense if you think of the Jumbo Valley as just another assemblage of slopes and trees and peaks and meadows. Mountains are lovely. They aren't particularly rare.
But something odd happens when you ask people about Jumbo. They swoon.
Take Rod Gibbons, general manager of RK Helicopters, a fierce Jumbo opponent who says the resort, if developed, will steal his prime ski terrain. Mr. Gibbons once ordered up a map of the region, colour-coded to accentuate areas with a 20- to 40-degree slope since, as Mr. Gibbons puts it, "that's your ideal skiing." On the map, "Jumbo Creek jumps out." Why? "It is perfect terrain. That's for sure."
Or take Dave Brownlie, president of Whistler Blackcomb. Jumbo, he says, "is absolutely unique. And it is totally differentiated from so much else - it's far more high-alpine European glaciers. It's absolutely beautiful. Like, absolutely magical."
It has glaciers that, when developed, will provide an uninterrupted winter run with 1,715 metres of vertical drop, powder top to bottom. It has Lake of the Hanging Glacier, where chunks tumble thousands of feet from a glacier hanging off a peak onto another glacier, which in turn breaks into turquoise waters.
And it has Glacier Dome. This is how Mr. Costello describes the spot he hopes will one day feature a restaurant, accessible by a gondola year-round, even to those with disabilities: "You look anywhere on the horizon, you see glaciers and mountain tops. You look down, you're looking at an alpine lake with icebergs floating in it."
"Nothing," he says. "compares with it."
That view, Mr. Costello says, should lure visitors in droves. Jumbo is counting on summer tourists to bring in substantial revenue.
But any talk of revenue must face a thicket of thorny facts. Even at Whistler, which has created a huge array of off-season attractions - mountain biking, glacier skiing, sightseeing - summer accounts for just 15 per cent of revenue.
Then there's Jumbo's location: Whistler is inside of a five-hour drive for seven million people. Jumbo is a four-hour drive from Calgary, population one million, and visitors have to drive past some of Canada's best-known ski areas - Lake Louise and Sunshine - to get to it. And those skiers aren't growing in number in Canada. That means there's really only one way to build a new hill: "market share war," says Nate Fristoe, director of operations with RRC Associates, a Denver-based market research firm.
Plus, Jumbo is located in a part of B.C. that has suffered in recent years. Just ask Hank Swartout, who calls the Jumbo resort "the craziest thing I've ever seen." Mr. Swartout was one of the backers of the Copper Point golf and condo development just outside Invermere, where the road to Jumbo begins. In 2008, Copper Point called itself "luxury's new address." The next year, it fell into receivership.
"I can tell you, the worst investment in my life has been investing in that valley," Mr. Swartout says. He adds: "I sold some lots for as high as $260,000. Now I can't get $70,000 for the next-door lot."
And those in industry say the days of funding a ski hill through real-estate sales are not just waning. They are dead. As for Jumbo, "if they do it in a more intelligent and measured fashion, and limit their up-front development costs, it's quite possible something there could work," says Jon Peterson, a resort consultant. That, in fact, is what Jumbo is proposing, with its initial ambitions so tempered that it expects not to pave its road - although it will eventually need some real-estate sales to balance its books and propel growth.
But it faces a barrage of local opposition. Scott Niedermayer, the defenceman, was raised in Cranbrook not far from the Jumbo site. He has called the project a "jumbo mistake," a sentiment echoed by provincial NDP Leader Adrian Dix, the head of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, the Union of British Columbia Municipalities and the local Ktunaxa Nation, which has launched a legal challenge.
The criticism has had a tangible effect.
Earlier this year, representatives from Compagnie des Alpes, a French company involved in some of Europe's biggest ski resorts, came to visit Jumbo. They were contemplating an investment. According to Mr. Oberti, the ensuing uproar made them rethink that notion. (Compagnie des Alpes did not answer questions.) Instead, Mr. Oberti says, it's more likely a private investor will step forward - although current long-standing investors have the means to build the resort, if they can be persuaded to pour in more money.
Mr. Oberti is actually designing another glacier resort near Valemont, B.C., which has the support of a local first nation. "If I was to start now, I would say to my original clients to go to Valemont, not to this one," he says, referring to Jumbo.
Still, this would not be the first time skiers have embraced a place with odds stacked against it. People thought Whistler was crazy at first, too. But replicating that success could be difficult. Today, Whistler's Mr. Brownlie says, "unfortunately, the overall market is not in a good place - and that's the challenge." But Jumbo would "add to B.C. as a world-class ski destination."
For Mr. Oberti himself, though, it's clear the years have taken a toll. Will Jumbo - can it - be built?
"That's a good question. After 20 years, I thought it would be," he says. "You tell me."

Full text:   A house built by United Empire Loyalists in 1850 was in bad shape, but after some work it revealed its secrets
Asking price: $2.995-million
Taxes: $9,008.46
Lot size: 12.58 acres
Agents: Alison Dyer (Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd.) and Luanne Hancey (ReMax Twin City Realty Inc.)
The back story
The Maus family were United Empire Loyalists who moved to Upper Canada from Pennsylvania in the late 1700s. In 1850, John Maus hired a Scottish architect and spent three years building the stone house that is still known as Maus Park. The house sits just outside of Paris, Ont.
"It's a very substantial home," says real estate agent Alison Dyer of Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd. She points to the Scottish granite that was used as ballast in boats on the journey across the ocean, then used in the construction of the front of the house.
The more informal part at the rear - including the carriage house - was built of local fieldstone. The two portions are joined by a keeping room and enclosed porches.
The sills, lintels and quoining are of quarried Guelph limestone.
The current owner, Douglas Stocks, is an antiques dealer who describes the house as almost derelict when he first saw it 25 years ago. It was divided into two apartments and the upstairs had no heat or hydro.
The residents had hung blankets and quilts from the ceiling in the front hall to prevent heat from rising to the second floor. Fake wood panelling covered the original stone and wainscotting in the keeping room and the carriage house had virtually collapsed.
"I love Georgian-style houses," says Mr. Stocks, who bought his first antique from another dealer when he was 11 or 12 and has been trading them ever since. At Maus Park, he was drawn to the centre-hall plan, majestic front hall and gracious principal rooms with high ceilings and traditional windows.
"I went into the basement. It was very sound and not wet," he says. "I went up in the attic and it was a marvel. It was very well-built," he says of the house.
There were orange blinds covering every window but Mr. Stocks knew light would pour in once they were stripped away.
"I could tell it was going to be bright."
Mr. Stocks also loved the landscape, the creek running through the property, and the massive original barn that measures approximately 11,000 square feet.
The size of the barn points to the prosperity of businessman and farmer John Maus, says Mr. Stocks.
When he recently had the value of the barn appraised, the appraiser couldn't find another one of that size within 160 kilometres, Mr. Stocks adds.
"Barns have a magic to them that houses don't," he says. "Maybe it was all the animals and feed. It was such an interesting barn - huge."
When it came time to renovate the house, workers spent three days stripping away layers of flooring in the kitchen. Underneath, they found a trap door that led to a hidden room in the basement.
"The foreman was all excited about the secret room," says Mr. Stocks, who adds that the workers found evidence that people had been down there.
He speculates that Maus Park was a stop on the underground railway, which sheltered slaves who had escaped from bondage in the United States. The property had masses of orange day lilies, which were a signal during the time of the underground railway that the homeowner would offer a safe haven, he explains.
Mr. Stocks worked on the house for a couple of years before he moved in.
"It was an adventure - a creative one."
The house today
The challenge, explains Mr. Stocks, came from retaining the character of the house while hiding all of the modern amenities. He updated the electrical system, plumbing and heating.
The kitchen includes a La Cornue range and an island with marble countertop.
Upstairs, a large master bedroom suite includes a luxurious bathroom with air jet tub.
Throughout the house, most of the original paint colours were still on the walls so Mr. Stocks restored the rich blues, reds and greens that were typical of a house of the age. After a few years, however, he found the dark colours too oppressive.
"So I decided we're not going to live in a museum - let's update the colours while staying sympathetic to what would be found in a Georgian house."
Mr. Stocks kept some of the wood trim around the doors in its original unpainted finish but painted other parts of the wainscotting and trim in bright white. He used historical colours that work well as a backdrop for the antique furniture that fills the house. He found a post card from 1911 which showed the house with its original portico so he had it copied.
The best feature
The 12 acres of landscaped grounds have drawn potential buyers looking for a country estate. The property includes Charlie Creek, which flows through the property and eventually joins the Nith River. Mr. Stocks dredged the creek to return it to its 1875 appearance.
An 1875 engraving depicted the circular drive and entrance gates so Mr. Stocks had the grass torn up as a first step to rebuilding the driveway.
"Lo and behold we found the original circular drive under there."
The former cow pasture is now the site of landscaped gardens and there is a large swimming pool. Mr. Stocks has created a small golf course that takes golfers through the grounds and over some of the bridges that straddle the creek.
Film crews often use the house as a set. Recently an episode of The Listener was filmed on the property. The grounds are so expansive, explains Mr. Stock, that the crew was able to film a scene that appears to take place in a public park.

Neighbours unite to create dream kitchens

Abstract: Mostly, however, the group discusses the wisdom of combining renovations. The only snag, they say, was when [Susan] and [Bart]'s slightly larger scope of work, which included widening the garage to add a mudroom, delayed [Lori] and Scott's job. "I remember there was a point where we just said 'please stop on ours for a week or two,' " says Susan, "but that was pretty minor in the whole scheme of things."

Full text:   Couples on each side of Westmount semi-detached home share an architect and combine renovations
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
'Their fault!" says Bart, stabbing an index finger at neighbours Lori and Scott when asked why he's endured two kitchen renovations since moving into his Westmount, Que., semi-detached home in 1994. His wife, Susan, laughs as Lori picks up the story (both couples have asked to withhold surnames).
It was in the wide laneway behind the two-and-a-half storey, 1928 Arts and Crafts semi where it all started, she says. For a brief period in the mid-2000s, both sets of children attended the same school, and she and Susan would walk them there via the lane, with their dogs scampering behind: "And I said to Sue, 'Did you ever think about taking the back wall out?' because she'd muttered about her kitchen."
She'd "muttered" because her 10-year-old traditional kitchen was already starting to sag. Plus, there was a staircase hogging valuable floor space, tiny windows, and, adds Bart, "we could not, as a family, eat in this kitchen."
Lori and Scott, who moved into their half in 2002, were no better off: In addition to the staircase, their kitchen - a mirror image of next door - still had the butler's pantry, which ate up even more space. "You couldn't open the fridge and make lunch at the same time," Lori quips.
Clearly, something had to be done.
But living in "half" a house doubles the challenge: Renovate without the blessing of the next door neighbours and risk making enemies, and these couples had been friends before the shared wall. Or, go ahead with a gut reno, then settle back to enjoy it just as a new dumpster arrives over the fence; worse, both owners end up with a mismatched home, and Susan and Lori had catalogued enough of those on their leafy, curving street already.
So, they searched for an architect to share. Since the City of Westmount takes heritage architecture seriously, with levels of protection to navigate and paperwork to sweat over, they hired R. James Aitken, Architecte "because he knew how to work within the system," says Susan. A Westmount veteran - he'd done work on city hall - Mr. Aitken welcomed the bureaucratic wrangling as well as the two-family challenge: "It was a very multidimensional project in terms of the interpersonal relationships," he says, "and they evolved and changed over time and there were differences of opinion."
Differences? It's hard to tell: The 2006 addition is so seamless, so considerate of the home's countenance, it's as if the two families were of one mind. Adding large, period-appropriate windows helped with light, and the new, flat roof is both sympathetic and stylish, while being fully capable of handling Montreal's legendary snow-loads. Rotating the staircase in both kitchens widened floor space considerably; pulling out the wall the maximum distance allowed, 11 feet, gave each couple an informal dining space.
Similarities end with the decor. On the right side is Lori's kitchen, built by a local contractor. Like the landscaping outside, it's traditional and cozy, with creamy stone counter tops and shaker cabinets crowned with moulding. In a nod to sustainability, an exterior window has been retained; it nestles into the counter beside a new interior door to the garage.
Interestingly, Susan, who had a traditional kitchen before, did a stylistic 180. Armed with Mr. Aitken's catalogues and dozens of shelter magazines, she was struck by photographs of older European homes that had grafted modern kitchens onto their backsides. Then, a friend who had practised architecture in Germany pointed to one by Bulthaup, a German company with a then-new showroom in Toronto, and called it "the Mercedes of kitchens."
She flew to Toronto and quickly agreed: "Everything's been thought through and has a purpose and a reason for its shape," she says. In fact, the highly engineered kitchens reminded her of Gore-Tex, the highly engineered product she had represented during her professional life with W.L. Gore & Associates.
Once Bart was equally smitten, they began to plan. But the folks at Bulthaup put up an early roadblock: They insisted upon a meeting with Mr. Aitken to make sure he had the chops to deal with the to-the-millimeter tolerances their kitchens required.
"I was being interviewed by the kitchen guys," he chuckles, still a little surprised.
He passed the test. Today, he sits at Susan and Bart's dining table with the others, discussing aesthetic things - "At the time there were no pictures in the magazines about dark grey kitchens ... so I was very nervous about that," Susan recalls - and engineered things, such as Bulthaup's "sexy" hinges or how the freestanding cabinet wall in fronting the stair had to be anchored with huge bolts. Bart shows off the tambour door that lifts to reveal a bar (where their window to the garage once was) and his flat screen TV.
Mostly, however, the group discusses the wisdom of combining renovations. The only snag, they say, was when Susan and Bart's slightly larger scope of work, which included widening the garage to add a mudroom, delayed Lori and Scott's job. "I remember there was a point where we just said 'please stop on ours for a week or two,' " says Susan, "but that was pretty minor in the whole scheme of things."
It certainly was, if one uses the dinners, walks, and glasses of wine passed over the fence since then as proof: "We're very fortunate, I feel, to have had this opportunity," finishes Susan. "I said to [Lori] in one of the e-mails 'You know you're not allowed to move, right?'"

Abstract: Some economists fear Spain's - and Europe's - unemployed may be near the breaking point. In a recent note, Gilles Moec of Deutsche Bank warned that "the capacity of the 'core' of working age population to accept a combination of unpopular structural reforms and harsh fiscal retrenchment may be close to its limit."

Full text:   In the El Raval neighbourhood, gloom threatens to snap a fragile web of support
On the edge of Barcelona's medieval quarter, near the port that welcomed Christopher Columbus home from his first voyage to the Americas, lies a densely populated area whose contrasts are striking: It vibrates with energy, diversity and communal support, while stricken by crushing unemployment, homelessness and street gangs.
On one short block alone in El Raval, the storefronts include the Centre Cultural de Bangladesh, a Spanish hardware shop, Gastro Bar Africa, the Maharaja Restaurant and a second-hand appliance shop where fridges cost as little as EUR50.
But with one of the highest regional jobless rates in the Western world, there's a sense of desperation and hopelessness.
While no official figures are available, local merchants say the unemployment figure in El Raval ranges from 50 per cent to 70 per cent. The numbers are credible, given Spain's national unemployment rate of 25 per cent, the highest among Western nations. Youth unemployment is a crippling 54 per cent, and both numbers are rising as the Spanish economy contracts and the euro zone lands in double-dip recession.
Spain, socially speaking, has been calmer than some other countries even as 3.2 million jobs have disappeared since 2007, when the housing market peaked, then crashed with devastating impact. It has not seen riots as violent as those that have torn apart Athens, most recently last February, when about 40 buildings in the centre were heavily damaged or gutted when mass demonstrations turned ugly.
But Spain may be on the verge of a greater labour upheaval as job prospects disappear for a generation of young people.
In September in Barcelona, more than 1 million protesters took to the streets to condemn the austerity measures that are deepening the recession (many were also there to call for Catalonian independence). On Nov. 14, another mass anti-austerity protest filled the city centre as part of the first co-ordinated, pan-European protests. In Madrid and in Lisbon, clashes with police left dozens injured.
Some economists fear Spain's - and Europe's - unemployed may be near the breaking point. In a recent note, Gilles Moec of Deutsche Bank warned that "the capacity of the 'core' of working age population to accept a combination of unpopular structural reforms and harsh fiscal retrenchment may be close to its limit."
In the heart of Barcelona, it is easy to forget that Spain is a miserable concoction of deep recession and soaring unemployment. The shops, cafes and restaurants are jammed with tourists and Catalans, bars are packed at 2 a.m.
Carolina Baras, the young sales manager of a funky handbag shop called Vaho, says business is picking up and she no longer fears losing her job.
"November started very well and we thought it would have started bad," she said, as shoppers snapped up colourful bags made of recycled material for EUR50 a pop.
Other parts of Barcelona are not so lucky. El Raval is a case in point.
One local resident, Harbilad Chumber, 51, created his own job when the booming construction industry that had employed him collapsed, putting him and millions of other unskilled and semi-skilled workers on the dole. He used his meagre savings to open an Internet and telecom shop, where calls can be made to India for 5 euro cents a minute. "In this area, there are three or four people to a room or small apartment," he said. "One of them works and gives money to the others. It's friendship, they all help each other."
Mr. Chumber, who is from Bangladesh, thinks 60 per cent or more of El Raval's residents have no work. "Some people here are going to Germany," he said.
The employment scene is so dire that thousands of people in El Raval have no place of their own. On a recent morning, the enclosed ATM area of La Caixa bank was full of elderly homeless people, who appeared to be Spanish, sleeping on cardboard mats.
Nearby, Cheick Conde, 40, from Guinea, was going through the contents of his supermarket cart that held his few possessions. He came to Barcelona eight years ago, worked as delivery man for the first four years and has had not a lick of work since then.
El Raval is full of gangs, he says, who have taken to petty crime, such as pick-pocketing tourists, to survive.
Mr. Conde sleeps in a communal lodging house. "You have to be out at 8 in the morning, and you can go back at 8," he said, speaking French. "I make no money at all. I'm sad because I came here to rebuild my life."
AFI, a financial consultancy based in Madrid, expects Spain's jobless rate to climb next year to 26.6 per cent as austerity measures kill off government jobs and the construction and housing industry remains in depression.
Throughout the euro zone, but especially in Spain, young workers are suffering the most. The young are easier to fire. In Spain, they are especially easy to let go because most are on temporary contracts, which give them virtually no job protection. Older workers tend to be on permanent contacts.
Rising Spanish youth unemployment (and falling employment) is proving disastrous not only for job seekers but for the economy itself. Deutsche Bank estimates that the lost generation of young workers has triggered a productivity crunch of 2 per cent in Spain, and a similar amount in Italy.
There is no doubt young people are growing frustrated in Spain as the downturn enters its fifth year. In a government employment agency in Barcelona, the lineups were long and hope was in short supply. "There are 6 million people looking for work in Spain," said Bibiana Perez Gasco, 31, who was waiting her turn to see an employment officer. "I look in bars, shops, supermarkets - nothing."
The question is whether Spain's millions of unemployed will get so angry that they will do what Greeks have done and paralyze their cities with endless mass protests that could turn violent. With job destruction in Spain outpacing Greece's, the surprise is that it has not happened already.
*****
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
Negative growth
Spain is now in its second recession since 2008, and its overall economic outlook is not expected to improve until 2014. Projections have the economy contracting by 1.5 per cent in both 2012 and 2013. Inflation is likely to rise from its current rate - 3.5 per cent in September.
Households
Since their 2007 peak, Spanish home prices have fallen by 28 per cent, a trend that's expected to continue. The combination of inflation, austerity measures and falling real estate costs have led to household savings rates of 9 per cent, well down from the historical 11-per-cent average.
Unemployment
Spain's jobless numbers are at all-time highs, and wage growth projections are being moderated. The overall unemployment rate reached 24.6 per cent earlier this year, and are expected to reach 26 per cent in 2013, with only a half-percentage-point improvement in 2014.

Housing slump ensnares Toronto

Abstract: "We wouldn't be surprised to see prices in Toronto down 5 per cent from where they are at the moment at the end of 2013," he said. However, prices have risen 6.4 per cent in the past year. "We think it will be a price decline consistent with a soft landing of the resale market," Mr. [Marc Pinsonneault] said.

Full text:   REAL ESTATE REPORTER
The decline in house prices that has hit Vancouver is spreading to Toronto, a shift that economists say marks the beginning of a national price correction.
While many say the market has long been due for a correction, and that a healthy and gradual decline in prices is ahead, the new numbers are fuel for those who argue that federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty's moves to cool the market went too far this summer.
Prices in Toronto dipped 0.6 per cent in October from September, the first monthly decline since the end of last year, according to the house price index compiled by Teranet and National Bank of Canada.
It comes after sales began to soften this summer, a trend that has continued. Sales in the Greater Toronto Area during the first two weeks of November were 17.5 per cent lower than the same period last year, according to the local realtors board, which has pointed out that Mr. Flaherty's decision to cut the maximum length of an insured mortgage to 25 years means higher payments.
A number of other cities, including Quebec City, Victoria, Ottawa and Montreal, also saw prices fall in October. Nationally, prices were 0.2 per cent lower than in September.
Craig Alexander, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said he was struck by how broad the declines were. "It's no longer just about Vancouver."
Vancouver's prices actually ticked up 0.1 per cent in October from September, but remain one per cent below where they were a year ago.
Nationally, house prices are still 3.4 per cent higher than a year earlier, but the year-over-year gains have been shrinking. The data suggest that the market is shifting toward negative territory.
A number of economists are optimistic that, barring any significant increase in unemployment or interest rates, house prices will nudge down gradually over the next year.
"We are starting to see the beginning of a negative trend in the housing market in Canada, but I think it will be a gradual and somewhat controlled slowdown," said Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce economist Benjamin Tal. That's the outcome that Mr. Flaherty and Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney are hoping for, as they've sought to take some of the froth out of the market now to prevent a crash down the road, and to keep consumers' mortgage debt levels in check.
Marc Pinsonneault, an economist at National Bank who works on the Teranet-National Bank national house price index, said that if the data are adjusted for seasonal factors, then home prices were flat in October compared to September. But even that is newsworthy, he adds.
"We wouldn't be surprised to see prices in Toronto down 5 per cent from where they are at the moment at the end of 2013," he said. However, prices have risen 6.4 per cent in the past year. "We think it will be a price decline consistent with a soft landing of the resale market," Mr. Pinsonneault said.
But some economists, and a number of real estate industry players, say the softening could be more severe and protracted than desired. This week, Will Dunning, the chief economist at the Canadian Association of Accredited Mortgage Professionals, said he thinks Mr. Flaherty's rule changes are jeopardizing the health of the market and the economy, and will continue to have an impact for years to come.
"Home prices have held up so far, prompting economists to declare a soft landing," David Madani, an economist at Capital Economics who has long been predicting a 25-per-cent national price correction, wrote in a note Wednesday. "But we think this is premature."
Data from RealNet Canada Inc. Wednesday showed that 2,792 newly constructed homes were sold in October, the second-lowest sales for that month for the 13 years on record. Of those, 1,914 were condominiums. The Building Industry and Land Development Association, which represents developers, blames Mr. Flaherty for the decline.
"In an attempt to cool down the market, the federal government has severely affected the building and development industry in the GTA," CEO Bryan Tuckey said in a press release. "The introduction of stricter mortgage regulations has triggered a decline in new home sales, and if this trend continues, it will affect job creation in the coming years, restricting economic growth."
The softening prices, coupled with rising household incomes, has made homes slightly more affordable, according to Royal Bank of Canada. "Despite the improvement, the latest readings still point to slightly greater-than-average affordability pressures in Canada, with such imbalances being somewhat more intense in the two-storey home segment," RBC says in a housing affordability report to be released Thursday.

The heartwarming sight of shrinking banks

Abstract: Shrinking banks are a heartwarming sight. Besides posing grave risks to taxpayers because of their outrageous size - the assets of UBS and rival Credit Suisse at one point were 680 per cent of Switzerland's GDP - they sucked up too much talent from the greater economy.

Full text:   ereguly@globeandmail.com
A funny thing happened when Swiss banking giant UBS announced last month it would eliminate 10,000 jobs, the first big move in dismantling its big investment bank. Its shares soared.
Investment banking was the glam end of the banking business and included fixed-income trading, equity capital markets, brokerage operations, and mergers and acquisitions. It was associated with big risk and big rewards, and every global bank of any size got into the game because that's what global banks did.
"As long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance," Chuck Prince said in 2007, when he was still chief executive officer of Citigroup .
A year later, the music stopped playing and Citigroup almost went bankrupt when its massive bets on collateralized debt obligations went wrong. It was saved by a government bailout.
Now, four years after the financial crash that eliminated Lehman Bros., the music is stopping for other global banks. Glamorous, high-paying jobs are being eliminated in the thousands, apparently with enthusiastic shareholder approval.
When UBS's brutal cull got under way - employees in London were simply locked out of their offices - the shares went up about 20 per cent.
Other banks - among them Nomura Securities and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) - are also blowing thousands of suits out the door. The Centre for Economics and Business Research estimates that the City of London financial district will lose 30,000 jobs this year alone, according to the Financial Times. The post 2008 job-loss total could reach 100,000, according to some estimates.
While this may be bad news for the City and the restaurants, accountants, cabbies and retailers that feed off it, like pilot fish around a shark, it's not bad news for anyone else.
Investment banks got too big too fast, to the point they put at risk entire economies because they became too big to fail. The banks evolved from the handmaidens of industry to speculative monsters, feasting on the very industries they were supposed to serve. The what's-in-it-for-me spirit of some of the investment banks was summed up by Matt Taibbi in his 2010 Rolling Stone article, which memorably likened Goldman Sachs to "a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money."
But the banks were also their own worst enemies, and not just because they lost the PR game. They also lost control of their costs, in good part because of excessive salaries. According to the Financial Times, staff costs as a percentage of operating expenses at UBS were an outrageous 69.5 per cent in the latest financial year.
The world has changed a lot for the investment banks since 2008, so more culling is inevitable. Trading activity has never fully recovered, initial public offerings are way off the mark, and economies in Europe and in North America are either in recession or growing so weakly that it's hard to tell the difference.
The biggie is tighter regulation. The European Banking Authority is insisting that EU banks maintain so-called Tier 1 capital of 9 per cent of their risk-weighted assets. Stress tests determined that dozens of capital-deficient banks will, collectively, have to raise about EUR116-billion ($148-billion) to meet the new capital requirements. More capital equals less leverage and lower returns. Bye-bye business.
Shrinking banks are a heartwarming sight. Besides posing grave risks to taxpayers because of their outrageous size - the assets of UBS and rival Credit Suisse at one point were 680 per cent of Switzerland's GDP - they sucked up too much talent from the greater economy. Bankers became bankers not so much because they were morally and intellectually suited to float dubious Russian and Chinese companies on the stock market, but because it paid a hell of a lot more than being a dermatologist, lawyer or fertilizer salesman. Soon, entire generations of university graduates wanted to cash in on the craze.
There is no shortage of bankers, real estate agents and even politicians, like London Mayor Boris Johnson, who think the banks' crash diets will damage local and national tax revenues. Britain is especially worried about the job losses because it readily let its grubby manufacturing industries slip away decades ago.
The fear is unwarranted. If smart, ambitious people do not go into banking, they will go into other businesses. They might become entrepreneurs and create jobs instead of working for planet-gobbling corporations that use their muscle to eliminate the jobs of rivals. Investment banks will certainly continue to exist in different forms. What they won't be is focused entirely on climbing the league tables for no discernible reason beyond ego and outrageous profit.

Gary Bensky began his career with an architectural firm renovating and restoring townhouses in downtown Toronto before shifting his focus to constructing custom homes across the GTA through Wycliffe Homes, over which he now presides.
So he relishes this company's latest development of a modern townhouse community disguised as a collection of historic structures inhabiting old Woodbridge Village, just north of Toronto.
"They're in a heritage district that used to be an industrial part of town with a lumber yard across the road that just closed down and a couple remnants of other buildings," Mr. Bensky said. "So we designed these houses to look like old factories with red brick and black window frames.
"That's what appeals to the young and young at heart."
Since the grand opening this summer, locals have purchased over a third of the homes in the unique infill project on Kipling Avenue adjacent to the Woodbridge Fairgrounds.
Among the first sold were two detached Victorians on site - the Thomas P. Wright House and McGillivray-Shore residence - that will be restored and relocated to frame the entryway into a landscaped courtyard surrounded by five buildings containing new stacked townhouses.
"The beauty of it is that the whole thing is only 67 units, two of which are heritage houses," Mr. Bensky said. "So you'll have some neighbours, but you're not going to have endless corridors and masses of people waiting for elevators."
More importantly, residents will become close acquaintances with established attractions nearby, such as the Market Lane Shopping Centre.
"It's a real short walk to the Market Lane, which after 20 years has finally come into its own with shops being well patronized and a grocery store taken over by a good operator akin to Pusateri's and Bruno's," Mr. Bensky said.
"It makes sense for young working people to live in close proximity to those amenities and there is a bus [route] outside the door."
Plus, there are plans to extend the Spadina subway line up to Vaughan, which is already easily accessible to several highways and is home to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, Boyd Conservation Area and Board of Trade Country Club.
Though these townhouses will have historic brick exteriors to complement the existing streetscape, the interiors will exude a modern loft atmosphere with nine-foot ceilings, hardwood floors, sliding bedroom doors, custom European-style cabinetry, granite counters and stainless steel appliances.
To cater to first-time buyers, empty-nesters and families, units will offer a wide variety of single and multi-storey layouts with street-level access , one to three bedrooms, open entertaining areas, U-shaped or open galley-style kitchens and private outdoor space with glass railings.
Units will come with parking, most outdoors and some in private garages.
Services will go in later this year for occupancy next fall.

Full text:   John Shiner uses differing levels to create an engaging series of spaces
jmays@globeandmail.com
Of the several virtues that have characterized modernist single-family residential design over its first century of development, modesty is one of the most attractive. You can set down a flat-roofed, geometrically simplified house in almost any urban streetscape laid out since Victorian times, and be sure that it won't make a fuss about itself. (Faux-historical monster homes, on the other hand, often kick up a lot of distracting visual racket.) And a modern dwelling is just the ticket when what's wanted is unshowy infill housing with ample, fluid interior space, maximum light and welcoming, up-beat attitude.
Last week, I visited a modern infill residence in Toronto's Cedarvale district that has all these desirable properties on the inside, and, on the outside, the right kind of neighbourly modesty - if perhaps a little too much of it.
Designed by John Shnier, founding partner in the local firm of Kohn Shnier Architects, for a professional couple enjoying an active retirement, the 3,000-square-foot house turns a severe face toward its street of traditional family homes. The boxy composition of this two-storey façade is dominated by the rigid symmetry of its upper portion, and its overall sombre tone is set by the ash-black brick that frames the horizontal windows and the entrance. The idea here, Mr. Shnier told me, was to encourage the building to "retire from the street"- though what he has done seems less like graceful backing off than a quick, sharp withdrawal, and the front façade appears somewhat stark and abrupt for that reason.
Inside the front door, however, a very different atmosphere prevails. The relaxed mood is generated, in part, by the simple palette of materials. The floors and cabinetry and other millwork throughout the building, downstairs and up, have been crafted from natural white oak, and the walls, too, are white. This light, warm scheme is quietly reinforced by the delicately grey-veined white marble Mr. Shnier has used in countertops, the bathrooms, and in the large, wide partition that stands between the kitchen and the living area. Relief from the general brightness is provided by black slate flooring laid in a pattern of contrasting sheens that creates a carpet-like effect underfoot.
But the most conspicuous and unusual accent is the red wall. The expanse of gleaming opaque glass covers the west side of the interior, rising alongside the stair to the second level, descending to the finished basement. This large, bold feature, and the various applications of only a few other sensuous materials, come together in a visual whole that is interesting, but never noisy, modern without being austere - that is lively without a sacrifice of serenity.
This liveliness, however, is not merely a matter of rhyming and contrasting tonalities. It is embodied in the bones of the house, the way it moves formally with its site, which slopes downward away from the street.
Mr. Shnier could have accommodated this incline by running the main floor straight back from the front door - the ordinary thing to do - and thereby making a lower storey that opened onto the back garden, pool, or whatever. Instead, he has let the floor sink with the landscape, and used the differing levels to fashion an engaging sequence of spatial experiences.
One enters the house at the top of this arrangement. The floor then drops a few steps to the level of the clearly demarcated dining area - with its wonderful glass and steel table - located at the front end of the house and the similarly well-defined kitchen. The dining area and the kitchen, then, occupy a mezzanine that is divided from the living area by an enormous counter draped in marble and by two more little flights of descending steps (one at each end of the counter).
The spacious living area is as exposed to the city as the dining area is intimate: A wall of floor-to-ceiling glass panels is all that separates the living and relaxing zone from the broad deck and pool beyond.
This gathering of space into site-specific places that are less than rooms, but more than spots on an blank grid, is not a reversal of the open-plan concept cherished by modernist architects in days of yore. It is, rather, an elaboration of this important idea, and an adaptation of it for contemporary architectural customers less concerned with abstract "space" than with place and place-making - with the properties of this or that place in a city, or in a landscape, or even in a residence.
I would like Mr. Shnier's Cedarvale house better if its exterior were not quite so gruff. But its innards are definitely sound.

Last week, just as the tail end of hurricane Sandy was lashing Toronto, five sets of bidders were sitting in parked cars outside one Leslieville house.
By the end of the evening the detached, house on Morse Street had sold for $932,000 and the sellers and buyers were inside sharing a bottle of champagne.
"We popped a bottle of bubbly and had a little toast," says Kevin Huestis. He and his wife Catherine sold the house for $133,000 more than the asking price of $799,000.
While some houses and condo units are languishing in Toronto's choppy real estate market, other homeowners are still reporting swift-moving deals out there. Properties in prime locations are selling within a week and sometimes generating a bidding war.
At the house on Morse Street, the buyers were feeling just as celebratory as the sellers when the deal was done.
"We knew we wanted it. We were prepared to be aggressive," says Maggie McAdory, who purchased the house with her husband Steve Barbier.
For Ms. McAdory, the most nerve-racking aspect of the evening was the fact that the couple's real estate agent had gone to New York for the weekend and remained stranded by the storm. They were trying to reach him for updates on the bidding but he was stuck with no power and a dwindling cellphone battery.
Meanwhile, the Huestises had been feeling some apprehension about the softening fall real estate market. The couple had already bought a house outside of the city in September. Just as they prepared their existing house for sale, the Toronto Real Estate Board was reporting a drop in sales compared with the same time last year.
"Definitely I was getting a little nervous," Mr. Huestis says.
He says his real estate agent, Shea Warrington of Real Estate Homeward, remained confident that the renovated house with a new garage would attract multiple bids - even as she was warning him to dig out the candles and the matches in case the power went out.
"Leslieville has really blossomed," he says, recalling that the Hells Angels had a club house just up the street when the family first moved in. Within six months of their arrival, he says, the police closed down the motorcycle club and Starbucks announced its first cafe in the area.
"It's a great neighbourhood and we're close to the core of it."
He says the couple wasn't surprised to receive so many offers but they were definitely pleased.
"Five was plenty."
For her part, Ms. Warrington says the location is ideal: the house is within walking distance of the shops and cafes of Queen Street but far enough along a residential street to feel removed. The main-floor family room and the parking for two cars also drew bidders, she adds.
"To get [a] detached with that kind of parking in Leslieville is so unusual," she says. "And the renovations there were just stellar."
Ms. McAdory and her family are pleased because they think the asking price was far too low. A detached house up the street sold for more than $900,000 in the summer, she says, so they made their offer based on that precedent.
They already live in the neighbourhood. They are move-up buyers who love the 25-foot-wide lot and the proximity to the local school.
The home's mansard roof also makes it stand out from others in the neighbourhood.
Ms. McAdory says she and her husband hope to keep their existing house as an investment property and rent it out, just as they still own the condo unit that launched them into the market.
"We believe that it's always going to be a good investment to have real estate in the downtown area in Toronto."
Meanwhile, on the other side of town, a house I wrote about last week sold on the offer date this week. The house at 3 Baby Point Cres. sold for $1.5-million, which is just shy of the asking price of $1.528-million, says real estate agent Theodore Babiak of Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.

Full text:   Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Pinterest are helping agents broadcast their expertise
Troll Twitter for the latest buzz from Pizza Libretto and you'll find plenty of pictures of sizzling Margheritas emerging from the wood-burning oven. So when real estate agent Ricky Chadha sent out a pic from the Ossington Avenue hot spot, he had no idea he would end up closing a deal on a house as a result.
Mr. Chadha is one of many agents who is using social media to bring fresh ideas to the real estate business.
The savvy ones are not using the hard sell to advertise their services so much as connecting with people who gravitate towards the agent's interests or market niche, says Samantha Hewit, who oversees realtor development at Royal LePage.
Blogging and posting on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Pinterest, among other sites, can broadcast an agent's expertise about architecture, design, neighbourhoods and market dynamics.
In the case of the dinner at Pizza Libretto, Mr. Chadha posted the pic with the hashtag #pizza. A chef in Nova Scotia happened to be searching for #pizza and came across the tweet.
He made a comment along the lines of "that looks good," recalls Mr. Chadha, and the conversation thread started.
It turns out the chef was planning to move from Nova Scotia to Toronto and he was searching online for job prospects. Eventually Mr. Chadha, who works with Royal LePage Estate Realty, offered to help the chef and his partner find a place in Toronto.
"They were very skeptical at first about working with any agent - let alone an agent from the other side of the country they haven't met," says Mr. Chadha.
So Mr. Chadha helped them without any obligation on their part to find a place to rent. When the couple did decide to buy, they hired him to represent them.
Mr. Chadha acknowledges that the chain of events is flukey.
"I think it's going to be rare for people to get a full-on cold lead from Twitter."
But he's going to continue to tweet about sports and food and the hyper-local happenings in Toronto because his social media activity often draws people to his website.
"It breeds familiarity," he says. "The only thing it costs you is your time, so why wouldn't you do this?"
Ira Jelinek, an agent with Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd., posts videos about his listings on YouTube and is increasing his presence with a Facebook business page.
Mr. Jelinek currently has 1,950 friends on Facebook. When they migrate to the new page and click on "like," he will be able to use Facebook tools to track their activity on his page.
For the social media segment of his business strategy, he has chosen to concentrate on Facebook.
It costs nothing, he points out, and the site already has a wealth of information about its users. That data will help him aim advertising at certain users depending on such factors as how much money they make.
Mr. Jelinek has also studied ways to increase his impact on Facebook. Every morning after working out at the gym, he spends an hour and a half pacing around his condo with a headset on. He phones acquaintances and clients just to touch base, then posts an item on Facebook because traffic is at a peak between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m.
He posts again in the afternoon between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. because that's when the greatest number of users are looking for a diversion from work, research shows.
"You can't just post anything. You want it to represent your passion."
Ms. Hewit, who handles training and education for more than 350 agents, stresses how important social media has become to the business.
Some agents are resistant, she says, because they don't know what to say on Twitter or Facebook.
"You have to use Facebook as a way to communicate with people on a personal level," she says. "People don't want to do business with a stranger. It's very emotional when they are buying a house."
She points to Royal LePage agent Shaun Nilsson who found his social media strategy so successful that he started a spin-off business called CityBlast.
Mr. Nilsson was just starting in the business and had no listings so he asked other agents if he could post their listings on his Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn feeds.
As a result, he pulled in $165,000 in his first year when he helped to sell 24 properties and the listings agents gave him a cut of the commission.
"Other agents in my office were asking me what I was doing because I was on the leader board right out of the gate."
Mr. Nilsson started CityBlast to provide agents with an "inbound marketing strategy," which means that instead of blasting advertisements about themselves, they are drawing clients towards them.
CityBlast posts the content on behalf of the agent who doesn't have the time or inclination to devise a social media strategy and stay on top of it.
Mr. Nilsson has clients in more than 1,200 cities across North America. He recommends that agents post status updates, mixed with articles about home decor or real estate trends.
"You need to be there on Facebook being perceived as an expert and a source of information."
Mr. Nilsson points out that more than 90 per cent of people who are looking for a property do so on the Web before they connect with an agent.
"More than 90 per cent of people are starting without you, so you don't know when they're starting."
That's why it's critical, in his opinion, for agents to be keeping in touch with clients through social media.
He also recommends that agents present a polished image - even on their personal pages.
"You won't see any pictures of me holding a drink. I feel like that's a public place and you're projecting an image there."
"My clients have now moved into their new place," he says of the deal that started with a Twitpic from Pizza Libretto on Ossington. "We ended up finding a house that has a wood-burning pizza oven in the backyard."

Apostasy on the West Coast: Californians back tax hikes

Author: McKenna, Barrie

Abstract: "California was on the leading edge of the anti-tax revolt that was a dominant part of the political scene in the United States for more than 30 years," pointed out Jon Christensen, an adjunct history professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. "So it's tempting to see Prop 30 as a bellwether for change."

Full text:   Leaders for decades of the anti-tax revolt in the U.S., state voters make abrupt turn in fiscal philosophy
Californians chose higher taxes over slashing school budgets this week as they turned back the clock on a decades-old anti-tax revolt that nearly bankrupted the country's largest state.
Voters approved a $6-billion (U.S.) package that includes a sales-tax hike and a surtax on the wealthy by a 54- to 46-per-cent margin. It was the first state-wide tax increase passed in California in two decades.
The improbable passage of Proposition 30 - one of hundreds of ballot initiatives held across the United States Tuesday - hints at a nascent mood shift as the country confronts an increasingly dire debt crunch and the dreaded fiscal cliff.
In California, at least, voters are apparently now willing to pay more for the services they consider vital.
"Here we are ... I think the only state in the country that says 'Let's raise our taxes, for our kids, for our schools, and for our California dream,'" said California Governor Jerry Brown, who championed the ballot measure.
California's dilemma could soon be replicated across the country as Americans are forced to make choices between losing cherished services or going deeper into debt.
"California was on the leading edge of the anti-tax revolt that was a dominant part of the political scene in the United States for more than 30 years," pointed out Jon Christensen, an adjunct history professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. "So it's tempting to see Prop 30 as a bellwether for change."
The urban voters in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay area, including women, young voters and Latinos, who led support for Prop 30 have a lot in common with the roughly 50.1 per cent of Americans who re-elected President Barack Obama Tuesday.
But exit polls in California suggest even many high-income earners voted yes.
"There are striking parallels here with the emergent national coalition that brought Barack Obama's re-election," Prof. Christensen said.
California's financial problems can be traced to the 1970s when soaring home prices and rampant inflation spawned a property-tax revolt in the sprawling suburbs of Los Angeles. The movement swept across the state, and eventually much of the country.
The result was Proposition 13, which rolled back and froze local property taxes in California. The effect of Prop 13 was to put the state in a permanent straightjacket, forcing local governments to off-load financial responsibilities on the state. And in the wake of the real-estate crash, it forced the state to take on ever greater responsibility for schools, health care and welfare, while sapping funds available for everything else.
Political scientist Peter Dreier, director of urban and environmental policy at Occidental College in Los Angeles, said Prop 30 is a "step in the right direction." But he said California's problems won't be over until the state repeals Prop 13.
"If California - the richest state in the U.S. - can't get its fiscal state in order, then it doesn't bode well for the rest of the country," Prof. Dreier said.
Now, he said, there finally seems to be a coalition of forces in the state willing to challenge three decades of anti-tax sentiment. If nothing else, Prop 30 suggests people understand "you can't have a strong economy without education."

Rebalancing act: Go against the flow

Author: Hallam, Andrew

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/rebalancing-act-go-against-flow/docview/1126289543/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Think of it this way: A global portfolio ensures that if there's a party going on for investors anywhere in the world, you'll participate in it. Meanwhile, rebalancing ensures that you're not having your pockets picked by blindly following the crowd. Both strategies make sense, whether you're in Cambodia or Canada.

Full text:   Living in Southeast Asia gives me the chance to attend the Cambodian water festival. Locals and tourists pack the streets of the capital city Phnom Penh, laughing as they splatter each other with water to welcome in the new year - but the fun often comes at a cost. Pickpockets roam the crowd, lightening the wallets of the unsuspecting.
Shake your head at the tourists' naiveté if you must. But most investors also lose money in crowds. And it costs them far more than it does Cambodian tourists.
The problem is our tendency to jump on stocks, bonds or real estate that other people also like. Even if we haven't personally profited from Canadian bank stocks or Apple shares, we feel good about their future prospects, because their prices have shot up in recent years as the crowd has rushed in. We recoil, however, when somebody mentions the languishing Spanish or Italian stock markets. Other investors have fled those troubled regions, so why should we stick around?
It's natural to think this way, but it's a very expensive habit. Our desire to be part of the pack is a key reason why individual investors in 17 fund categories do far worse on average than the typical funds in those same categories, according to research firm Morningstar.
Investors fall behind because they can't resist the temptation to jump out of areas with poor recent returns and hop into sectors that have already gone up. This habit ensures most of us sell low and buy high - just the opposite of what we should be doing - and typically shaves 2.5 per cent a year off our returns compared to how we would have fared by simply standing pat, according to the Morningstar study.
Avoiding this tendency can provide a big boost to your returns - and the way to do so is simple. Just develop a plan for allocating the assets in your portfolio across many different areas and types of assets, then rebalance your portfolio once a year to get back to your target allocation.
The great psychological challenge is the annual rebalancing. It means taking a deep breath, trimming back on your winning investments, and putting money into areas that have been falling - going where the crowd isn't.
This pulls against the way most of us think. A good example of the problem: Readers constantly question why I have selected an international mix of index funds for my Strategy Lab portfolio. Don't I know that Canadian markets have thumped the competition for much of the past decade?
I do. Nobody, though, can consistently predict which markets will do well in the future. Who would have looked at the lacklustre U.S. economy back in January and guessed that the S & P 500 would have soared to double-digit gains this year, handily outpacing the Toronto market?
The easiest way to make sure you'll benefit from whatever happens is to set up a global portfolio of low-cost index funds, then rebalance once a year. Say your overall goal is to have a mix of 30 per cent Canadian stocks, 30 per cent international stocks and 40 per cent bonds in your portfolio. If your Canadian stock index fund has made big gains and now constitutes 45 per cent of your holdings, you would sell some and pour the proceeds into your international stock index fund and your bond index fund to get back to your 30-30-40 target.
Rebalancing is a way of acknowledging that different assets bloom at different times. For instance, bonds typically outperform stocks during the first stages of economic weakness as investors flee to their perceived safety. Stocks usually start outperforming bonds before a recession officially ends.
It's next to impossible to predict when these shifts will take place, but a disciplined system of rebalancing ensures you're not piling into a hot sector just as it cools. In a study titled Does Portfolio Rebalancing Help Investors Avoid Common Mistakes?, Steven Beach and Clarence Rose, professors of finance at Radford University, show that regular rebalancing produces better returns than chasing top performing sectors.
Rebalancing works best if you have a diversified portfolio that is spread out among several asset classes, ranging from Canadian stocks to global bonds. A lot of investors resist this notion - some, for instance, prefer an all-Canadian portfolio because they perceive it as safer than risky emerging-market stocks and the like.
I can understand how they feel, but those investors should remember that there are long periods - such as much of the 1990s - when Canada's markets lagged behind the U.S. market and other global alternatives.
Think of it this way: A global portfolio ensures that if there's a party going on for investors anywhere in the world, you'll participate in it. Meanwhile, rebalancing ensures that you're not having your pockets picked by blindly following the crowd. Both strategies make sense, whether you're in Cambodia or Canada.

Full text:   Along with picking a president, Washingtonians will have their say on legalizing same-sex marriage next Tuesday. Backed by big corporate dollars and a strong campaign, the 'yes' forces just might make history, Rod Mickleburgh writes
As storybook weddings go, the union of Colleen Ozolitis and Lee Ann Martinson is hard to beat.
The couple was married on a gorgeous fall day in 2006 - to the cry of seagulls and the roar of pounding surf - by a B.C. marriage commissioner, who presided over the ceremony on the sublime white sands of Long Beach on Vancouver Island.
Despite the magic of the moment, however, there was something missing. "We eloped," Ms. Martinson recalled with a laugh this week.
The two Seattle women were among more than 600 gay men and women who travelled north from the United States that year to be married in British Columbia, where such marriages have been legal since 2003. The pair left family and friends behind.
Now, notwithstanding their romantic memories from Long Beach, they want to get married again - this time in their home state.
Their moment may be at hand. Next Tuesday, along with choosing a president, a myriad of state and county officials and deciding whether to legalize pot, Washington State has a chance to make history as the first state to vote in favour of same-sex marriage.
"We are very much appreciative of our northern neighbours, but we really want to get married here. It's time to bring our families together," said Ms. Martinson, a 43-year-old banking executive, as she took a break from working the phones on behalf of Washington United for Marriage at a volunteer centre in the heart of Seattle's gay area.
Referendum 74 asks voters to endorse or reject a state law legalizing same-sex marriages that has been passed but not implemented.
There are implications for B.C., too. The province would lose its favoured status as the only jurisdiction in the Pacific Northwest to sanction gay marriage, a factor that has sent several thousand American couples to tie the knot in B.C. over the years.
Although yearly totals have gone down since the first rush of matrimonially minded gays to the province, local tourism boosters continue to market Vancouver as a "gay-friendly" destination, pointing to same-sex marriages as part of the attraction.
"Marriages do cost money, even small weddings, so obviously there's a positive economic impact for us," said Candice Gibson, manager of consumer marketing for Tourism Vancouver.
Ms. Gibson hastened to add her hopes that Washington votes "yes" to same-sex marriages. "Advancing civil rights is always a good thing. ... Besides, Vancouver remains an excellent honeymoon location."
Asking Americans, with their country's strong conservative and religious roots, to sanction gay marriage, however, is a daunting task.
Advocates are on a grim losing streak. The question has been put 32 times to different state voters across the U.S., and 32 times they have said "no."
This campaign may be different. Big donations from liberal corporate moguls such as Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com Inc. ($2.5-million), Bill Gates ($500,000) and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg ($250,000) have the "yes" forces awash in cash. Large companies, including Nordstrom Inc., Starbucks Corp. and Nike Inc., have also weighed in, urging employees to support the right of gay couples to marry.
And Washington is one of the most Democrat, secular states in the country.
Pinched for funds, the headquarters of the anti-gay-marriage side is no grander than a few modest rooms in a nondescript, suburban Seattle plaza.
There, Chip White, the cheery, relentlessly upbeat spokesman for Preserve Marriage Washington, brought in from California to direct the group's messaging, is undeterred by the other side's financial war chest. This is a grassroots campaign, based on volunteer groups across the state, he said.
They are fuelled by the conviction that marriage is solely a union between a man and a woman, and it's best for kids, too, according to the unmarried, 37-year-old real-estate lawyer from California. "You can be a creationist or a Darwinian. It still takes a man and a woman to have a child."
This dedication was evident on a highway overpass later in the day, when a dozen opponents of same-sex marriage braved a drenching downpour to wave their signs at motorists speeding below on the busy I-5.
Clad in a black rain suit, water streaming across his glasses, a retired government employee, who identified himself only as "Norsky," predicted "a tsunami of consequences" if gay marriage is approved. "I believe it's just a matter of time before they'll be teaching about homosexuals right in the classroom."
That's the message pounded home by the "no" side's not-so-secret weapon, Frank Schubert, the champion of anti-gay-marriage campaigns in the U.S.. He has yet to lose a public referendum on the issue, often turning around pre-election polls late in the race with TV ads playing on voter fears about the implications of same-sex marriage.
They argue that those opposed to gay marriage will be harassed and discriminated against, while youngsters will be taught in school that "a prince can marry a prince," as one controversial ad claimed. Another features Ontario sportscaster Damian Goddard, who was let go by Sportsnet last year, a day after tweeting in favour of traditional marriage.
"Washington is a tough state, because it's very liberal," Mr. Schubert said in an interview, and the stress of maintaining his campaign winning streak is high. "This is life on a high wire. I expect victory. If not, then the Lord has some plan that I don't understand."
For Colleen Ozolitis and Lee Ann Martinson, who already receive full couple benefits as registered "domestic partners," it's all a matter of their place in society, especially now that they are parents of five-year-old Callum.
"I want my son to be able to tell people his moms are married," Ms. Ozolitis said. "I don't want to redefine marriage. I want to be included in it."

Full text:   RETAILING REPORTER
In a fast-growing sector that caters to bargain hunters, some discount retailers are being transformed by fierce new competition that is forcing them to improve or face extinction.
As a bevy of smaller Canadian discounters are being pushed out or shrinking - including Quebec-based Hart Stores and Hudson's Bay Co.'s Fields chain - the survivors are trying to reinvigorate their operations, before they get crushed between large U.S. players and dollar stores.
One of the smaller players, Bargain Shop - an heir to the Woolworth's five-and-dime - will unveil a dramatic makeover on Friday aimed at battling the emerging forces. It will change its name to mymark in cities and Red Apple in rural towns. In urban areas, where it is being squeezed by bigger players, it will ditch low-margin food and household consumables, such as paper towels, and bet heavily on higher-margin clothing and home goods.
"Let everybody else fight over food and consumables," said Eric Claus, executive chairman of Bargain Shop's parent, TBS Acquireco Inc. "We said, 'We don't need to be in that low-margin game.' ... It broadens our customer base and gives us the ability to compete."
The discount shakeout is pitting giants such as Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and Dollarama Inc. against the likes of Bargain Shop and Giant Tiger.
Next spring, the stakes will rise again as U.S. discounter Target Corp. opens its first stores in Canada, taking over from former Zellers outlets.The surviving smaller chains feel the need to take bold steps. But there's also a risk they will lose customers by shifting too fast or by dropping offerings such as food, which may earn little profit but keep shoppers returning.
"Food and consumables, generally speaking, keep the customers coming back on a regular basis because we have to eat regularly," said Rick Pennycooke, president of retail real estate adviser Lakeshore Group. "But I can see them feeling the pressure to do something because they will just get run over."
Bargain Shop and the larger Giant Tiger both are counting on a similar competitive advantage - being a convenient, local discount destination - and are placing a similar bet on private-label fashions.
Giant Tiger, with roughly $1.5-billion of annual sales, is moving more to brand-name food and toys, along with its clothing and household products. Andy Gross, its chief executive officer, said his company foresaw the shifting tides from Wal-Mart, Target and dollar stores about two years ago and has started to sharpen its offerings. "Everyone is a moving target."
Giant Tiger is almost doubling its spending on store remodelings in the next 12 months, responding to its customer research that found that shoppers want more predictable and less cluttered aisles. The chain is aiming eventually to raise sales by about one-third to $2-billion from 250 stores, up from today's 206.
Bargain Shop, which is controlled by Genuity Capital, is moving to entirely new banners to flag the changes in its offerings. Mymark,whose first six stores under than name will include locations in Toronto and Welland, Ont., will focus on clothing produced mostly by Quebec-based apparel specialist Effigi - which is also owned by Genuity and run by Mr. Claus.
Clothing can generate gross profit margins of 40 per cent or more for discount retailers, compared with between 20 and 30 per cent in consumables, industry observers estimated.
The revamping won't be as pronounced at the company's Red Apple stores in rural markets, where competition isn't as stiff, Mr. Claus said. Thirty-one Red Apple stores have already launched. They carry basic packaged foods, although not nearly as much as Giant Tiger, which also stocks fresh produce.
With about 230 stores today, including 10 former Fields stores purchased recently from HBC, Bargain Shop is aiming for 290 by the end of 2015, one-third of them to be mymark and the rest Red Apple. (Most of the 169 Fields stores were closed this year by parent HBC, which sold 57 of them in small towns in Western Canada to new business partners.)
But mymark isn't abandoning food completely. It and Red Apple are rolling out a colourful "candyworks" section to help keep shoppers in the buying mood - an idea that Mr. Claus borrowed from some European retailers.

Full text:   The fledgling Expo City project could dictate the direction of the suburb's visionary downtown revitalization
jmays@globeandmail.com
In a brief, intriguing video currently on YouTube, the Toronto suburb of Vaughan rolls out its vision for the stretch along Highway 7 just east of the 400 expressway.
Gleaming residential and office towers, thickly clustered, soar above what is now a dreary patch of sprawl. People bustle on spacious sidewalks. Wide thoroughfares transect the proposed downtown (to be called, rather grandly, the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre, or VMC), and large greenswards open its core to the sky.
It remains to be seen whether this futuristic scenario will be effectively, fully translated into facts on the ground during the years and decades to come. But shovels and cranes are already doing their jobs at a couple of spots in the 442-acre VMC quarter.
One is at the terminus of the $2.6-billion Spadina subway extension, scheduled for completion in the autumn of 2016. Another, located a short distance east of this new underground station, is the 8.6-acre site of Expo City, the district's first high-rise residential complex and, certainly, a foreshadowing of the intensive development that Vaughan wants to see happen in the neighbourhood.
Designed for Cortel Group by architect Alan J. Tregebov, Expo City will eventually consist of five condominium towers, a long, mid-rise mixed-use pavilion alongside Highway 7, and landscaped green spaces. (The first condo stack is under construction, and the sale of apartments in the second has begun.)
For the record, each of the two 37-storey initial towers will contain around 350 suites, all attractively squarish in layout. (As opposed, that is, to the long, skinny format of the common Toronto condo unit.) The apartments range in total area (including balconies, solariums and terraces) from about 527 square feet to more than 2,100 square feet. The prices, Cortel vice-president Peter Cortellucci told me, run along a spectrum between $430 a square foot and around $500 per square foot.
The ideal customers Mr. Cortellucci is angling for, he said, will be either local twenty-somethings "moving out of the home" - young folks in Vaughan are in no rush to leave the family nest - or people over 45 who are single or downsizing. The developer, an offspring of the numerous and successful Cortellucci real-estate family, is in a good position to know the likes and dislikes of one cohort in his target market: He is just 25.
So what are we to make of the home base he is preparing for the first generation of VMC's high-rise residents?
If what's wanted is livable, workable intensification, then the Expo City scheme makes good sense. While he could possibly have scattered the five buildings more loosely across Cortel's property, Mr. Tregebov proposes to gather them around a small pond behind the low-slung condo/retail structure, to which the first two towers will be linked at grade. One consequence of this close grouping is the freeing-up of land for a park along the meandering itinerary of Black Creek.
Also, this compact arrangement will offer home owners the convenience of doing at least some of their shopping where they live, which, in turn, will cut down on the number of their car trips - a major objective of the municipality's general VMC plan. If Expo City's galleria attracts the designer-label kind of retail Mr. Cortellucci would like, and if his mixed-use formula catches on with other residential developers in the area (as the planners intend for it to do), Vaughan could soon see a certain lightening of its domination by the sprawl culture of malls and cars.
Unless there is a significant course-correction, however, Vaughan's shiny new downtown will never be hailed as the hatchery of innovative architecture it could and should be. The exterior of Mr. Tregebov's first tower, with its wavy mullions and undulating balconies, will be slightly interesting from an aesthetic point of view - or perhaps merely a little different from the same old thing.
His second tower is the same old thing - a serviceable but completely unremarkable heap of glass and steel.
Of course, not every new suburban residential high-rise project needs to be a show-stopper like Mississauga's curvaceous Absolute complex. There will always be a place for modest "fabric" buildings of the kind Mr. Tregebov has (so far) crafted for this site.
But the commercial success of Absolute has demonstrated that the housing market in the Greater Toronto Area can absorb the shock of a departure from routine glass-box geometry.
If Vaughan is serious about creating a dense 21st-century downtown from scratch - a really new place under the sun - it will press developers and their architects to come up with imaginative, fresh tower designs that delight and move and challenge the people who live in and with them.

Hong Kong pulls welcome mat

Abstract: Hong Kong's new anti-foreigner property tax may catch on elsewhere. Battling the effects of cheap money and capital flight, the territory's authorities have slapped a 15-per-cent stamp duty on buyers without a permanent resident's card. Though the move will have unintended side effects, its political logic could prove appealing in other urban hot spots.

Full text:   Hong Kong's new anti-foreigner property tax may catch on elsewhere. Battling the effects of cheap money and capital flight, the territory's authorities have slapped a 15-per-cent stamp duty on buyers without a permanent resident's card. Though the move will have unintended side effects, its political logic could prove appealing in other urban hot spots.
The average cost of a small Hong Kong apartment rose by a fifth in the first nine months of the year. Yet the territory's currency peg to the U.S. dollar means raising interest rates would merely attract more foreign inflows. So far, the authorities have concentrated their efforts on protecting the banking system by placing increasingly tight limits on mortgages.
The new special stamp duty is aimed squarely at the other driver of Hong Kong property inflation: Chinese buyers. Investors from the mainland seeking a safer place to park spare cash have become an increasing feature in recent years. In 2008, non-residents bought one in 17 of Hong Kong's newly-built properties. Last year, they snapped up one in five.
Taxing non-residents is a blunt instrument. It punishes Hong Kong-based expatriates who want to establish a permanent base in the city as well as domestic developers seeking to spruce up old buildings. It also treats mainland buyers as foreigners. These groups may yet challenge the new measures in court.
However, the political appeal is clear. Rising property prices used to be a sign that a city was attracting high earners whose taxes and spending would add to prosperity. But when real estate becomes a safe-harbour asset for foreign landlords, many of them effective absentees, that argument no longer applies.
Singapore has also imposed an extra stamp duty on foreign buyers. Others may follow suit. House prices in central London, for example, have soared in defiance of Britain's economic gloom as investors seek a haven from the storms of the euro zone. While European law would make it hard to discriminate against buyers from Spain or Italy, local authorities could take other measures, such as imposing extra taxes on owners who leave their houses empty. The anti-foreigner property backlash has some way to run.

Real Estate Association predicts that Greater Vancouver's average prices will slip another 1.9 per cent next year to $720,000 while the Fraser Valley squeezes out a gain of 0.2 per cent to $488,000.

Full text:   High-flying market to see sales fall by one-fifth this year, B.C. Real Estate Association forecasts
Greater Vancouver will see home sales tumble by one-fifth this year, but the market should rebound in 2013, the B.C. Real Estate Association says in its new forecast as the group moves to calm fears of a local housing crash.
The number of single-family detached homes, condos and townhouses sold in Greater Vancouver will fall 20.5 per cent this year to 26,200, hurt by Ottawa's moves in the summer to tighten rules for mortgage borrowing at a time when the local market had already softened, the association said in its report.
In the B.C. Fraser Valley, which includes the sprawling and less expensive Vancouver suburb of Surrey, sales on the multiple listing service are predicted to decline 10.4 per cent to 13,200 this year. But the number of residential properties sold is forecast to climb 13.7 per cent to 29,800 next year in Greater Vancouver and rise 5.7 per cent to 13,950 in the Fraser Valley.
Cameron Muir, chief economist of the B.C. real estate group, said the federal government reduced the maximum period for a government-insured mortgage to 25 years from 30, effective July 9, resulting in a dampening effect on house sales. Ottawa also eliminated government-backed insurance for homes above $1-million in a bid to ward off highly leveraged borrowing.
"The resulting decline in purchasing power has squeezed some potential buyers out of the market," Mr. Muir wrote in the forecast. "However, strong full-time employment growth, persistently low mortgage interest rates and an expanding population base point to more robust consumer demand in 2013."
British Columbia is expected to attract 40,500 "net new migrants" to the province next year, mostly through international immigration, notably from China and other Pacific Rim countries. That total would represent an 8-per-cent increase from this year.
The average price for a Greater Vancouver residential property sold in 2012 is forecast to fall 5.9 per cent to $734,000 and decrease 3.1 per cent to $487,000 in the Fraser Valley, compared with 2011. The B.C. Real Estate Association predicts that Greater Vancouver's average prices will slip another 1.9 per cent next year to $720,000 while the Fraser Valley squeezes out a gain of 0.2 per cent to $488,000.
In an interview, Mr. Muir said restrictions on Ottawa's immigrant investor program also contributed to a slowdown in sales in some neighbourhoods, but he cautioned against jumping to conclusions that home prices will eventually plunge, triggered by this year's slump in the volume of units changing hands. Barring any large catastrophe such as a tsunami or major economic shock, the Vancouver region will experience a "gentle landing because home prices tend to be sticky on the way down," he said.
In addition, the Vancouver area's economy is healthy, and not dependent on any one sector, Mr. Muir said.
Provincially, the B.C. association forecasts residential sales will drop 9.8 per cent to 69,200 units this year - far off the 15-year average of 79,000 and a record 106,300 across British Columbia in 2005.
The average B.C. resale home price is predicted to decline 7.6 per cent this year to $518,600 but post a slight increase of 0.7 per cent to $522,000 next year. The statistics in 2011 were skewed by a large number of high-end homes sold in the B.C. Lower Mainland, especially on Vancouver's west side and in Richmond, said Mr. Muir, whose association represents 11 member boards.
Real estate boards in Greater Vancouver and the Fraser Valley prefer to track trends through what they call "benchmark index prices for typical homes" in a formula that effectively strips out sales of high-end luxury houses to better gauge regional changes.

"Sixteen out of 31 units will not only have nice views of the city, rooftops and trees, but they also have a view of the [building's] green roof."

Aykler Developments and Urban Fabric Development have released details of their latest collaboration in Leslieville. They feature a small collection of stacked townhouses that they hope will provide a low-rise, infill alternative to the ubiquitous downtown condo tower.
"We're filling an important niche for people who want something different that still has the look and feel of a house, but is less expensive and everything is brand new," says George Popper, principal of Urban Fabric Development.
"Another big feature of ours is the condo fees are low and they will stay low because we don't have elevators to maintain, public corridors and public stairways."
This means there will be direct street-level access to each unit in the infill project, which will contain 31 luxury suites placed on top of one another in two three-storey buildings on Gerrard Street, just east of Greenwood Avenue.
"People living in a high-rise condo or young people moving out of their parents' homes like the idea of having their own place with their own front door," Mr. Popper explains.
Buyers also appreciate that many of the one-bedroom units on the lower level will have private, south-facing patios, and the two-storey, two-bedroom suites above them will have rooftop terraces with gas and water hookups.
"For our upper units, they have not only big rooftop terraces, but most have a sizable balcony right off the main level, which is something you don't see very often," Mr. Popper adds. "Sixteen out of 31 units will not only have nice views of the city, rooftops and trees, but they also have a view of the [building's] green roof."
While the development known as East Village will complement existing residences, it will have a distinct, modern design encased in large expanses of glass, wood and brick once completed by November, 2014.
Local designer Andrew Pike will ensure the clean and sleek lines will extend indoors, where there will be nine-foot ceilings throughout and open principal rooms with engineered wood flooring, glossy melamine slab kitchen cabinetry, quartz or granite counters and stainless steel, Energy Star appliances.
Some smaller plans will bear dens and sliding bedroom doors, while larger ones will offer pantries and skylights.
Monthly fees will be 31 cents a square feet, plus individually metered gas and hydro.
Purchasers of two-bedroom units can also buy a parking and bike lockers for $29,900. Storage and bike locker will be $3,000 and $2,000, respectively.
However, residents can easily travel on foot to established restaurants, shops and streetcars on Gerrard and Queen streets, including local favourites in the Gerrard Indian Bazaar. Plus, there are recreation facilities at Greenwood Park nearby and at Woodbine and Ashbridges Bay parks by the waterfront.
"We think it's going to be a hot new area because of its proximity to downtown and all the amenities close by," adds Mr. Popper. "There are some coffee houses and boutiques moving in, so it's an area regenerating."

LISTING AND CO-OP AGENT
Anne Adams, Toronto West Realty Inc.
The Action: This five-bedroom property in Lorne Park opened its doors to about 30 buyers granted private showings and a group of realtors invited to an agents-only open house. Offers would be reviewed at any time, so local business owners hoping to reside in the area immediately presented a bid.
What They Got: In 1969, this 5,740-square-foot residence was custom built by the sellers on a 105-by-121-foot lot, complete with a double garage and an indoor pool with multiple skylights, windows and sliding doors to the south-facing backyard.
* The main section of this centre-hall residence has a foyer between the living room and a dining area with beamed ceilings and a stone, wood-burning fireplace. Across the rear there is a den, a family room and an eat-in kitchen outfitted with a granite-topped island and a rear walkout.
* Crown mouldings and hardwood floors appear in several bedrooms upstairs, including a master suite with entry to one of four bathrooms and a secondary bedroom that could be used as an office as it has stairs to a separate front entrance.
* The 1,700-square-foot basement contains a sauna, games room and fireside recreation area with a wet bar.
* Within a five-minute drive of the property, there is a golf course, waterfront parks and Port Credit's entertainment and food districts, as well as a marina, GO Train station and QEW.
The Agent's Take: "It had a very nice floor plan and it was very spacious," says agent Anne Adams. "A lot of the homes have pools, but not necessarily an indoor pool, which was a very nice feature."
The outdoor setting is also a highlight. "It was treed at the back and there were trees around the perimeter, so it was nice to give privacy," says Ms. Adams. "It's a beautiful street and the homes on the other side back onto the Credit River."

Crossing the Great Mall: Mainland shoppers invade Hong Kong

Full text:   If people are rude on the Hong Kong subway, blame China.
Do the same if the hospital emergency room is overcrowded, or there's no yogurt at your local grocery store.
That's what the locals do.
When this former British colony was handed back to Beijing in 1997, there was widespread celebration, but also nervousness: Could Hong Kong maintain its separate identity - particularly its freer media and unfettered business environment - once it was part of the massive People's Republic?
Fifteen years later, Hong Kongers worry less about China's nominally Marxist rulers than about China's capitalist masses, who tend to treat this densely populated city of seven million as a giant mall.
Shopaholic tourists from mainland China, often spotted moving in packs behind an umbrella-waving tour guide, are vilified for emptying store shelves, driving up real-estate prices and crowding maternity wards and schools.
And if that wasn't bad enough, uncouth mainlanders eat on the subway - prohibited in orderly Hong Kong - or spit on public streets. They simply ignore the painted markings that show where lineups are supposed to begin at taxi ranks and bus stops.
These faux pas are not easily dismissed in a city that has long viewed itself as culturally superior to the rest of China because of its traditions of civility and free expression.
"Chinese people are quite selfish. They don't line up, they spit, they think that money makes them kings and queens," complained Roy Tam, a prominent local environmentalist. He said the city needed a quota system to restrict the influx of mainland Chinese. "As a Hong Kong person, I care about living space. But on Saturdays and Sundays, we can't go to the shopping malls or to the park because they're too crowded. Tourists from all over China coming to such a small space - it's over the capacity of what Hong Kong can handle."
Animosity toward mainlanders is such that many refer to them as "locusts." A modified version of the colonial-era flag has even shown up at anti-mainland demonstrations in recent months - an act of protest against a local government many see as being too accommodating to Beijing.
It's the opposite of what was supposed to happen when the city joined the People's Republic under the promise of "one country, two systems," with Hong Kong allowed to preserve its relative freedoms under Beijing's loose rule. Hong Kongers and mainland Chinese, long-separated siblings, were expected to gradually get used to living with each other. Instead, Hong Kongers have come to dislike their constantly visiting relatives.
Hong Kongers, who already live in one of the world's most densely populated places, feel they're being overrun by mainland Chinese. Some 28 million visited last year, or four tourists for every resident, taking advantage of the city's tax-free status to go on buying binges. Though mainlanders injected a whopping $263-billion (U.S.) into the local economy, residents are frustrated that it is the mainland Chinese authorities, not the government of this Special Autonomous Region, that decide who and how many can visit Hong Kong.
Polling done by Hong Kong University's Public Opinion Programme found that more than 45 per cent of residents identify themselves purely as Hong Kongers - the highest level in 15 years of asking - compared with less than 20 per cent who see themselves solely as Chinese citizens. (The rest saw themselves as either "Hong Kong Chinese" or "Chinese Hong Kongers.")
Beijing first relaxed restrictions and began encouraging mainlanders to visit Hong Kong in 2003, as part of an effort to rescue Hong Kong's economy after it was devastated that year by the SARS outbreak.
Few disagree that the influx of Chinese tourists has bolstered the local economy. But many say the costs to the way Hong Kongers live outweigh the financial benefits. Cross-border shoppers snapping up luxury goods are tolerated, but many here complain that medicines, milk powder and the popular Yakult brand of yogurt have occasionally become scarce as mainland Chinese - responding to worries about the reliability of products on their own store shelves - bulk-buy basic goods in Hong Kong and then sell them for a profit back home.
The shoppers have transformed historic neighbourhoods like Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Shui, as local chains like cosmetics retailer Sa Sa International and jewellery giant Chow Sang Sang jostle for space with foreign brands like Zara and H & M, as well as supersized Watsons and Mannings drugstores. Causeway Bay, once a fishing village on Hong Kong Island, is now the world's third-most expensive shopping strip by cost of retail space, after Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and the Champs-élysees in Paris.
Many larger stores have signs only in the simplified Chinese characters used on the Mandarin-speaking mainland, rather than the traditional characters used in Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong.
Mainland property speculators are also blamed for skyrocketing real-estate prices in many districts of Hong Kong. "Twenty per cent of the flats sold this year were bought by mainland residents," said Mr. Tam, the environmentalist. "Meanwhile, I cannot afford to buy anything with my teacher's salary."
The 30,000 mainland Chinese mothers who sneaked into Hong Kong last year to give birth - thereby giving their children Hong Kong passports and access to the city's better education and social welfare systems - fuelled more resentment. The local government has now moved to bar such trips.
Political worries remain a factor. Tens of thousands of Hong Kongers took to the streets this summer to successfully beat back a plan that would have seen pro-Beijing curricula introduced in all schools.
But the anti-mainland protests could also be held up as proof that "one country, two systems" is working. First demonstrators pushed the government to crack down on the mainland mothers, then they defeated the patriotic education program.
"People power is working," said Chin Wan, a professor at Lingnan University who founded the Hong Kong City-State Autonomy Movement, the group that started waving the controversial old flag (identical to the colonial banner, but without the Union Jack in the corner). "When Hong Kong people gather and go into the streets and demand their rights, [Beijing] has no way to answer, because we're only demanding rights that are already granted to us under our Basic Law."

Primates in the office
Chester Zoo has started opening its cages to local businesses so they can observe the beasts, then ape their behaviour in the boardroom in the first management course of its kind in Britain, BBC News reports. "Leading a group of business people around the zoo, Dutch biologist-turned-leadership-expert Patrick van Veen explains they are taught how primitive behaviour is still alive and well in the workplace. By observing monkeys and apes, the premise is that they will start to understand their colleagues better, he says." Van Veen, whose first job was with an insurance company, said he was particularly inspired by his boss, who reminded him of a gorilla.
Another smoking hazard
Smoking is a major hazard to your health - even when the cigarettes are imaginary, reports Associated Press. An intoxicated patient at the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor started a fire Saturday night when he attempted to light up a cigarette that didn't actually exist. The patient, whose name has not been released, "thought he had [a cigarette]," said the university's public safety spokeswoman Diane Brown, and he ended up setting his bedding on fire. A nurse successfully put out the blaze before it spread.
Upstairs, downstairs 2012
"Amanda Jones, a real estate agent from San Francisco, toured her house one day last month and counted the number of people she was paying to take care of her. There were seven," says The Huffington Post. "April, the dog walker, was in the kitchen picking up Speedy and Willis - Jones's miniature dachshunds - for their $35 walk. Up in the master bedroom, Christina, Jones's $50-an-hour closet organizer, was strategizing with Jackie, her $200-an-hour personal stylist, about what to buy at the Container Store (Jackie's assistant was there, too, built into the hourly rate). Meanwhile, two men were installing new windows in Jones's bedroom, but she hadn't hired them herself - she hired someone else to hire them. They came with rave reviews from Carrie Starner Keenan, a lifestyle management concierge who co-ordinates home contracting projects, plans events and secures the most elusive reservations at the best vineyards in wine country for $75 an hour."
Big, deep voices
"In the 18th century, whalers who heard whales singing beneath their ships believed they were listening to the souls of drowned men," says a Guardian blog. "The notion of the silent ocean having a voice seemed so improbable. It wasn't until the Second World War and the advent of underwater acoustics that science discovered how vocal whales really are. Initially, it was thought that these sounds were seismic shifts in tectonic plates. Only later was it realized that cetaceans such as blue, fin and sperm whales were the loudest animals on Earth. A fin whale vocalizing on one side of the Atlantic can be heard by another fin whale on the other side of the ocean."
A car alarm that nags
In 1996, Passtime, a manufacturer of car alarms in Littleton, Col., was asked by a car dealer if it could make a gadget that could monitor "credit-challenged" car buyers, reports KDVR.com. "The device they came up with is quite simple. It's installed like a car alarm, and a series of beeps reminds car owners when their payment is past due. Say you haven't made your car payment for a couple of days. You would hear a beep when you start your car and when you turn it off that would last for about 20 seconds. And if you wait too long to submit your payment, you'll hear a different beep. This one means your car has been shut down remotely."
Thought du jour
"I was brought up to believe that how I saw myself was more important than how others saw me."
Anwar al-Sadat
President of Egypt (1918-81)

Canucks max out to buy in Brooklyn

Author: Gold, Kerry

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/canucks-max-out-buy-brooklyn/docview/1113535621/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Mr. [Rodney Hynes] and Mr. [Thomas Hunt] had almost paid off their Vancouver home but chose to mortgage it to the max so they could own the brownstone clear title.

Full text:   Rodney Hynes and Thomas Hunt have plowed the equity they've built up in their Vancouver home into a U.S. real estate play
kgold@globeandmail.com
Meet Rodney Hynes and Thomas Hunt, Vancouver owners of a new brownstone in Brooklyn, N.Y.
"We'd like to thank the over-priced Vancouver real estate market for making it possible," says Mr. Hynes, dryly.
Mr. Hynes, who works for Aboriginal Affairs, bought a house on Vancouver's east side with Mr. Hunt, a TV producer, nine years ago. They purchased the house, which needed a $200,000 renovation, for $268,000. According to a recent appraisal, it's worth $850,000.
They purchased the three-unit brownstone, in the up-and-coming area of Bedford-Stuyvesant, for $725,000 (U.S.), by re-mortgaging their Vancouver house for around 80 per cent of its value. Because the Brooklyn property will bring in rental revenue of $7,000 U.S. per month, their mortgage and other expenses will be more than covered.
Full disclosure: I've known these guys through friends and media connections for a number of years. They are a perfect example of Vancouver buyers who were initially reluctant to jump into the market, but once in, soon embraced the seemingly endless ride, as, year after year, the value of their home climbed. They were smart, or lucky enough, not to lock into a five-year rate, but instead went with a variable rate so low that they rapidly paid down a hefty chunk of their principal. It meant they were sitting with a lot of equity, and they became eager to use it toward another purchase.
You won't hear the Suze Ormans of the world advising consumers to mortgage one's home to the max. Most every money expert will tell the average middle-income earner to pay down the mortgage, not borrow further on it.
Mr. Hynes and Mr. Hunt had almost paid off their Vancouver home but chose to mortgage it to the max so they could own the brownstone clear title. I spoke to a few Century 21 realtors in Vancouver and Toronto who help clients liaise with realtors south of the border, so they can work their way into the U.S. market. When I ran the idea of maxing one's mortgage to make a U.S. purchase possible, the realtors weren't so sure they'd personally go that far.
Mr. Hynes and Mr. Hunt say they have already endured shocked reactions from friends, of the "are you crazy?" variety. But the couple regularly travel to New York, and one day, when they've paid down the mortgage, they will reserve one of the small suites for themselves, as a pied-à-terre.
"Canadians are very conservative, especially around matters of money," says Mr. Hynes.
Says Mr. Hunt: "What's interesting is when you go to New York and you're doing what we're doing, you see it's as normal as can be. There are people from all around the world purchasing real estate, and being entrepreneurial about it.
"We're not worried."
Mr. Hynes and Mr. Hunt aren't alone in their quest for U.S. real estate. Over all, foreign purchases of U.S. properties have gone up 24 per cent in the past year, according to a recently released report by the American National Association of Realtors (NAR). Canadians are, by far, the greediest buyers. We account for 24 per cent of the foreign sales stateside in the last year. Meanwhile, the second-biggest buyer, China, is responsible for 11 per cent of sales. Toronto realtor Paul Indrigo said he relies on such stats to help Canadians find properties in popular hot spots in Florida, California and Arizona.
But it's not a straightforward process to purchase an American investment or holiday property that's nowhere close to home.
If Mr. Hynes and Mr. Hunt want to renovate, which they do, their property management company will have to hire contractors. To do the work themselves would require a work visa. As well, non-residents of the U.S. are expected to pay a 30 per cent withholding tax on gross rental income - unless, of course, they find an accountant who can help them file the forms that will save them from having to take such a hit. Fortunately, there are local accounting firms who've become expert in U.S. tax laws and one of them, a Surrey firm, helped guide Mr. Hynes and Mr. Hunt.
"There will be challenges every step of the way," says Mr. Hunt. "Taxes are huge. Expenses are really high. Insurance is high. Water has to be paid for separately. We have to budget for maintenance."
And the vacancy rate isn't the same as Vancouver, adds Mr. Hynes. In an up-and-coming neighbourhood like Bed-Stuy, they say demand is so much lower that people might not show up for an open house on a rainy day.
However, compared to Vancouver, the New York market is a breeze, says Mr. Hunt.
"We spent two years looking for a house in Vancouver, and the fact that we survived a sellers' market here meant we didn't freak out about the New York purchase.
"The market in Vancouver was way more intense."

Full text:   An attic-to-basement basement renovation leaves the bones of this brick and stone farmhouse in place
The listing
Asking Price: $1.75-million
Taxes: $4,721 (2011)
Agent: Colin Byrne (Re/Max Hallmark Realty Ltd.)
The back story
Actually, this heritage home has two back stories. In 1802, Andrew Thomson, brother of Scarborough's first European settler, David Thomson (after which Thomson Park is named), purchased a huge parcel of land. In 1839, his son, James A., acquired it and tucked this two-and-a-half-storey "Romantic style" farmhouse, known as Springfield, into a natural slope for heating and cooling purposes; because of this, the rear elevation reads as one-and-a-half storeys. According to the historical plaque outside, (placed by the Scarborough Historical Society in 1979) Springfield is the "oldest brick dwelling in Scarborough," although the first storey/basement was built with local stone. Symmetrical window and door placements are somewhat Georgian, a wide, wraparound porch features decorative "trelliages," and the original, freestanding root house remains.
Springfield remained in Thomson family hands until 1965.
Forty-five years later, Kyle Raino, a 37-year-old employee of Lewitt Construction, came across the home, which had been vacant for almost two years.
While his first plan was to renovate and move in with his wife, he admits this would have been a "financial no-no," so he decided to embark on a full restoration and modernization with Lewitt Construction president Ed O'Flanagan as partner. Since Lewitt had done work on heritage properties such as the Enoch Turner Schoolhouse, Queen's Park and the George Brown house, it was a good fit.
What's new
"We've done absolutely everything," says Mr. Raino with a sweep of the hands, listing behind-the-scenes items such as plumbing, electrical and the attic's Spacepak heating and cooling unit, as well as in-your-face stuff such as the open floor plan, widened staircase and the modern 12-by-36-foot rear addition that allows for an office, mudroom and breakfast nook on the main floor and a large master bedroom and en suite above.
However, he's quick to point out that "the bones" are original. This includes the wonderfully warped, wide-plank cedar floors on the main and second levels (some of it was hiding under mid-twentieth century thin-strip oak flooring), the fully restored decorative woodwork crowning the wraparound veranda, the heritage windows - which he's christened "Frankenwindows" because of all the parts it took to restore them - and the gorgeous exposed-brick interior wall that separates the old house from the addition. Along with original window openings, this wall has initials scratched into it to remind homeowners that it was once outside.
The state-of-the-art kitchen features a massive slab of statuario marble (a clever illusion, there's an undetectable seam where it's joined to engineered stone underneath), cabinetry that's "a little traditional," and nice 1930s-ish subway tile. "It's a mishmash, and part of the reason we were totally fine with doing that is the architect of this house [did] a mishmash of styles from the 1840s: some say it's Romantic, some say it's Georgian, it goes on and on."
In the newly-dug-down basement, an acid-stained concrete floor provides the canvas for what can become a games room or fifth bedroom, and the family room boasts the home's second fireplace with a mantle made from the original 40-foot-long structural beam: "We cut a chunk out of it because it just looked so cool," laughs Mr. Raino. Another area, he suggests, might become a wine or single malt storage room.
Best feature
While it's hard to beat the unobstructed view of Thomson Park across the street, Mr. Raino loves the little touches that help marry old to new, such as the reclaimed cedar floors that the team "searched high and low" for to ensure the addition wouldn't be jarring.
He also loves that a former owner of the home dropped by to give him a gift: an 1847 bible that once belonged to James A. Thomson's son, James George Thomson, which will be given to the home's new owners.

Full text:   A Waterloo couple cherish their 1950s bungalow. 'Sweating the small stuff' has brought it back to mint condition
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
The first hint is the minimalist landscaping.
Next, the slim, brushed-metal house numbers, followed by an original front door sporting a tidy column of square windows against a jaunty lime-green backdrop.
But push the doorbell and four muffled, familiar notes - "Meet-the-Jet-sons" - twinkle inside.
Meet the Stadus family of Waterloo: R.J., Mary, both 44, and Monty, a two-year-old Norwich terrier; more dedicated mid-century modern aficionados would be difficult to find in southwestern Ontario.
While this story begins with how they rescued this 1956 house in Waterloo's desirable Westmount neighbourhood from decades of neglect, it doesn't end there.
"I used to jog past this house all the time," says Mr. Stadus, who, in 2005, lived about a kilometre away in an early-eighties "faux colonial" that was big enough to house the couple's marketing business and extended visits from family members, plus featured "certain rooms I would go into every few weeks and think 'Oh, I haven't seen this room in a while,'" he said.
The couple was drawn, however, to the smaller 1956 house's clean lines, low profile and gentle placement on the large lot so when the "For Sale" sign appeared, they immediately arranged to get inside. Halfway through their walkthrough, they decided to purchase, despite the growing list of projects they'd tallied inside and the wildly overgrown English garden outside.
They didn't waste any time: "When the [old] owners were driving out when we took possession, we had our landscaper drive up behind them," he laughs. Everything, except the two mature trees in front yard, was carted away. "We bought a bunch of old Sunset magazines from the period and said, 'Okay, how would they have landscaped it back in the day?' "
They read articles by the esteemed American landscape architect Garrett Eckbo, who studied under Bauhaus master Walter Gropius at Harvard in the late 1930s.
They sweated the small stuff, too: the "curlicue things" sandwiched between the three sets of twin posts holding up the covered walkway to the front door were sacrificed to the Modernist Gods - "That was a happy day," jokes Ms. Stadus - and unattractive house numbers were jettisoned.
Inside, everything except the kitchen - which wasn't to their taste but had been renovated so recently they didn't have the heart to tear it out - was brought back to the studs. Failing windows were replaced, bathrooms renovated, and the second-largest bedroom was converted to a dressing room complete with vanity. Hulking ductwork in the walkout basement was replaced to gain ceiling height so the couple could place their business there.
Much of the furniture was replaced with mid-century classics - an Isamu Noguchi coffee table, a Saarinen dining set, a teak bed - and a local artist was commissioned to create a large painting inspired by Karl Benjamin's work for the living room. At some point after that, the Jetsons doorbell was installed.
Dedication. Modernist gods appeased. But that's nothing compared to what came next.
A neighbour revealed his wife had grown up in the house; even better, he offered to arrange for his mother-in-law to visit, since she'd had the house built and could answer many questions. "And we were all over that," says Ms. Stadus .
It took a year to arrange, but when the octogenarian came over, the couple learned a lot more than which rooms had been kids' bedrooms and the colour of carpeting: They learned the house had been built from plans purchased from Better Homes & Gardens in 1955 ... or thereabouts.
They went to the library to search for the little advertisement she must have clipped. Hours, patience and reels of microfiche were exhausted. Eyes grew bleary. And then they saw it.
The house was the cover story. The accompanying article, "The house of seven children ... and tranquil parents," placed the original home in Golden Valley, Minn., and named Carl Graffunder, who also studied under Gropius, as architect. Needless to say, when they got home they hit eBay for the issue; it now hangs in their basement hallway.
That's not all. Mr. Graffunder was still alive, so they wrote him a letter, which began: "We're writing to tell you that we live in a house you designed and we love it!" Three months later, during breakfast, the phone rang; the 90-something architect took Mr. Stadus by surprise: "It's like when you're in high school and your date comes to the door and you're not ready," he says, feigning panic.
While he "missed all kinds of opportunities to ask him some great questions," a detailed letter arrived from Mr. Graffunder's daughter, Sybil, a little while later. Also an architect, she told the couple of her father's "primary influences," which were "the work of Antonin Raymond and Japanese architecture." She compared the magazine house with their Waterloo version and set their minds at ease on some points, concluding with: "It's been fun writing about these things."
That was a few years ago.
Last week, members of Waterloo's municipal heritage committee visited. They think the house might be a shoo-in for designation. If so, it'll be Waterloo's first mid-century modern listing.
"We see what's going on in the neighbourhood with some of these houses," Mr. Stadus said. "The character of the neighbourhood is beginning to get lost, and that really saddens us."
Modernist gods happy.

Indulging a passion for fashion

Abstract: "It crystallized for us," recalls Candace Thomas about how quickly it all came together when they discovered this summer the store was for sale. The former owner wasn't into women's fashion, but liked the real estate. "We did say 'now or never. Are we going do this? Are we going to seize our destiny?'"

Full text:   It was over Cosmopolitans and some channelling of Oprah that the three high-powered professional women in Halifax discovered they had a common interest other than the law: They all harboured dreams of being in the fashion business.
And now, just months since their epiphany, the stylish troika, plus another Nova Scotian who now lives in Toronto, own Mills Brothers - the iconic Halifax department store that has been selling high-end women's fashions, cosmetics, perfume and lots of gloves to well-heeled women since 1919.
This tribe of women retailers moves quickly.
"It crystallized for us," recalls Candace Thomas about how quickly it all came together when they discovered this summer the store was for sale. The former owner wasn't into women's fashion, but liked the real estate. "We did say 'now or never. Are we going do this? Are we going to seize our destiny?'"
Thomas and her co-owners, Lisa Gallivan and Deanne MacLeod, are partners at one of Halifax's large law firms, Stewart McKelvey. They graduated from Dalhousie University's law school and have been practising for more than 15 years.
The fourth woman, Katharine Perry, is a physiotherapist with a background in business. She lives in Toronto but grew up in Amherst, N.S., and has been best friends with MacLeod since they were 5.
Only MacLeod, who just turned 42, will reveal her age. (That's because, she says, she's the youngest.) The others allow they are "fortysomething." There are a couple of husbands among them, who are not involved in the store. Three of the women have children; Perry does not.
They are boisterous, they laugh a lot and they talked over each other as they sat down for an interview this week. And they acknowledge that although they have little experience with retail fashion - except that they all love to shop - they are counting on safety in numbers. There has to be for their plan to work: None of the women are planning to leave their day jobs.
"I think our strengths overlap," says Gallivan, who practises labour and employment law. She, along with MacLeod, who buys businesses as part of her practice, and Perry all have MBAs. Thomas, who specializes in business law, also has a diploma in fashion merchandising from the Fashion Institute of Canada.
They are planning to leave the day-to-day operations to the store manager but all will be involved with the buying of clothing and accessories. In addition, they are working with designers on their new space. And Perry will be doing some "retail research" for them in Toronto.
It was at Gallivan's house after a partner's meeting one night about six months ago that the three lawyers talked about what they would do if they didn't practise law. That's when the passion for fashion came up.
"It was the first time I said that out loud to anybody," recalled Gallivan. Said Thomas: "I went home thinking about Oprah: 'Live your best life. Do the things that you want to do.'"
Several days later they got together again, wondering if each one was serious. A few months later, they heard Mills was for sale and jumped at the opportunity.
For three of the women, Mills was the fancy department store where their mothers and grandmothers shopped for that extra-special gift, or quality coat.
However, for Thomas, who grew up for a time in the African-Nova Scotia community of East Preston with 11 siblings and a single mother, Mills was not a place where her family shopped. She knew of it because a woman in her community was a seamstress there.
Now she and her partners have bought the Mills name and the contents of the nearly 8,000 square foot store. They are keeping the manager and the 13 other staff members, but they did not buy the Mills Tudor-style building. Instead, the women are redeveloping a 9,000 square foot space just a few doors down from where Mills is now.
They purchased Mills from a local developer, who had significantly scaled down the original department store from 37,000 square feet. He had purchased the store in 2007 for about $8-million, according to allnovascotia.com, the respected online business journal in the province.
They will not say how much they paid for the store or if they all put in equal shares. However, they say they all have an equal voice in the partnership.
Their dream is to bring a new modern focus to the fairly traditional store, and bring in new contemporary brands so that women don't have to leave the province to find an interesting cocktail dress, business suit or a great pair of shoes. MacLeod characterizes this as "fine-tuning" Mills - taking its established brand and history and moving it forward.
Until their new space is ready, the store will stay open in its present location with the four helping to work the floor on the weekends. They were there the day the deal closed on Sunday, introducing themselves to customers.
Retail consultant Wendy Evans, president of Toronto-based Evans and Company Consultants Inc., who has shopped at Mills, calls this is a "great move on their part."
"They wanted to preserve what is obviously a great name," says Evans, adding that "what is needed in pretty much every major market across Canada is a place where you can buy up-market ... fashion in a nice environment."

Business, political elite flaunt success with mistresses

Author: MacKinnon, Mark

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/business-political-elite-flaunt-success-with/docview/1112664207/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: What about "erye," or "second men"? Ms. [Li] said that while Chinese society tolerates powerful men keeping mistresses, the reverse is still frowned upon and a Chinese businesswoman would probably seek to conceal an affair she was having outside her marriage. "It's a male-oriented society," Ms. Li said. "Men are expected to like sex, but women are not."

Full text:   Powerful men in China said to accumulate women the same way they desire money and power
The accusations against Bo Xilai are serious enough - massive corruption, abuse of power, helping to cover up a murder - that the fallen star of China's Communist Party is likely going to jail for a long time.
But the official Xinhua newswire added one more titillating allegation to the list when it passed judgment on the disgraced Mr. Bo late last month: that he also had "improper sexual relationships with a number of women."
The Communist Party, in attacking Mr. Bo for his supposed infidelity, was only following the script from political purges past, destroying the outcast morally as well as legally. Though Mr. Bo was once the darling of China's neo-Maoist "new left" movement, there are few who would publicly declare their support for him now.
If Mr. Bo had numerous mistresses, as Xinhua implied, the news would shock few people here. For China's business and political elite, keeping multiple mistresses - and doing little, if anything, to hide it - is as much a part of the package as the bling watches, the flashy sports cars and the offspring attending expensive Western universities.
China's top sexologist calls it the "emperor complex" and says powerful Chinese men seek to accumulate women the same way they desire money and power.
"I think it mainly comes form the Chinese tradition of having concubines. Monogamy has only been around for 60 years. But in history, there was nothing wrong with [having mistresses] at all," said Li Yinhe of the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. "Now successful men take mistresses - I would even call it a subculture - as a way of showing off their success."
In advance of Mr. Bo's trial - expected some time this fall or early next year - the guessing game in Beijing is just how many mistresses he will be accused of having. When Liu Zhijun, the former Railways Minister, was ousted last year in another corruption scandal, it was reported in state news media that he had been seeing 18 women on the side. Another famously corrupt official in coastal Fujian province once forced his 22 mistresses to publicly compete against each other for his affections.
Rumours of philandering followed Mr. Bo throughout his career, going back to when he was the mayor of the coastal city of Dalian. Jiang Weiping, a journalist who was jailed in 2000 after reporting on corruption in Dalian at the time, said he believes Mr. Bo had "not less than 100" mistresses.
"Dalian held an International Fashion Festival during his term. There were many actresses who came to Dalian for it - singers, movie stars, sports stars, etc. Bo had high tastes," Mr. Jiang, who now lives in Toronto, said in a telephone interview. In return, Mr. Jiang said, Mr. Bo showered the women with real estate, cash and other gifts. "It's not just him. It's very common with local [Communist Party] leaders."
Indeed, a 2007 report prepared for China's top prosecutor drew a direct line between marital indiscretions and misbehaviour in office. Almost 90 per cent of the officials who had been sacked for corruption over the previous five years had mistresses, the report found, with "some keeping several."
Hong Kong media have alleged links between Mr. Bo and movie star Zhang Ziyi, reporting she was paid $1-million per encounter to sleep with him. Ms. Zhang has angrily denied the stories and is suing the websites that published the story. Her lawyer says the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon actress has never met Mr. Bo, but has lost $750,000 in work because of the whiff of scandal.
Part of the reason many were willing to believe the tale is the everyday nature of extramarital affairs in China. "I have heard of businessmen who take their mistresses to attend a friend's party, rather than their wives," Ms. Li, the sexologist, said.
With divorce rates in the country at an all-time high, some women believe its time to challenge society's acceptance of men keeping mistresses, who are colloquially known here as "ernai," or "second nipples."
When Xin Ya, a 40-year-old divorcee from the port city of Xiamen founded what she called the Anti-Mistress Association last summer, tens of thousands of Chinese women tried to join it in the first week alone. "We wanted to unite all forces in society against mistresses outside the marriage, and violence inside the marriage, and to help members protect their marital rights," said Wu Hen, a psychologist who volunteers with the group.
The anti-mistress campaign quickly made some powerful enemies, however, and the organization later sought a lower profile and changed its name to the Marriage Defence Association. "Criticizing the mistresses started a new cycle of hurt. Many people were angry and complained about us. Our staff has been threatened. My car was even [run into] once and I think I know who did it," Mr. Wu said.
A television talk show that tried to tackle what Mr. Wu calls the mistress "phenomenon" was recorded but never broadcast, he said, because a rich businessman whose jilted wife wanted to speak out used his influence to prevent it from being shown.
Some argue it's time to embrace the third wheel in such relationships. For the past two years, another online support group - the China Mistress Association - has sought to have March 3 (the third day of the third month) added to the calendar as Mistress Day.
And what about "erye," or "second men"? Ms. Li said that while Chinese society tolerates powerful men keeping mistresses, the reverse is still frowned upon and a Chinese businesswoman would probably seek to conceal an affair she was having outside her marriage. "It's a male-oriented society," Ms. Li said. "Men are expected to like sex, but women are not."

Full text:   British group to build designer outlet mall on land leased by Vancouver Airport to capitalize on travellers who love to shop
Airports have become the stealth shopping malls of the 21st century, with proliferating acres of restaurants, massage-therapy centres and stores selling perfume, technology, luggage and books.
Now, the Vancouver International Airport is on the verge of seeing a stand-alone mall constructed on its land - what appears to be a first for North America.
And not just any mall. A 460,000-square-foot luxury outlet mall is going through the planning arm of the Vancouver Airport Authority, which is exploiting two airport trends.
One is an increased interest from Canadian airports in maximizing the value of their leased federal land. The other is shoppers' growing willingness to drop large sums of money on shopping at airports around the world.
The proposed Vancouver airport mall is also a new move for British-based McArthurGlen Group, which revolutionized the European designer-mall world 20 years ago by providing upscale settings for designer-label-mad bargain hunters.
It currently has 21 designer outlets in eight countries, where the malls are built to replicate local architecture and design features. In the mall outside Hamburg, which opened in September, there are faux half-timbered houses and Germanic town plazas. In the mall outside Venice are mosaics and frescoes inspired by the palazzos of that nearby city, the company says.
McArthurGlen has about 100 high-end brands it mixes in different quantities in its malls, including Bottega Veneta, Fendi, Paul Smith and Prada.
The company's European malls are often near airports, but not right on their land, said McArthurGlen's managing director of development, Gary Bond, in a phone interview from London.
The unique Vancouver opportunity appeared on the company's radar by chance - one where the city's function as a resort community paid off.
A company founder, Alan Glen, has houses around the world, including one in Vancouver. He saw a local advertisement from the airport authority, inviting development proposals for its land.
Plenty of factors made Vancouver a good fit: A huge contingent of Asian visitors, renowned around the world for their propensity for high spending on luxury goods. An equally big contingent of nearby local shoppers. No other outlet malls in the vicinity (the nearest at the moment is across the U.S. border, two hours from Vancouver). A spectacular natural setting, without too much of the industrial development that usually dominates near airports.
"It ticked off all the boxes. Forty per cent of Richmond is Asian and there are millions of [Asian] visitors. They're so brand conscious. But it's also just the wealth of the local population. It's a wealthy city."
There was one more huge attraction.
"We found out they have their own planning authority," Mr. Bond said. In Europe, it can take up to six years to get approvals for one of the company's malls due to complex local approvals processes and resistance from local retailers.
In Vancouver, the company approached the airport less than a year ago. Airport authority president Larry Berg announced the planned mall in June. It's expected to be open by the fall of 2014.
"It was easy to work with them," Mr. Bond said. Now the company is seeing offers come in from airport authorities around the globe, from other Canadian cities to the United Arab Emirates.
Toronto isn't one of them, though. The Greater Toronto Airports Authority is also looking to maximize the revenue it gets from its land. Last year, it developed a real-estate plan that outlined what kinds of development it would pursue that would fit with the airport.
It recently concluded a deal with a developer who is going to build an industrial facility for the kind of company that would benefit from being able to get its products to the airport quickly. But it's not going for just any kind of development opportunity.
"We have not identified an outlet mall as being one of them," said Pat Garisto, the authority's development manager. "We look at what the community need is and the fact that it's an industrial zone. We have outlet malls very close by. Why would we compete?"
That thorny question has been raised in Vancouver, where the plan for an airport mall raised huge public interest, but also strong concerns earlier this year from the closest municipality, Richmond, and Metro Vancouver, the regional authority, which is focused on trying to shape land use and prevent sprawl.
Both Richmond Mayor Malcolm Brodie and Metro senior planner Gaetan Royer raised questions about why the airport would go into the business of mall development.
Mr. Brodie said the mall, then proposed for a corner of the airport's 1,340-hectare lands that was the closest to Richmond's rapidly developing downtown, went against his city's concept of trying to concentrate local retail into a town centre that was easily accessible by transit.
Since then, the airport and McArthurGlen have looked at shifting the mall location to a site next to a stop on the rapid-transit line that runs from the airport through Vancouver to downtown. Authority spokeswoman Rebecca Catley said that a significant proportion of the public wanted a mall that people could get to on the Canada Line. The first mall site would have required them either to drive or take a shuttle from a Canada Line stop.
The tempting reality for all airports is that shoppers are dropping increasing amounts of money at what used to be just waiting rooms for planes.
Vancouver just brought in a World Duty Free outlet, another European retail concept that focuses on super-luxury products.
"We know people come out here because they just have an interest in airports," Ms. Catley said. They're not flying anywhere. They are simply attracted to the bustle and the shopping that airports now offer.

Lithuanian voters toss out austerity government

Full text:   Lithuania's opposition prepared to take power on Monday after voters rejected the austerity-minded government, a foretaste of what may await other European leaders forced to make unpopular cuts by the financial crisis.
An ex-Soviet state of about three million people, Lithuania crashed hard when the crisis hit four years ago. It slashed spending in response and is now returning to economic health - but too late for voters fed up with belt-tightening.
An exit poll after a parliamentary election on Sunday showed Lithuanians had thrown out centre-right Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius in favour of a coalition of left-leaning opposition parties who promise to soften the austerity.
The government of the Baltic nation lost out despite winning praise from big European powers and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its thrift and discipline.
"If the IMF was voting then he [the Prime Minister] would be re-elected," said Kestutis Girnius, who teaches at the Institute for International Relations and Political Science in Vilnius.
"But the IMF does not live in Lithuania, and they could not live on a Lithuanian salary."
As one of the European Union states most severely hit by the crisis, and one of the fastest to implement austerity, Lithuania is a bellwether for governments in Greece, Spain, Ireland and elsewhere, who are being forced to make similar drastic cuts.
The RAIT/BNS exit poll gave the biggest share of the vote, 19.8 per cent, to the Labour Party. The centre-left Social Democrats, likely coalition partner for Labour, were second with 17.8 per cent and the Prime Minister's Homeland Union was in third place with 16.7 per cent.
Partial official results, based on the votes that have been counted so far, ranked the parties in the same order.
The final shape of the next government will not be clear until talks take place on forming a coalition. It may come down to a second round, to take place in two weeks, which will settle races in local districts where no candidate had a clear lead. The Prime Minister said he would fight on into the run-off round, but it appeared unlikely he would be able to stay in power, after voters held him accountable for the tough decisions he took to drag Lithuania out of crisis.
"What kind of crisis management are we talking about?" asked Alfonsus Spudys, 78, on his way out of a polling station on Sunday in the capital, Vilnius. "They scythed people down ... and now they are saying they handled the crisis really well."
Before the financial crash in 2008, Lithuania was booming. Scandinavian banks provided cheap credit that let the country buy more than it sold and over-heated the real estate market. When the crisis struck, the banks stopped lending. Economic output dropped by 15 per cent in 2009. Unemployment shot up. Thousands of young Lithuanians went abroad to seek work.
Mr. Kubilius, elected after the crisis began, cut pensions and public-sector wages. To save money, only every third street lamp in Vilnius was lit, and fuel for police cars was rationed.

Full text:   He had a Midas touch in real estate and donated 75 per cent of his fortune to organizations such as the AGO and National Ballet
What makes the Walter Carsen story so compelling is the sheer complexity of the man. He was best known as one of Canada's more beloved philanthropists. As a businessman, he could seal a multi million-dollar deal with a handshake. He was the epitome of Old World charm and continental sophistication, well-versed in politics, economics and the arts. The private man, however, was deeply conflicted. As daughter Johanni Carsen says: "My father's life was one of outer calm and inner drama."
Carsen was a serial philanthropist who tended to be loyal to one art form at a time. His funding corresponded to the specific needs of an organization. He subsidized the refurbishment of the Shaw Festival's Royal George Theatre and helped to build the Christopher's Loft rehearsal space. He gave the Art Gallery of Ontario the Walter Carsen Reading Room in its new reference library. He was the lead donor for the National Ballet of Canada's new home, the Walter Carsen Centre. The Dancer Transition Resource Centre was also very important to him because it helped former dancers find new careers. He also sponsored Canada's National Ballet School's artist-in-residence program. According to his son, while most philanthropists give away 5 per cent of their fortunes, Carsen gave away more than 75 per cent. "With my father, it wasn't the tip of the iceberg," says Robert Carsen. "It was the iceberg."
It was his affinity for the arts that became the cornerstone of his extraordinary philanthropy. The art galleries of Ontario, Hamilton, Windsor, St. Catharines and Oshawa, the Shaw Festival, Canadian Opera Company, and the National Ballet of Canada are among the many organizations that benefited from Carsen's largesse. In 2001, he donated $1.1-million to the Canada Council to establish the Walter Carsen Prize for Excellence in the Performing Arts that recognizes distinguished lifetime careers in dance, theatre and music. He also was a great humanitarian. Carsen was so upset reading about street people dying in the cold that he set up the Walter Carsen Fund for the Homeless within the United Way.
Carsen was born in 1912 into a family of assimilated Jews in Cologne, Germany. His father died when he was six, and he was adopted by his stepfather, a famous lawyer. Although Carsen would have preferred to study medicine, he trained in the law out of respect for his stepfather. In 1938, Carsen went to London to avoid Nazi persecution while his older brother, Kurt, went to Uruguay. His parents ultimately fled to the Netherlands, but were transported to Auschwitz where they died. "Walter's way of dealing with bad things was silence," his late wife Clementine once said in an interview. "I went along with his refusal to talk about the past because it was his protective shell."
In 1940, Carsen was arrested as an enemy alien even though he was a Jewish refugee. When Eric Koch was writing his 1980 book Deemed Suspect: A Wartime Blunder, about the mostly German Jews the British sent to prison camps in Canada, Carsen refused to be interviewed. His inability to come to terms with the Holocaust continued throughout his life. In fact, when asked about his background, he would describe himself as "European."
One way out of the camps was to help in the war effort and, in 1943, Carsen got a job in Toronto grinding optical lenses - while in Britain, he and a partner had opened a business that imported optical instruments.
He also met Clementine Nalm, his future wife and a fellow German Jewish refugee, in a local restaurant after a proms concert. Although both were on dates with other people, a smitten Carsen called her the very next day. The couple married on May 1, 1943.
"Walter always felt grateful for his new life in Canada," said Clementine Carsen, who died four years ago, "and, even though we were just married, he volunteered for the army and I completely supported him in this."
On his recruitment papers for the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers he created the name Walter Carsen, and so his real surname became part of his lost history. In the process, Carsen buried his past so deeply that his children did not find out about their Jewish heritage until well into their teens, and then, only from their mother. It also led to his estrangement from his brother, although the two reconciled in later years.
As a businessman, Carsen had the uncanny knack of recognizing trends in the marketplace. He had started the import company anticipating that the British army was going to need cameras, telescopes and binoculars, and optics became the heart of his post-war corporate empire in Canada as well.
The Carsens launched their distribution business in 1946 in the basement of their small bungalow. The crowning glory for W. Carsen Co. Ltd. was becoming the exclusive Canadian representative for Olympus, the Japanese camera and optics giant, in 1949 - a business venture confirmed by a handshake. The Carsen company became known as a market leader for its top-of-the-line products, competitive pricing, and high level of service. Their imports included optical, scientific and photographic equipment, and later, a medical and survey instruments division. As Clementine Carsen said: "We handled every lens except spectacles."
After Carsen sold the business in 1962 at the age of 50, he continued his Midas touch in real estate, property development and investments.
At 17, James Vella was the company's second employee and ended up a vice-president. Money was so tight in those early days that Vella was responsible for collecting cartons at supermarkets that were used to ship the company's products. Vella also recalls how important company morale and worker dignity were to the Carsens. When he married and had children, the Carsens let him borrow the company van for personal use until he could afford a car. Every year there was party for employees that included clowns, pony rides and gifts for the children.
Initially the Carsens had decided not to have children because of their own traumatic backgrounds, but changed their minds 10 years into their marriage. Born in 1952, Johanni is a Montreal potter, art therapist and Freudian psychoanalyst. Robert arrived two years later and now, based in Europe, is one of the world's leading stage directors of opera.
After Hurricane Hazel nearly flooded the Carsen house in Hog's Hollow, the family moved to a 15-acre estate in Thornhill in 1955. The children had chores around the estate, which included polishing the sculptures in the garden. When the estate was sold, the art pieces were donated to galleries and public places across the province.
Robert remembers a home filled with art and culture, where going to museums, concerts and theatre was a priority. As parents, the Carsens were very progressive and welcoming of their children's friends. "In comparison with other fathers, mine was open-minded, funny and interesting," said Robert. Johanni talks about parents who each had very strong personalities.
"It was not the easiest marriage," she says. "My father was a womanizer, but my mother insisted that they stay together while we were growing up."
In 1975, Carsen went through what his family calls male menopause. He separated from his wife to become, in their words, a playboy with a pied-à-terre in Toronto. He would return to Thornhill on weekends. Said Mrs. Carsen: "It was almost as if he wanted to have the youth he had lost before it was too late." The couple never divorced. In later years they talked to each other on the phone almost every day and even holidayed together.
Carsen's urbane veneer hid a true eccentric. One of his favourite practical jokes, his son recalled, was to startle his family by pretending to have had an accident. Once, when he really did have a bad fall and was found bleeding and unconscious, it took awhile for them to realize it wasn't a joke. He also loved to dress up in weird ways, and walking in the street, he would often hobble, limp or stagger to the great embarrassment of his children. A boiled egg could not be decapitated before first saying "Zumzock," followed by "Zerometer," after the egg was hit. Throughout his life, Carsen spoke to animals in a special made-up language.
Among Carsen's less eccentric pursuits were tennis, gardening and exotic travel. Even into his 90s, he did yoga every morning.
Carsen's love of music began in the cultured environment of his youth - he was the grandson of a concert pianist.
His wife remembered in their early marriage spending every extra penny on concerts and records. Carsen had played in a jazz band in Germany and kept a drum set in the house. Dinner was often followed by impromptu musicals.
Carsen's philanthropy earned him many honours. In 1993, he was awarded the Paris-based Montblanc de la Culture Arts Patronage Award, and in 2002, the New York-based International Society for the Performing Arts Foundation Angel Award. In 2005, both he and son were honoured with simultaneous honorary Doctor of Law degrees by York University. The very patriotic Carsen was thrilled to be appointed a Member of the Order of Canada in 1995 and Officer in 2002. He was given the nickname "Care Bear" by his grateful tennis club in 2002 when he paid for the redesign of the garden. Being Walter (Care Bear) Carsen was something he treasured.
Late in life, the National Ballet became his obsession, and Carsen referred to the company as his family and the dancers as his children. He had an office at the ballet and would often attend rehearsals. Former National artistic director Reid Anderson calls Carsen his artistic godfather. "I was entranced by Walter," he says, "and we'd spend hours in his garden eating oysters and drinking white wine. Walter was a catalyst to get others to make donations, like offering matching grants and giving seed money. He wanted things to happen." Carsen was a man of contradictions. He was a private person who loved publicity. Despite his immense accomplishments, he possessed an innate insecurity that made him incapable of sharing the limelight. He never acknowledged that Mrs. Carsen had been a business partner, and as Robert's fame started to grow, he felt a competition with his son as to who would have the bigger name in the arts. While Carsen had difficulty with family commitments, he was extremely loyal to friends. He lived in the world of the elite but called his tennis pro, his hairdresser and the parking lot attendant his friends. He was guarded with his family, but his home was very important to him, surrounded by objects that he loved. One of his favourite expressions was: "When I am by myself, I'm in the best of company."
As Johanni says: "My father never came to terms with the bitter chapter of his past. He kept reinventing and redefining himself to conform to what he saw as his ideals, his vision and his creativity. He played by his own rules.
His was a life of discovery and getting involved. He genuinely loved artists, and the arts became his comfort because he could lose himself in their beauty."
Walter Carsen died peacefully in Toronto on Oct. 8, at the age of 100.

Abstract: While some describe the problem as the VAG outgrowing the facility, others say the design has been problematic from the start. "It's a substandard gallery," says photo-based artist [Jeff Wall]. "... I knew that when I walked into the gallery in 1983. I thought, 'They've made a huge mistake here; this is really too bad.' I thought that the first two seconds I was in the place," adds the internationally celebrated artist, who lives in Vancouver.

Full text:   Some of Canada's greatest artists are taking sides in an increasingly personal fight over the future of the Vancouver Art Gallery. Marsha Lederman reports on the players, the stakes and the dinner party smackdown that has a city talking
A letter - just a single paragraph long - began circulating by e-mail throughout the Vancouver visual-art community a few weeks ago. Sent by artist Roy Arden, with a deadline looming for a plot of city land, it calls for a "new, stand-alone, iconic building" to house the Vancouver Art Gallery, and also declares support for VAG director Kathleen Bartels and her board "as they work towards its realization." More than 200 people have since supported the letter by adding their names to a website calling for a new art gallery, among them art-world rock stars Jeff Wall, Douglas Coupland, Ken Lum and Brian Jungen.
"It seems so very uncontroversial," Wall told The Globe and Mail in a recent interview. "Why would we not want to have a purpose-, custom-built, hopefully very distinguished, beautiful building for art in this city?"
But the fight for a new VAG - a concept overwhelmingly supported by the visual-art community in an important contemporary-art city - has been anything but uncontroversial. While the public stands by, awaiting word on whether there will be a new museum to visit, the behind-the-scenes machinations have been intense at times.
There has long been a debate about whether to simply expand on the current site in the centre of downtown, as opposed to undertaking what the VAG is calling for: a move to a brand new building on a site a few blocks to the east. The letter calling for a new facility has been signed even by some who feel uncomfortable with the the mention of an "iconic" facility; some have signed it despite a hesitation to tie their support for a new VAG specifically to Bartels (not that they don't support her; they simply feel the issue is bigger than the current director).
And there has been a great deal of chatter about a conflict between Bartels and local art collector/condo marketer Bob Rennie, which has escalated in the wake of Rennie making public this summer his counterproposal for expansion of the VAG, and following a recent dinner-party incident that has had tongues wagging.
Rennie's idea - put simply, that the new VAG consist of a number of smaller facilities rather than a single building - created some heated debate. When a story about this was published in The Globe and Mail in August, some - including Arden - were upset that Rennie's vision was given so much attention. Some also made the argument that, as a marketer of condominiums, Rennie has an interest in scattering museums around the city, given the potential impact on property values.
But in Vancouver - and in contemporary-art circles that stretch far beyond the West Coast - Rennie is an important figure. Internationally, he chairs the Tate's North American Acquisitions Board. Locally, he has strong connections to City Hall and is hugely influential not just as a generous cheque-writing collector and philanthropist, but as a cultural and business leader who has an eye for art, and the ear, it seems, of just about everyone.
As government dollars become more scarce, it's hard to deny the increasing importance of this kind of private influence. But this fight for the future of a vital public institution has been compared by more than one person in the art community to something you might witness in a schoolyard. And fingers are pointing in various directions.
Challenges on all sides
The Vancouver Art Gallery is currently housed in a 1906 provincial courthouse that was renovated by Arthur Erickson Architects before its opening in 1983. People may love the location, but it's hard to find anyone in the visual-art community who thinks the space is adequate. Among their oft-cited concerns: an awkward entrance, low ceilings, small rooms, no auditorium, and environmental issues that require unsightly portable equipment in the galleries. An argument you often hear is that, because of the inadequate exhibition space, most of the collection remains hidden away in storage, which is also inadequate.
For years, Bartels has been making the case for a new building - with the public, with government and with donors.
Now, as a city-imposed February deadline approaches for the VAG to prove its case to obtain the city-owned site known as Larwill Park, Arden felt artists should have more of a voice in the debate. "Purpose-built things always function better than jerry-rigged things," wrote Arden in an e-mail to The Globe and Mail (he refused a telephone interview). "The current VAG is below par for cities of comparable size. I have been in cities one-third the size of Vancouver that have three times the art infrastructure in size and quality."
While some describe the problem as the VAG outgrowing the facility, others say the design has been problematic from the start. "It's a substandard gallery," says photo-based artist Wall. "... I knew that when I walked into the gallery in 1983. I thought, 'They've made a huge mistake here; this is really too bad.' I thought that the first two seconds I was in the place," adds the internationally celebrated artist, who lives in Vancouver.
"It just seemed like a poor plan. I don't think that the architect was really on his game for that one," he says. "People have gotten used to it, but I'm not used to it." (The Erickson point can also be touchy in Vancouver, where the architect, who died in 2009, was a hometown hero to whom some remain fiercely loyal.)
Wall remembers confronting the inadequacies of the space head-on in 1990, when preparing for an exhibition. "It was one of the worst struggles to make a half-decent show I've ever done," he says. "I don't like it and I'm not satisfied with it and I wish it wasn't our gallery. And I'm not the only one who thinks that.
As for a new building, he says, "Whether we can afford it is another question. If we can afford it, I can't think of a reason why we wouldn't want it."
Indeed, artists have lined up to support a new VAG building - at public meetings, at city council, and now online. Along with debate about the new shape such a museum would take, how to pay for it is, of course, a huge issue. Talk of a new VAG has been going on for a decade, and over that time, there has been a decline in the economy. Further, there are other cultural projects - albeit on a much smaller scale - that will be competing for capital dollars, including a proposed new Presentation House Gallery for North Vancouver.
And the ambitions for a new Vancouver Art Gallery took a hit last week when Michael Audain, a wealthy real-estate developer, philanthropist and collector, announced his intention to build a gallery in Whistler to house his own substantial collection. Audain has - along with Bartels and former VAG board chair David Aisenstat - been a driving force for a new building, functioning for a time as a spokesperson, while he served as chair of the relocation committee. Audain, who remains chair of the VAG Foundation, says he still supports a new VAG. But there is a pervasive feeling that, along with much of his art, his money will now be going north up the Sea to Sky Highway.
"Michael Audain announcing Whistler is, I believe, his recognition that Larwill Park is not going to happen," says Michael Turner, a Vancouver-based writer, critic and curator who has been closely following the saga. Or as another person, who asked not to be named, put it: "It's the last nail in the coffin" for Larwill Park.
In any case, in light of the potential challenges, and with time moving on, there is quiet talk about drifting back to the expand-on-the-current-site solution.
Turner, who, like others, signed the petition despite disagreeing with the use of the term "iconic," says that, in conversations he has been having, the feeling increasingly is that this move is not going to happen. Among the reasons he cites is Rennie's powerful position in the city, and Rennie's well-known personal disdain for Bartels.
Persona non grata
On this front, things came to a head last month during what has become a notorious dinner-party incident, related this week by Turner on his blog.
Bartels was attending a dinner, auctioned off at a Vancouver Symphony Orchestra charity event; the winning bid came from one of her board members. The dinner was at the Rennie Collection at Wing Sang, Rennie's museum. When Rennie and collection director Carey Fouks heard that Bartels was there, they rushed over to the building, and she was told to leave.
"This is the point where most people would say 'No comment.' But I'm going to make a comment," said Rennie, when reached by telephone Thursday in London, and asked about the incident.
"We donated the space to the symphony to have a dinner. We were alerted that there was a guest on our premises that emphatically knew they were not welcome - evidenced by the fact they have never been in our building since we acquired it in 2004. Like anybody else, we all protect our own home. And the shame is that potential philanthropy was put at risk by a very poor sense of judgment to even show up where one is not welcome."
Bartels "respectfully" declined a request to speak about the incident.
Has this become a distraction? Of course. The serious discussion about what is arguably the most important cultural institution in the city has veered off into the trading of juicy tidbits about a high-powered charity dinner party gone horribly wrong.
But Rennie says this isn't about personalities; it's about financial viability.
"I don't care who signs a petition; nobody is addressing what it is to spend $300- or $400-million dollars in this new economy and it is irresponsible to simply go out and say we want an iconic building," he says. "The public discussion should now be around alternative models and the tough questions that have to be asked in this new economy: Do we spend the money on art, or architecture? And how does this institution fit in with the cultural fabric of Vancouver as a whole? It cannot be talked about in isolation."
While the issues, economic and otherwise, are obviously layered and complex, Arden's desire - the desire of many in this art community - is simple: He might not have become an artist if the VAG was less than it was, he says, and each generation wants to make things better for the next.
"We don't care about gossip," he writes. "We want to see a new building for everyone to enjoy."

Abstract: One ad caught the eye of Terry Tian. He'd immigrated from China to Vancouver in 2008 and got a job working at Wok n' Roll, a fast-food outlet at the Vancouver airport. He called MaxCrop, came to visit [Ogema] and ended up buying 800 acres, borrowing $400,000 from his father who has a business in China. Mr. Tian moved to Moose Jaw last year with his wife and two children and he's now learning to farm with help from a local farmer. "I love it here," he says with a wide smile.

Full text:   At first glance, Sheldon Zou looks like any other farmer sipping coffee in the dining room of The Little Amego Inn in Ogema, Sask. He wears a rumpled hat, drives a pickup truck and talks earnestly about canola prices.
While most of the other farmers in the café have been tilling soil in the area for decades, Mr. Zou is a newcomer - to farming, to Ogema and to Canada. He immigrated from China in 2008, an entrepreneur with a background in engineering and a brief history of running a broadband company in the U.S. Mr. Zou, 40, was at loose ends at first, shuttling between Vancouver, Calgary and Toronto looking for a business opportunity. But during a drive across Saskatchewan, he became enchanted with the Prairies, and the investment possibilities of farmland.
He took the plunge a year ago, putting down $1.5-million to buy 4,000 acres near Ogema, roughly 115 kilometres south of Regina. Soon he moved to Ogema with his wife Linda, daughters Jennifer and Angela, and friend Alice Jin. Ms. Jin bought the Rolling Hills Restaurant while the Zous became farmers.
"I am still trying to buy more land," said Mr. Zou, a landed immigrant, who has rented out most of his property and farms the rest with local farmers who are teaching him the ropes. He hopes to one day manage all the land himself and to recruit more immigrants to Ogema. "I think that if I can teach basic farming to new immigrants, I see an opportunity," he said. "It's very easy for Chinese to accept this idea to buy farmland. It just makes sense."
The Zous are part of a new wave of immigrant investors who are changing the Saskatchewan's countryside. These investors, who come mainly from China, South Korea and India, are buying up farmland, often in cash, and frequently becoming landlords to dozens of local farmers.
Most are motivated by the province's booming agriculture sector and a sense that Saskatchewan farmland, while soaring in price, is still remarkably cheap. Many are also convinced that the demise of the Canadian Wheat Board's monopoly over the sale of wheat and barley will open opportunities to sell grain directly to buyers in Asia. For these investors, the plan is simple: Buy up acres of land, partner with a local farmer to grow the crops, and then ship the produce directly to customers in China. The lure is simple too: The possibility of profits from those sales to Asia, and the hope that land prices will continue to rise and drive up the value of their land assets.
That's all still a ways off, and new immigrants represent only a portion of the roughly 30,000 annual farmland sales in Saskatchewan. But real estate agents say the number of deals to non-residents has soared in the past couple of years and the influx of Chinese immigrants in particular is getting noticed.
"For farmland, especially Saskatchewan farmland, they think it is much, much undervalued," said Justin Yin, a real estate agent in Saskatoon who immigrated from China in 2004 and specializes in selling farmland to Chinese immigrants in Toronto and Vancouver. "So they think that's the best place to put their money." Mr. Yin, who also owns nearly 2,000 acres, has been in business for four months but he already has roughly 100 clients including a group of 10 investors who have put up $20-million and told him to buy whatever he can find.
The influx is creating mixed feelings in many communities. There is a long history of Chinese immigrants coming to Western Canada and good part of it is unhappy: a head tax, as well as prohibitions on voting and on owning farmland. Chinese immigrants still represent only a fraction of the province's population, but the number has been growing particularly in the past couple of years as buyers arrive by the busload to scout out farmland. While older farmers planning to retire are thrilled to have a growing pool of new potential buyers, many worry about the long-term impact of so many new immigrants arriving with little knowledge of agriculture and often overpaying for farms.
Still others wonder where all the money is coming from.
Ownership rules
Saskatchewan has the strictest rules in the country when it comes to farm ownership. Only Canadian citizens, permanent residents and 100-per-cent Canadian-owned companies are allowed to hold title to more than 10 acres of farmland. There are some exemptions and it's not clear if titleholders can be backed by foreign investors. Whatever the case, the province doesn't do much checking. Saskatchewan doesn't even keep track of the number of non-residents buying land and officials don't probe too deeply into how the transactions are financed or whether offshore investors are involved.
"We check basically what's on the title," said Mark Folk, general manager of the Saskatchewan Farmland Security Board, which regulates non-resident farmland ownership. "We do some verifications that they comply with residency [rules]. After that it's a little bit more difficult to follow up farther than that."
Mr. Folk said the board often requests passports or permanent resident cards from buyers. And in some cases it requires them to sign a declaration that they are the only owner of the land. But officials don't go much farther to look into any potential offshore arrangements. There's nothing wrong with a non-resident having a mortgage with a foreign investor, he said, but that investor cannot have an ownership interest in the property.
While the board doesn't keep statistics about non-resident purchases, Mr. Folk knows they are on the rise. "There's definitely an increase from non-Saskatchewan residents purchasing farmland in the last couple of years." However, "we don't have any information that would lead us to believe that it's not their own money."
It's easy to see why new immigrants, like many other investors, are attracted to Saskatchewan farmland. Prices in parts of the province have climbed more than 20 per cent in the past year to around $2,000 an acre, according to a recent report by Re/Max realty. Over all, the average value of farmland in Saskatchewan increased 9.1 per cent during the first half of 2012, which was above the national average, according to a report by Farm Credit Canada. With grain prices and farm incomes rising, rural land values are expected to keep going up. And yet Saskatchewan's farmland is far less expensive than comparable property in other provinces, such as Ontario or British Columbia, which have less restrictive ownership rules. Ontario farms go for up to $15,000 an acre while farms in B.C. can sell for as much as $60,000 an acre.
Buying land that's increasing in value by roughly 20 per cent annually is one thing. But many of these investors are banking on something else too. If the government ever eases its restrictions on foreign ownership, many believe farmland prices will soar. "It's a really good bet," says Tim Hammond, a real estate agent in Biggar who has done several recent deals with immigrants from China and India.
Ogema has become something of a focal point for the buying spree. Plopped along a stretch of open prairie near the U.S. border, Ogema has all the trappings of a classic Saskatchewan town; 368 people, a post office, restaurant, hotel, school, arena and a couple of shops. Many farmers in the area have been working the same land for generations, riding the vagaries of weather that can change from drought to flood in a matter of weeks. Land prices for the most part hadn't moved much in decades.
That changed a couple of years ago when Andy Hu came to town. Mr. Hu, 38, grew up on a farm in China and immigrated to Canada in 2004, launching a commercial real estate business in Calgary. After a few visits to Saskatchewan, he turned his attention to farmland and launched MaxCrop Farm Canada Inc., a Regina-based company that specializes in finding farmland investors among new immigrants from China and South Korea. "I thought [farmland] was very, very undervalued," Mr. Hu said in a recent interview. "Also at the same time I saw the strong [interest] by new Canadians to own farmland. Sometimes they come from a country where they were not allowed to own farmland."
Mr. Hu met with Ogema mayor Wayne Myren, who runs the local Napa Auto Parts store. The meeting went well and Mr. Hu returned a few weeks later with four investors, all recent arrivals from China. They too met with Mr. Myren and talked about farming, land values and the local rail line that makes shipping grain directly to Asia feasible. That became even more crucial to MaxCrop last year after the federal government announced it was ending the Wheat Board's monopoly. "Their idea was there's a link now with the Wheat Board gone, they have a flow through right through to China with grain," Mr. Myren recalled. He explained that there are half a dozen farmer-owned elevators along the line, making it relatively easy to load cars destined for ports on the West Coast. Another option is to truck grain to Regina and send it on a container car to Asia.
Within months, several MaxCrop investors began buying up farms and driving up prices, doubling values overnight in some cases. The company ran ads in local Saskatchewan papers seeking farm sellers, promising a "quick closing" and "no commission." It also puts ads in Chinese-language papers in Toronto, Vancouver and elsewhere looking for investors.
One ad caught the eye of Terry Tian. He'd immigrated from China to Vancouver in 2008 and got a job working at Wok n' Roll, a fast-food outlet at the Vancouver airport. He called MaxCrop, came to visit Ogema and ended up buying 800 acres, borrowing $400,000 from his father who has a business in China. Mr. Tian moved to Moose Jaw last year with his wife and two children and he's now learning to farm with help from a local farmer. "I love it here," he says with a wide smile. He plans to partner with MaxCrop for the long term and one day find buyers in China for his grain. "I think I've got a chance and I'm interested in doing that," he says.
Long-time local farmers like Keith Bacon are leery about all the buying. He welcomes Mr. Zou and he has met some of the MaxCrop investors. But he wonders about how much they are paying and whether they are in over their heads. "If it was great farmland they were getting, it would have been bought by locals already," Mr. Bacon said. When asked if he believes the new immigrants fully understand what they they are getting into, he replied: "No. There is some issue there."
Mayor Myren isn't so sure either. He is open to new arrivals and said Ogema has been among the few towns in Canada to market itself in China. The town has a Filipino population and counts five different languages among its tiny population. But Mr. Myren has found Mr. Hu's tactics aggressive at times and he got testy when MaxCrop put his picture on the company's website without permission.
"I don't know if it's good or bad, I honestly don't," he said when asked about the immigrant investors. But then he paused and added: "Who's going to farm the land when our generation is gone?"
MaxCrop has grown rapidly across the province since Mr. Hu's visit in 2010. The company has attracted roughly 40 investors, all new immigrants, and manages around 70,000 acres across the province. It also operates a 7,000-acre farm, with separate investors, and it is looking into acquiring processing facilities. The company's plan is to use the connections of its investors to open new markets in China and ship grain directly to buyers, via container ships. It is already working on a deal to ship malt barley grown on the MaxCrop farm to buyers in Shanghai.
"This is the next step for agriculture," said Jason Dearborn, a former provincial politician who is MaxCrop's chief operating officer. "We have Mandarin speakers and we have a vision that is going to link us into that marketplace."
Mr. Dearborn added that MaxCrop is not as interested in land ownership so much as sharing what the land produces with local farmers. The company wants to partner with farmers, get them to invest in MaxCrop, and then work together to produce crops for China. "If you look at the bigger picture, China is the largest commodity buyer in the world. ... For me as a farmer to do this on my own, is really, really difficult. I need partners who understand the language and the nuance. And that's where this partnership is really coming to fruition," he said. The company hopes to produce niche products, he added, such as lentils and malt barley, which can be processed and shipped via container to Asia.
Mr. Dearborn is well aware of the concerns about Chinese immigrants buying up farmland. "I don't see this as any different from what my great grandparents did," he said noting that his family has been farming in the province for more than 100 years. He dismissed suggestions that MaxCrop's investors are fronts for buyers in China, saying MaxCrop wants to partner with local farmers, not supplant them. While he has heard some complaints about MaxCrop, the reception has been generally positive "except for a few xenophobic cranky pants."
"Race and ethnicity should never be a punishment in this country for commercial enterprise as far as I am concerned," he added. "I think that is a Canadian value."
Mr. Zou who is not a MaxCrop client, has heard the concerns as well but is convinced people will adjust. "In a couple of years they are probably going to feel more comfortable," he said. He pointed to his friend Ms. Jin, who runs the Rolling Hills Restaurant with her family and has been embraced by the community, many of whom have helped her learn English.
"Recruiting more immigrants is a good thing," he added. "I think there's a benefit for everyone."
*****
RETURNS AND REGULATIONS
Output:
Over the past 15 years, real agricultural output increased 30 per cent while employment in agriculture declined 26 per cent. Canada's real agricultural output is on track to increase 7.5 per cent this year. Producers are also shifting toward higher-return products other than wheat that are of high demand in developed economies. Canadian growers also benefited from a major U.S. drought this summer.
Income:
Average total income of farm families, which includes other income, was $118,970 in 2011 and is projected to reach $123,498 in 2012. It was $106,894 in 2010 and averaged $97,331 between 2006 and 2010. Average net worth per farm is expected to reach $1.7-million in 2012.
Impact of the dollar:
Since the Canadian dollar began its ascent in 2002, the volume of agri-food imports has increased by 64 per cent while the volume of exports has gone up just 14 per cent.

Theories abound on rising yuan

Author: Hoffman, Andy

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/theories-abound-on-rising-yuan/docview/1104629043/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "Besides political considerations and the QE effects, I think the PBOC also wishes to shore up investors' confidence. A stronger spot exchange rate for the yuan helps diminish the depreciation expectations for the Chinese currency and underpins investor confidence for the Chinese economy. And in turn, it reduces people's desire to hoard the U.S. dollars and makes people more willing to convert dollars into yuan," Mr. Liu said in an interview.

Full text:   Is China boosting Obama's odds or investor faith?
ASIA-PACIFIC REPORTER
China's currency surged to a 19-year high against the greenback this week, prompting some to suggest the Asian economic giant is playing favourites in the upcoming U.S. election.
But other China watchers see the rising yuan as an attempt to boost the confidence of investors concerned about China's slowing economic growth.
The world's second-largest economy is expected to grow at less than 8 per cent in 2012 - far below the average double-digit gains enjoyed in recent years. Other than a stabilizing real-estate market, China's economic data have offered few solid reasons for bullish optimism and widespread fears of a "hard landing" for the Chinese economy persist.
So why the rise?
Some are pointing to the upcoming U.S. presidential election, and suggest the People's Bank of China (PBOC) is intervening to goose the currency, commonly known as the yuan, to help U.S. President Barack Obama's re-election efforts. Mr. Obama is regarded as less hawkish toward China than Republican candidate Mitt Romney, who has vowed, if elected, to brand the country a currency manipulator.
Mr. Romney and others have charged that China keeps its currency artificially low by compiling foreign currency reserves, including U.S. dollars. Critics say this helps China's massive manufacturing and export sectors and costs jobs in the West.
"Does it work in Obama's favour?" senior currency strategist Camilla Sutton of Bank of Nova Scotia told The Globe and Mail. "Absolutely."
The jump in the China's currency, which closed at 6.2673 yuan to each U.S. dollar on Friday, down from Thursday's close of 6.2770 yuan, also comes as officials from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are meeting in Tokyo this week.
The PBOC sets a mid-point for yuan trading every day, from which the currency can rise or fall by 1 per cent. The value of the yuan has often risen in the run-up to such meetings where global currency values are in focus.
Concerns about a slowing Chinese economy had pushed the yuan lower against the U.S. dollar for much of the year. By the end of July, the currency had retreated by 1.6 per cent. With the recent increases, the yuan has now appreciated about 0.4 per cent against the greenback this year. Some have pointed to the latest round of quantitative easing initiated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, which includes the buying of U.S. assets and Treasuries, as a possible reason for the yuan's increase.
Na Liu, the president and founder of CNC Asset Management Ltd., believes there are other considerations at work, namely an attempt ratchet up investor faith in the Chinese economy.
"Besides political considerations and the QE effects, I think the PBOC also wishes to shore up investors' confidence. A stronger spot exchange rate for the yuan helps diminish the depreciation expectations for the Chinese currency and underpins investor confidence for the Chinese economy. And in turn, it reduces people's desire to hoard the U.S. dollars and makes people more willing to convert dollars into yuan," Mr. Liu said in an interview.
While China's economic data has been gloomy, anecdotal evidence contradicts fears of a hard landing. During one night of China's "Golden Week" holiday in early October, for example, the National Holiday Tourism Office reported a 30.4-per-cent increase in visits to tourism sites.
Mr. Liu, an expert on commodity markets and Chinese demand, explained that despite the pressures that a rising yuan puts on manufacturers and exporters, expectations of mild appreciation are necessary to maintain confidence in China's investment driven economy.
"It makes sure foreign investors are interested in investing in the economy and it makes sure local investors want to keep money in the economy rather than converting it to foreign assets," Mr. Liu said.
The deputy governor of China's central bank said the value of the yuan is near its equilibrium level and that the PBOC has "dramatically reduced" its intervention in currency markets.
Reuters reported that Yi Gang, in remarks made in Tokyo at the IMF meetings, argued that the value of the yuan is now being dictated by market demand and supply.
"People might not know that the People's Bank of China has dramatically reduced the intervention in the market place. For more than one year, the official reserves of China have been flat," Mr. Yi said.

Abstract: The Agent's Take: "This townhouse complex filled a very high need for the neighbourhood," says agent [Tasi Farquhar], who cites older single-family homes and high-rise units as the main housing stock. "This was new and attractive, and in a super location for accessing different parts of Toronto."

The Action: In a relatively new condominium complex just west of High Park and north of waterfront trails and parks, this three-storey townhouse had over 50 private showings and a good turnout at the open houses even though many buyers and agents were busy taking summer vacations.
Not long after the Labour Day weekend, the property was sold to a local renter.
What They Got: The growing Windermere by the Lake community is home to high-rises, stacked condominium suites and traditional townhouses, like this brick-clad unit with 1,280-square-feet of living space and an oversized private garage accessible via a 280-square-foot basement professionally finished with laundry and recreation rooms.
* Nine-foot ceilings and engineered hardwood floors are featured in the main floor living room, dining area and kitchen, which also has the luxury of granite counters, a custom pantry and a walkout to a deck with a gas hookup.
* The second floor is divided for two carpeted bedrooms, while the entire third floor is a master retreat with an office area, a balcony, a walk-in closet and one of two four-piece bathrooms.
* Monthly fees of $275 go toward water and upkeep of common areas, such as visitor parking under an adjacent tower.
The Agent's Take: "This townhouse complex filled a very high need for the neighbourhood," says agent Tasi Farquhar, who cites older single-family homes and high-rise units as the main housing stock. "This was new and attractive, and in a super location for accessing different parts of Toronto."

The script by [Jonathon Young] and [Kevin Kerr] is also a mash-up, but a much lumpier one, combining an amusing pastiche/parody of classic Hollywood film noir with surreal, nonsensical twists that recall one of David Lynch's more enigmatic flicks.

Written By Jonathon Young and Kevin Kerr
Directed By Kim Collier
Starring Jonathon Young, Dawn Petten and Laura Mennell
Canadian Stage
At Bluma Appel Theatre
(St. Lawrence Centre) in Toronto
on Tuesday
**½
As a writer who plays the dual roles of theatre and film critic, I'm accustomed to bouncing between the two mediums. Now, thanks to Electric Company Theatre, I'm able to wear both hats at once.
The Vancouver company's ingenious Tear the Curtain! , kicking off Canadian Stage's 25th season, is a full-on mash-up of theatre and film in which the action unfolds (or should that be unspools?) as much on the screen as on the stage. In fact, director Kim Collier - that wizard of the West Coast, now Canadian Stage's "resident artist" - has entwined the two so artfully that after your initial delight in the fluid shifts between movie and play, you're likely to forget which is which.
Unfortunately, by the end of the show's overlong 2.5-hour running time, you're also likely to have forgotten what the point of it all was. The script by Jonathon Young and Kevin Kerr is also a mash-up, but a much lumpier one, combining an amusing pastiche/parody of classic Hollywood film noir with surreal, nonsensical twists that recall one of David Lynch's more enigmatic flicks. It's a meld of the old-fashioned and the avant-garde that makes a rather laboured attempt to explore the differences between the theatrical and cinematic experiences.
Young and Kerr have cooked up a fanciful tale set in Vancouver in 1929, when the advent of talking pictures is proving a threat to live theatre. They are also threatening the livelihood of theatre critics like Alex Braithewaite (played by Young), who finds his column inches in the local newspaper being usurped by movie reviews.
Caught in a sudden identity crisis, Alex seeks answers in the experimental work of deceased theatre guru Stanley Lee (James Fagan Tait), whose Empty Space Theatre was dedicated to creating something called "ultimate presence" - the antithesis of cinematic escapism. Alex discovers that Empty Space still exists as a radical underground movement and - via the manipulations of glamorous actress Mila Brook (Laura Mennell) - he becomes a pawn in a plot to bring Lee's teachings to life.
That puts him smack dab in the middle of a turf war between a pair of rival showbiz mobsters (Gerard Plunkett and Tom McBeath, serving up some tasty ham). Both have their greedy eyes on the piece of real estate that will become the future Stanley Theatre - the vintage Vancouver cinema-turned-live venue where Tear the Curtain! had its premiere in 2010. The history of the Stanley was, in fact, one of the primary inspirations for this show.
Toronto's Bluma Appel Theatre does not share those roots, but it's a fine stand-in for a movie house. And, as Electric Company proved with its previous Canadian Stage show two seasons ago, Studies in Motion: The Hauntings of Eadweard Muybridge , this indie troupe has no problem filling its vast stage. David Roberts's multilayered production design riffs on the curtain theme: A red velvet drop conceals a movie screen that fills the entire proscenium space. This, in turn, rises to reveal a two-tiered set doubling as Alex's apartment building and a Front Page -style newspaper office. The film portions are projected on the big screen, on scrims and directly onto the set.
Collier's direction employs the advantages of both mediums. The filmed scenes (shot with flair by cinematographer Brian Johnson) give us close-ups, montages, real locations. The live scenes have immediacy. At her most playful, Collier blends the two, so that the actors are onstage and on film simultaneously.
The cast has good fun with its old-movie stereotypes. Young's hard-drinking Alex comes off like a slightly seedy Gary Cooper, while Mennell is suitably sultry as the femme fatale. But Dawn Petten is the standout, bringing screwball charm to her role as Alex's lovelorn secretary.
The film critic part of me came away appreciating Tear the Curtain! 's affectionate use of the noir genre. But the theatre critic felt that its ideas were not sufficiently developed. Both, however, applaud Electric Company's brilliant fusion of two enduring art forms.
Tear the Curtain! runs until Oct. 20.

Full text:   Nearby residents anxiously looking over developer's plans that will transform neighbourhood
bjang@globeandmail.com
A104-year-old farmhouse on Vancouver's east side awaits a new life as the centrepiece of a multiunit residential project in the Killarney neighbourhood, where town met country after the Second World War.
The site of the old Avalon Dairy has been a notable holdout over decades of urban development. The 1.25-acre farmhouse property, located near a row of Vancouver Specials, is now the subject of much local chatter.
Residents are anxiously scrutinizing a developer's plans to construct 52 to 68 units in a townhouse complex smack dab in the middle of an area where the landscape is largely defined by single-family homes built in the 1960s and 1970s.
On the land where Jeremiah Crowley began his dairy business with six cows, the new owners are operating under the name Avalonna Homes, including local builders and a real estate agent whose office is in Killarney. Avalonna Homes has pledged to restore the farmhouse's exterior to its former glory, while doing a major renovation on the interior to create three units.
Hywel Jones, a residential architect hired by the developer, insists that keeping the farmhouse on its existing footprint is the best option. "If done right, neighbours will be your allies and friends of the project," said Mr. Jones, who is overseeing the design and planning phase, as well as navigating the rezoning application through City Hall.
Harald Underdahl, who lives across the street from the former dairy, reminisces about a time when a driver on horse and buggy delivered milk in glass bottles. On some winter days as a kid, he would go outside and find cream frozen at the top of the milk bottle. The cream went straight into his cereal. Now 74, he fondly remembers the good old days in the 1940s, when he played on the dairy's grass field.
Lee Crowley, a grandson of Avalon Dairy's founder, sold the family's property last year for $6-million. He closed down the Killarney bottling plant and retail store, while shifting milk processing to new facilities in Burnaby.
The Killarney site's industrial buildings, including a large garage, will be demolished to clear the way for clusters of townhouses up to three storeys in height, with units ranging from one to three bedrooms. Underground parking is in the offing, and Mr. Jones is vowing to preserve mature trees that dot the property while allotting space in front of the 1 1/2-storey farmhouse for community vegetable garden plots. It is meant to be a nod to the site's bucolic, agricultural roots.
Mr. Underdahl wants the developer to move the Craftsman-style, wood-frame farmhouse so that it rests along Wales Street, where the home would be easily visible to passing pedestrians and car traffic. "If you keep that house hidden in the middle where it is now, nobody is going to see it except for those people who live on the development," he said.
But heritage consultant Donald Luxton, retained by the developer, said it is best to leave historic buildings where they stand, whenever possible. "You end up with a tighter development that uses land, in my estimation, more wisely. One way to deal with affordability is to cut land costs and put in more housing units per acre," Mr. Luxton said. A typical single-family detached home in Killarney fetched more than $940,000 recently, while a townhouse unit went for $426,000.
Mr. Luxton, who is also president of the Heritage Vancouver Society, has recused himself from commenting in that role due to his conflict as a consultant. But Anthony Norfolk, a retired lawyer who serves as chairman of the society's advocacy committee, is giving the thumbs up to the transformation of the old dairy land into a townhouse project. "It is pity that a lot of the green space will be lost along Wales Street, but we understand the economics and the need for additional buildings," he said.
While some residents fret about higher density ruining the neighbourhood, Mr. Norfolk said the farmhouse will be given a purpose again as Killarney takes a new step in its conversion from rural to suburban to urban.

We, of course, acknowledge that we enjoy this bounty on the traditional territory of the Coast Salish people to whom we give thanks. We also give thanks to the many diverse cultures who have come together to share this space.
There is much to be grateful for this year: the good health of my family, our lovely home which has held its value and may even see a modest increase in its assessment next year despite the recent downturn in the real-estate market.
We also give thanks that, so far this year, there have been no running gun battles in our neighbourhood, that our neighbours remain safe and their homes unstrafed by gunfire. We thank you for the juice empire upon which this house is built.
We give thanks for our good fortune. In just over a month, I will be one year into my second term as mayor and closer to my goal of making Vancouver the greenest, most sustainable city on Earth.
We thank the many cyclists who supported me in my bid for a second term, and we hope they are feeling less threatened by traffic as a result of the many protected bike lanes and greenways I have created. We ask you to watch over them, especially the ones who don't wear helmets.
We thank you for people who choose to ride public transit or walk to work, rather than driving their cars. We thank you for people who have decided to live in tiny condos, above garages, and in shipping containers, thereby reducing their carbon footprint and helping the city achieve its greenhouse-gas reduction targets.
We thank you for continuing to keep Vancouver a nuclear-free zone.
We thank you for my Vision Vancouver colleagues on council who, despite having ambitions beyond council chambers, remain loyal to me for the time being, and rarely, if ever, speak out of turn. I thank you for their willingness to assume portfolios in which they may have little interest or expertise. We thank you for my excellent communications staff who encourage me to stay on message and are expert at spinning even the most awkward council reports into good news.
We thank you for delivering to us city manager Penny Ballem, and ask you to guide her as she oversees negotiating a new contract with the city's unionized inside workers represented for the most part by CUPE Locals 15 and 1004. We ask you to give her strength and to remind unionized workers who have been without a contract since December of last year who their real friends are. We thank you for the unionized workers not striking.
We thank you for the many professionals who have chosen to build their careers with the City of Vancouver and embrace my many ideas no matter how hare-brained. We thank you for the dedication demonstrated by members of The Mayor's Task Force on Housing Affordability, who are working hard to convince citizens who are not residents of the West Side that building houses in the middle of the road is a good idea.
Thank you for giving me the discipline to keep my potty mouth under control, at least in front of open microphones.
Thank you for Chip Wilson, whose generosity has enhanced our city immeasurably.
Thank you for my dimples and my hair.
Thank you for the Internet - especially Twitter - which makes me appear to be open, transparent and engaged with the public, and is also fun. Thank you for spell check.
Thank you for Christy Clark.
Amen.
Okay, who's hungry?

The Action: In May, 2011, this detached residence was listed at $5.698-million and then $4.999-million, but several bids as much as $1-million less were rejected. With market activity on a steady decline, the house was staged and reduced to $4.399-million, which drew out a local buyer who negotiated a deal this summer for $4.28-million.
What They Got: In 2000, Peco Construction redeveloped a double corner lot measuring 66 by 169 feet with a 3,014-square-foot residence, architect David Wong designed with a boat-like structure to incorporate Feng Shui principals, rounded rooms and halls, a rooftop terrace and a double garage.
* The entertainment wing consists of a living area with double-height ceilings and a curved wall of windows in one section and a three-sided, gas fireplace shared with the dining room, which has a balcony to one side and a kitchen to the other.
* One bedroom and the smallest of four bathrooms are located on the main floor, while three bedrooms are situated above, including a master suite with a Juliet balcony.
* The lot's sloping grade allowed for a walkout from the basement, which has family, media and recreation rooms.
The Agent's Take: "In that general area, anything that is not brand new will be torn down," says agent Lisa Berlin-Sandy. "But it was a unique property in that it was a double lot."

Abstract: In the Spinnaker residence, kitty-corner to Kitsilano Beach Park, this two-storey penthouse was listed at $649,000 at the sellers request, but the slowdown in market activity prompted a reduction to $610,000 and then $599,900. A local renter toured three units in the four-storey building before negotiating a price for this one at $565,000.

The Action: In the Spinnaker residence, kitty-corner to Kitsilano Beach Park, this two-storey penthouse was listed at $649,000 at the sellers request, but the slowdown in market activity prompted a reduction to $610,000 and then $599,900. A local renter toured three units in the four-storey building before negotiating a price for this one at $565,000.
What They Got: In 1979, developer André Molnar designed this 31-unit residence with six one-of-a-kind penthouses, including this 824-square-foot model with two bedrooms, open principal rooms and a private 322-square-foot deck, which is the largest on the penthouse level.
* Within the last few years, the bathroom was remodelled with Carrera marble floors and the galley kitchen by the dining area was redone with granite counters and appliances. A new skylight was also installed in the vaulted ceiling above an entertaining space with a wood stove and raised solarium area along the windows.
* One bedroom is enclosed, but the one upstairs opens to the principal rooms below. Monthly fees of $316 pays for water and building repairs, including new roofing and plumbing, as well as maintenance of a squash court and garage, where this unit has one parking spot.
The Agent's Take: "The location was amazing, right across from the beach, and it has a 300-square-foot deck overlooking the ocean, mountains and Kitsilano," says agent Holly Wood.
"To get this deck and view right across the beach is very rare." The interior space was also exceptional.

Corruption investigators raid Laval City Hall, mayor's home

Abstract: Opposition politicians say they have been raising concerns about the awarding of contracts in [Laval] for years. "We're not surprised by this," said David De Cotis, head of the Mouvement Lavallois party. "We see the same firms over and over getting contracts, and they contribute to the mayor's party. The system is broken in Laval."

Full text:   The tentacles of Quebec's ever-expanding corruption scandal have reached into the home and headquarters of a mayor long considered untouchable.
About 70 investigators from the province's anti-corruption squad descended on Laval City Hall and the home of Mayor Gilles Vaillancourt Thursday, seizing documents and databases related to contracts handed out by Quebec's fastest-growing big city.
The raids come as corruption in government construction contracting is getting a thorough airing at the Charbonneau inquiry. Construction magnate Lino Zambito held the province in rapt attention this week as he accused mobsters, Montreal city employees and the political party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay of organizing an intricate system of kickbacks and illegal payments.
Laval, a suburb just north of Montreal, has grown from a sleepy island of farmland and bedroom communities to an industrial and real-estate development hub with the population of Halifax in the 23 years Mr. Vaillancourt has ruled.
The city has long been reputed to be rife with shady dealings between officials, construction companies and developers, but despite damning media investigations and serious allegations by provincial politicians and local rivals, no police force showed interest in Mr. Vaillancourt - until now.
The investigators arrived at City Hall at about 4 p.m. and ordered all employees to leave immediately, a city spokeswoman said. Staff was told to take only their personal effects with them. Officers also searched the million-dollar home of Mr. Vaillancourt, a man nicknamed the "King of Laval" who has barely been contested since first becoming mayor in 1989.
Police also raided the offices housing the city's computer servers and engineering department as the Quebec corruption scandal spread, fuelled by revelations at an inquiry hearing shocking allegations of kickbacks, illegal political financing and bribery.
"Police inspectors are still inside City Hall and they told us they would be there for a good part of the evening and even into the night," Nadine Lussier, a spokeswoman for the city of Laval, said from outside City Hall on Thursday evening. "We are fully co-operating with the authorities."
A spokeswoman for Quebec's anti-corruption squad would not comment on what the investigators are trying to find. "There is an investigation under way and the seizures are to find information to assist the investigation," said the spokeswoman, Anne-Frederick Laurence.
But opposition politicians in Laval said police were looking for evidence involved in the awarding of contracts in Laval. In fact, news of the raids was greeted with joy by Laval's opposition leaders who have difficulty getting elected or heard in Laval, where Mr. Vaillancourt has long had a stranglehold on city council.
The opposition in Laval traditionally watches council proceedings from the public gallery. Mr. Vaillancourt's critics have asked for police investigations for years.
Opposition politicians say they have been raising concerns about the awarding of contracts in Laval for years. "We're not surprised by this," said David De Cotis, head of the Mouvement Lavallois party. "We see the same firms over and over getting contracts, and they contribute to the mayor's party. The system is broken in Laval."
The mayor wasn't home at the time of the raids and left City Hall in the morning. A spokeswoman said the mayor wasn't hiding and is prepared to go before the Charbonneau commission probing corruption in public contracts if asked to do so.
"He is very surprised" by the police raid, Johanne Bournival said.
At the Charbonneau inquiry, Mr. Zambito's public testimony has mostly concentrated on Montreal, but he has hinted the stink of corruption is as bad or worse outside the city.
He said Laval and other areas outside Montreal also have a closed system of rigged bidding on public works contracts, but, instead of mobsters, politicians run the system.
When someone from outside would underbid on a contract, "they would just cancel the contract," Mr. Zambito testified. "In Laval, the Mafia wasn't present. There were other mechanisms to control things. ... It was another game."
Media reports in Quebec have raised questions about the conduct of Mr. Vaillancourt. A La Presse investigation found a quarter of Laval public works contracts between 2001 and 2008 went to firms controlled by Tony Accurso, the construction magnate facing charges of corruption for dealings with other municipal governments.
A Radio-Canada report accused Mr. Vaillancourt of offering a $10,000 cash contribution to former provincial Justice Minister Serge Menard when he was running for a seat in the provincial legislature under the Parti Quebecois banner in 1993.
Mr. Vaillancourt has always denied any wrongdoing.

The Action: In an established high rise just south of Upper Canada College, this three-bedroom suite with two solariums was listed for sale for more than two weeks and had 31 private showings before a buyer struck a deal for $1.3-million.
What They Got: This 12th-floor suite is a double unit with a 3,286-square-foot plan that the sellers bought from Cadillac Fairview before the highrise was constructed in the late 1970s.
* One wing of the unit houses all the public quarters, including a sunken living and dining room with access to a panelled family room, a breakfast area in the kitchen and a solarium in the northwest corner.
* The private wing of the unit contains laundry facilities and three bedrooms, each with access to one of the four bathrooms and one with a dressing area and second solarium with south and west exposures.
* The unit comes with two lockers and three parking spots, plus monthly fees of $3,094 pays for the cost of all utilities, cable, valet parking, 24-hour security, a party room and car-wash facilities.
The Agent's Take: "These large units don't come up very often," says agent Elli Davis, who notes only a handful of units this size exist in the building, much less the city. "Buyers are coming out of Forest Hill homes and want to have all that space on one level."
The highrise itself was also a local landmark. "It's a small building in the Forest Hill area that offers valet parking and wonderful services," says Ms. Davis.

Abstract: While not every artist's space is messy, it is important to have a dedicated work environment. "I know people who are spending $2,000 a month in rent for a studio," Ms. [Jenifer Papararo] says. "It is a very serious concern, and I do believe that there has been a cultural drain away from Vancouver, especially in the visual arts."

Full text:   With affordable studios hard to come by, a curator and a condo developer have come together to make room for artists
bjang@globeandmail.com
Finding affordable studios for visual artists in Vancouver is a tall order, but Jenifer Papararo is game to participate in helping find solutions.
The curator at the Contemporary Art Gallery is worried about the lack of working space, saying that many artists have left the city after being squeezed out by Vancouver's housing crunch.
Even with the real estate market softening last month across much of the region, prices have been steady on Vancouver's east side, which has been targeted by city officials for creating new space for artists.
"I think that is a real key problem here - not being able to afford a work space," Ms. Papararo says. She notes that many artists need a separate work area from where they live due to the nature of what they produce, whether it be to avoid fumes from using solvents to clean up after oil painting or needing a large room to assemble complex sculptures.
While not every artist's space is messy, it is important to have a dedicated work environment. "I know people who are spending $2,000 a month in rent for a studio," Ms. Papararo says. "It is a very serious concern, and I do believe that there has been a cultural drain away from Vancouver, especially in the visual arts."
With that sobering thought in mind, she is embracing a collaboration with Mo Yeung International Enterprise Ltd., the developer of a six-storey condo project in Mount Pleasant.
There will be 45 condos when the complex opens in the spring of 2014. But an additional unit, called Art Studio 45, will have 900 square feet of ground-level space allocated rent-free for 12 months for a visual artist. That individual will be selected by an independent jury. If all goes well, a new artist will rotate through the unit every 12 months.
Vancouver needs to "keep the young, creative, next generation here. We don't want to drive them out, we want to keep them here," says Ameet Johal of Fifth Avenue Real Estate Marketing, which is helping to promote the condos. "We're doing our little piece."
The condo complex, dubbed Collection 45, has a front entrance on East 8th Avenue that faces the back-lane parking lot of the Congee Noodle House, while the back looks onto the Sarah McLachlan School of Music located on the second floor across the alley. For those on Collection 45's upper floors, there will be a panoramic view of the North Shore mountains, a perk that is included for owners who pay roughly $720,000 for their suite with roof-top patio.
Nearby, artists at the Nice Cafe can afford the $4.95 breakfast, but bemoan the shortage of art quarters in their neighbourhood.
Vancouver Councillor Geoff Meggs, who values Mount Pleasant as one of the hotbed neighbourhoods for artist activity, welcomes the private-sector contribution from any developer.
"The long and short of it is that there is more space out there in the private sector than people realize," Mr. Meggs says. "It is very expensive in Vancouver, and rents have been rising, even in industrial areas."
The City of Vancouver will continue to do what it can, including plans to convert two industrial warehouses on Vancouver's east side for low-rent studios, Mr. Meggs adds.
As well, the Vancouver Park Board selected local artists this week to participate in its program to open up seven field houses. The city also points to its support for Performing Arts Lodges, which gives priority to residents age 55 and over.
Whether it is the public or private sector, artists say it is crucial to remember Vancouver's history of having a strong arts community.
"It's great that the City of Vancouver is doing what it can, but it's still a drop in the bucket," says Carmen Rosen, artistic director of the Still Moon Arts Society.

Full text:   Mannix has talent, financial wherewithal to fashion elite-level career in polo-mad Argentina
While most Canadian boys grow up with NHL ambitions, few ever achieving them, Fred Mannix Jr. had an even more improbable childhood dream: chase a little white ball from atop a polo pony in some of the world's most exclusive locales.
Polo is a sport dominated by a deep talent pool in Argentina, where labour costs are lower, pristine playing fields are plentiful and it's a national obsession. Meanwhile, it's a sport played only by a few hundred people in Canada, where the northern climate cuts the outdoor season short, and it requires substantial wealth - eager patrons or incredible parental sacrifice - to make it to the top.
Despite the odds, Mannix has managed to shine.
The 28-year-old from Calgary is one of the best players this country has produced - good enough to compete in the so-called Triple Crown of Polo, which began last week with the Tortugas Open in Buenos Aires. His four-man squad, Alegria, lost its first two matches and will now prepare for the Hurlingham Open, before finishing with the sport's most prestigious stop - the Argentine Polo Open Championship, which ends in December.
Mannix is set to become the first Canadian in 65 years to compete in all three legs of the Triple Crown, and is believed to be just the second Canadian to play in the Argentine Open, which dates to 1893.
He follows in the boots of Canada's most storied polo player, Montreal-born Lewis Lacey. Lacey also made it to the Triple Crown, and won the Argentine Open eight times between 1915 and 1937.
It's a major accomplishment for Mannix - and Canada - to be competing at this level, according to Don Pennycook, vice-president of Polo Canada .
"He's a very unique individual," he said, "I don't know anybody else in Canada who can afford to do what he's doing. No. 1, that he has the talent, and No. 2, that he has the financial wherewithal to play."
He has also benefited from the good fortune of birth.
The Mannix family is known in Alberta for its considerable wealth (and related philanthropy), as well as its exceptional privacy. The family's privately-owned Mancal Group has arms in real estate, ranching, coal, oil and gas. Canadian Business magazine estimated that brothers Ron and Fred Mannix (the latter is Mannix's father) had a net worth of $3.44-billion last year, and ranked them the ninth richest Canadians.
Equestrian sports are also in the family's bloodline. Mannix's grandfather established a farm south of Calgary, while his father, and mother, Li-Anne, are avid riders. So are all his siblings - notably his younger brother, Julian, who is internationally ranked on the polo circuit, and his younger sister, Vanessa, who is show jumping with an eye on the Olympics.
"I've been very lucky," Mannix said from Argentina. "My father had horses and, naturally, I was able to follow him to the barn."
He played in the pee-wee ranks in California. By 15, he watched an older friend venture to the U.S. circuit, and decided he, too, was going to play polo for a living. Quickly making the national team, at 16, he played in the 2001 world championship. He later attended Florida Atlantic University, where he studied business management while honing his polo skills.
Mannix made the trek to Argentina in 2006, teamed with local superstars and has since established a farm - Alegria. He's already played in the Argentine Open four times.
His time toiling in the sport of kings has not been without controversy.
In 2007, Mannix was playing at the U.S. Polo Association Gold Cup in Florida when his then-La Herradura teammates conspired to fix the match to receive a more favourable seeding in the U.S. Open.
"The three guys, they came to me and said, 'Fred we've got to lose this game,'" he recalled, "... It was just a messed-up deal. I didn't go along with it. I didn't condone it."
The other players were suspended. Mannix was not.
Mannix is ranked No. 47 on the World Polo Tour and has an eight-goal handicap (10-goal is the highest handicap). British-born financier Lyndon Lea, who holds Canadian citizenship, is the only other higher-ranked Canadian (No. 17).
Pennycook said the sport is no longer just for the super-wealthy, but nonetheless, describes polo as "an addiction that only poverty or death can cure."
Last Sunday, Mannix's team narrowly lost 18-4 to the world's top team La Dolfina, led by Adolfo Cambiaso, the world's top-ranked player with a perfect 10-goal handicap.
The significance of competing at this level - and making it to the Triple Crown - isn't lost on Mannix. "It's huge. I feel so proud. We've been working hard. Very, very hard. ... A lot of effort has gone into getting us to the field."

Abstract: In particular, my thoughts are with [Bianka], 28, a high-school nurse from Mississauga. As Brad (Brad) Smith has made crystal clear, he, the former Canadian Football League wide receiver and now "free agent," has no truck with persons of the female persuasion who are "high-maintenance."

My heart goes out to bachelorettes Bianka, Jessica, Laura B., Mindy and Tia.
Like all of Canada, I was on tenterhooks, going mental with anticipation as the final group of bachelorettes - those comely ladies attempting to win the abiding affection of Brad (Brad) Smith, the first Canadian Bachelor - were introduced.
Bianka, Jessica, Laura B., Mindy and Tia join 20 other bachelorettes vying, all aflutter no doubt, for the hand of 29-year-old Brad (Brad) Smith. This great country was combed high and low, north and south, east and west for the cream of Canadian single ladies who might, just might, interest his Brad-ness. (Rumours that raw, red meat was dragged through the hills and valleys of certain areas to attract potential bachelorettes from their lairs are just that - rumours.) Now, the lucky two dozen plus one are named and those names are certain to live in the annals of Canadian fame.
The Bachelor Canada (Wednesday, CITY-TV, 9 p.m.) is not merely hotly anticipated. In the genres of romance and manly-men-without-their-shirts, it is a mega-event of totally epic proportions. Those who note that the show will air at the same time as the U.S. presidential debate and that this fact means there is no competing original programs from the U.S. networks are just haters. And haters have no fun.
Everybody just chill. Even the haters. Here it comes, Canada: high jinks in the hot tub and hearts broken.
In particular, my thoughts are with Bianka, 28, a high-school nurse from Mississauga. As Brad (Brad) Smith has made crystal clear, he, the former Canadian Football League wide receiver and now "free agent," has no truck with persons of the female persuasion who are "high-maintenance." He totally said, "Someone who is high-maintenance turns me off!" And Bianka, bless her comeliness, has a past. She had a "high-profile relationship" (as CITY-TV describes it) with National Basketball Association player Kris Humphries. Yes, that Kris Humphries - Kim Kardashian's husband of 72 days. If that is totally not a warning sign of a maintenance issue, I don't know what is.
And let's face it: In his search for a not-high-maintenance lady friend, Brad (Brad) Smith is on a voyage of discovery. He is like an explorer in search of new lands and new ways. He is the Lord Franklin of the lonely, the Jacques Cartier of the singles scene. His journey - bracing and inspirational to everyone but the haters - through 25 bachelorettes is a noble cause and he totally deserves those hot tub pit stops.
To know Brad (Brad) Smith is to, well, totally know him. I can tell you that his favourite movie is Romeo + Juliet , the music-filled version starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. His favourite food recipe is for Soy Ginger Seared Ahi Tuna and Pickled Cucumbers. His favourite songs are To Build a Home by the Cinematic Orchestra featuring Patrick Watson, Soldier On and Sweet Disposition by the Temper Trap, Fix You by Coldplay and Wicked Game by Chris Isaak.
I know this because CITY-TV told me so in a package of info that came last week. Along with a personal note that said, "It's time to stop playing the field and fall in love." Oddly, it is signed Brad, not Brad (Brad) Smith.
Now, obviously only the most elite of single Canadian ladies has been picked to possibly hot tub it with Brad (Brad) Smith. Just look at their occupations. A casual glance at the bachelorettes, going alphabetically, illuminates everything. There is Amber (age: 29l; occupation: strip club server.) There is Ana (age: 26; cccupation: server.) And there is the amazingness that is Chantelle (age: 25; occupation: pastor.) Yep, she's a pastor. There are other things to note about Chantelle. Her favourite foods are: 1. grapes; 2. dill pickles; 3. Starbucks coffee. Of herself, Pastor Chantelle says, "People often think I come across as fake, but my happiness and joy are real." So there, haters, she's a pastor with a thing for grapes, pickles and coffee. Does that not make her hot tub worthy?
There are also a Playboy model, a real-estate agent nicknamed Bubba and a photo-lab manager who wants "a change in career to become an embalmer/funeral director." Phew.
Only the bitter, the bigoted and curmudgeons could be haters of The Bachelor Canada . Oh, I know what the haters are asking right now. They're asking if there's a red-haired bachelorette. Why? Because as the Boss himself, Bruce Springsteen, reminded us: "It takes a red-headed woman/ To get a dirty job done."
Well, go back to high school, haters. This is Canada, this is The Bachelor Canada and it's hot tub time.

Full text:   Hunter, trapper, world traveller, passionate Western Canadian. Born Sept. 20, 1923, in Red Deer, Alta., died Feb. 1, 2012, in Stettler, Alta., of heart failure, aged 88
No one really expected Lex Edward Bickle would live when he was born in Red Deer, Alta., on Sept. 20, 1923, weighing only four pounds. But Lex never met a dare he didn't take.
His father, Thomas Bickle, worked on the Canadian National Railway in Stettler and his mother, Laura, and two older siblings Bruce and Gladys lived just half a block from the tracks in a house that is still there today.
Lex grew up playing hockey, trapping muskrat and weasels and summering at Buffalo Lake, northwest of Stettler. As soon as he was old enough, he went to work delivering groceries on Friday nights to the big barn at the dairy where the farm families parked their horses and wagons while they socialized and shopped.
Lex never settled in at school, but it didn't stop him enjoying himself. The school toilets consisted of a series of holes in a board set atop a sloped trough and separated by stalls - boys upstream, teachers downstream. One day, Lex and his buddies set fire to some paper and floated it downstream just as a particularly unpopular teacher was relaxing in his stall.
At 16, Lex ran away and joined the army to fight in the Second World War, but his age was discovered and he was sent home. He joined the navy instead and spent the war on a minesweeper on the West Coast.
After the war, Lex went to work in the North, up on the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line. He learned the local Inuit language and hunted caribou.
Returning to Stettler in the 1960s, he bought three businesses: an insurance company, a real-estate company and a travel agency. He toured the world as a travel agent, collecting mementos from every continent. In Paris, he went to a famous restaurant and ordered the beef. But when it was served to him very rare, he sent it back to the kitchen with the comment "I've seen steers wounded worse than this recover!" The chef roared out, cleaver in hand, and threw Lex out of his restaurant.
Although Lex married once, briefly, his most beloved companion was his black lab, Jack. When Lex wasn't working, he and Jack were out hunting in the foothills beyond Rocky Mountain House.
When he retired, Lex bought a piece of land on Buffalo Lake where he had spent his summers as a child. His house was filled with books and music, as well as his Inuit artifacts and travel mementoes.
When Lex was nearly 70, we became neighbours. At our house on Sunday nights, he told my four children stories of the old days in the West. He showed them the old trails and where the natives had camped. He taught them how to recognize birds. He told them of the coming of the railway, and what life was like during the Depression and before universal health care. Even though he had no children of his own, he taught another generation what it means to truly be Canadian.
Sally Krueger is Lex's friend.

Full text:   Does China, with too many shopping centres, apartments and offices, need a 220-storey tower?
It should be no surprise that China - the world's emerging superpower - wants to be next to boast the world's tallest building, and build it at record speed.
But does the country, already strewn with barely-occupied shopping centres, apartment buildings and offices, really need the 220-storey Sky City tower in the central industrial city of Changsha?
At first glance, the Sky City project seems too good to be true. Rough plans for the 838-metre, multi-use tower were unveiled in June by Broad Group, an air-conditioning company moving into property development. An earlier version of plans for the building set it at 200 storeys and 666 metres, including 6,690 apartments, 210,000 square metres of office space and a luxury hotel. Reports have suggested the last 20 storeys, to give the building the 'world's tallest' title, were added at the urging of local government officials.
The company's construction arm, Broad Sustainable Building, has pledged to erect the new super skyscraper in as little as three months using prefab components and streamlined construction. It built a 30-storey tower in a little over two weeks last year, using prefab components.
It's not clear Sky City will leave the ground. But the ambitious plan is already stirring some worry in a country already grappling with an abundance of real estate from years of relentless infrastructure spending, along with a cooling economy.
If the tower is actually completed, there is the question of who will fill its 1 million square metres of floor space, served by 104 elevators. It all must be absorbed by a proud, but largely working-class city of 7 million - large by Canadian standards, but provincial in a country of 1.3 billion - in which possibly only 2 to 3 million people have the financial means to shop, eat or live in such a development.
"For the rest of the population, they are sitting at home doing nothing, they are not going out and dining or shopping," said Carlby Xie, head of north China research for Colliers International, which tracks retail and commercial rental prices in China's major cities. "The key point is, softened demand is already looming on the market, and [so is] softened revenue."
Office space now under construction in China could take seven years to fill, by some estimates. In second- and third-tier cities like Changsha, much of that space will remain empty for months or years after opening, economists warn - creating the threat of a commercial property bubble to rival China's residential housing woes.
"In the very near future there is going to be a massive dump of office space in this country and a lot of it is going to be in second- or third-tier cities ... There is just going to be a lot more supply than demand out there," said Patrick Chovanec, an associate professor of economics at Beijing's Tsinghua University. "Shanghai and Beijing are unique cities in China, they are magnet cities. It's like talking about Manhattan or London. But what holds for Manhattan doesn't necessarily hold for Omaha."
Famously, China already has the empty New South China Mall in Dongguan, a city of 10 million which could never come close to filling the mall's 2,350 stores. The city of Ordos used its wealth to build an entirely new, centrally planned district which remains largely empty, five years later.
Observers say such grandiose projects are a collision of developers' faith that government will continue to prop up any money-losing projects, and local governments' ambitions to show off their cities while driving local GDP figures.
"Like all cases of moral hazards, it's true until it's not true," observes Prof. Chovanec. "The expectation has been that [real estate development] is a no-lose proposition and there is a strong belief it will continue to be that way."
But that expectation, he said, relies on the central government "waving a magic wand" over natural economic forces to keep the boom going, the kind of approach which drove China's growth during the 2008 economic crisis but left it with a litany of bad bank loans and a seriously overheated housing market, not yet deflated despite tough government restrictions on mortgages and the purchase of multiple homes.
The growing glut of retail and office space in second-tier cities is already showing. Rents in Tianjin and Qingdao fell between 3 and 8 per cent year-on-year at the end of this year's second quarter, a Colliers report showed. The economy is slowing down, conscientious consumers are saving their money, and both luxury and mid-market foreign brands are reporting slowing sales.
Yet China's frenzy to build may be fed anew by smaller stimulus plans now being rolled out by local governments. Changsha announced a separate, 829 billion yuan ($130-billion) spending program for infrastructure; the cities of Chongqing and Tianjin and the provinces of Guangdong and Shanxi have also pledged billions of yuan in spending on areas including capital-intensive industry and infrastructure.
Aside from the size of Sky City, the speed of the construction plan is also raising eyebrows. Broad Group's chairman Zhang Yue told The Financial Times last month that financing was in place, architects are finishing blueprints and construction is to begin in December. By comparison, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, presently the world's tallest building, took more than five years to complete.
Local reports suggest some government approvals are outstanding and a spokeswoman for Broad Group, contacted by phone, offered no new details. "Construction in the project hasn't started," said Zhu Linfang, the company's media manager. "All is going as planned. But we cannot arrange interviews on this project now, and I have no more information to release ... We will do it when all is set."
To some extent, building today to accommodate future growth is China's way.
"The fact you've got so many good quality developers developing good quality office space means you are positioning a city to thrive in the next five to 10 years ... It's a case of you build it and you will grow into it," said James Macdonald, head of China research for real estate services firm Savills, who argues the approach helps minimize inflationary pressure, even if there is a temporary disconnect between demand and supply. "Temporary could be two or three years, it could be longer. But ... this China growth model is not going to go away, we're in sort of a bumpy patch."
Still, plans for a 220-storey tower in an out-of-the-way industrial city may be a sign China's go-go development may be out of sync with its cooling economy.
"I don't think there is any need to build that high in a market like Changsha," Mr. Macdonald said.

B.C. property prices a lesson for provinces

Abstract: Greater Vancouver's overheated housing market required some much-needed cooling off, he said. "You don't really hear the word bubble when discussing the Vancouver housing market any more, and that's a good sign because the market is adjusting gradually and in a moderate way, and in a way that won't cause major concern in the medium term about the growth prospects for B.C.," Mr. [Jacques Marcil] said.

Full text:   The slump in British Columbia's real estate market serves as a cautionary note for other provinces that are bracing for bumps in economic growth.
When homes slip in price, consumers rein in spending, producing a ripple effect on local merchants and slowing down the broader economy.
Jacques Marcil, senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, points to British Columbia as a signpost that the rest of the country should pay attention to because the province's average resale home prices have fallen this year - the only province experiencing a decrease from last year's average.
"There is less shopping and less retail purchases when the housing market slows down. Consumers are less likely to get new appliances or a new couch," Mr. Marcil said Thursday in an interview from Toronto. "It's what we call the wealth effect. Part of household spending is based on regular income but also on how wealthy we feel and our net worth."
In a new provincial economic update, TD forecasts that average prices for existing homes in B.C. will decline 8.9 per cent this year. It is a steeper drop than TD's previous June prediction for a 4.6-per-cent decrease in 2012, driven by a slowdown in Greater Vancouver's housing market.
TD has ratcheted back its growth forecast for the Canadian economy as a whole, forecasting that the improvement in real gross domestic product will be 1.8 per cent this year, down from its previous prediction for a 2.1-per-cent increase. Despite the uncertainty over housing markets, TD is forecasting 2 per cent economic growth next year in Canada and 2.5 per cent in 2014.
Ontario and Quebec can't afford to be smug about British Columbia's housing price correction. Average resale home prices are forecast to climb 5.3 per cent this year in Ontario, but the province's housing market might eke out a paltry 0.1-per-cent gain in 2013 and drop 4.3 per cent in 2014. Quebec's average prices for existing homes are predicted to go from a gain of 6.3 per cent in 2012 to an expected 2.4-per-cent increase next year, before declining 5.8 per cent in 2014.
TD forecasts that average resale home prices across Canada will rise 0.3 per cent this year, climb 0.9 per cent next year, but slip 2.8 per cent in 2014.
"If you own a furniture store and you see the housing market slowing down, it means you have to be more careful with your inventories because of the higher possibility that people will be buying less furniture," Mr. Marcil said.
Greater Vancouver's overheated housing market required some much-needed cooling off, he said. "You don't really hear the word bubble when discussing the Vancouver housing market any more, and that's a good sign because the market is adjusting gradually and in a moderate way, and in a way that won't cause major concern in the medium term about the growth prospects for B.C.," Mr. Marcil said.
Canada's economy accelerated 3.2 per cent in 2010 and grew an estimated 2.4 per cent in 2011. "We're still in a low-growth environment. It is a coasting speed. The economy is expanding, but so is the population. Having 1.8-per-cent growth in Canada is certainly slower than what we experienced earlier this decade and in the late 1990s," Mr. Marcil said. "The headline number is dropping, but all the provinces are still experiencing growth, and that's a good sign."
While household consumption is an important element in economy activity, the price decline in Greater Vancouver's real estate market is being viewed as a necessary step toward maintaining economic health in the long term. "There will be a slowdown in discretionary spending such as upgrades inside houses, but homeowners still need to feed themselves and heat up the place where they live," Mr. Marcil said.

Full text:   This wood-burnished loft offers a balcony that looms at Toronto's tree line and a three-storey spiral staircase
Asking price: $1,495,000
Taxes: $5776.27 (2012)
Maintenance fees: $963.81 per month
Agent: Christopher Bibby (Sutton Group-Associates Realty Inc.)
The back story
The 100-year-old building that now houses the Button Factory Lofts was occupied by workers in the garment trade, confirms real estate agent Christopher Bibby, but they were actually making uniforms, not buttons.
According to local lore, kids in the neighbourhood would visit the factory after school to see their parents at work. The children were rewarded with pennies in return for picking up buttons off the factory floor, says Mr. Libby of Sutton Group-Associates Realty Inc.
By 1993, most factories had moved out of the downtown core and the red brick building was rezoned for residential use. The builders reconfigured the building into four zones and sold the space raw so that the new owners could customize each area. Today, the building has 13 units.
The loft today
Designer Parisa Manouchehri purchased the 2,400-square-foot unit at the front of the building 14 years ago.
"She has the whole facade of the building, the front door and the address," says Mr. Bibby.
Ms. Manouchehri's three-storey space takes advantage of the heavy fir posts and beams original to the factory. At the front of the unit, the weathered, wooden factory door now opens to a small, enclosed garden.
"With a lot of conversions, you don't get exterior space," Mr. Bibby points out.
In addition to the three outdoor areas, there's a parking space next to the kitchen door.
Inside, the living room ceiling soars to 24 feet. The main floor provides living room, dining area and kitchen space in a mostly open area divided by a dramatic spiral staircase.
On the second floor, Ms. Manouchehri has created a home office with built-in bookshelves in the den. Doors lead to a large wooden deck. There's also a master bedroom and a bathroom with a glass-enclosed shower and tub.
On the third floor, a second bedroom and third bathroom also have lots of windows and a skylight. Stairs lead to a roof deck at the level of the tree tops.
"It's very private," says Ms. Manouchehri of the deck, which is set above the rooftops of nearby houses.
She purchased the unit, she says, because of the huge amount of sun that streams through the large windows.
"I can't live without light," says the designer. "Having light on three sides of the building, it's so open and airy."
The building's location, between Harbord and College Streets in Little Italy, means that it's quiet at night but also close to bars and restaurants, she adds.
The best feature
The spiral staircase that winds up for three floors through the centre of the unit is crafted of wood and stainless steel.
Ms. Manouchehri says the open stair lets light through to every level and also serves as a sculpture at the centre of the unit.
"Every day you're reminded of this staircase as an art piece because of the way the light does its thing," says Ms. Manouchehri. "It's a house with spirit. It has architectural character."

Full text:   Transforming a century-old downtown house took time, some creative thinking and the inventive use of limited funds
A young professional couple buys an old downtown house and sets to work. They put in a basement apartment; make evening trips to Ikea; learn to do some carpentry; have two babies amid the dust and half-finished projects. It's an old story.
But here's a new ending: the result is attractive and creative enough to qualify as real architecture. The credit is due to Tony Round and Andrea Kordos, of the young architecture firm blackLAB, who transformed an ordinary house on limited funds, using an architect's sensitivity to details and an awareness of the whole picture.
First, the house: near Bloor and Lansdowne, it's a workmanlike two-storey that's stood here for more than a century, with three bedrooms upstairs and now a basement apartment. When they bought it in 2007, Mr. Round and Ms. Kordos, naturally, found lots of work to do. They began with the usual modernist moves - taking out the walls in the middle of the house and opening up the back wall to make room for large glass-and-wood doors. "I think the lesson here is to begin by planning the space properly," says Mr. Round, 33. "The big-ticket faucets and the last layer of materials are what people see, but that's superficial. It can follow in time."
And the details did take a while; the couple were building their careers together at local architecture firm Altius, and starting their family. Their son, now 5, has a three-year-old sister. And as of this year they also have blackLAB, which they've founded with two friends, architect Joe Knight and business manager Sarah Knight. Though none of their projects is complete yet, they've launched strong with a series of renovations and new single-family houses that span from Georgian Bay to deep downtown.
And the Round-Kordos house has been a laboratory to develop their ideas about materials, space and ornament. "A lot of things in this house have been a process of experimentation," says Mr. Round, a Calgary native who met his wife while both were at the University of Waterloo's School of Architecture. The most striking aspect is the mosaic image of a lily that covers one wall of the kitchen. "We wanted to do something fun with it," says Ms. Kordos, 35, who grew up outside Ottawa. "But we didn't want to impede the flow of light into the space."
So they developed an image on an architectural scale. It looks like tile or perhaps printed wallpaper; in fact, it combines a digitally derived image with low-tech handiwork. Ms. Kordos found a picture of a lily online, pixellated it in Photoshop, and printed out key maps to be executed with masking tape and paint. "It was a Friday night and it seemed like a good idea at the time," Mr. Round says with a rueful smile. "It started as a weekend project and wound up taking two weeks of standing at the wall slicing." This move addresses a major theme in contemporary architecture: how to combine traditional ideas and techniques of craft with the computerized design process that defines today's architecture.
For Mr. Round and Ms. Kordos, being their own general contractors has given them a similarly hands-on connection to the handiwork of building. They made their kitchen counters, for instance, out of plywood, and recently gave them a coat of high-gloss white paint. (It's a placeholder, Mr. Round says, but for the moment it looks great.) It steps down from the kitchen island to form a built-in table, good for meals, snack time and crafts. Underneath the counters are a series of Ikea cabinets in three different finishes, mostly bought on sale and installed, like with like, in coherent blocks. Most designers (and do-it-yourself design guides) would advise against this strategy, yet it works. A strong design sense can stretch the smallest budget.
Ikea definitely helped here, too - or, to put it more generally, combining store-bought components with custom ones. A handsome bench extends from the kitchen into the adjacent living room; its guts are kitchen vanities with a white oak veneer, from Ikea's final sale area. They're capped with white back-painted glass - an unusual and handsome choice - and garnished with a few small pieces of custom woodwork. They hide kids' toys and general clutter with style. The overall effect is bespoke; the cost, much less.
Another helpful ingredient was time to think. "We lived for two of three years with the original kitchen," Mr. Round says. When they first moved in, they bought an Ikea kitchen for the basement apartment, "and it stayed in its boxes for two years," Mr. Round says. Their own kitchen took even longer, and they say - convincingly - that taking so long allowed their design ideas to ferment. Along the way, they replaced the back doors and several windows with wood-framed double-hung windows from the Parry Sound, Ont., manufacturer Ross. These are consistent with this "prototypical Toronto house," as Ms. Kordos describes it, and also with the rich, time-steeped combination of woods on the inside of the house.
Outside, they renewed the backyard. In such a small house, "in the summer, the yard is almost an extension of our house," Ms. Kordos says. Here, too, the architects display an uncommon finesse in deploying combinations of materials. The deck, just off the kitchen, blends stained cedar slats and a bench with a seat of unstained wood. It's sized to hold their row of recycling bins underneath, solving another downtown-Toronto challenge. Simple hardware supports an awning of sailcloth, which turns the west-facing porch into a fully usable room.
Just down the steps is the yard - which, since they've ceded space to the 12-foot-long deck, is not enormous. Yet the two took the opposite tactic to what they did inside: rather than unify it, they divided it. Down one side is a long vegetable garden with squash, zucchini and more. The other side is split into a patio; then a seating area with a barbecue and table under a peach tree; and, at the back, a sandbox for the kids with a roof that folds up into an an adjacent bench. "You might think that cutting a backyard into lots of spaces would make it less usable, but somehow creating a series of rooms has expanded its usability," Mr. Round says. "When we had a family reunion with 28 people out there, it worked very well."
And the couple's flair for bargain-hunting solutions is visible here, as well. The ground is covered with irregular squares of slate, in various sizes, that began life as counter-top offcuts. Mr. Round and friends cut and laid them, painstakingly, into a poetic paving that belies their origin as leftovers.
You could say the same about this house. (Or, at least, the parts where renovation is finished; some of the upstairs rooms have yet to get a makeover.) It has been for these architects, like many before them, a training ground for renewing a 19th-century city house. Other such projects are already on their agenda. "We've got a few in the office right now," Ms. Kordos says, "where people want to convert the house, as we have, into a brighter, more livable space, better connected to the backyard."
And they must to be prepared for those conversations. "Definitely," Ms. Kordos agrees. "We spend a lot of time talking with clients about how they want to live: Do they want their toasters on the counter or put away? How often do they entertain and how?" This process of analyzing the space is where domestic architecture should begin, and when the ideas are just right - like Ms. Kordos and Mr. Round have proved at home - the result can be far better than ordinary.

A family-friendly take on Buffett's Giving Pledge

Full text:   Inspired by Charles Bronfman and other billionaires, Canadian business owners are establishing charitable family foundations
Public pledges by Charles Bronfman as well as dozens of U.S. billionaires to give away a big chunk of their fortunes are starting to have an impact on the estate planning of Canadian business owners, private wealth advisers say.
Inspired by the recent high-profile Giving Pledge initiative by billionaire Warren Buffett, owners of small to medium-sized businesses are exploring the idea of establishing charitable family foundations with proceeds from the sale of their businesses, the advisers added. The pledges have "created a bit of a fever among our clients," said Jerry Koonar, a portfolio manager in Calgary with Leith Wheeler Investment Counsel.
"More and more people are talking about it and are doing it," said Marvi Ricker, a vice-president and managing director of philanthropic services for BMO Harris Private Banking.
Pledge-inspired giving has not become a deluge in Canada, but it has sparked conversations. These could prove to be an impetus for higher levels of donations, which have been stagnant in Canada since the 2008 market meltdown.
The conversations intensified this past week after Mr. Bronfman, a Canadian citizen who is based in the United States but is part of a prominent Montreal business family, joined 91 wealthy Americans who have taken up Mr. Buffett's pledge to commit to donating at least half their fortunes to philanthropic causes.
But even among Canadians who can't claim billionaire status, the Bronfmans and Buffetts are role models. Advisers to family businesses say such discussions develop in family companies when the children have no plans to carry on the business and the enterprise is being sold to another party, creating a financial windfall.
It creates a dilemma for parent-owners who do not want to bequeath the entire proceeds to their children - other than, perhaps, the means to gain a high-quality education and a good start. The answer is often a foundation.
"I hear a lot of people say they don't want to give it all to their kids because they are not doing them a favour by leaving them so much money," Ms. Ricker said. This kind of thinking is best captured by Mr. Buffett, who has said he would give his children enough that they would feel like they could do anything, but not so much that they would feel like doing nothing.
Mr. Koonar emphasized that foundations are also a mechanism for adult children to play a continuing role in managing the family legacy.
Brett Wilson, a prominent Calgary investor who is very public about his plans to give away most of his wealth, said he admires Mr. Buffett for rallying interest in charitable giving. But he also warned that Mr. Buffett has only written the first in a 10-chapter book. "Chapter 1 is thinking about releasing your assets. Now let's talk about Chapter 2, which is: How much do your kids really need?"
He points out that while the Buffett pledge focuses attention on the ultrarich, the collective net worth of people with more than $10-million and less than $1-billion is "probably in multiples of the billionaires' wealth" and therefore an excellent potential source of donations.
Any Buffett-inspired jolt to giving would be welcome in the charitable industry, said Ian Bird, president of Community Foundations of Canada, which speaks for 200 local foundations with $3-billion in assets and that dispense annual grants of $200-million. He added that charitable giving to member foundations soared in the good times, around the turn of the millennium, but with the current economic conditions, the annual pledges have flat-lined at about about $200-million a year.
His organization is lobbying for tax benefits to broaden the base of giving, including a "stretch tax credit" to provide an additional incentive for people who are donating money for the first time. For family businesses, there would also be a substantial advantage if Ottawa were to extend tax incentives to people who transfer private company shares and real estate to charities.
That is the goal of Toronto investment banker Donald Johnson, who said he is hopeful the proposal will be considered for next year's federal budget. Mr. Johnson scored a coup in the late 1990s by convincing the government to provide benefits, including capital gains tax breaks, to transfers of publicly listed shares.
Another spur to giving would be if Canada's very rich stepped forward with their own version of the Buffett pledge.
Seymour Schulich, the Toronto-based financier, is a very forthright donor to Canadian educational institutions, and he estimates he will likely donate half his fortune by the end of his life - if he finds the right causes. But he doesn't see a lot of Canada's wealthy people becoming public examples.
"I don't think this is a Canadian thing to do," he explained by e-mail. In Canada, "self-praise is no honour."
*****
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Marvi Ricker, a vice-president of BMO Harris Private Banking, offers some pointers:
Foundations are ideal for people who feel they've been lucky in life, who want to give back, and who wish to leave a legacy.
They provide an opportunity for a donor's children to learn to be stewards of wealth. By being involved in the foundation, adult children get a chance to stay connected with the family legacy.
Family foundations generally average about $1-million in size - although they can be much bigger or smaller.
The one-time cost of setting up a foundation should be, at most, $3,500. There will be annual filing responsibilities.
If you transfer stock or other traded securities to the foundation, you can bypass capital gains tax - and the money grows tax-free in the foundation.
Give the foundation a focus that reflects your own values. Don't see it as just a cheque-writing exercise.
Dialogue is vital, so start the conversation about foundation planning well in advance. Your family should not be learning about your intentions at the reading of the will.

Full text:   Corruption and chaos keep many Western companies away from this continent. But emerging-market powers such as China and Russia have a different attitude and will take the risk in search of outsized profits
Driving north in Africa's copper belt, Mark Crandon marvels at the new factories and offices along the highway. "It's crazy," he says. "None of this was here three weeks ago."
Supermarkets and shopping malls are opening too. They're fresh fuel for his theory that anyone can make money in this corner of Africa. "You could almost blindly open any business here and it would be a success," he says . There's just no competition."
It's an unlikely place for a foreign investor to be raving about. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is one of the world's most corrupt, impoverished and war-torn countries. Millions have died in the military and political chaos of recent years. Yet even here, the lure of the Africa boom is proving irresistible.
In the copper-belt city of Lubumbashi, the nouveaux riches of the mining industry can be spotted at upscale businesses such as La Plage - a glitzy suburban mall with a gelato shop, high-priced supermarket and cafes, not to mention a swimming pool and an artificial sand beach with parasols and volleyball nets.
Mr. Crandon's employer, Renaissance Partners - a unit of leading Moscow-based emerging-markets investment bank Renaissance Group - is making an aggressive gamble on the future of Congo: It is investing $50-million in the first phase of a hugely ambitious 4,000-hectare property development. Luxury homes and retail shops will soon be springing up in the planned "satellite city" of Kiswishi on the outskirts of Lubumbashi.
In both its boldness and the nationality of its creators, Kiswishi (which means "there is wealth") represents the new face of African economic development.
The dramatic rise in trade and investment from the BRIC countries - Brazil, Russia, India and China - provides a crucial source of capital for African countries, new markets for African commodities, and cheap new technology besides.
Annual trade between Africa and the BRIC nations, led by China, has already climbed past $200-billion and is expected to reach $530-billion by 2015. Direct investment in Africa by the BRIC nations is forecast to reach $150-billion by 2015, compared to about $60-billion in 2010.
The sources of foreign investment are changing partly because BRIC investors can more easily tolerate the political risks in African countries than their counterparts in the West.
Renaissance Partners, with its long experience in the rough-and-tumble "wild east" of post-Soviet business, has an instinctive understanding of the hazards of Africa - including the widespread corruption.
Its executives don't blink twice at the unofficial payments they are obliged to give to Congolese soldiers at checkpoints along the road to its property.
"I think the Russian experience has made us more ballsy," says Arnold Meyer, director of African real estate at Renaissance. "What we looked at in Lubumbashi, almost any other company would have walked away from."
The company's appetite for risky ventures is helpful in a country where, apart from the culture of bribery, war still simmers and company assets have been expropriated by the government. Its rivals from Europe and North America face pressure to stay out of conflict zones, as well as a trend among their governments to penalize companies that engage in corruption abroad.
Renaissance Partners, which manages a $750-million investment portfolio, has property developments under way at eight sites across Africa, from Ghana to Zimbabwe, including a planned $5-billion project called Tatu City on the outskirts of Nairobi. The project in Lubumbashi could be the most challenging - and rewarding.
"The political risk is probably the highest in Africa," admits Mr. Crandon, an energetic young South African who is overseeing the satellite city project.
"There's a lot of cash in the city, but it doesn't sit in the formal sector. The middle class is often a lot bigger than you realize from the outside. They're desperate for quality homes and quality infrastructure. It's a city of three million people, with almost zero infrastructure, so the opportunity is just enormous."
But in an age-old pattern, much of the BRIC investment flowing in to Africa is benefiting the political and business elite, rather than ordinary Africans. In Ethiopia, for example, China built a gleaming new $200-million headquarters for the African Union - and supplied surveillance technology to the state telecommunications company. In oil-rich Angola, China spent $600-million to build four new soccer stadiums for the authoritarian government, allowing it to host a prestigious African soccer tournament.
In Congo, many of the villagers who live on Renaissance's development site are worried about the project. They're afraid they could be evicted from the land that Renaissance is now leasing from the government. Even when the company began digging boreholes to provide water for the villages, some were nervous.
"Maybe you're digging the borehole so that you can come here and take water for yourself," a young mother named Mwape Salome told Mr. Crandon in the village of Kintu.
"We're living in fear every day," said Gadi Sept, a farmer in the same village. "We've been informed that we live on someone else's land."
Mr. Crandon tries in vain to reassure them. "There's definitely an air of skepticism here," he admitted later.
If the poorest Congolese are distrustful of the Russian real estate project, they are equally unimpressed by the billions of dollars in foreign investment in the mining industry. They feel that the foreign investments - including those from BRIC countries - are benefiting only a narrow elite.
Congo boasts an estimated $20-trillion in natural resources. But many of its most lucrative assets have gone to mysterious shell companies, often registered in the British Virgin Islands, which have acquired valuable copper and cobalt mines (including former Canadian-owned mines) at a small fraction of their value. Congo has lost $5.5-billion in potential revenue from these shadowy deals, according to an investigation by British MP Eric Joyce.
One of those Canadian assets was the massive Kolwezi tailings project, valued at up to $2.5-billion, which was owned by a joint venture between Vancouver-based First Quantum Minerals, the World Bank and the state mining company, Gecamines. It was seized by the Congo government, and 70 per cent of the asset was secretly awarded for $60-million to four shell companies based in the British Virgin Islands, according to Mr. Joyce's research. Those companies later flipped a majority of their interest to a Kazakhstan firm for $175-million. (First Quantum eventually received $1.25-billion from the Kazakh company in an out-of-court settlement that covered several mining assets.)
In Lubumbashi, some of the harshest criticism has been directed at BRIC investors - including an Indian company, Chemaf, which processes copper and cobalt in several factories around the city. Since arriving a decade ago, Chemaf says it has created 3,000 jobs here. But the air around its main factory is thick with sulphur and dust, and many Congolese are worried it is endangering their health.
Dominique Sango, a 23-year-old bus ticket seller, lifts his shirt to show the scars from the burns he suffered in an acid spill near one of Chemaf's factories this year. A tanker truck, filled with sulphuric acid from a Chemaf plant, flipped over on a road outside Mr. Sango's small house. When he heard the crash, he went outside and fell into the spilled acid.
"It was like a fire inside me," he says. "It was as if the flesh would come off me."
He says he was treated for six weeks at a Chemaf clinic, but was never compensated. The acid flowed into his house, which had to be abandoned, and he was left unemployed. The foreign investment, he says, is "good for those who get jobs." But most people get nothing, he says.
Company officials confirm that the acid came from a Chemaf factory, but they blame the spill on the trucking company involved. They also blame the neighbours for building their houses too close to the factory.
"People living beside a mining company will always complain," says Jo Katembo, deputy manager of the Chemaf plant. "It's like someone whose room is next to the kitchen - he'll always complain of the smell."
The government rejects Chemaf's argument. Moise Katumbi, Governor of Katanga province, where the city is located, says he will shut down the operations if it fails to reduce its pollution.
"[Foreign investors] have a tendency to reduce their standards in Congo," says Katanga's Mines Minister, Barthelemy Mumba Gama. "They're coming with nice words about what they'll do. But when they start working, you see the opposite face."

Abstract: For a modern interpretation, spend an evening at Amaro Bar at Osteria Mozza restaurant in the Marina Bay Sands hotel shopping complex.

Full text:   A quest for the exotic leads The Globe's Catherine Dawson March to Singapore, where the vibrant neighbourhoods, eye-opening temples and colourful traditions create a city that, ultimately, is unlike any she's ever seen
I wanted somewhere exotic, that I hadn't been to before, somewhere I had trouble finding on a map - and somewhere safe: I'd be travelling on my own.
Someone suggested Singapore, the island just off the coast of Malaysia, and since it fit the bill on all accounts, I started packing. I was entering a rare rip in the domestic time-space continuum: I had time off work, my husband didn't and the kids were at their grandparents. No way was I puttering at home that week.
But when I landed - about 20 hours later - I discovered a thriving city that's as much Western as it is Asian. Singapore's multiethnic society reminded me a lot of the multicultural city of Toronto I'd just left. Was I a stranger in a not-so-strange land? Then I saw a man drinking coffee out of a plastic baggie, with a straw.
That discovery pierced through my jet lag, and led to a lively conversation: "Won't it spill? Isn't it too hot?" He found my questions as odd as I found his drink.
It wasn't something I'd expected to see in the modern city state. Since Singapore gained independence from Malaysia in 1965, growth and modernization has occurred at lightning speed for its five million souls. Concert halls, 57-storey hotels and massive landscape design projects by world-renowned architects keep popping up. ("Building cranes," deadpans my guide "are Singapore's national bird." Just like home, I thought.)
Designer shops and high-end restaurants that wouldn't be out of place in New York open all the time. And yet, it is still possible to turn a corner and find yourself in an older neighbourhood, home to one of Singapore's multiple ethnic groups: Malay, Chinese, Peranakan, Tamil and many more. Some say these neighbourhoods are the real Singapore, so I was keen to explore them.
It was in such a 'hood where I found Zul Sumuri - one of the bird men of Singapore - sipping his bagged caffeine.
I'd asked my guide where I could find these ornithological enthusiasts. I'd read about them in one of my kid's books but could find no mention in adult guidebooks. Which is how we ended up driving 20 minutes north of the downtown core to Ang Mo Kio. There are not a lot of tourists in this neighbourhood, but there are a lot of birds - hundreds of caged songbirds hanging from numbered hooks in elaborately carved wooden homes. The noise is deafening but the spectacle is unforgettable. Every Wednesday and Sunday morning, dozens of men bring their birds to this apartment block; some days they hold contests for the longest and loudest birdsong, or the prettiest cage (many are adorned with engraved ivory). "This is my hobby," says Sumuri, 40. He has two birds here today and six more at home. "It's just something men have always done."
The men here are mostly Chinese, as is about 80 per cent of the population. But as I wander over to the kopitiam (coffee shop) to order my own coffee (in a mug), I notice that many more ethnic groups live in the area. The Singapore government, I'm told, has firm rules about keeping the apartment blocks (called housing estates) from filling with families of the same ethnic group. Each building is home to the same number of ethnicities, proportionate to the country's population: Since 74.2 per cent of the population is Chinese, no more than 74.2 per cent of a building's apartments can be sold to Chinese families. The remaining vacancies are filled by Malays (13.4 per cent), Indians (9.2 per cent) and Eurasians, Peranakans and others (3.2 per cent). Everyone needs to get along to keep the economy rolling - and prosperity is Singapore's big trump card in Asia.
The United Nations of faces may feel a lot like home, but in Toronto, under the restraints of work-life routines, I've never walked into mosque or a Hindu or Budhist temple. In Singapore, I am delighted to do all three.
In Kampung Glam, the heart of the Muslim community, I button up a long hooded robe over my shorts and T-shirt and wander through the Sultan Mosque. No one minds if I snap pictures and several elders are happy to answer my questions. Everyone here is welcoming, even at the wedding I seem to have crashed. Family members smile and nod, as I too take pictures of the happy couple.
Walking through Little India the next day, I notice stall after stall of flower vendors stringing elaborate garlands. Garry, my guide, explains they are for Hindus to take to the temple, just down the street. But first he wants me to try ginger tea from his favourite stall in the Tekka Market. I'm not sure why I agreed to drink steaming tea in humid 38 degree weather inside a food court with no air conditioning, but I'm glad I did. It was a bracing, unforgettable cuppa, and only $1.
The Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple is, for me, as eye-opening as the ginger tea. Barefoot, I ring one of the bells on the door (to announce my entrance to the gods) and wander about on my own. I admire intricate carvings of deities, some swathed in fresh garlands, as priests, tourists and devotees pray quietly in the cool corners. At a different Hindu temple in a quieter neighbourhood, I noticed thought-provoking quotes on the walls ("Be like a flower, give happiness and fragrance to all"). But as I leave this place of worship in a busy tourist area, I see another sign: "Those who steal footwear will be handed over to police." These guys don't mess around.
In Chinatown, I can wear my shoes inside the Buddhist Tooth Relic Temple, but must cover my arms and shorts with the wraps provided. Entering, I can see I've hit a home run in my quest for the exotic. Brilliantly covered religious statues and ancestral tablets line the walls, and a service is under way. The rhythmic chanting envelops me and lulls other visitors to lower their cameras and just listen, entranced by the shimmering gold idolatry and rhythmic prayers. Eventually, I tear myself away and head to the upper floors to see Buddha's tooth. This is sacred ground, and photography is not allowed. The tooth is housed in relics of solid gold in a small stupa built on gold tile. All this is kept in a sealed chamber behind thick glass (a nearby monitor offers a close-up shot of the tooth).
Visitors are encouraged to sit on large cushions and meditate, or explore the small pagodas and rooftop orchid garden, where you can ask Buddha to change your fate with three spins of the nearly two-metre-high cylindrical prayer wheel. In a city where orchids grow like daisies, this garden is a stunner with many varieties in full bloom. It's a welcome respite from the hustle and never-ending humidity in the streets below.
I also can't leave this country without exploring Joo Chiat to learn more about the Peranakan culture. Peranakans are descendants of Chinese traders who migrated to Southeast Asia centuries ago and married local women. In the 19th century, many of these families were drawn to Singapore's busy ports.
Garry, who is a fourth-generation Peranakan, wants me try a traditional meal of laksa (rice noodles in a rich, curry soup with bean curd and cockles) and rojak (a salad of pineapple, cucumber, turnip and bean sprouts covered in a peanutty sauce). We find a streetside table at 328 Katong Laksa, which is great for people watching (just order a glass of iced sugar-cane juice to weather the oppressive humidity).
After, we wander down the street to Kim Choo, a shop, restaurant and café specializing in all things Peranakan (111 East Coast Road). The street-side café sells takeaway treats such as ondeh-ondeh (a coconut covered ball filled with palm sugar) and jars of green kaya (a sweet curd egg, caramelized coconut milk and pandan that's spread on toast). But we head up to the second floor so I can browse through the incredible array of batik clothing, beaded shoes and purses, and Swiss voile embroided blouses (called kebaya) . Peranakan families often worked for Singapore's British colonizers, so "Peranakan style is all about the fusion of English and Chinese lifestyles," shop owner Raymond Wong says.
Much of the beadwork and embroidery feature entwined Chinese peonies and English roses, sometimes parrots. The craftsmanship is stunning. The handmade shoes start at $380, while kebayas start at $180. I do less damage to my credit card with a couple of darling fold-away batik fans, which help me survive the heat as we walk up to Koon Seng Road. Here the elaborate colours and design work beloved by the Peranakan people show up on restored shophouse homes. I take loads of pictures: There's nothing quite like them anywhere else in the city - and definitely not back in Toronto.
As I near the end of my week-long escape, I savour my favourite frozen dessert - palm-sugar drenched shaved-ice - and wonder if I'll ever find this in Toronto. Singapore has been a feast for the senses, but I'm just about full. Thankfully, all those "exotic" fruits I've been eating all week - durian, mangosteen, longan, rambutan - no longer seem so strange, and I know just what to look for when I get back home.

IF YOU GO
This is a safe city to travel in at night, but respect the city's rules. And make sure you don't litter, it's a $500 fine. (On the super-clean subway, where you can't eat either, a flower fell out of my hair and my guide scooped it up before it even hit the ground.)
WHERE TO STAY
Shangri-La Hotel Singapore Lushly landscaped, the Shangri-La is true to its name in this busy city. The Garden Wing has had a recent luxe overhaul: the rooms are cushier, the TVs much bigger and the garden around which it's built is a true centrepiece. One lovely amenity includes a daily supply of local fruits to your room. Book a table one night at Shang Palace, one of the best fine-dining Cantonese restaurants in town. Rooms from $395. 22 Orange Grove Road, shangri-la.com/singapore
WHERE TO EAT
Maxwell Food Centre Choose from dozens of stalls. The longest lineup is for chicken rice at Tian Tian ($3). But don't stop there. Wash it down with sugar-cane juice ($1.50) and a box of ondeh-ondeh (coconut balls with a palm-sugar filling) for $3. If it's busy, reserve your table by placing a tissue on your chair - seriously. South Bridge and Maxwell Roads

WHERE TO SWING YOUR SINGAPORE SLING
The one place you shouldn't order a Singapore Sling is the one place most people will tell you to get it: the Long Bar at Raffles Hotel, where the hot-pink drink was invented in the early 1900s. Problem is, today's Long Bar isn't where Noel Coward, Ernest Hemingway and Somerset Maugham tipped back the sweet mix of liqueurs, gin, juice, grenadine and bitters.
Raffles rebuilt its Long Bar into a shopping complex that's beside the famous five-star hotel but not in it. And the famous drink? It's made from a mix, served in a souvenir glass (pay extra if you want to keep it) with a slice of pineapple and maraschino cherry that's sweet enough to make your teeth scream. $30; 1 Beach Road, raffles.com/singapore
On your flight: Singapore Airlines offers it gratis during its drinks service. Flight attendants serve the premade cocktail from a plastic bottle into a plastic glass with a plastic swizzle stick. It's sweet as a Jolly Rancher candy, but free drinks at 30,000 feet? It's hard to complain too much. Free; singaporeairlines.com
At a rooftop bar: At 1-altitude you'll find a true, bartender-made Singapore Sling (no premixes here) and a take-your-breath-away, 360 view of the city. The drink tastes fresh (and not just because you're 63 storeys high), since a heavier hand with the gin makes it a tad less sweet. At night the city lights are dazzling and you can dance with local and expat financiers; in the daytime you can watch the busy harbour and see Malaysia and Indonesia in the distance. $18; One Raffles Place; 1-altitude.com
At a hip restaurant: For a modern interpretation, spend an evening at Amaro Bar at Osteria Mozza restaurant in the Marina Bay Sands hotel shopping complex. The Italian wine list is deep and the cocktails are creative, but see what bar manager and mixologist Lucas Swallows has done to the Singapore Sling. "The recipe has been a subject of hot debate for close to a century. ... Osteria Mozza's version pays homage to the recipe detailed in a 1913 article from the Singapore Weekly Sun. This article made reference to 'a really decent Sling' at the time, which contained 'one cherry brandy, one Domb [i.e., D.O.M. Benedictine], one gin, one lime juice, some ice and [soda] water, [and] a few dashes of bitters.' Our Singapore Sling (1913) emulates this recipe, and as a result, is a much less sweet and delightfully refreshing cocktail that packs a flavourful punch." $22; 10 Bayfront Ave.; marinabaysands.com

Charis Developments aims to produce luxury homes at its Admiral Collingwood Place - a 90-minute drive north of Toronto - that lets residents climb the escarpment rather than a flight of stairs, idle at specialty shops - not in their cars - and unearth fresh produce at a farmer's market - not the weeds on their lawns.
"There comes a time when [homeowners] want no maintenance, underground parking, and they want to lock the door and go to Florida without any worries," says Stephen Assaff, who is the president of Charis Developments and a long-time resident in the small town.
"There are a few condominium buildings in town, but none of them are downtown."
The six-storey building will contain 127 residences - the first batch of them is now on sale - and will also contain ground-floor retail stores along both Hume Street and the historic Hurontario Street.
"It's on a very important corner, not quite like Yonge and Bloor, but in Collingwood, it would be classed as Yonge and Bloor," says Mr. Assaff, who named the project after a school on the site that he and his kids attended.
"It's no secret as to what makes a lively downtown - it's animating it with people walking around and spending money. So this is going to be a great boom to the downtown core."
The town recently refurbished its streets, which are lined with bistros, boutiques and banks, as well as art galleries, Theatre Collingwood and Collingwood Museum.
Recreation is available year-round with the Collingwood Trails Network just beyond the building's front door, a YMCA down the street and ski hills, golf courses and Georgian Bay waterfront all a short drive away. "The area has evolved nicely over the last 20 years," says Mr. Assaff.
As another tie to the area's roots - especially the historic storefronts and heritage lamps - AJ Tregebov Architect designed this red brick and limestone residence with turn-of-the-century architecture.
Local interior designer Marylyn Joel will add her touch to the interiors, where residents will have access to a fitness studio and party room with a kitchen, as well as a modern green roof and 7th floor terrace with a water feature, fire pit, cabanas and barbecue area.
Individual suites will range from one-bedroom-plus-den suites to three-bedroom plus library suites, but with most interest from locals downsizing from single-family or farm properties, many plans average 1,000 to 1,200 square feet with open principal rooms, kitchens and expansive balconies.
Standard features will be upscale, such as nine-foot ceiling, pre-engineered hardwood, porcelain and ceramic tile floors, as well as granite or quartz counters and stainless steel Energy Star appliances.
Units will come with laundry facilities, lockers and parking, plus monthly fees of 39 cents per square foot.
Occupancy is slated for fall of 2014.

Full text:   July's changes to mortgage rules cool the housing market, leaving some first-time buyers in the cold
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Canada's housing market is cooling rapidly in the wake of government changes to mortgage insurance rules, amid suggestions that many potential first-time buyers are opting to remain tenants.
Indeed, the changes made by Finance Minister Jim Flaherty in July appear to be having more of an impact than his earlier attempts.
The latest measure of the housing market, released Monday by the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA), illustrates the extent of the summer slowdown in sales, and has prompted the group to cut its forecasts for both sales and prices.
Sales over the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) system fell 5.8 per cent in August from July, the largest month-over-month decline in two years. The MLS Home Price Index was up 4 per cent from a year ago, but that gain actually marks the slowest rate of increase in more than a year.
"The Canadian housing market has indeed ratcheted down its growth pace," Toronto-Dominion Bank economist Sonya Gulati wrote in a research note after the data were released. "In fact, in most local markets, it has reversed course, with price and sales contractions becoming more the norm."
CREA is now forecasting a drop in sales next year. It expects them to fall 1.9 per cent to 457,800 units. "Activity is expected to ease in all provinces except Alberta and Manitoba, with Ontario registering the largest decline," it said.
It expects the average national home price to rise by just 0.6 per cent this year, to $365,000. And next year, it says it will likely fall one-tenth of a per cent to $364,500, with Ontario and B.C. seeing small price declines while other provinces see modest gains.
As evidence mounted that rock-bottom interest rates were fuelling house prices and consumer debt loads, Mr. Flaherty has changed mortgage insurance rules four times, each time making it more difficult for consumers to take on housing-related debt.
While the three previous rounds crimped both housing activity and the demand for credit, economists and real estate industry experts say this latest round, which took effect July 9, looks as if it is having a bigger impact.
One reason the July changes seem to be more effective is that Ottawa learned its lesson. With the first set of changes in 2008, Mr. Flaherty gave consumers more than three months' notice before the new rules took effect. As a result, many buyers who wanted to make a move under the old regime had time to do so. In the following two rounds, he gave roughly two months' notice. This time, he shocked the market with just 18 days' warning.
And the latest changes, which include cutting the maximum length of an insured mortgage from 30 years to 25 years, are bigger because they build on the previous moves.
A number of economists, real estate agents, and industry observers say that many prospective first-time buyers have found themselves unable to secure a mortgage, especially in Toronto and Vancouver, and are therefore remaining renters.
Paula Roberts, a mortgage broker based in Markham, Ont., said one of her clients, a young teacher, was preapproved under the old rules, but now that she has found a home she likes, is having trouble securing the mortgage.
The changes are still filtering their way through the system, but Mr. Flaherty suggested to The Globe and Mail in an interview Friday that they are doing what he intended and he is no longer worried about a real estate bubble. "What I am seeing now in the most recent data is quite clear evidence that there is no boom," he said.
Other observers continue to be troubled by the market and mortgage debt loads. David Madani, a bearish economist at Capital Economics, reiterated his forecast Monday that house prices will fall 25 per cent in the next year or two.

The Internet is an overstuffed investor's toolbox full of useful gadgets you never knew were there. Here are 13 examples you can bookmark to complement your go-to online investing resources.
FOR HISTORICAL RETURNS
TMX Money
One way to take the stock market's temperature is to look at the price-earnings ratio and dividend yield for a benchmark stock index. The place to find this data for Canada's most widely following indexes is TMX Money, a website for investors that is run by the Toronto Stock Exchange's parent company.
Click on an index name, scroll down the page and you'll find PE and yield data current to the previous market close.
Curious about how much extra yield you can get by investing in preferred shares over financial stocks? The S & P/TSX Preferred Share Index had a yield of 4.9 per cent recently, compared to 4.3 per cent for the S & P/TSX Capped Financials Index. Note: You can invest in both indexes using exchange-traded funds.
Stingy Investor
Nothing makes the case for diversifying your portfolio like having year-by-year data on the investing categories that have soared and cratered over the years. Think gold is a can't-miss investment? Gold was the best performer among 12 investing categories in 2002, with a gain of 24.4 per cent. In 2003, it was second-worst with a loss of 1.5 per cent and in 2004 it was dead last after losing 3 per cent.
The source of this information is the Periodic Table of Annual Returns for Canadians, which can be found on the Stingy Investor website. The data goes back to 1970, and you can adjust it for before- or after-inflation returns. By the way, Stingy investor is a great website if you're interested in value investing, which essentially means buying the shares of undervalued companies.
BigCharts.com
The specialty here is stock charting, which you can find on any number of investing websites these days. What's harder to find is a database like the one BigCharts keeps on historical share price data. Yes, Canadian stocks are included. Just type CA: in front of the ticker, as in CA:SU. Stock splits are noted.
StockCharts.com
It's both illuminating and depressing to look at long-term performance charts for major stock indexes. Oh, to have been an investor in the 1990s, when the Dow Jones industrial average, Nasdaq composite and S & P 500 all soared. Want to see for yourself? Then check out the historical chart gallery on the StockCharts.com website.
PWL Capital
Wow, have real estate investment trusts ever done well in the past few years. Small stocks are just the opposite. For investors interested in buying low and selling high, data like this can be quite useful. But where can you find it?
The money management firm PWL Capital has a page on its website where you can download both short- and long-term performance numbers for major stock and bond indexes.
The numbers are updated monthly, and they include both Canadian- and local currency returns for non-Canadian indexes. Check out the long-term numbers for stocks. They're quite impressive, even if the five-year numbers stink.

Vancouver looks at adding homes by 'thinning' streets

Full text:   Boosters say scheme offers a road to practical, high-density inner-city housing
It's a lazy afternoon at 13th and Balaclava, a residential neighbourhood in the heart of Vancouver's West side.
On one stretch of road, a single car is parked next to an old arts and crafts-style house. The only traffic is a Siamese cat, ambling slowly toward the other side.
In spite of the relative calm, a woman in her 80s who's lived here for 40 years is challenging planners Ted Sebastian and Christina DeMarco about their award-winning plan for developing affordable housing in the city.
"Are you those 'thin streets' people?" she asks warily before giving the team who won the city's re: THINK HOUSING contest a piece of her mind. Her tirade is undoubtedly fuelled by a flood of largely critical and often fear-mongering letters to the editor in local papers about the plan.
While some of her concerns - such as a new monster home adjacent to her smaller-footprint 1930s bungalow that is "blocking her sunlight" - might actually be mitigated by the plan. She also complains that thinner streets would not leave room for parking.
After Ms. DeMarco tries to allay her fears and the senior heads back home, she sighs and says, "The parking concern is one we hear a lot." But gesturing to the lone parked car in the area, she says, "there's enough room for cars and people here." Indeed, what the thin streets plan is, in many ways, is another form of reclaiming streetscape from the automobile.
Ms. Demarco points out that streets in Toronto's Kensington Market are thin - and she celebrates cities such as London that have "transformed vehicle-dominant areas into pedestrian-friendly areas." Piccadilly Circus, she notes, is no longer a 'circus' (roundabout) but a pedestrian plaza, and Trafalgar Square has greatly benefited from the road between the National Gallery and the square being given over to pedestrian traffic.
The Vancouver plan was born two decades ago, when Ms. Demarco and Mr. Sebastian used to commute together by bicycle from their respective homes in Point Grey to their jobs as planners at city hall.
"We used to take 13th Avenue because it was so fast," she explains, "and we were amazed at how deserted the north-south corridors were." The two immediately saw the potential for a plan that would narrow streets and allow for higher density and more affordable housing.
In essence their idea is to take the wide 66-foot expanse between existing north-south street right of ways that characterize most Vancouver neighbourhoods and divide them into equal parts. This would produce two new 33-foot residential lots per block and a narrower 33-foot right of way.
According to their plan, the new lots would be developed for affordable housing while the 33-foot right of way with a 17-foot thin street would include a pedestrian sidewalk, a parking lane for cars and bikes, and a boulevard for street trees, Ms. Demarco and Mr. Sebastian contend that their proposal would quite literally pave the way for up to 20,000 new units of "ground-oriented housing" and would additionally establish an endowment fund of up to $4-billion from the lease of new lots that would support affordable housing and neighbourhood amenities such as parks.
Furthermore, they say their plan would allow for avoidance of rezonings and demolition of established housing. One proposed scheme would consolidate the new lot with the adjacent property, allowing for up to 24 units per block.
Concerns expressed in local coffee klatches and letters to the editor include issues around municipal services like sewers, water and gas, telephone and electrical services as well as parking.
But these are mitigated, say Ms. DeMarco and Mr. Sebastian, by their focus on north-south streets - relatively free of underground services - and used less often for resident parking than the east-west fronts of houses.
The plan was rebuffed by city hall bureaucrats in the mid 90s - when it was initially presented as a way to create revenue at a time when budgets were being slashed - and again in 2004.
But if the current city council approves the plan this fall, a demonstration project could begin as soon as November.
Peter Ladner, who brought forth a motion to city council in 2004 ("eventually watered down until it became meaningless and unworkable," he says) to try a thin streets pilot project, notes, "At the highest level, the plan puts wasted street space to better use."
However, he contends that it's "fraught with complications and may not work everywhere and for everyone, but it's definitely worth looking into."
Getting neighbourhoods to sign off on the plan could be tricky, he says, and any "imposition" has to "involve a lot of consultation and some compensation."
The bottom line, says Mr. Ladner, is that " we have great, open, super-wide streets that are basically just wasting space," but he observes that "Maybe things have changed - we've come to some tipping point where there's more tolerance for converting road space into other more productive uses."
While opinions on the proposal differ, one thing is certain: neighbourhoods like the one at 13 th and Balaclava must evolve or die. As fewer young families and singles can afford to live in the city and elderly residents who prefer to stay in their homes need extra income, the thin streets plan offers a practical, higher-density alternative to inter-generational living.
"With more people living in the neighbourhood," says Mr. Sebastian, "local businesses will thrive and residents will be less automobile-dependent because they can walk to shops."
Today at least, as the odd cat crossing is interrupted by the rarest of vehicles, and only occasional Philippina nannies with strollers, it's easy to imagine this sleepy neighbourhood as one that could be humming with new life - only a few short years - and thinner streets - from now.

Abstract: The Agent's Take: "For somebody looking to get into the market - particularly a loft space - hard lofts conversions are very difficult to come by," says agent [Anil Khera]. "It's not ideal for the first-time buyer who wants to be closer to downtown, but here, the value proposition is that you're getting almost 1,100 square feet in the low $300,000s."

"You could build a 5,000-square-foot house with no problem." The outdoor surroundings, parks and schools, among other things, made the location desirable. "The nicely tiered yard has a vegetable garden, pond, outdoor fire pit and a working well, in addition to lots of space for parking, equipment and even a RV," Mr. Roy adds. "The house is situated near the top of a hill with views to downtown Vancouver and North Shore mountains."

Full text:   Process innovation allowed Russel Metals to bounce back from calamity in 2009, regaining its global leader ranking
It was early in 2009, and Brian Hedges couldn't believe the numbers he was seeing. In his 15 years as CFO at Russel Metals Inc., he had been through his share of market cycles and had come to appreciate what he calls "the stability of the metals business."
Then, just as he was readying his transition into the CEO's office, the recession sent the company off a cliff: a 40-per-cent drop in volume in a single quarter.
"I had modeled lots of scenarios to figure out how we would manage them," Mr. Hedges said wryly, "but I can guarantee you that I had never modeled that kind of calamity."
For Russel Metals - which operates an expansive network of metals service centres for the North American oilpatch, construction and manufacturing sectors - it had the potential to be a crippling blow. The Mississauga-based company reported a loss of $1.54 per share in 2009, compared with record profits of $3.68 per share just one year before.
Indeed, that lone bad year knocked Russel Metals out of the group known as Canada's Global Leaders - the annual list of Canadian-based companies that rank among the world's top five in their industry, compiled by the Toronto-based think tank Institute for Competitiveness and Prosperity (ICP). Suddenly, Russel Metals was poised to go from global leader to minor player.
But the strategy that had made Russel Metals a global leader in the first place is also what saved it from catastrophe: fostering an entrepreneurial culture that can respond quickly to changes in the marketplace.
"That's not easy to do in a large, publicly traded corporation with $3-billion in revenues," said Mr. Hedges, who became CEO in May of 2009. "We make sure that our corporate staff are resources to the field, not dictators to the field."
Mr. Hedges explained: "Head office negotiates price with suppliers, but never places the orders. I don't ever want to hear one of my service centres complain that head office sent them a bunch of inventory they never asked for and can't sell."
That strategy allowed Russel Metals to bounce back fast. The company, already lean on inventory, was able to immediately scale back orders. "In the first quarter of 2009 we lost a billion in revenue, but by the second quarter we were making money again," Mr. Hedges said.
In a mere two years, Russel's revenues have risen from their low of $1.97-billion to $2.69-billion in 2011 - and a return to grace among ICP's list of 89 Canadian global leaders.
The upswing continues. Last week Russel made its latest nimble move: an agreement to acquire Apex Distribution Inc., one of North America's largest oilfield supply companies, with nearly $500-million in revenues generated through 44 locations in Canada and 14 in the United States.
Fewer than 20 years ago, Russel Metals had been the opposite of nimble - just one arm of Federal Industries Ltd., a 1980s conglomerate that had lumbered into the late 1990s with assets that included Cashway stores, the bookseller WH Smith, and the White Pass Railway, a relic of the Klondike Gold Rush that ran between Alaska and the Yukon.
Following a 1997 proxy battle, won by Prem Watsa's Fairfax Holdings, most of Federal's retail and transportation assets were divested and the company was renamed for its new focus on metals.
"Focus has truly become the name of the game," said Jim Milway, who recently stepped down as ICP executive director, but who has overseen the research on Canada's Global Leaders since its inception.
"The Edper and Brascan model is not dominant any more [their remains now exist in the form of Brookfield Asset Management]. The global market is such a tough one to face every day. Companies just can't be that good at too many things."
Another firm on the ICP's Global Leaders list, the aerospace firm Heroux-Devtek, also achieved global dominance by focusing, then expanding, on its core business. Heroux-Devtek is the world's third-largest designer and manufacturer of airplane landing gear systems, reporting revenues of $380-million and gross profits of $64.7-million for 2012.
CEO Gilles Labbé said the merger between Heroux and Devtek in 2000, followed by a number of strategic acquisitions south of the border, turned the company from a parts manufacturer into a full-service landing gear firm.
"It became possible for us to bid on contracts to design and build prototype landing gear systems for new aircraft," he said. His small team of 15 engineers has grown to nearly 100, complete with its own facility for testing new designs.
Mr. Milway lauds Heroux-Devtek as a company that has achieved global dominance through a singular focus on product innovation. "Our research has shown that most global leaders achieve success through innovation rather than invention," he said. It's less important to invent a brand-new product or service than to keep finding creative ways to improve existing products.
Russel Metals, for its part, grew not through product innovation but process innovation: designing a corporate structure that gave its distribution centres as much autonomy as possible. It's a structure that has allowed Russel to acquire smaller, entrepreneurial businesses without losing the entrepreneurs driving their success.
"We pay a premium for those entrepreneurs' relationships," Mr. Hedges said. One oilpatch acquisition was so relationship-driven he said the company didn't even have real estate; the entrepreneur was storing inventory in trucking yards. "If the people go home, you lose the goodwill and the knowledge of the local market."
Those kinds of acquisitions can sometimes be difficult to find. The company assesses hundreds of buying opportunities each year. Some sellers are serial entrepreneurs who want to go on to the next thing. Others are looking to cash out and kick back. According to Mr. Hedges, neither makes a good fit. "We've walked away from some pretty good deals because we felt the sellers had lost their passion for the business," he said.
Russel also made key acquisitions south of the border, including JMS Metals in 2007 and Norton Metals in 2008, giving them a strong U.S. market presence stretching from the rust belt states of Illinois and Indiana through to the Midwest and into Texas.
Mr. Milway said both Russel Metals and Heroux-Devtek are prime examples of firms that grew globally through careful, targeted foreign acquisitions.
"We first began the Global Leaders list as a response to fears that Canada was being 'hollowed out' of corporate head offices," he said. "Canadians have the mistaken impression that our firms only ever get purchased by others. Our global leaders are buyers. We can turn the tables when it comes to acquisitions. We already do."

Full text:   Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists see opportunity in the battered border cities of Windsor and Detroit
Entrepreneurs Lois Li and Joshua Rammage discovered that when you have an idea for a startup, there's no reason to let a border get in the way.
Ms. Li, a law student at the University of Windsor, met Mr. Rammage, a business student at Detroit's Wayne State University, last year at an international networking event on alternative energy in Detroit.
Each had a similar idea about creating diesel fuel from waste cooking oils and animal fats collected from restaurants and homes. They decided to submit a business plan at a competition held in the spring to promote entrepreneurship in economically challenged Windsor.
They didn't win, but the University of Windsor admitted them to a summer program that netted them $8,000 in grants and the advice of mentors to develop their company, Domestic Diesel Ltd.
An increasing number of entrepreneurs, mentors and venture capitalists are recognizing the advantages of setting up shop in the border cities of Windsor, Ont., and Detroit, which share an unenviable reputation as the rustiest parts of the industrial rust belt.
"Windsor has a big advantage," Ms. Li said. "The local real estate prices ... are much lower than in other places in Ontario. And being a cross-border city, we have the option of selling in Michigan."
Detroit is battling a stereotype that it's a one-horse town, heavily dependent on jobs in the auto industry, which has shifted production to facilities in other cities.
"While we've been shaped by automotive, we have a lot of strengths in many industries," said Olga Stella, vice-president of business development at the non-profit Detroit Economic Growth Corp. "We're doing well in knowledge-based jobs, education and medicine. There is still real R & D and real people making real things. People who recognize that are capitalizing on that."
It's natural for Windsor to encourage partnerships with the bigger market and resources across the river, said Karen Plunkett, president of Windsor and Essex County non-profit WEtech Alliance, one of 14 Regional Innovation Centres in Ontario, financed through the Ontario Network of Excellence. WEtech is developing cross-border initiatives between industry and academia.
WEtech's office in a former bingo hall on a major Windsor street provides work space, computer access and mentoring for startups. In 18 months of operation, it has hosted 84 Canadian startups in sectors including information technology, biomedical and green technology, and agricultural tech, Ms. Plunkett said.
Mentoring is a key element. The alliance offers workshops in co-operation with Toronto's MaRS Discovery District, with eight Windsor-area entrepreneurs and a lawyer providing advice to small and medium-sized companies on developing business plans and managing.
"I wish I had an organization like WEtech when I got started," said Ms. Plunkett, whose experience as an entrepreneur includes starting a craft brewery in Windsor. "It can be a bit lonely for an entrepreneur."
The Internet and shared interests in economic growth is also spawning a cross-border venture capital community.
Mike Labiak, Windsor-based chief operating officer of Essex Angel Capital, met Rick Galdi, the venture capital firm's CEO who lives in the Detroit suburb of Birmingham, at a networking event organized by the Canadian Consulate-General in Detroit to promote cross-border activity. They formed their company a year ago and have already made two successful investments.
One is in 3 Gyros Inc., a Windsor startup whose zero-calorie, gluten-free salad dressings were initially sold only in Canada but are now now being distributed to U.S. Wal-Mart stores. The other, Wellness Indicators Inc., is a medical device company that is planning an international launch of its screening equipment for early symptoms of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
While Essex Angel has office space in Windsor, "most of what we do is virtual," said Mr. Labiak, who spends most of his time in Canada while Mr. Galdi works in Michigan. "Both cities are interweaved economically and it's important to have eyes on both sides of the border," Mr. Labiak said.
Meanwhile, some deep pockets who have been investing in startups in Detroit are starting to look across the border. "It's an entrepreneurial time in Detroit. The whole city feels like a startup now. People are looking for ways to reinvent the city's economy," said Jake Cohen, vice-president of Detroit Venture Partners LLC.
Other partners in the investment company include Dan Gilbert, the owner of Quicken Loans, and Josh Linkner, founder of online promotions company ePrize. Its most recent partner is Earvin (Magic) Johnson, the former National Basketball Association star who is from Michigan and became an entrepreneur running a string of franchise coffee shops and sports centres.
Detroit Venture Partners has invested as much as $3-million (U.S.) in a dozen tech companies in Detroit, but it has its sights set on opportunities in Ontario too, Mr. Cohen said.
"We've been networking with Windsor people and had brainstorming efforts to bring the two communities together," Mr. Cohen said. "When we think of cities where we can find tech talent, we think of Windsor, London and Toronto, and we've been watching the whole tech cluster around Waterloo."
The prospect of a second bridge linking Detroit and Windsor has increased interest in business collaboration on both sides of the border, said Sabrina DeMarco, executive director of the Small Business Centre of the WindsorEssex Economic Development Corp.
The centre has also been working with TechTown, an incubator and business accelerator program operated through Wayne State University with support from private donors. The University of Windsor's Centre for Enterprise and Law has also been working with TechTown to promote cross-border entrepreneurship.
Of course, the two cities still face a stark economic reality. Detroit has made significant cuts in services and staff this year and still faces the threat of bankruptcy. But in the eyes of Ms. Stella of the Detroit Economic Growth Corp., that marks a tipping point.
"It's an ideal opportunity for entrepreneurs who want to build something new and innovative. Detroit became the auto city, thanks to entrepreneurs like Henry Ford," she said.
The city has always been reinventing itself, Ms. Stella added. After a fire in 1805, the city adopted the motto: "It shall rise again from the ashes."

BUSINESS CYCLES
The person
In 2011, Zak Pashak, 31, moved from Calgary to Detroit, where he founded Detroit Bikes. He now has 10 employees.
He moved because he is fascinated by Detroit and its history of manufacturing: "Not to knock Canada, but there's a sense of camaraderie in the business community in Detroit."
Past experience included running pubs and music clubs in Calgary and Vancouver.
The plan
To build and distribute "Made in Detroit" bicycles, counting on the cachet of U.S. manufacturing in a market dominated by Asian imports.
Pros and cons
Benefits of his move include inexpensive real estate (he bought a 50,000-square-foot building for $190,000) and easy financing. "When I went into the bank to open a business account, the staff almost cheered." Also, the U.S. market is large and there is easy access to Canada.
However, providing private health-care coverage for a staff of 10 costs at least five times as much as in Canada.

Abstract: "This is an interactive tool where you can stand in a room, a lobby or a landscape area and manipulate the space and discuss it," said architect Paul Sapounzi, a partner with +VG Architects, which designed the Woodlands library. "This is a working tool," he added. "It's not a gimmick."

Full text:   Technology allows clients to visualize condos, offices and restaurants, even neighbourhood projects, before they're built
Months before construction this fall of Woodlands library in central Mississauga, Ont., branch librarians walked around the 7,000-square-foot space with all the bookshelves and furniture in place, as if it existed.
Was it science fiction? No.
The Woodlands librarians had a virtual experience, made possible by interactive three-dimensional technology that creates the illusion of depth and perspective using stereoscopic (3-D) projectors illuminating images on four sides of a booth-like space. Stepping into the booth, they responded to the design as if it were real, peering around bookshelves, passing through doorways and standing in the parking lot to get a feel for the space and identify potential trouble spots.
Architects, real estate developers and design professionals say the "immersive" environment, which creates a virtual rendering on a life-size scale, has the potential to change the conversation with their layman clients.
"This is an interactive tool where you can stand in a room, a lobby or a landscape area and manipulate the space and discuss it," said architect Paul Sapounzi, a partner with +VG Architects, which designed the Woodlands library. "This is a working tool," he added. "It's not a gimmick."
Developed by Christie Digital Systems Canada Inc., a Kitchener firm with an international reputation in digital projection systems, the technology is one of several 3-D visualization devices being commercialized by Reality Cave Inc., a local, privately held incubator startup.
Reality Cave opened its first 3-D design centre, built at a cost of $5-million, here last December. It's betting there will be a growing industry demand to visualize condos, offices and restaurants, even large-scale neighbourhood projects, before they are built.
Since the opening, the company has signed almost 20 members from industry and government, said company vice-president Jeff Botham. In a golf course-style membership, annual fees range between $1,000 and $5,000, with a pay-as-you-use charge of $1,000 per hour at the Kitchener design centre.
He said the company aims to set up five design centres worldwide by the end of 2014, including one in Toronto next year. Exploiting various sophisticated technologies - the 12 projectors have a total of 24 million pixels - the design centres are not portable: The client has to go to them.
That's why Sue Coles, area manager for Mississauga Library Services, and 30 city officials from various departments trekked to Kitchener last January for a virtual tour of Woodlands library, which will cost $2.8-million to build. The architectural drawings were loaded into encrypted software and illuminated by the projectors positioned at different angles to create the illusion of reality.
Wearing special sensor "tracking" glasses and manipulating a joy stick to guide her through the space, Ms. Coles stepped into the theatre-like booth (5.6 metres wide, three metres tall and three metres deep) to immerse herself and her colleagues in the design. They stood at the library check-out desk and saw that the height of some book shelves and display obscured their view of the children's reading area. A vertical duct leading from an electric fireplace created another visual barrier.
In response, the architect made small adjustments to the design.
"This was an opportunity to be in the library without having to build the library [first]," Ms. Coles said. "It is fine to see it on a piece of paper but another thing to walk through the space and see the shape and size of things and the relationship between the spaces."
Previously, the Mississauga officials would have examined a scale model or a two-dimensional animated fly-through of the design.
"We were able to sense a sense of the volume of the space," said Kendall Wayow, project manager for the library, and a member of the Mississauga delegation that day.
"We caught some issues that needed to be adjusted and tweaked the design," he added. "It will help save the project money."
Kitchener commercial real estate broker John Whitney sees the potential for better communication between industry experts and clients.
"Most people, whether it's a house purchase or a renovation, just can't look at a 2-D plan and say 'that will work,'" he said. "What this Reality Cave experience does, is to let people visualize something that is not there yet."
Laird Robertson, a partner in Kitchener-based Robertson Simmons Architects Inc., said 3-D visualizations could also facilitate disputes between developers and municipal officials during site-plan approvals.
"We spend hours trying to show them things to convince them that what they say they are going to experience is not true," Mr. Robertson said.
With a 3-D view of a project, he said, "they could walk around a space and get a sense of its verticality, see the colours, textures and dimensions, and see tree landscaping and parking."
The City of Waterloo recently incorporated Reality Cave into a citizen engagement strategy to imagine new uses for a former elementary school on a half-acre site in a mature neighbourhood. Once competing developers present suggestions for new uses of St. Louis school, purchased earlier this year by the city, residents will be able to review the designs in a 3-D format.
Waterloo chief executive officer Tim Anderson likens the 3-D experience to "a virtual open house" that could elevate public engagement.
"If we can demonstrate and visualize what is being proposed in a tangible way, it is better for everyone," said Mr. Anderson. "It is a powerful tool that has the potential to change the way we do business."
*****
PUB PERFECTIONISM
The owners of Morty's Pub, a 31-year-old Waterloo, Ont., landmark half a block from Wilfrid Laurier University, plan to add a second pub in a former variety store opposite the university.
They plan to use Reality Cave for a three-dimensional imagining of the proposed 2,500-square-foot restaurant, well before the start of construction next year.
"It takes out the element of surprise," said Jay Taylor, co-owner of the current pub named for his father. With a virtual walk-through of the proposed layout, Mr. Taylor said he will be able to see if, for example, the chef needs more room to work or if the route from kitchen to tables is workable for wait staff.
"The point is to make it just the way I want it."

LISTING AND CO-OP AGENTS
Louise Boutin and Nadia Doucet, Re/Max Crest Realty Westside
The Action: Less than a five minute drive east of Queen Elizabeth Park, this detached, two-storey house had private showings and public open houses hosting hundreds of visitors. Two offers were made immediately, but the one that was accepted fell apart.
Fortunately, a third bid drafted a few days later turned out to be a solid deal.
What They Got: This 23-year-old house has 1,988-square-feet of interior living space, a central backyard and patio, and a double garage on the back portion of a 33-by-98-foot lot.
Highlights indoors include gas fireplaces in the rear family room and entertaining space by the dining room on the main floor, as well as a grand foyer with a winding staircase to three bedrooms and two out of four bathrooms upstairs.
The basement could be used as a one-bedroom suite as it has a separate entrance, second kitchen, living area and bathroom.
The Agent's Take: "Fraser is up-and-coming, so people are starting to look in the area, and the prices are reasonable under that million-dollar mark," says agent Louise Boutin. "It was well located close to the bus to the SkyTrain and there is a park right across the street."
While this house is standard of the local housing stock, it had some bonuses.
"It had a nice staircase and crystal chandelier from the second floor down and it had skylights and tile roofing," adds Ms. Boutin.

FINDING THE MISSING LINKS

Abstract: This tartan of beauty and charm hasn't yet made the Gulf coast prosperous; the next step depends on Inverness and Cabot Links. Despite the resort's deepening footprint, it faces an uphill battle to conquer Cape Breton's distant reputation and North America's contracting golf market. [Ben Cowan-Dewar] takes heart in [Mike Keiser]'s experience at Bandon.

Full text:   A decidedly modern lodge overlooking the greens and the Gulf of St. Lawrence at Cabot Links is catapulting Cape Breton from Celtic kitsch to laid-back luxe. The Globe's Guy Nicholson checks in, tees off and vows to return again and again
It's six-twenty-something and the sun is rising on a shoulder of Cape Breton highland. Fishing boats bob in a protected harbour, foxes scamper through the beach's marram grass-peppered dunes and a gull pecks at something that can't be identified but smells unmistakably of ocean.
The scene is repeated every morning in countless coastal idylls on Cape Breton, which Travel + Leisure magazine famously rated one of the world's very best islands for visitors. And yet many of them have come away underwhelmed by the infrastructure and services.
Which is where this shoulder of highland, this harbour, this grass, this beach - plus a game-changing new seaside golf course - have entered the picture. The tiny former coal-mining community of Inverness is being reshaped, and the island's beautiful but underdeveloped Gulf of St. Lawrence coast is along for the ride.
After decades of false starts, Cabot Links is finally draped across the former mine site between Inverness and its three-kilometre beach. The course, Canada's only true links, has been feverishly anticipated in North American golf circles for years. Ten holes and a restaurant opened last year, and just weeks after June's official opening of the full 18 and Cabot Links Lodge, the development is already redefining the community: visually, economically and even culturally.
Cabot Links was built for golf, but the development is bringing an entirely new standard of service to Cape Breton, tilting its tourist map toward Inverness and the surrounding region. In a market previously typified by economy lodgings and floral bedspreads, Cabot's hotel and food are distinctly upscale and modern - "barefoot luxe" on the Gulf, acknowledged from opening day as the best the island has to offer.
Ben Cowan-Dewar, an impeccable 33-year-old Toronto-born entrepreneur, spent eight years navigating local and provincial politics, enticing investors, finessing land purchases, vetting course design candidates and relocating his family on the way to fulfilling a lifelong dream of building a great golf course.
Still, "as much as I love golf, I've come to love food even more," he says over a glass of California cabernet and Nova Scotia lamb. This evening, Cowan-Dewar and his wife Allie Barclay are playing host to a large table of friends and visitors at Panorama. The restaurant overlooks half the golf course, the beach and the Gulf through its two dozen windows, although there's a tendency to focus on the plate when the food arrives.
Panorama's "are-we-really-in-Cape-Breton" menu, overseen by husband-and-wife chefs John Haines and Tracy Wallace, has quickly won over tourists and islanders alike.
The evening's smash hit is lobster-stuffed chive ravioli, an appetizer that's come recommended by the starter on the first tee and several others. It's full of texture, salty and spicy and creamy all at once.
Our table is heaving with the kind of high-end visitors Cabot Links hopes to attract: a Toronto investment banker, a prominent Halifax doctor, a former media executive and others, most with non-golfing spouses who are just as tickled to be here.
These are the kind of details Cowan-Dewar and his principle partner, American golf developer Mike Keiser, have spent years chewing over. Barrier-free WiFi? In-room espresso? Sunset vistas across the links from each and every room? Check, check and check.
Keiser's wildly successful Bandon Dunes project on the coast of Oregon has served as a test. Case in point: While Bandon's inn serves its golfing patrons well, the washrooms haven't fully met the needs of non-golfing guests, Cowan-Dewar says. At Cabot's 48-room lodge, the spacious washrooms average 95 square feet, replete with indulgent tubs, shower stalls and his-and-her sinks.
It all still feels a little surreal for Inverness, whose 2,000-plus residents are still adjusting to the rapid lurch from second fiddle to top bill.
On previous visits over the past decade, the vast beach and its sunset view seemed like consolation prizes for the community's high unemployment rate and declining fortunes. Now, new businesses are opening, traffic is becoming an issue and unfamiliar faces are prowling the back streets for lots with views of that very beach.
(Local sellers are putting some "very silly prices" on some of it, said one agent, shaking his head at property listed for double to quintuple its previous worth.)
Residents are seeing increasing numbers of people "from away" turning up in golf shirts at the harness track, the coffee drive-thru and the Hoff, a local roadhouse. A new driving range has been hacked from the bush north of town and planted with grass seed. Expectations are changing.
Back at Cabot Links, a few details are still being ironed out. Workers are finishing a bank of rooms, the on-course trash bins remain on order and a few of Cabot's young staff continue to feel their way through the nuances.
"The majority of our staff have not worked at the higher end of hospitality, or in hospitality at all. They've been hired for their incredible attitudes and we feel that we can teach them everything else," says general manager Andrew Alkenbrack, recruited from the luxury Aman Resorts chain with a mandate to get the details right.
Between golf, food and the region's growing charms, it's tempting to spend a week in Inverness itself. But all of Cape Breton is within easy range, making the town and its services a good base for golfers, families, even budget travellers.
The island can be completely circumnavigated by car in less than 10 hours, so anything is possible as a day trip - even the Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Site, at the opposite tip, which can be reached in less than three hours and is worth the effort.
But it's the Gulf coast that will get the real boost, now that visitors have a high-end option to trump the central B & Bs of Baddeck and remote Keltic Lodge in Ingonish.
After crossing the Canso Causeway from the mainland, many visitors make a beeline for the Cabot Trail, which begins near the island's centre and winds through the pastoral Margaree Valley to Cheticamp and the highlands. It's a traditional journey with roots in the dirt tracks of the settlers, but it bypasses some of Cape Breton's best scenery and culture on the Ceilidh Trail.
From the causeway, the Ceilidh Trail emerges at Creignish, high above the St. Lawrence, where if you stand on your toes, you might see 30 kilometres across St. George's Bay in clear weather. Judique and Mabou are all about Celtic culture and the snug Red Shoe Pub, owned by the musical Rankin family. The Glenora Inn, south of Inverness, offers tours and seminars at North America's first single-malt whiskey distillery, rooms, and a restaurant that might be second only to Cabot's Panorama.
Try anything made with the in-house spirits, especially the palette-cleansing whisky sorbet.
North past Inverness, the rugged shore harbours warm-water beaches and the pretty harbour at Margaree Harbour and Belle Cote, where drivers can pick up the Cabot Trail for Acadian flavour, whale-watching at Cheticamp and the iconic Cape Breton Highlands National Park.
This tartan of beauty and charm hasn't yet made the Gulf coast prosperous; the next step depends on Inverness and Cabot Links. Despite the resort's deepening footprint, it faces an uphill battle to conquer Cape Breton's distant reputation and North America's contracting golf market. Cowan-Dewar takes heart in Keiser's experience at Bandon.
"Even in the current golf climate, Bandon continues to draw golfers from all over the U.S. and Canada. They go for the seaside location and the fun of links golf," he says. "If we're successful, it'll be because we've embodied those characteristics." Many golf courses bill themselves as links, but Cabot Links is the real thing - sandy and well-draining soil, ocean views, fescue grasses, healthy winds and firm conditions that encourage shots along the wrinkled ground. Walking is the order of the day; caddies and pull carts replace the motorized cart. Consensus has it as the only true 18-hole links between Bandon and Ireland.
Cabot's greens are hardy, but their putting speeds are relatively slow, allowing for the kind of character and contour often lacking in modern golf. The caddy becomes coach and sounding board for every approach: A putt, lob, bump and run, bank shot, knockdown or spinner might be best employed to reach the flag. Albertan designer Rod Whitman, who tramped the Cabot Links property for 31/2 years with Cowan-Dewar and Keiser, found holes that reward creativity rather than obedience.
It's already been successful enough for exploratory work to begin on a second course on the oceanside cliffs north of Inverness. Respected designers Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw have tinkered with a layout that includes a par three to a soaring promontory that could become one of the most photographed holes in Canada. Proper work could go ahead as soon as next spring.
Bouncing through the property in a truck, Cowan-Dewar is thinking about when, rather than if. He's talking about the second course, but it could be a hotel expansion, improved air access, a fully developed tourist economy or any number of ambitions for this part of Cape Breton.
"We're pretty optimistic."
Guy Nicholson's visit to Inverness, courtesy of Golf Cape Breton, was his fourth in nine years. He's looking for real estate (not at silly prices).

IF YOU GO
Getting there
Well-heeled golf visitors in private planes are already using the small airport in Port Hawkesbury, and there are hopes of expanding a strip north of Inverness to lure commercial flights. Until then, most visitors will arrive by car or fly into Sydney (WestJet and Air Canada; a two-hour drive from Inverness), Halifax (31/2 hours) or Moncton (five hours).
Stay
Award-winning Nova Scotia architect Susan Fitzgerald and interior designer Alexandra Angle teamed to create a geographically respectful yet stylish 48-room lodge. Rooms have wall-to-wall windows, L'Occitane bath products,
soft Italian terry bathrobes, a Nespresso machine, goose-down duvet and pillows, walk-in rain showers and, with some rooms, outdoor terraces. (855) 652-2268; cabotlinks.com/accommodations; peak-season rates run from $225 to $280; off-season rates (Oct. 15 to June 29) start at $165.
Explore
A few hours is barely enough to scratch the surface at the Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Site - you'll wish you had a full day to explore the site, where dozens of reconstructed buildings with enthusiastic staff depict the lives of 18th-century French officials, merchants, tradespeople and soldiers.
Or go lighter on the history and enjoy the period restaurants and ocean-view trails. pc.gc.ca
Cabot and Ceilidh trails: The summer ocean breezes of Cape Breton's Gulf coast give way to fall, when vast walls of colour adorn the highlands. Winter and spring are quiet, but these routes are open all year. novascotia.com
Cape Breton Highlands National Park: It's 116 kilometres along the Cabot Trail from Cheticamp to Ingonish, but budget several hours to several days to properly explore the park's viewpoints, hiking trails, side routes and beaches. pc.gc.ca
Teeing up
If golf's your only game, you'll want to make time for the following courses:
Cabot Links: True links golf and stylish modern lodging along the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Standout holes include the par-5 13th, which encourages a running approach through a giant navel in a double green that tests all a golfer's creativity. 1-855-652-2268; cabotlinks.com; $65 to $130.
Highlands Links: Not a true links, but Ian Andrew's bunker restoration and tree removal (see photo) have restored mountain and ocean views and left this Stanley Thompson gem in its best condition in years. 1-902-285-2600; highlandslinksgolf.com; $54 to $89; (adjacent lodging at the classic Keltic Lodge, 1-800-565-0444, kelticlodge.ca).

Rise, Vancouver, to the ultimate civic challenge - hosting Chavril's wedding

Full text:   By now, you've likely heard enough about Chavril or Chadvril, or as the gossip site TMZ is referring to it: "A match made in music hell."
But like it or not, the engagement of a rock star whose music is as divisive as it is monotonous to a pop star of little consequence may be the closest Canada ever gets to a royal wedding.
I say we make the most of it.
Sometimes life hands you terrible-sounding lemons covered in clumps of mascara.
The potential economic benefits of the impending Avril Lavigne-Chad Kroeger nuptials cannot be overstated, and may be just what Vancouver needs to pull itself out of its post-Olympic, post-riot, slumping-real-estate-market dog-day doldrums.
Food trucks can only carry the city so far.
This is our time to shine, Vancouver! Unlike the 2010 Winter Games, there is no formal bidding process for a rock-star wedding extravaganza.
And no doubt many Canadian cities will be lining up to hold the event. Not least of all Napanee, Ont., Ms. Lavigne's hometown, and headquarters of the Dixie Lee Fried Chicken empire. If you doubt her affection for the place, consider that both the town and the chicken have been immortalized in Ms. Lavigne's song My World :
"Grew up in a 5,000 population town, Made my money cutting grass, Got fired by fried chicken ass, All in a small town, Napanee."
So while it may be the sentimental favourite, Napanee - for all of its history, its charming main street, and its convenient central-Ontario location - simply doesn't have the infrastructure for such a major event.
Mr. Kroeger has expressed some affection for his hometown of Hanna, Alta., but most of his positive associations seem to focus on drug use and acts of vandalism.
Also, like Napanee, the town simply doesn't have the resources to pull off an event of this magnitude.
Major centres like Toronto may also be interested in hosting the wedding, but only Vancouver can lay claim to being the home of Nickelback.
The couple may also be exploring the possibility of a destination affair.
Which is why we need to act fast.
First off, no debate. No referendum this time. We need the city and surrounding municipalities (which also stand to benefit) to declare their unconditional love for the couple immediately.
This can be done through bumper stickers (think "I'm Backing the Bid"), civic proclamations, neighbourhood celebrations and so on.
The mayor could declare the securing of the wedding "a civic emergency" and as a result deploy the substantial resources of the newly created Citizen Volunteer Corps to spruce up neighbourhoods for photo shoots.
Radio stations could put into heavy rotation songs by Ms. Lavigne and Nickelback and play them even after they have satisfied their Canadian content obligations. The songs would have to be introduced without sarcasm and could never be played ironically.
We could also explore the idea of a reality television program documenting the city's preparations for the event while highlighting local businesses and attractions. This would culminate with a special live broadcast of the wedding itself.
Concurrently, the city needs to launch a public information campaign to persuade citizens of the benefits of hosting the Lavigne-Kroeger wedding.
Messaging should appear along the following lines:
1. Hosting the wedding will once again put Vancouver on the world stage and reclaim some of the civic pride that was seen during the 2010 Winter Games.
2. Hosting the wedding will have huge economic benefits as wedding participants, their posses, the world media, fans, and various hangers-on descend upon Vancouver. Using the same formula Tourism Vancouver applies to conventions, each dollar spent will generate $10 in economic activity.
3. Selling the broadcast rights could generate millions of dollars.
4. Hosting the wedding will make Vancouver "cool." It will reinforce the notion that we are an inclusive city willing to celebrate even those who are lyrically challenged.
5. Hosting the wedding will reduce homelessness and result in the creation of thousands of new units of affordable housing.
6. Hosting the wedding will accelerate the construction of a rapid transit line to the University of British Columbia.
In addition to the benefits listed above, holding the wedding in a public space will reunite roughly 90 per cent of the people who participated in last year's Stanley Cup riot, thereby allowing police an unprecedented opportunity to identify and arrest more suspects.
If all of this hasn't convinced you, I think perhaps Mr. Kroeger speaking for himself may do the job:
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
We must stand together
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
There's no giving in
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
Hand in hand forever
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's when we all win. Hey, yeah.

Full text:   A plan for a new condo tower to sit atop the iconic Holt Renfrew store wends its way through city council
jmays@globeandmail.com
Strike out in any direction from the Toronto intersection of Yonge and Bloor streets and you find yourself in a little world unto itself. A little way north and east is quiet and respectable Rosedale. Immediately west of the crossroads, along Bloor West, is touristy Yorkville and the crowded "Mink Mile" of sleek upmarket shops. And just to the south lies an elderly, low-rise strip of gadget stores, pizzerias and such that has managed to stay seedy despite the best efforts of the gentrifiers.
A spot at the centre of such urban variety (and the site of a key nexus in the subway system) should have architecture brim-full of sophisticated energy and visual imagination. Yonge and Bloor, however, has not been lucky in the artistic department. The office blocks on the northwest and northeast corners are desperately dull, and the looming concrete carcass of the Bay department store is an aesthetic calamity that should never have been allowed to happen.
But potentially significant things are afoot. There's the tall mixed-use building, called One Bloor East, now under construction on the southeast corner, for instance. If it lives up to its renderings, this graceful tower by Toronto architect David Pontarini will have a romantically sculpted glass skin that sets it apart sharply from the city's more usual, sober-sided modernist condo stacks. Mr. Pontarini's dramatic work could be just the kind of architectural exclamation point the place has long needed.
Then there's the 83-storey skyscraper that Morguard Investments Ltd. would like to raise over the deluxe Holt Renfrew clothing emporium, a few steps west of Yonge and Bloor.
If the scheme gets the green light from the city and is built out as proposed, this very tall structure will feature 600 residential units in the tower and 620 parking spaces below grade. Just because it's so big, the building will join One Bloor East (and a few other towers nearby) in telling the world just how important the intersection is in Toronto's imagination of itself.
But will it be an architecturally exciting addition to downtown Toronto's inventory of residential towers? Going just by the drawings and the descriptions that accompanied the application to the city, I'd say it won't.
Before getting into the question of aesthetic merit, however, here is a sketch of what the project will look like. The great chunk of architecture has been designed by the local firm of Pellow & Associates, who have strongly articulated its bulk into a few main components. At the sidewalk level is a wide, glassy pavilion that will contain the Holt Renfrew flagship store and other retail outlets and a tucked-in arrangement of columns and floating glass volumes that indicates the entrance to the tower. In an interesting gesture, the architects have made this portal open, not grandly onto Bloor Street West, but modestly toward a little laneway on the east side of the rectangular site. Giving over the first several levels of the eight-storey platform to shopping, and only hinting at the presence of a looming residential tower, means that this stretch of Bloor will have a mid-rise character at grade, and, probably, a comfortable sense of walkability.
The top of the platform's west end will be landscaped. The residential shaft is scheduled to rise from its east end. In its upward reach, this tower is divided into low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise sections. Each one is distinguished from the others by small façade moves - down below, a light exterior frame that looks like a cage; farther up, a play with jutting and angled volumes, and so forth. The whole composition is to be capped by a sloping skyline feature that resembles a playground slide.
In a report accompanying the proposal, consultants for Morguard make a painstaking case for the conformity of the design to every rule laid down by the province and the city. These requirements are detailed and legion, by the way. They spring from recent official concerns with matters ranging from height and shadows to "greenness" and traffic and view corridors. (For anyone interested in better understanding the hurdles high-rise developers have to vault across, this rationale, available on line at the city's Web site, makes useful reading.)
I leave it up to the experts at city hall to decide if the scheme satisfies the elaborate official expectations. But, for what it's worth, I am impressed by how carefully Morguard and their consultants argue for this proposal. The skyscraper seems to fit the bill perfectly. And that, to my mind, is a dispiriting thought. For despite its apparent compliance with the regulations, this building is far too artistically ordinary. It is a responsible, respectable and very tall lump of architecture - not the daring and stunning landmark that Bloor and Yonge cries out for. Toronto will have to wait a little longer, it appears, before the creative levels of our highest structures, and not merely their steel frames, touch the sky.

Full text:   Low interest rates, healthy lines of credit and an abiding desire for a country getaway, writes Sandra E. Martin, are prompting would-be buyers across Canada to home in on their cottage dreams
Somewhere, sometime, just about everyone has The Cottage Talk - and this was Amy Nelson's time. The 33-year-old account manager from Toronto was driving to a friend's family cottage this summer when she asked her husband, "Would you ever want a cottage?"
Sure, he did. So did she. And with their seven-month-old daughter napping in her car seat, and hours on the road ahead of them, Ms. Nelson and her husband could spin such pretty pictures of their baggy-bottomed baby taking her first steps in the lake, entertaining family, getting away from the stress of their city jobs and the city smog.
"It does happen, yeah," says Sue Morrison, a salesperson and office manager with Re/Max North Country Realty in Muskoka, Ont. "People get the fever, they fall in love with the area, and they think: Now is the time." That's when Ms. Morrison's phone rings.
Cottage hunters are so notoriously fickle that Ms. Morrison takes measures to "prequalify" her clients - a diplomatic way of saying that she shakes out the sincerity of their intentions through gentle questioning. Even then, "whether that translates into anything, we're not sure," she says.
"There's a lot of pelts ," is how Glenn Larkin puts it, using local idiom for "tire-kickers." A few years ago, getting a commission from a cottage sale was such a long shot, says the Royal LePage broker in St. John's, that "when somebody'd phone and say they're looking for a cottage, you'd say, 'Oh, when you see one you like, call me.' "
These days, however, low interest rates have become cottage realtors' friends. Mr. Larkin and other salespeople say they are seeing most buyers borrow against the equity in their city homes to fund recreational properties, rather than bothering to apply for separate financing. The reason: Mortgages on cottages tend to cost more, because they're a greater default risk; people have more stake in, and need to live in, their principal residence. By refinancing their lower-cost city-home mortgages, cottage buyers cleverly circumvent lenders' caution, and make the dream of owning a summer place more attainable, too.
For that reason, Mr. Larkin now takes the long view, indulging a would-be cottage buyer with his time in the hope he or she will become a commission-paying client down the road.
"We do spend months and months and months looking for the right place," echoes Desmond von Teichman, a broker in Collingwood, Ont. "Clients are very well-educated and they know what they want. A cottage is a discretionary expense, so they can afford to be very, very picky."
In Vancouver, Deborah Beaulieu and her husband, Peter, have been talking about buying a recreational property for the past eight years. It started with Mr. Beaulieu poring over local real-estate magazines, and the couple making the occasional drive-by of properties that interested them. Eventually, they contacted Joel O'Reilly, the listing agent for a place on the Sunshine Coast; the area, a 40-minute ferry ride from Vancouver's Horseshoe Bay, particularly intrigued them. Three years after that, they pulled the trigger.
"Why did we buy now, after looking all this time? The prices are down. Also we were specifically looking for something we could build on," says Ms. Beaulieu, who, like her husband, is a renovation contractor. "Most of the properties there already have a house on them, and it would not be financially feasible to tear down and rebuild."
The place they took possession of July 1 does have a small cottage on it, but the more than half-acre property means there's still plenty of room to build a custom home for Ms. Beaulieu and her husband to enjoy and eventually retire to; in the meantime, their son and his girlfriend, who manage the couple's Subway restaurant franchise in nearby Sechelt, can live in the cottage.
In Nova Scotia, Tim Harris's Tradewinds Realty is having an uncommonly busy August. "I don't know what the motivation is," says Mr. Harris, who has been in business for a quarter century. "Usually, spring is our busy season." One theory: Middle-income professionals from Halifax have been working extra hard and squirrelling away savings since the economy soured in 2008; four years later, they figure they deserve that cottage they've always dreamed of. In a market where seven- and even eight-figure vacation estates aren't uncommon, Mr. Harris says that this year the sale of properties in the $500,000 range "seems to be quite brisk."
Says Mr. O'Reilly, the Beaulieus's agent, "A number of people have been watching and watching the market, and they want to have the kids up, and the grandkids."
Ms. Morrison predicts she will see another uptick in interest from would-be-cottagers this fall, when some believe they'll get a better deal from sellers who would prefer to unload rather than carry their for-sale property over the winter. (For the record, Ms. Morrison says that isn't usually the case.)
Others who caught cottage fever after a stay in a rental or at a friend's place will go home and sleep it off. "Reality sets in when you go home," Ms. Morrison says, "just like after you go on a tropical vacation."
For Amy Nelson and her husband, reality set in while they were still on the road to their borrowed getaway. "We talked about whether it would fit into our financial plans," she says. Neither she nor her spouse has a pension plan, so saving for retirement is a priority. And with Ms. Nelson still on maternity leave, "as fun as a cottage would be," she says, the timing isn't right.
But they'll have The Cottage Talk again; Ms. Nelson is sure of it. Brokers are counting on it.

TWO PROVINCES, TWO PRICE RANGES
ONTARIO
Can't afford this?
Asking price: $699,900
Hondoo Island, South River, Ont.
This cottage comes with ownership of half an island and a custom-built, 2,400-square-foot winterized cottage. So, why isn't it a million bucks? Properties that can be accessed only by boat generally cost less than those with land access, so you get more for your money. In this case: three bedrooms, two bathrooms, hardwood floors and high-speed Internet access.
Then how about this?
Asking price: $329,900
Oxtongue Lake, Dwight (Lake of Bays), Ont.
Right on the lake with a sand beach, this 50-year-old, 750-square-foot cottage may be what real-estate agents like to call "cozy" but it comes with a bunkie (for teenaged kids or guests to sleep in) and a dryland boathouse (read: shed).
NOVA SCOTIA
Can't afford this?
Asking price: $748,000
La Have Islands, Lunenberg County, N.S.
Quaint, but with mod cons including a central-vacuum system and air exchanger, this four-bedroom, two-bathroom cottage has direct ocean frontage - the holy grail for most East Coast recreational-property hunters. Though it's on an island, you can drive directly to the property's nearly five-and-a-half private acres over a causeway.
Then how about this?
Asking price: $325,000
Russell Lake, Queens County, N.S.
This three-bedroom, two-bathroom cottage sits on six acres of your very own wooded land. It's right on a lake, complete with dock and water supplied from a drilled well. Inside, there's a fireplace for chilly evenings, and 1,248 square feet of living space.

Full text:   Proposed facility will succeed without pro sports tenant, Roustan says
Graeme Roustan is convinced he can build a 20,000-seat arena in the suburbs northeast of Toronto and make it profitable without an NHL team as a major tenant.
A lot of skeptics are just as convinced he cannot. Among them are taxpayers in Markham, Ont., who wonder about the promises from local politicians, and from Roustan and his partner, real-estate tycoon Rudy Bratty, that the cost of the $325-million project will not come out of their pockets.
Also doubtful are NHL executives, and those familiar with the operations of the Air Canada Centre, one of North America's busiest arenas some 32 kilometres south in downtown Toronto.
One source, who knows the hockey and concert business in the Greater Toronto Area but requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak for the owners of the Air Canada Centre (Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd.), says even if Roustan can book close to the 50 concerts a year that the ACC averages, they do not bring in enough money to support a large arena.
The best concert acts will produce a $200,000 profit for MLSE, the source said, but many produce $100,000 or less, which means the annual take is about $7.5-million.
What makes the ACC a cash cow is that just one of the Toronto Maple Leafs' 41 regular-season home games brings in about $2-million for MLSE. Add a lesser, but still healthy, amount for the Toronto Raptors' 41 NBA regular-season games and it is clear why BCE Inc. and Rogers Communications Inc. combined to pay $1.3-billion for a 75-per-cent ownership share of MLSE.
Since all of the $325-million construction cost for the proposed Markham arena will be borrowed, the debt service alone will be in excess of $10-million a year. (The suburban city of Glendale, Ariz., pays about $8-million [U.S.] annually on the $180-million it borrowed almost 10 years ago to build the Phoenix Coyotes' arena.)
There will also be several million dollars in operating costs, which will be paid by GTA Sports and Entertainment Ltd., the company Roustan and Bratty formed to build and operate the proposed arena. The company is also on the hook for any operating losses.
This does not dissuade Roustan, 52, who is also chairman of Bauer Performance Sports Ltd., from insisting he and his partners and the City of Markham will make money.
With a population of six million, growing by about 100,000 people a year mostly to the north of Toronto, Roustan says the GTA is ripe for a second major sports and entertainment facility.
"I'm a businessman who makes investments in companies where I surround myself with really smart people who've done this stuff before," he said. "I make my decision based on what I know. I'm told by the experts a second [arena] would be very profitable."
In this case, the experts were from Global Spectrum, which manages arenas around the world, including many in the NHL, and the Canadian arm of Live Nation Entertainment, the biggest concert promoter in the world. The companies will manage and promote events at the arena for Roustan and Bratty, and were asked for an unvarnished report on the chances of turning a profit.
"They did their analysis and said this facility would be very busy without any professional sports franchise and you'll make money at it," Roustan said.
About that professional sports franchise: As the head of Bauer and as someone who attempted to buy his hometown Montreal Canadiens, Roustan is well connected in the NHL community.
There is an assumption - perhaps fuelled by the thinly disguised enthusiasm of Markham politicians - that Roustan must have some sort of nod-and-a-wink understanding with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman about landing a second NHL team for the Toronto area.
Roustan insists he has no such understanding and his partners have no expectation either. Bettman says the NHL has no plans to expand or move a team to Toronto.
"I'm not the guy to go down the road on a $325-million investment based even on a handshake," Roustan said.
The project took an important step forward last week when Roustan filed a site-plan application for the development, which is proposed for a six-acre plot at Highway 407 and Kennedy Road. He hopes to begin construction by December, with the arena opening in time to possibly play host to the 2015 world junior hockey championship.
Roustan, who is well connected in international hockey, says he plans to chase every International Ice Hockey Federation event from the junior tournament to the men's and women's world championships.
Roustan still needs approval from Markham council for his site plan, which requires consultation with the public.
Concerns about parking have already been raised, as there are just 4,400 parking spaces planned within walking distance. But Roustan says with a GO Station planned nearby, some 57 per cent of those coming to the arena will use public transportation.
However, the concert-business source says there are other potential problems concerning Roustan's plans to have more than 130 events a year at the arena.
Live Nation, for example, is already a partner with MLSE in promoting concerts at the ACC and other venues in Ontario. The source said MLSE will object, if it has not already, to Live Nation doing business with Roustan.
Roustan said Live Nation has agreements with a lot of arena owners but he does not see his facility as competition for the ACC.
"An act can play your [building] two nights and then move to the next arena 20 miles away, whether it's Oshawa or Hamilton or wherever, that doesn't take away the two nights you get," he said.
Riley O'Connor, chairman of Live Nation Canada, could not be reached for comment.
The source said there are few major concert acts that have enough demand to play more than two dates at the ACC. He also doubted people in the GTA would travel to the northeast to see a concert even if there is a nearby GO Train station.
Roustan rejected this notion as well, on the grounds that just as many people don't want to fight traffic to go downtown to the ACC.
"There's millions of people who live north of [Highway] 401 who won't bother to go downtown," he said. "First, the concert is sold out. Second, they're not going to fight their way there. By the time they get home, it's midnight. This gives them an alternative.
"The opportunity of serving people in the north to me is a no-brainer. When I saw this, I thought to myself, I better do this before somebody else figures it out."

Full text:   Faced with falling revenue, the head of Canada's largest English-language newspaper chain sells austerity with a smile
When the call came, Paul Godfrey wasn't wearing any pants.
It was 1988, and Ben Johnson had just tested positive for steroids after winning Olympic gold. Mr. Godfrey - then publisher of The Toronto Sun - was trying to climb into a tuxedo when a friend who represented the sprinter called and asked him how to put together a press conference.
What happened next is the stuff of newspaper legend. Mr. Godfrey convinced the caller to grant the Sun exclusive access to Mr. Johnson, who would tearfully deny the charges in a farmhouse east of Toronto as the publisher and a columnist listened intently.
It was a worldwide scoop that ran under the headline "I didn't do it." To throw competitors off the trail, the Sun printed several hundred decoy copies that hit the streets before press time at rival papers.
And when it finally came out that he did do it, Mr. Godfrey managed to spin that to his paper's advantage as well.
"We just went out there and told everyone that he lied to us first," he says, leaning forward and banging the table as he laughed. "That was an exclusive, too."
The chief executive officer of Postmedia Network Inc. loves to tell stories about overcoming challenges and defeating the competition. But as he seeks to restructure Canada's largest English-language newspaper chain, a happy ending is anything but a sure thing.
Mr. Godfrey is looking to chop $120-million out of its operating budget - a third of its expenses - in the next three years in an attempt to match revenue with costs.
And while he is facing the same challenges as other newspaper publishers when it comes to a tough advertising market and encroachment from Internet-based competitors, his situation is somewhat unique because the company is largely owned by American hedge funds that are able to put extra pressure on him to pay off the company's $480-million debt.
Mr. Godfrey has given up on the idea that the money that left the newspaper industry is ever coming back - one U.S. study has suggested that for every $7 newspapers are losing in print advertising sales, they are only picking up $1 in online revenue - and he's trying to hack at the business until the books balance, without actually ruining his newspapers.
"People buy newspapers for the editorial product and you have to have compelling content at all times or people will abandon you," he says. "That's what happened at a lot of the American papers - they cheated on content and look where they are now."
The Ben Johnson story provides a small insight into the changes Mr. Godfrey thinks he can make without destroying storied titles such as the Montreal Gazette, Ottawa Citizen and Calgary Herald.
His opening shot was to shutter the company's breaking news service in Ottawa because he could get the "commodity news" cheaper from the Canadian Press wire service - in other words, he wants his papers filled with more hard-earned scoops and fewer provincial legislature roundups.
The pronouncement earned him some scorn from within the company, where he is regarded by some as a friendly but dangerous leader who is willing to cut editorial to the bone to appease lenders.
At 73, he's pulling in $950,000 a year to run a company focused on austerity (roughly the same as the newly appointed CEO of The New York Times, bonuses notwithstanding), and his tone of detached amusement has some wondering what he has to be so happy about.
"These are trying times," he says with a shrug and a broad smile. "But people can get more creative when times are tough - I like our position in every market that we are in."
His next move was to expand the operations of a Hamilton-based editing centre. By the end of the month, it will be editing stories for Postmedia papers across the country and designing common pages for all of the newspapers.
Copy editors and page designers were handed pink slips even as the Hamilton centre ramped up with lower-cost replacements - the only journalists left working in Postmedia newsrooms will be "local reporters writing compelling content" and their assigning editors.
He's hardly alone in looking to consolidate operations and outsource some functions to save on costs in response to lower print advertising revenue - Sun Media Corp. sold many of its printing presses years ago in favour of centralized facilities and uses common pages across its titles, The Globe and Mail sends some of its editing and page design to a Canadian company it partly owns called Pagemasters North America.
This first wave of Postmedia's cuts - intended to help stop the losses ($12-million in the last quarter) brought on by a relentless drop in print advertising revenue - won't go nearly far enough to meet his $120-million savings target.
That means he's looking at other options - high on his list are selling real estate and seeking out cost-saving partnerships with rival news agencies.
"I think newspapers will evolve more into media companies than anything else," he says, as he dips a forkful of his asparagus and mushroom omelette (it's the daily special, but he ordered it without the asparagus) into the mess of ketchup that is slowly spreading across his plate.
"They are going to be content centres more than anything else, with maybe some sales and marketing people, too. But I think we'll see more strategic alliances between competitors than we have today on things like national sales. We've already crossed the barrier in distributing each other's papers, and people can get creative when times get tough."
Working with other publishers would be easy enough for Mr. Godfrey, who has been running the chain of newspapers since Postmedia was formed out of the ashes of the CanWest Global Communications Corp. bankruptcy in 2010.
He was an alderman in the 1960s, and despite a varied career that included running Sun Media and the Toronto Blue Jays, he's still very much the showman politician.
Our lunch - at a restaurant called Glow in an open air outlet mall near the company's suburban Toronto headquarters - is our second attempt at doing this story. The first time, a few months earlier at another restaurant in the same mall, we didn't get much of a chance to talk because people kept coming up to the table to introduce themselves to him.
A table of attractive women to the right of us was particularly interested in Mr. Godfrey that day. At first they were sneaking their glances, but by the end of their meals had moved as close to him as the seating arrangements allowed.
They almost knocked each other out of the booth as they scrambled to hand him their business cards. He handled it with the seasoned ease of a pro, smiling the entire time and going out of his way to make sure they knew who I was as well.
"I run the National Post and my friend here is a big deal at The Globe and Mail," he said, as he shook their hands.
"Does that seem strange to you? Because we're all right with it, so it shouldn't seem strange to you."
The folksy charm - he frequently says things such as "So then I says ... " - serves him well as I press him on the changes he's making to his newspapers. But even he has his limits.
When I ask how he could possibly produce a better product with fewer journalists in the building, he changes the subject to focus on the money the company will save by cutting copy editors and page designers from its 10 newsrooms.
Aren't local copy editors better versed in local markets? Wouldn't local editors be better able to decide which international stories would appeal to local readers?
"Yeah, they would," he finally says, throwing his arms up theatrically. "It's not that we want to do this. We have to do this."
The road ahead isn't likely to get easier for Mr. Godfrey or his employees. He's convinced the cuts have to be made - "in the next three years, print revenue will decline more than digital is going to increase" - and he's willing to concede some Canadian papers (not his own, of course) may not make it through to 2015.
"I'm not sure that everyone makes it, but I think we have a pathway to success," he says, before slipping back into his more comfortable role of storyteller.
"Times have changed. I remember at my first ad meeting at the Sun, I reported 'National advertising - up. Retail - up. Classified - up. Circulation - up.' One joker stood up and said 'I told you guys, this paper is so good even this guy can't fuck it up.'
"That's how things used to be. Things were a little easier back then."

Abstract: Which isn't to say there is nothing to do if fresh air and Spandex aren't your thing. Downtown Bend and some of the outlying neighbourhoods are a shopper's Shangri-la, with hip clothing stores, galleries, amazing restaurants and artisan-coffee cafes. Sprinkle in some live-music venues, wine bars, spas and yoga studios (we are in Oregon, after all) and you've got all the urban fixings of a small city with groove.

Full text: Meandering down a leafy street on a still, sunny Saturday afternoon in Bend, Ore., my four-year-old and I were making our way to the park when a pub rolled by.
That's right, a pub.
Music blaring, beer flowing and legs pumping to the beat, 12 laughing thirtysomethings sat around an oval-shaped counter on little bar stools rigged up to bike pedals, merrily drinking and trundling their way around town.
It made me laugh aloud to see two of this city's greatest passions, biking and beer, wedded in a strange but blissful matrimony of sport and leisure (otherwise known as the Cycle Pub), and I don't know that I could ever find a more fitting or suitable image to capture the spirit of Bend.
I lived in Bend for 10 years before finding my way back to Canada, and in that time I developed deep connections to the community and landscape. Something about the soft sweet smell of sage after a rain and the sociable locals keeps it front of mind when planning an escape from home, and we find ourselves back in Bend year after year.
Located about 280 kilometres southeast of Portland and perched on the Central Oregon high-desert plateau, Bend is flanked by the volcanic peaks of the Cascade mountain range, divided by the Deschutes River and blessed with a temperate climate of long, hot summer days and mild winters flush with heavy snowfall.
With spectacular views on all sides and out-your-back-door access to a crazy catalogue of recreational opportunities (skiing, biking, hiking, climbing, fishing, golfing, rafting, to name a few), Bend deserves its reputation as one of North America's premier outdoor playgrounds. The weather, terrain and seriously sporty vibe have drawn athletes here for ages and, yes, that could very well be an Olympic skier or professional cyclist you just sat down next to at the coffee shop.
Which isn't to say there is nothing to do if fresh air and Spandex aren't your thing. Downtown Bend and some of the outlying neighbourhoods are a shopper's Shangri-la, with hip clothing stores, galleries, amazing restaurants and artisan-coffee cafes. Sprinkle in some live-music venues, wine bars, spas and yoga studios (we are in Oregon, after all) and you've got all the urban fixings of a small city with groove.
Decisions about what to do in a day, or, more likely, how to fit it all in, can be the hardest part about visiting Bend. For my money, your two best bets here in this high-desert destination are biking and beer - not necessarily in that order.
Bend is a bike lover's utopia with its seemingly endless options of road-riding routes and mountain-bike trails, and the locals take their two-wheeled transport seriously. On any given day, small armies of Lycra-clad hordes jostling for position and charging up hills can be spotted on virtually every scenic secondary road and route around town. Equally as impressive is the passion for mountain biking and the range of terrain for all ages, stages and abilities. A spidery single track winding its way through old-growth ponderosa pines, high-desert scrub grass and lumpy lava outcrops awaits the eager mountain-bike enthusiast.
If you have arrived without your bike, pop in to a west-side bike shop for a rental, map and chat with any one of the local shopkeepers or bike mechanics. The good folks are unfailingly helpful and bike-obsessed.
Worked up a thirst and looking for something to rinse the dust out of your choppers after a hard, sweaty ride? Here's where Bend gets really fun. "Beervana," as it is locally known, is home to 10 microbreweries and boasts the biggest selection of craft beer on the West Coast - fast becoming better known for brews than bikes.
The proliferation of brewpubs that have popped up since the founding of the original Deschutes Brewery in 1988 has largely kept the town's economy afloat in the sea of real-estate recession that washed over the state in 2008. Nearly one in seven Oregon jobs is with the booming brewing industry now. So if rehydrating after a hard workout doesn't make you feel better about frequenting the town's watering holes, supporting the local economy should.
Most of the pubs are within walking or biking (of course!) distance of each other, and there's even a Bend Ale Trail passport activity, complete with map to locate and get a stamp for all the breweries you've visited, ensuring none get missed.
As the Cycle Pub passed us by that sunny Saturday afternoon, and rolled slowly forward, my son and I resumed our walk. I noted that it was the "GoodLife" brewpub sponsoring that tour, passing pitchers and serving rounds.
"How appropriate for this place," I smiled to myself. "It's a good life indeed."
*****
A PERFECT DAY IN BEND
8 a.m.: Get your motor running with a coffee from Thump or Backporch . No-nonsense pro-star baristas and fresh toasty beans guarantee a cup of pure bliss every time. Make it a double. You've got a lot to pack in and the extra caffeine will come in handy. For food, make your way to Sparrow Baking Co . and try one of the famous Ocean Rolls (a sweet buttery sensation sprinkled with cardamon), breakfast sandwiches or amazing bagels. The food will warm your stomach; brick-lined walls, soft jazz and a cozy Old World feel will warm your soul.
10 a.m.: Hit Sunnyside Sports bike shop to get a rental, trail map and some local knowledge. If you're into mountain biking, chances are they'll send you to Phil's Trailhead . From this parking lot, just a few kilometres west of the city, the mountain biking trails fan out in all directions for all levels and abilities. If you're experienced and like surprises, plus a bit of air now and then, the self-explanatory Whoops trail is a must.
12 p.m.: The gourmet street-cart food scene in Bend exploded a few years ago and offers phenomenal choices, making for a great midday meal. For fresh original fusion and good hipster viewing, my favourite is Spork (Galveston Avenue). There's also the creative, delicious and organically based Real Food (Columbia Avenue), as well as the wittily named Codfather (NW Colorado Avenue) serving up great fish and chips out of an old double-decker bus.
2 p.m.: Time to get outside again! Rent a road bike and hit some of the secondary roads around Bend or make your way up to Mount Bachelor (Bend's alpine and cross-country ski resort) on Century Drive. If you're still feeling the love (or caffeine), carry on and follow Century Drive all the way around to one of the many scenic Cascade Lakes and some of the prettiest views in Central Oregon.
5 p.m.: After parking your bike and cleaning up, it's time to hit the town and embark on a new kind of athletic endeavour, the Bend Ale Trail . Pull out your passport and map, plot your course and start sampling some of the best microbrews and craft beers in the western United States. Visitors can learn about brewing techniques, meet the brewers and, best of all, taste the cool, malty beverages each brewery proffers. All the breweries are close to each other. Base camp for the night should be the one that started it all, Deschutes Brewery , and from there, let your penchant for passport stamps and your taste buds be your guide. There's good pub grub to be had at most of the breweries, but if you want to veer from your route a little and taste some of Bend's best restaurants, try 5 Fusion and Sushi Bar , crowned by locals as the 2012 Restaurant of the Year.
10 p.m.: Time to wind it down and warm up with a last brew around the outdoor fire pit at 10-Barrel Brewing . Sidle up to a friendly face at the outdoor bar or alongside a bench around the fire. Mention you rode Phil's Trail or the Whoops , and let the conversation begin. With a beer in hand and bike story to tell, you'll fit right in.

Kite fights

Author: Nolen, Stephanie

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/kite-fights/docview/1033450359/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: While kite vendors say kids today don't fly like they used to, the city's electric company put out a plea this year for responsible kite use, noting that a person can easily be electrocuted if a kite flies into wires and that 23 separate power outages, each affecting thousands of people, were caused by kites on last year's Independence Day.

Full text: Indians celebrate Independence Day in varied ways: parades, concerts and parties. Some mark it by sparring with kites - special kites, called 'patang,' strung on glass-encrusted thread - with each flier seeking to cut down the tissue-and-bamboo combatants controlled by rivals
Amir Khan will be up early on August 15. He will eat a quick breakfast, then climb to the roof of his small house on the edge of the vast sprawl of the Indian capital. He will be joined by four or five of his friends and together they will scan the sky. When they spot the first flash of colour, they will launch their arsenal: The boys have pooled their savings and invested 300 rupees, or $6, in 20 patang , fighting kites made of tissue paper and bamboo, and a 900-metre spool of glass-encrusted cotton thread.
The boys will battle until the sky is completely dark, 11 hours later. They will fight friends, neighbours and strangers, deftly coaxing their kites through the sky so that their abrasive string cuts through their rivals'. Some kites will be cut free and lost, but when things go well, the boys will cut the strings so that the other kite plummets down onto their roof or the street below - and they will dash down to catch it and add it to their stock.
"If it's a good day, we'll catch 100, and only lose 50," Rohit Mishra said. He and Mr. Khan, both 17, are best friends. But Mr. Khan is the undisputed kite master. "He cuts more kites than anyone," Mr. Mishra said.
When it's over? They will stack the kites away, and perhaps some will survive until next year. "We only fly them on Independence Day. You have to fly a kite for your country's freedom," Mr. Khan said.
This year marks 65 years since India threw out its colonial overlords and the occasion will be commemorated in different ways across the land - with parades, concerts, garden parties. In the capital, the hallmark of the celebration is kites: Tens of thousands will fill the skies, with fliers in every public park and, especially, on every roof in the labyrinthine tangle of Old Delhi, the ancient imperial seat.
Kite flying is believed to have come to South Asia from China thousands of years ago, and became a popular competitive sport in the Mughal empire; there are epic poems from the 1400s that recount battles. The Afghan love of kite fighting is the backdrop for the popular novel The Kite Runner . In India, the dance and swoop of the kite became a metaphor for freedom with the ousting of the British. Similarly, Afghans launched their kites to the sky to mark the overthrow of the Taliban, who had banned them. Today, Indians consider mass kite flying a way of demonstrating pride in independence, explained Nazir Hussein, who comes from an ancient kite-making-and-battling family in Rajasthan.
While kite vendors say kids today don't fly like they used to, the city's electric company put out a plea this year for responsible kite use, noting that a person can easily be electrocuted if a kite flies into wires and that 23 separate power outages, each affecting thousands of people, were caused by kites on last year's Independence Day. The festival is hard on the city's avian population as well - pigeons, crows and parakeets get their wings sliced by kite string and the Old City's one bird hospital is bursting at the seams after Independence Day.
In early August, Lal Kuan, the central market inside Old Delhi, undergoes an annual transformation into kite mecca - every shop has thousands of them. The cheapest are just a rupee each; the best models, which come from Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh, are a whopping 10 rupees, or 20 cents. A serious flier will buy 30 at a time - plus a 600-metre spool of the best cotton, which has sufficient length to fly all 30 kites.
The kites are made, often by children trying to supplement their family wages, in villages across the Indian north, and the market's stall operators buy them in bulk, paying $5 for 1,000 kites.
Gourov Sharma, 28, who works in his parents' real-estate business, trekked from his middle-class neighbourhood in the south of the city to find the perfect kite last week. He found it on the crammed shelves in an Old Delhi stall rented by Nazir Hussein - a mid-size patang with carefully smoothed bamboo that was heated and bent into an arching frame, with thick tissue sealed so no errant drafts catch in its seams and make it hard to wield - and bought 50.
Mr. Sharma came shopping alone. "On the 15th, it is every person for himself: Everyone wants to cut, and there are no friends, no family, no looking out for whether someone is big or small." His index finger was striped with cuts from pulling sharp string in practice runs; he has battled on every Independence Day for 20 years.
His purveyor, Mr. Hussein, has competed at the all-India kite competition 14 times. (He has never won, which he attributes to "bad luck and lack of mental fortitude.") Today he coaches a kite club of 10 young men (culturally, kites are not for girls, hereabouts); they enter local competitions, where there are no prizes or money to be won, but great local renown. For a few weeks each summer, Mr. Hussein endures the muggy heat of Delhi in monsoon season to pocket some rupees from the Independence Day kite rush. He is known for his especially lethal thread. It is made by applying powdered glass to the cotton string, which is coated with a paste made of rice. Mr. Sharma cradled the spool in his elbow and gave the string a tentative rub, then winced, then bought it.
The Lal Kuan market was thronged this past week, but vendors say sales are down to half what they were a decade ago - they blame rising prices and a cultural shift. "People are not as interested as they once were - children have new things to do, computers and TV," said Mohammed Yusuf, 69, who runs a tiny kite stall. "This was for the older generation."
Mr. Khan, Mr. Mishra and their friends beg to differ. They cut school twice last week to come hunting for supplies in the Old City and they were itching with anticipation. "For our kites, there is just this one day in the year," Mr. Khan said.

Full text: Dave Tuccaro is driving from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, where he will plan the book tour he will mount after Christmas when his biography is released.
That biography, written by Peter C. Newman, will tell the story of the first nations businessman - quite possibly Canada's wealthiest.
Mr. Tuccaro will contemplate what to do with the $102-million he will take in when he finalizes a deal to sell his business, knowing that he still holds an additional $25-million in real estate.
And he will think of how he can use those funds, built up over three decades in which he profited handsomely from the oil sands, to raise up others.
Mr. Tuccaro, 54, is a member of the Mikisew Cree First Nation, out of Fort Chipewyan, Alta., a place that garnered attention after reports - discredited by medical authorities - that its location downriver from the oil sands created an elevated level of rare cancers.
But for Mr. Tuccaro, Fort Chipewyan was a launching pad for a career that has helped to reshape the expectations for Canada's aboriginal communities, which face a deluge of resource development plans. Much of the public profile of the first nations' relationship with the oil patch is negative as groups oppose oil pipelines and new mines, protesting at meetings and stoking fears that industry is devastating traditions and cultures.
Yet Mr. Tuccaro's story - while in his 20s, he used income from working as a heavy equipment operator in the oil sands to buy a taxi licence in Fort McMurray, and three decades later comfortably negotiates with oil-sands chief executives on contracts for everything from heavy hauling to laboratory services - is in many ways a template for how business is now done in northeastern Alberta.
By his tally, native-owned and controlled corporations now count more than $1-billion in annual revenues from the oil sands. Companies run by just three bands, the Fort McKay, Mikisew Cree and the Athabasca Chipewyan, bring in more than half a billion a year, while Primco Dene Ltd., a fast-growing oil patch services company owned by the Cold Lake First Nation, says it will employ 700 people, more than 500 of them aboriginal, this winter.
"We've become an economic force. We're respected now, where in the past people would look at us and say, 'You don't know how to do this,'" Mr. Tuccaro said.
His ambitions are increasingly shared among first nations, which have quietly embraced both the wealth generated by the oil sands and the substantial effort that energy companies have placed into boosting and building aboriginal businesses.
First nations people now commute from across western Canada to work as carpenters and scaffolders, housekeepers and receptionists, drivers and dry-cleaners - there is even a first nations-owned helicopter firm in Fort McMurray. The Northeastern Alberta Aboriginal Business Association, which counts Mr. Tuccaro as its founding president, has some 120 companies on its roster.
They are becoming increasingly important players. Take Primco, which does security, emergency, catering and housekeeping work. The company has opened a satellite office in Edmonton and is looking to open another in Saskatoon, both for recruitment.
It has already dramatically changed the prospects of its home base, Cold Lake. The company has had a mandate to create jobs in its community since the first days of its existence in 1999, when all it had was a garbage truck and hopes for a better future.
"At the time we were running 60, 70 per cent unemployment," said Primco president James Blackman. "Now we're below 10."
Primco's ability to secure contracts has come largely from set-aside contractual obligations, in which oil-sands companies sign deals with local first nations pledging certain benefits. Often, that means priority access on bids: "We get a good majority of our work through agreements," Mr. Blackman said.
Companies such as Primco have sought to use that head start to build businesses that compete with others. Increasingly, they are succeeding. Last year, Royal Shell Plc said its oil-sands operations had spent $1-billion on contracts with first nations companies since 2005. Cenovus Energy Inc., which has several contracts with Primco, spent more than $240-million on aboriginal-owned and joint venture businesses in 2011, equivalent to 9 per cent of its total corporate capital spending, and up from 6 per cent the year before.
For some first nations companies, however, the ability to build wealth has not dispelled an unease over profiting from an industry with a heavy, and growing, industrial footprint. "There's nothing healthy about it at all," Mr. Blackman said. But, he added, there is little choice: "industry pushes through regardless. We have to work with them collectively to try to at least get a better livelihood for the loss of the land."
Or, as Mr. Tuccaro puts it, oil-sands projects are "our new trap lines. If we don't adjust, we're just going to get left behind. We're going to be just as poor as we were before the oil sands started."
Industry benefits, too. By spending on contracts with first nations, the multinational giants pumping out the oil sands are gaining stability. "If we're successful, then they're successful," Mr. Tuccaro said. "And when they go to apply for an expansion of their existing operations, they have support rather than roadblocks or negative interventions."
At the same time, entrepreneurs such as Mr. Tuccaro are building businesses that have an unexpected allure for outside buyers. Brad Creswell is a partner in NCA Partners LLC, the Seattle-based private equity firm that bought out Mr. Tuccaro with plans to take the company public in September. With just about every bid for contracts in the oil sands, Mr. Creswell said, "you actually have to report to the oil company your aboriginal ownership and your aboriginal employee base."
Having Mr. Tuccaro remain as a part-owner - he is taking 20 per cent of the $102-million purchase price in shares - can only help. It doesn't hurt that many of Mr. Tuccaro's workers are local, with 20 to 30 per cent from aboriginal communities. That's an advantage at a time when companies are scrambling to fill positions and often must bring in outside labour.
"We think our involvement with the aboriginal community is going to be very positive," Mr. Creswell said. "It's an important aspect of us going forward."
And the sale could help further aboriginal interests, as Mr. Tuccaro intends to use some of the proceeds to invest in other first nations businesses. He is also harbouring a dream: that one day, an aboriginal company will actually produce oil-sands crude, rather than just services for other companies. It's not an outlandish possibility. The Fort McKay First Nation already owns rich oil-sands leases. It just needs to develop them.
"There is no reason why we can't," Mr. Tuccaro said.

The collector's gamble

Abstract: In terms of visual art, [Bob Rennie] and [Kathleen Bartels], the collector and the director, are among the most powerful people in Vancouver. He's a self-made multimillionaire and cultural force - he is also the chair of the [Tate]'s North American Acquisitions Board - she's the Chicago-born curator who's driven the VAG into the local and international public's consciousness with daring shows, such as 2004's Massive Change and 2009's Andreas Gursky exhibition.

Full text: Condo king and cultural force Bob Rennie has a radical plan for the Vancouver Art Gallery. The only problem, finds Marsha Lederman, is the museum's director thinks he's dead wrong
The rain was falling and the Blue Mountain Brut was flowing on the rooftoop of the Rennie Collection at Wing Sang as guests, protected under a giant white tent, toasted visiting Tate director Nicholas Serota with a dinner put on by the collection's founder: Bob Rennie, condo king and art collector and provocateur. The Serota dinner, like the dinners Rennie and the collection's director Carey Fouks have hosted before and since, attracted a who's who of the Vancouver art scene and beyond: On this night, B.C. Premier Christy Clark waded her way through the almost 3,000 pink balloons of Turner Prize-winning artist Martin Creed's Work No. 329 ; philanthropists such as Michael and Inna O'Brian were there, so were artists Stan Douglas, Rodney Graham and Steven Shearer. Absent from the high-calibre list was Kathleen Bartels, the director of the Vancouver Art Gallery.
In terms of visual art, Rennie and Bartels, the collector and the director, are among the most powerful people in Vancouver. He's a self-made multimillionaire and cultural force - he is also the chair of the Tate's North American Acquisitions Board - she's the Chicago-born curator who's driven the VAG into the local and international public's consciousness with daring shows, such as 2004's Massive Change and 2009's Andreas Gursky exhibition.
He's got the bucks; she's got the walls.An outsider could see Rennie and Bartels as potential allies who might work together to create an exciting new gallery experience for their city, which has a rich visual-art history, and scene. Yet, even at this important moment for Vancouver, the two do not directly speak to each other and have not done so in years.
As the gallery is trying to make a case that it needs - and can raise the funds for - a new building, Rennie is floating another idea. Rather than build one $300-million facility, why not build eight or 10 $30-million buildings, one after the other, around the city - as far east as funky Commercial Drive and as far west as, possibly, Stanley Park. Each location would focus on a particular area of art - first nations, contemporary, Emily Carr, etc.
Rennie is speaking up, he says, as someone who is deeply interested in the health of the city that made him. "My job is to city-build," Rennie said recently at a café across the street from the VAG. "I think [we should] start to look at the city as a whole, rather than just one location."
His involvement, though, goes beyond a public mulling. He talked publicly about the idea at the Innovation City event at the MaRS Discovery District in Toronto this summer; now, he's meeting privately with decision-makers at the city and on the VAG board. (Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson's chief of staff Mike Magee and the chair of the VAG's relocation committee Peeter Wesik confirm they've lunched with Rennie over this, but neither would comment on what he's proposing at this early stage.)
Whether or not his idea gains traction, it represents a demand for more public input and for literally thinking outside the box. The multiple site approach has something in common with the Tate's four primary collections, housed in four different locations in Britain, but it is also a response to a more restrained time in fundraising, when skepticism about the worth of blockbuster buildings has replaced exuberance. In the post-Bilbao era, even starchitects like Santiago Calatrava are finding their bills questioned - as the Spanish architect has recently - rather than paid without complaint.
It makes sense that it is Rennie, 56, who is at the forefront of coming up with a new proposal, although others, like architect Michael Green, are thinking along the same lines. From a working-class childhood in East Vancouver, Rennie became president of Rennie Marketing Systems, helping real-estate developers sell condominiums on a very large scale, including Woodward's and The Shangri-La. But Rennie is much more than a condo magnate. Not merely wealthy, not merely well-connected: He is a household name in Vancouver with a virtual key to the city in the form of a golden Rolodex. He spent several years renovating the Wing Sang building in the city's Chinatown to house his vast and storied collection, a project that Wallpaper Magazine last year named one of the top 20 reasons to be in Canada. Among the artists he collects are Mona Hatoum, Ian Wallace, Rodney Graham and Kerry James Marshall.
He was a member of the VAG's board when Bartels began her tenure in 2001, after a post as assistant director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. The following year, he quit. In the time since, he has set foot inside the place only once. (He made an exception to his no-VAG rule to tour through the show Shore, Forest and Beyond: Art from the Audain Collection, consisting of works in the collection of developer/philanthropist Michael Audain. Audain also sits on the VAG's relocation committee and has been one of the driving forces behind the gallery's proposed move. Rennie calls him "one of the most important art citizens in our city.")
So when Rennie went public with his vision for the future of the Vancouver Art Gallery - one that is radically different from the path the VAG is pursuing - you can imagine it raised eyebrows within the VAG's executive offices.
The VAG, constrained by its current facility - a provincial courthouse in the downtown core renovated by Arthur Erickson for the gallery 30 years ago - is eager to move to a new, purpose-built facility. Bartels and her board lobbied for a prime plot of city-owned land - currently a parking lot - a few blocks from the VAG's current home. In February, 2011, city council voted to reserve the city block for two years, during which time the gallery (which would have to share the land with an office tower) would have to make its case. The gallery was asked for a solid business plan, and to prove it could raise the funds (widely estimated at about $300-million, although Bartels herself has been careful not to publicly offer a figure). It was also asked to demonstrate that the public supported the idea.
In the lead-up to the council vote, a petition was launched and public forums were held.
But since the vote, the discussion has moved largely behind closed doors - to the point where people who should be in the know have asked reporters who have covered the issue: "Any idea what's happening with the VAG?"
Bartels, in a discussion about the VAG move - but not about her relationship with Rennie - said she is not keen on the multilocation idea.
"One of the hallmarks of the Vancouver Art Gallery and our exhibition program is to really find thematic links between historical and contemporary, the local and the global, and I think that would be very difficult to do with multiple sites," she says. "People have come to see Vermeer, Rembrandt and have discovered Huang Yong Ping. And they probably wouldn't have done that if it had been at a separate site."
She also worries about the impact on smaller galleries in the city, and says it would mean higher operating costs for the VAG, and fewer opportunities for accommodating the education component which is an integral part of her vision. And it would take something away, she believes, from the visitor experience.
Talks with City Hall over the desired block are going well, Bartels added, and there might even be something to present before the February deadline.
Rennie also refuses to discuss what went sour between them, and because of the touchy situation, is careful about how he inserts himself into this discussion.
"I have no relationship with the Vancouver Art Gallery, but I do have a relationship with the arts and culture fabric of the city," he says. "My thought process comes more from city-building than interfering in an arena that I'm not involved in, which is the Vancouver Art Gallery. But because it's our city, we all have a comment."
For the city, multiple sites mean spreading the cultural wealth around the downtown core and to neighbourhoods beyond. And true to his background, Rennie also looks to a spreadsheet for some of the benefits: From a practical, fundraising perspective, multiple sites offer several opportunities for wealthy philanthropists to get their name on the outside of a building.
"Once you've given away naming rights to the building, it does get difficult to raise large sums of money," says Rennie. "This way we have eight to 10 different naming rights." He offers a hypothetical example: the Vancouver Art Gallery's Michael Audain Museum of Contemporary First Nations Art. (Audain has a keen interest in first-nations art.)
"This to me starts to lead where the world's going," says Rennie, acknowledging his is more of a vision than anything near a concrete plan at the moment. "I really think that this is starting to look at where we're going, as opposed to what's been done before."
David Baxter, an economist and research analyst, now retired from the Urban Futures Institute, is one of the people to whom Rennie has presented the idea, and he agrees this is an important discussion for the city.
"This is really a once-in-50-years decision," Baxter says. "The art gallery is making a fundamental decision about how it sees itself relating to the city for the next 50 years. Maybe the work has been done, but it seems to me the decision is being cast in a traditional building location format ...rather than throwing it open and saying: 'So, 50 years from now what do we want the gallery to look like?'
"I don't think this should be cast as a conflict," Baxter continued. "We have a real opportunity as we move into the Twitter age to ask what are other ways that this collection could be presented."
On a personal level, Baxter likes the idea of creating a range of gallery experiences that would be accessible from different parts of the city. And he rejects concerns that tourists might not bother to check out more than one building. "I don't know anybody who goes to New York and only goes to one gallery."
He also agrees with Rennie entirely on one issue. The conversation about the future of the VAG needs to have a larger public component.
Rennie says his vision might not be the answer, but Vancouverites should at least be able to ask the questions. "If this dialogue does nothing but provoke controversy and conversation, I think it forces us to look at things differently."

NO MORE MR. NICE GUY

Author: Campbell, Clark

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/no-more-mr-nice-guy/docview/1033010021/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Someone close to him says Mr. Baird is mystified by officials who keep making proposals that he has already rejected. "He'll say, 'I've told them 17 times, I'm not doing this.' ... They'll say, 'Minister, people won't like this.' And he'll say, 'That's the point.'"

Full text: His mission to the Middle East this weekend brings John Baird and Canada's radical shift in foreign policy into the global limelight. Eyebrows were raised when the Prime Minister appointed his notorious Commons 'pitbull' as the nation's face to the world. A year later, Campbell Clark examines the minister's performance, past and present, and finds that, given Ottawa's determination to become tough and pragmatic abroad, he may be the right man after all
Someone had defaced his Brian Mulroney poster, so Rusty Baird was out the door. An ardent Tory at 17, he knew that he'd bug people by putting it up in Mike Lajoie's civics class, but he wasn't going to have the prime minister treated this way. So off he went, smiling, to fetch a replacement.
There were giggles as he left, but not from the teacher, a classmate recalls: "Mr. Lajoie turned around to all of us and said, 'Just you watch: That kid's going to be a cabinet minister one day.'
"And we all laughed."
In much the same way, many people smirked, or scratched their heads, almost a quarter-century later when John Baird was appointed Canada's fifth foreign-affairs minister in as many years.
Was this not the partisan hit man so often seen scowling and pointing an accusing finger at the opposition as he delivered some scathing blast in the House of Commons?
True, the Prime Minister had turned to him time and again to act as his fixer, but now he was being handed a high-profile portfolio, as the face of Canada abroad, just at the moment that Stephen Harper's government, finally armed with a parliamentary majority, was preparing to shed its fixation on domestic affairs.
Mr. Harper wanted to focus on charting Canada's course through a world of economic turmoil and rapidly shifting power; the country needed someone with serious diplomatic chops. Then still a week away from turning 42 and a scrapper described by one foe as "a master of the conflict machine," Mr. Baird seemed like no one's first choice as a diplomat or a statesman.
Yet there are growing signs that he may pull it off. He has combined assertiveness and brash charm to begin making a mark.
His critics argue that it's the wrong mark - one ambassador insists diplomats were quietly laughing as Mr. Baird addressed the United Nations last fall.
And he is still accused of grandstanding - an impression that he challenges. "I don't seek out publicity - I really don't," he insists during a wide-ranging interview in his office at the Foreign Affairs department's Ottawa headquarters.
"At heart, I think I'm a problem-solver ... I like to make things happen."
Those who know him well say that he's not the man people see on TV. They contend that the real John Baird, a workaholic with self-assurance and a shrewd ability to be effective, has been lost behind his political persona, and a little typecasting.
They also say that, in many ways, he has been preparing for an opportunity like this all his life.
After 15 months on the job, it appears that his penchant for bold steps and embracing strong leaders, his confidence in his own political compass, and the willingness he has displayed ever since high school to shrug off ridicule rather than abandon the task at hand make him the dynamic foreign minister Mr. Harper has long lacked.
And now, as he makes his first foray into one of the great conflicts of the day, travelling to Jordan to visit refugees fleeing the turmoil in Syria, Canadians have good reason to pay close attention to Mr. Baird.
The man long labelled a pitbull is changing dramatically the way his job is done and, in the process, his nation's place in the world.
The young recruit: He caught the political bug at 14
Mr. Baird's passion for politics wasn't born in Mr. Lajoie's class. Three years earlier, as one of the more heavily contested nomination battles in local memory drew to a close, Rusty could be seen in the middle of the action at the Ottawa Civic Centre. It was 3 a.m. He was 14 years old.
His family wasn't really political, although a great uncle had once been an MP. His father, an Ottawa city employee, and mother, a real-estate agent, were divorced, but Mr. Baird had what he calls a "pretty average, middle-class" upbringing in suburban Nepean.
He'd caught the political bug in middle school from an energetic and active teacher. Kay Stanley was the sister of longtime Conservative insider Marjorie LeBreton and president of a teachers federation as well as the women's commission of the Progressive Conservative Party. Her status gave her a perk, a telephone in her classroom. And when it rang, one student's ears perked up - especially when the caller was the party's leader. "John was like a radar beam - 'She's talking to Joe Clark,'" Ms. Stanley recalls. "After class, he just started quizzing me about things I was involved in."
In the spring of 1984, with Mr. Mulroney now leading the Tories and poised to take power, Ms. Stanley ran for nomination in a race so heated that thousands of party faithful came out to vote. She lost on the last ballot and recalls that "down on the floor, with a Kay Stanley sign, was John Baird, who was up to his ears in my campaign."
From there, he grew into politics quickly. At 15, he was a convention delegate for Ontario Attorney-General Roy McMurtry, a Red Tory, in his bid to become provincial leader. He ran for youth wing posts, and won. At 17, he got a job answering phones at night in the office of Defence Minister Perrin Beatty. He stayed on the staff, part-time and then full time, for six years, including a six-month stint in the ministry he now runs. He became president of the provincial Tories' youth wing.
At Queen's University, he was a well-known, sociable preppy, moving philosophically farther to the right, and happily disturbing those on the left. He led a campaign to oppose a student-union resolution against the Gulf War and was arrested for hectoring then-premier David Peterson, a Liberal, during a visit to a Kingston shopping mall.
His many years in politics have equipped Mr. Baird with a vast network of friends and acquaintances. He was just 16 when he first crossed paths with his current boss. A close friend had married the son of the Alberta MP for whom the youthful Mr. Harper happened to be working. And who was the friend? Alison Redford, now Alberta's premier, he says: "Small world, eh?"
Guy Giorno, who ran one of his youth-wing races, went on to become chief of staff to Mr. Harper and last year served as the PM's campaign manager. Ms. Stanley, his former teacher and mentor, was on hand at Rideau Hall in 2006, when he was first sworn in as a federal minister, because her sister, as government leader in the Senate, was also taking the oath. Mrs. LeBreton says she's still tempted to call him Rusty during cabinet meetings.
But he found his chief political hero abroad: Britain's Margaret Thatcher. The Iron Lady's right-wing measures sparked social conflict, but she set a bold course and steered straight ahead. "A conviction politician," he says approvingly.
A product of her times, she came along when Britain was "on its knees," he says, which is where he felt Ontario was headed when he first ran for public office in 1995 - the province "required that kind of leadership."
By then he was a dedicated follower of Mike Harris, and about to play a prominent role in implementing what many consider a radical reduction in the size of Ontario's government. But he'd first been drawn to Mr. Harris five years earlier by the future premier's bold approach to what mattered more to Mr. Baird at the time - the party's machinery.
In 1990, he was president of the provincial youth wing and leaning toward Red Tory leadership candidate Diane Cunningham, when Mr. Harris won him over. "The party was in bad shape ... it needed to be blown up," he recalls, adding that his new champion "said quite decisively what needed to be done."
Mr. Harris defeated New Democrat Bob Rae and came to power with 26-year-old John Baird as one of his new MPPs - and a true believer in his Common Sense Revolution.
"It was beyond ideology - it was a plan to make something happen. He was completely into that," says John Snobelen, a member of the Harris cabinet. "He liked the idea of changing direction for the province. He was a revolutionary in the broadest sense of the word, at that time.
"He always struck me as someone who was looking for the bold things to do."
Mr. Harris also liked what he saw and four years later made Mr. Lajoie's civics-class prophesy come true: At 30, Mr. Baird became community and social services minister, and proved to be an eager beaver. "I think he had a list of 300 priority items in his ministry," says Mr. Snobelen, who sat next to him in cabinet, but he also has "a sense of humour about everything, including about himself."
Not everyone found him funny. The Harris government slashed welfare payments, targeted teachers and fought pitched battles with unions. It was a little Ontario echo of Mrs. Thatcher's Britain and, having earned a reputation as an attack dog while a backbencher, Mr. Baird gave critics the impression he was an angry, overgrown frat boy.
Too quick to shoot and unconcerned about hitting bystanders, he employed showy wedge politics that sometimes shocked. Having called for those on social assistance to work for their money and be tested for illegal drugs, he appeared at a news conference with a box of syringes to "stop people from shooting their welfare cheque up their arm, and to help them shoot up the ladder of success."
"That, for me, was a very clear indication of the immaturity, the inexperience, he brought to public life - this hard-edged-certainty view of the world," recalls David McGuinty, a Liberal MP from Ottawa who, along with his brother Dalton, now Ontario's premier, has sparred with Mr. Baird for years.
Mr. McGuinty says he was part of a "conflict machine," a new style of politics that relied on provocation to motivate supporters and win headlines: "John was always very, very good at generating conflict."
Too good, at times. In the 2002 race to succeed Mr. Harris, he ran the campaign of friend and future federal finance minister Jim Flaherty with gusto, portraying frontrunner Ernie Eves as wishy-washy - even going so far as to dress up someone as a waffle to lampoon him.
He still maintains he was right - "I don't know anybody who said that was actually inaccurate" - but paid a price: Upon winning, Mr. Eves promptly handed Mr. Baird a demotion to associate minister of francophone affairs or, he recalls ruefully, "associate minister of F.A., as the premier-designate called it."
Mr. Baird was devastated. Mr. Eves later bumped him back to a full cabinet post, but he soon concluded his party was just playing out the string. The following year it was back in opposition, which may seem an appealing prospect to a political jouster, but "I didn't like it at all. I found it very negative. It just wasn't very fulfilling."
And by then, he had a new cause: Before the election, he'd become the first of his province's ministers to endorse Stephen Harper as leader of the new, merged Conservative Party. A true prize for the former Reformer and Canadian Alliance leader, who needed support in crucial Ontario, Mr. Baird became his campaign co-chair, first for the leadership and then for the 2004 election campaign.
The following year, when another federal campaign began, he quit provincial politics to run with Mr. Harper, and soon was a cabinet minister once again, in his home town.
Mr. Foreign Affairs: a sense of humour, except about the job
Six years have gone by, and finds today's John Baird a traditionalist with a strain of Ottawa Valley old loyalist Tory - he insists that a portrait of the Queen hang in the Foreign Affairs department's lobby. An art lover, he also asked for a Cornelius Krieghoff canvas to adorn his office and, ever the prankster, does an impression of Jean Chretien when explaining that the former PM had the same Krieghoff on his wall at 24 Sussex.
During caucus meetings, he has been known to stand, grin and wave when his name is mentioned. But as foreign minister, he has been serious about asserting his presence.
He made his first trip abroad after a month on the job, visiting a war zone in eastern Libya and urging the rebels to keep fighting. Four months later, he was back, this time with corporate executives looking to do business with the triumphant new regime.
At multinational meetings, he has stubbornly blocked summit communiques that cut references to rights issues he held dear, and gave himself an exemption from sanctions against Myanmar so he could fly there to encourage nascent reforms. In February, he used his close relationship with China's foreign minister to seal a deal to sell that country uranium.
He's not only willing to trumpet unabashedly-Tory rhetoric on the world stage, to play up the fighter-bombers of the Royal Canadian Air Force, back Israel to the hilt and blast Iran. He's also prepared to look uncouth to prod Canadian business deals abroad, because hard-boiled economic interests are job one.
He has loudly claimed that Ottawa bases foreign policy on Canadian values, but what's really new is that it's not the honest-broker, peacekeeper values of Pearsonian tradition. Even stranger, he admits that part of his government's policy is to ask what's in it for Canada. He doesn't mind if others think he's too coarse for diplomatic sensitivities. Sometimes, he revels in it.
Still he has enough confidence to bring nuance and flexibility to a party agenda sometimes laden with muscular bluster. He opened the door to engaging with Myanmar, once hated by Harper Tories, and followed through as reforms there materialized. He played point in Ottawa's shift toward sharp criticism of Sri Lanka's human-rights record, to the delight of Canada's politically weighty Tamil community.
The current trip - today he leaves Beirut for Jordan where he will visit Syrians who have fled the violence in their homeland - underlines another characteristic: He's a bundle of energy, travelling the world and often running his department from the road.
At home, he is one of Mr. Harper's more adept political performers - perhaps his first foreign minister to be firing on all cylinders and unmatched in the degree of confidence the Prime Minister has in him.
In his early days in office, Mr. Harper's focus on domestic affairs meant that he kept Peter Mackay, his initial choice, on a tight rein. Mr. Mackay was followed by Maxime Bernier, who crashed, David Emerson, who soon left, and Lawrence Cannon, who brought stability for 21/2 years, but had neither the drive nor the sympatico with the PM to make a big mark.
Now, however, Foreign Affairs is led by a player, and has influence. Other governments pay attention.
One visiting European official said that, because his country now believes Canada finally has a foreign minister with the ear of the prime minister, it wants to do business with him. Sweden's globetrotting foreign minister, Carl Bildt, remarked during his mid-May stop in Ottawa that he has already run across Mr. Baird many times in capitals around the world. "That indicates an ambitious approach," he said.
Foreign ministers such as Britain's William Hague, Hillary Clinton of the U.S., and Mexico's Patricia Espinoza get along with Mr. Baird, apparently charmed by his irreverent wit. "He does a very lousy Australian accent," jokes Australia's foreign minister (and former PM), Kevin Rudd.
"In the business of diplomacy, being personable is a decided advantage. Often people get caught up in the formality of their positions," Mr. Rudd says from Canberra. "One of his great strengths is to walk into a room and to befriend people very quickly."
The lingering doubts: His combative nature still on view
Many Canadians still conjure an image of John Baird as the glaring hit man, firing at opponents, but a closer look reveals that the scowl usually breaks into a smirk. "He's got a shtick now," says friend Jaime Watt, once a key strategist for Mike Harris.
The old Baird persona still flares up in the Commons at times, but his demeanour outside Parliament can be surprisingly friendly - one New Democrat MP calls him "Jekyll and Hyde." (If he seems affected by the heat of the Commons battle, aides have been known to put a picture of his late cat, Thatcher, in his briefing book to calm him down.)
Mr. Watt says people tend to overlook Mr. Baird's political talent: He doesn't need the crib sheets other ministers rely on. Each question gets a different answer. "He's a master of assessing the situation, and figuring out the needed response," Mr. Watt says. It's probably why he often serves as the PM's stand-in when Mr. Harper is not in the Commons.
He also has personal drive. Single, with reading and spending time with friends his only hobbies, he considers politics his life. Aides have to keep up with his hours - and his discipline. In 1996, a fast-food habit saw him bloat to 240 pounds, he says. "If you'd slit my wrists, the Swiss Chalet sauce would have come out." So he became a "pescatarian" - a fish-eating vegetarian - and lost 50 pounds in three months. "I'm very focused."
Which may be why Mr. Harper repeatedly turns to Mr. Baird to get a job done, initially making him treasury board minister to stickhandle the Conservatives' first legislation, the Accountability Act - a high-profile election commitment - and rewire its campaign promises to free the government from the more onerous of transparency requirements.
Ten months later, when the Liberals geared up to campaign on climate change, Mr. Baird became environment minister - tasked with reducing the government's weakness on the issue. He attacked then-leader Stephane Dion's carbon-tax proposals as costly and ineffective, and floated the Conservatives' own tough proposals for regulating emissions - since abandoned.
When economic stimulus was the issue in 2008, he was put in charge of infrastructure. Then he served as house leader for Mr. Harper's tumultuous last six months in minority.
Although his relationship with the PM is mostly business, Mr. Baird has become a friend of Mr. Harper's wife, Laureen, squiring her to events and parties and sharing a fondness for felines. Having not had a cat since 2009, when Thatcher died at 16, he was about to adopt Stanley, a stray Mrs. Harper had taken in, after last year's election. But she suggested that might not be such a great idea, given all the travel in his future - the first hint of the task that lay ahead
Finally enjoying a majority mandate, the Conservatives not only could afford to look abroad; a sputtering global economy and a power shift made doing so imperative.
So after five years of Mr. Harper touting that Canada was "back" on the world stage, it has fallen to Mr. Baird to flesh out what that really means: opinionated, pro-military and, while still close to such old allies as Britain, Australia and the U.S., actively seeking relationships with China, India and many other emerging powers to further Canada's fast-shifting economic interests.
He has gone so far as to compare the "honest-broker" label, a tenet of Pearson-era diplomacy, to moral weakness, an inability to choose between right and wrong.
"I was always offended by the notion that Canada shouldn't defend anyone, shouldn't stand on its own two feet and say what we think, that we have to be super-sensitive to what everyone thinks and not say anything of our own," says Senator LeBreton, who started her career working for John Diefenbaker and then Brian Mulroney. "We count. People may not always agree with us, but we're there."
To that end, she says, Mr. Baird is "overseeing quite a culture change" at Foreign Affairs. "They're going to know where he stands."
From his first trips abroad, he has demonstrated that he is in charge and not worried about make a misstep. He hasn't shied from picking sides, or soliciting business.
"We didn't go to Libya with the expectation of getting anything - we went to do what was right, to protect the civilian population," Mr. Baird insists. "After the war was over, you bet we want Canadian business to be fairly treated ...
"I think others would have thought, 'Well, that would be gauche for Canada to do that.' Well, I'll tell ya, [then French president Nicolas] Sarkozy was right in there."
The potential conflict between simultaneously pursuing values as well as trade with nations that don't necessarily share those values is so apparent that many seasoned observers are surprised that Mr. Baird makes no attempt to disguise what he's doing.
"He's not the first foreign minister who likes to talk about values," says a former senior official in Foreign Affairs. "But it's very hard to get a foreign minister to say, 'We are pursuing an interest-based foreign policy,' because it sounds too commercial."
In fact, Mr. Baird is so focused on economic ties that it's easy to overlook the fact that Ed Fast is Canada's trade minister - something his itinerary has made clear.
"I have a pretty good relationship with Hillary Clinton. I value my relationship with William Hague in the United Kingdom," he says. "Having said that, I made my first [official] trip to Beijing. I think that signalled the importance with which you court that relationship."
He began by referring to China as an "ally," and has kept at it. In July, he made yet another swing through Asia, visiting China for the fourth time in a year. He has assiduously developed a relationship with Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, arriving a day ahead of a visit by Mr. Harper in February to meet him and help settle a uranium deal expected to provide a shot in the arm for Saskatchewan's Cameco Corp.
Just as important, he has shown interest in other emerging markets Canada has overlooked. On the way back from his first trip to Beijing he stopped in long-neglected Indonesia, returning to Southeast Asia last month. He also ordered a foreign-policy review that adds several potential partners (Turkey is another example) to the list of countries Canada could cultivate.
"I'd give him high marks for understanding the basic architecture of the global power shift, and where Canada's interests lie," says Peter Harder, a former deputy foreign affairs minister. "He's thinking, 'Where's the puck going?'"
Mr. Harder feels Mr. Baird has much of what it takes to do the job: He's willing to travel for days on end, has the backing of the PM, is bright and quick enough to absorb briefings rapidly and confident enough to be able to make a timely decision. "He's not afraid of downtown, or what will others think. He has a good grounding, of how to decide and what to decide."
Still, the blustery rhetoric he often chooses doesn't win universal approval. A senior diplomat from one major country describes a favourite Baird line, that Canada will no longer "go along just to get along," as a bit "too simple," while others say he's quick to pick on small pariahs, but not bigger powers.
One ambassador says Mr. Baird's speech to the General Assembly last fall, in which he castigated North Korea, Syria and Iran, attacked opponents of Israel, and promised Canada would not "sit idly" and watch the UN decline, was seen by many diplomats more as grandstanding than serious policy. "People were laughing."
And there is tension within his own department.
The Tories came to power suspicious of the diplomats at Foreign Affairs, whom they viewed as mushy lefties, spoiled elitists or patronizing traditionalists. In return, the diplomats have bristled at times when they feel important nuances are being lost.
Mr. Baird downplays any friction and says he has a good relationship with his deputy minister - however, Morris Rosenberg, as a former deputy in justice and health, is seen as an outsider as well.
Those who fear that the government has lurched to one side point to Mr. Baird's staunchly pro-Israel views and the fact he spent five days there in January, but cancelled a half-day stop in neighbouring Jordan.
"There's no doubt," he replies with a shrug, "that on a number of files we're taking a different foreign-policy stance than has been traditionally. But that's ... why we have an elected government.
"I think the Prime Minister has brought a different way of doing things, and I'm certainly in sync with that."
But the tension between the minister and his diplomats goes beyond policy. He has shown a whiff of relish in clipping their lifestyle, consigning them to smaller residences and less entertaining. He has ordered embassies to stop serving alcohol except at official functions. When he visited Paris, Canada's ambassador to France, Marc Lortie - a Baird fan - had to buy him a glass of wine.
Older diplomats are said to be especially piqued when Mr. Baird sets aside traditional Canadian positions, but some younger ones appear to like a minister who knows what he wants.
Someone close to him says Mr. Baird is mystified by officials who keep making proposals that he has already rejected. "He'll say, 'I've told them 17 times, I'm not doing this.' ... They'll say, 'Minister, people won't like this.' And he'll say, 'That's the point.'"
Australia's Mr. Rudd says foreign ministers can expect such push-back because diplomats feel they're paid to protect relationships. "Often the temptation, driven by the advice of professional foreign ministries, is if it's going to cause offence to any other government, then give up and run away.
"I don't think that's ever been my approach, and I don't think it's ever been John's approach either."
As for dealing with his peers, Mr. Rudd says he has yet to see Mr. Baird pick a fight, but he will press a point. At last September's meeting of Commonwealth foreign ministers, chaired by Mr. Rudd, Mr. Baird pressed for sections on gay rights and blocked a draft statement because a section opposing forced marriage for young girls had been cut.
"John was forthright, clear, concise in explaining his view, but ... many of the African foreign ministers had a different view," Mr. Rudd recalls. "To advance an argument, which sometimes needed to be advanced sharply, you need somebody who's got the policy and the personality predisposition to do it. He has that."
Mr. Baird admits that most of his colleagues would be happier if he'd "just shut up," such as when he pushed to have the Commonwealth look into Sri Lanka's record on human rights.
"Sometimes it's a bit uncouth ... a bit unpleasant, to say, 'There are these charges of war crimes, should we look into it?' Some people would say, 'Well, maybe do it quietly.' Well - no."
Mr. Rudd praises his Canadian counterpart as the kind of foreign minister who saves diplomacy from "evaporating into a sea of grey" caused by grinding bureaucracy. "You do need people that stand out. And I believe John fits into that category."
The road ahead: Concern that he's not in for the long haul
But does he really fit in and, if so, for how long?
Just as he seems to be finding his comfort zone, some of Mr. Baird's political friends fear that Mr. Harper will soon tap him to "fix" another portfolio. According to one, this job is the "pinnacle" for a career politician who has no economic background and shown no sign he'd ever run for the party's leadership. And if he has any plans for life after politics, Mr. Baird declines to discuss them.
In a strange way, he seems to have come full circle.
Down the hall, one of his aides now has the office he occupied almost 20 years ago - a fake nameplate reads "Rusty Baird" - and by sheer coincidence the main telephone number is the same one he answered at 17 when he started working for Perrin Beatty in defence.
Rusty's old mentor certainly feels he has found a good fit.
Kay Stanley stays in touch, sending kudos by e-mail - except when he goes over the top. She says she doesn't recognize the more partisan, aggressive John Baird, and wasn't always crazy about the Harris government, which she feels knocked her former student a little off centre.
After she left teaching, Ms. Stanley had a remarkable second career as a senior federal bureaucrat. So she knows ministers, and says that, when young, Mr. Baird was curious, quick and "always a happy warrior," all valuable qualities for a foreign minister, especially required to be an agent of change.
"He can walk into a hostile room and still treat people with respect."As far as she is concerned, he has not only matured; "he's in the right place now."

*****
PAST VERSUS PRESENT
John Baird isn't responsible for all the shifts in foreign policy - after all, Stephen Harper is the Prime Minister. But there is no doubt that he has brought a sharper focus to much of what now distinguishes his government's approach from those of the past, and even Mr. Harper's early days.
THEN
Honest broker: The classic label in the tradition of Lester B. Pearson - that Canada, able to earn respect from both sides, can use its goodwill to help negotiate an agreement.
NOW
Choosing sides: Mr. Baird has not only scoffed at the notion of having an honest broker help Israel deal with terrorist organizations," he has blasted the very concept. "I call it being afraid to take a clear position, even when that's what's needed," he said in a May speech.
THEN
Out for everyone's interests. The rhetoric of Canadian foreign policy was dominated by a good-guy approach to multilateral rules, avoided stepping on toes and usually shunned talk of naked self-interest, even though leaders such as Jean Chretien led Team Canada trade missions to China and elsewhere.
NOW
Out for number one. Mr. Baird says principles won't be compromised, but he's willing to declare commercial interests in public, and quick to say Canada's interests matter more than making other nations happy. "You know the Russian Foreign Minister? His job is to stand up for Russia. My job is to stand up for Canadian values and Canadian interests," he said in an interview in December.
THEN
Less is more: Mr. Harper's early foreign policy focused on a few places that mattered: the U.S. dominated, Israel got extra backing and China was first criticized for human rights before a repair project began. Southeast Asia, Brazil, Turkey and several others felt ignored.
NOW
More is more: Mr. Baird has begun to travel more widely, visiting places formerly overlooked, such as Southeast Asia, and taking the lead in broadening foreign policy to emerging markets and powers. A policy review points to a dozen or so new priority countries, and Mr. Baird has named Vietnam, Turkey and Nigeria among the countries that matter to Canada's future.

Full text: Too many newly-built homes in Toronto are muscle-bound hulks bullying their way into established neighbourhoods. Architect Donald Chong's new Scarborough project shows a thoughtful, sensitive alternative
jmays@globeandmail.com
The fashion for tearing down elderly detached houses and raising new ones on the old lots is a feature of the current real-estate boom in many districts of Toronto. And it could be shrugged off as merely another ho-hum result of the complex forces at work in the local housing market - if its effect on the urban landscape were completely harmless.
But the impact isn't harmless at all. Too many residential infill projects are muscle-bound, pseudo-historical hulks that are out of sync with the modest, amiable rhythm of Toronto's modern streetscapes.
While popular, however, these monster-mansions are not inevitable.
Other, more sensitive replacements are possible for old Toronto homes that have become too small or too dilapidated to maintain economically. The century-old, ever-evolving career of European and North American residential modernism, for its part, has produced highly effective dwellings that sit well in tight spots, look great, and sing in tune with what's likable about the contemporary metropolis.
Toronto, in fact, is a hotbed of designers who are imaginatively updating the ideals and ideas of architectural modernism and incorporating them into their residential work.
Here's one of them: Donald Chong - founder, along with Betsy and Shane Williamson, of the promising new firm of Williamson Chong Architects - whose recent house on a quiet old street at the western edge of Scarborough is a fine example of contemporary infill.
Mr. Chong and the Williamsons, by the way, are the winners of the Canada Council's 2012 Professional Prix de Rome in Architecture, a prestigious fellowship for international travel and research. Next week, I'll be reporting here on what the trio hope to learn during their trips abroad.
Mr. Chong crafted the detached, 2,300-square-foot house for a couple with a small child. (Another is on the way.) The physical limits on what the architect could do for this family were strict. There had to be a sizable setback from the street, the lot was only 25 feet wide, and, further hemming in the buildable area, a large, venerable Norway spruce stood in the midst of the rear garden.
The three-level (plus basement) building that Mr. Chong has dropped into the available slot is simple, but not dull, and it manages to be efficient and lovely at the same time. The attractive street-side façade, for example, is an open, right-angled composition of warm wood, tall windows and glass doors, with a boxy upper volume that floats over the sheltered concrete porch. Tough and genteel materials combine here to say "home" as clearly as any Gothic cottage might, though in a fresh, thoroughly modern idiom.
It's inside, however, that Mr. Chong's planning skill is most evident. Instead of trying to cram the more public zones of this narrow house - living room, dining room, kitchen - into the entry level, the designer assigned cooking and eating to the first floor, and moved the living room upstairs.
The lower storey, in this arrangement, is a bright, welcoming sweep of space from the tall glass openings at the front to the glass wall and spacious deck at the rear. This flow is interrupted only by a long island that includes, in one gesture, both the counter top and the dining table. In a further bid to eliminate clutter on this level, Mr. Chong has run a straight, continuous wall of wooden panels all the way from the front to the back of the house, then put everything behind it - fridge, appliance garage, closets, storage cupboards, the air-conditioning ductwork - the works. Not a square inch is wasted here, though nothing is mean or bare.
The living room, on the second storey, overlooks the street through a handsome window nearly as wide and tall as this level itself. (Living rooms belong on upper storeys, it's always seemed to me above the busy city, somewhat apart from the activities of cooking and dining.) Behind this living area are two of the house's three bedrooms, one in the middle, the other at the rear. (The master bedroom occupies the third floor.)
That middle bedroom deserves special mention. In houses snugly squeezed, like this one, into the city's residential fabric, lighting the centre is always a problem. But if middle bedrooms are often gloomy, the one in this dwelling definitely is not. Mr. Chong has brightened it by smartly tucking in the wall of the adjacent living room, thereby exposing the middle bedroom to a large influx of sunshine, and also making the shape of the living room itself more interesting.
Donald Chong's small, thoughtful contemporary house, of course, won't stop the march of the faux chateaux . But it does show what can happen when good urbanism, along with good sense and good taste, are driving the design of replacement housing.

The Action: The flight of stairs between the entrance and principal rooms of this two-storey townhouse was a drawback many buyers couldn't overlook, so it sat on the market at $480,000 last fall. Earlier this year, when fewer properties were also on sale, this unit was relisted for $5,000 less, which quickly renewed interest among shoppers and secured a deal from a local first-time buyer within days.
What They Got: The McKinney Crossing community is composed of one and two-level units, including this 1,253-square-foot model with a street level foyer with stairs up to a living room with a gas fireplace, sliding balcony doors and an adjacent dining area and eat-in kitchen with a rear balcony. The floor above the entertaining quarters accommodates laundry facilities and two bedrooms, including one with a balcony and access to one of three bathrooms. Stylish additions include hardwood and slate floors, granite counters and stainless steel kitchen appliances, plus practical ones such as two parking spots in a garage and a monthly fee of $152. The complex is just minutes from the waterfront, marina, shops and Richmond Country Club.
The Agent's Take: "It's only five years old ... it has two large bedrooms upstairs and three large balconies," says agent Keith Roy, who notes the complex is also more popular than others popping up in the area. "It has a nice park in the middle of it for kids and it's one of the closest to the water."

Abstract: "Certainly you want to have an understanding of the market and know there's demand for this kind of thing, and people love living in the downtown peninsula, and they don't want to leave it," says Andrew Abramowich, chief executive officer of Austeville Properties, a developer and property management company. "We are getting a lot of looks from existing residents. A lot of people have had uncomfortable condo experiences."

Full text: The Pacific Palisades, stomping grounds for the 1970s in-crowd, is now PaPa - and a hit with a new urban generation
kgold@globeandmail.com
It was the early seventies, not long after the Mad Men era, and the stars were gathered in the Pacific Palisades' lounge, in the heart of the West End, on what was then Robsonstrasse.
Sid Caesar. Bob Hope. Frank Gorshin. The three men, all guests at the hotel, hooted and hollered and drew a lot of attention, to the delight of the hotel's original developer, Mel Zajac, who'd become a fixture at the hotel.
"It wasn't a fancy hotel, but we had fancy people staying there," recalls Mr. Zajac. "All the big stars of the era stayed there, like Katharine Hepburn, Fats Domino, Roy Orbison, Sammy Davis Jr. And Bob Hope stayed there, 10 or 12 years, when he came to town. I became good friends with him."
The faded old icon has undergone a major facelift and renovation over the last two years, and throughout June and July, it's filling up again - but this time with renters.
And a good many of them appear to be tenants who've already been residing in the neighbourhood, say the new property managers. The newly christened PaPa holds its place as a West End icon, appealing to locals who want the simplicity of renting as opposed to mortgages and strata fees, strata meetings and property taxes. Of 200 or so applicants for the first tower, 53 of them said they were local property owners. As well, of course, PaPa has the cachet of that history, which its marketers are banking on, and which includes famous bad-behaviour stories, such as the time a young Johnny Depp got into a big fight in front of the hotel.
"Certainly you want to have an understanding of the market and know there's demand for this kind of thing, and people love living in the downtown peninsula, and they don't want to leave it," says Andrew Abramowich, chief executive officer of Austeville Properties, a developer and property management company. "We are getting a lot of looks from existing residents. A lot of people have had uncomfortable condo experiences."
Mr. Zajac is one of those locals who could never move out of the 'hood. He gave up his penthouse at the Pacific Palisades in 1990, but he's lived in the Robson Street neighbourhood for 40 years, and now lives across the street.
After the renovation on the first tower was recently completed, he was one of the first to get a tour of the studio and one-bedroom suites, which start at $1,100 and $1,500 per month, respectively. He applauds new owner Austeville Properties chairman Gordon Diamond for staying true to the hotel's architectural roots.
The development has gone from its celebrity heyday to a stylish rental complex that pays homage to its international modernist history. The cheesy stucco facade is gone and the big arched exterior main floor windows have been restored to their modernist glory. In keeping with the era, it's a symphony of glass and clean lines.
The two-tower, 240-unit complex had a waiting list of more than 400 for the 106 units available in the first tower, near Jervis. Renters will move into the second tower on Alberni Street in July.
The Pacific Palisades Apartments opened to much fanfare as the tallest building in Vancouver in 1966. It was originally a four-building complex that included an office building, but was later scaled down to the two towers. By 1970, due to demand for business hotel suites, the complex was converted into the Pacific Palisades Hotel. Co-owner and president Mr. Zajac, who lived and partied in the penthouse, was soon in for a wild ride.
He recalls enduring spoiled-celebrity demands, such as hiring white limousines and having to repair rooms that had been trashed. One time, he says, rock star Alice Cooper gave him money for a limo to go down to Blaine to pick up Budweiser beer.
"The only person who didn't stay there was Frank Sinatra. But I met Frank, and the rest of the Brat Pack."
As late as 1985, Mr. Zajac says the hotel was filled to a record 93 per cent capacity, almost all of them movie people. On Thursday and Friday nights, the lounge was the place to be, and nobody could squeeze in. But then, times changed and hotels like the Sutton Place Hotel, and more recently, the Loden and Shangri-La came along, and the old hotel was out-glammed.
"It couldn't compete with the new hotels," Mr. Zajac says of the Pacific Palisades closure in 2010.
The conversion hasn't left the downtown area with a shortage of hotel rooms. The city has made it a policy to create additional rental units in the West End to support the 170,000 jobs in the area, without threatening the stock of hotel rooms required by the tourism industry and business community. Last year, the city council approved redevelopment of the Coast Plaza Hotel and Suites at Denman and Comox for rental apartments.
"Rental is a key city objective," says Kevin McNaney, assistant director of planning. "We have some targets around rental we are trying to achieve. There are a number of projects moving forward. And with all the construction over the last five years, we had seen a net increase in hotel rooms downtown, in spite of hotel conversions in the last few years."
After the 2010 Olympics, owners Anthem Properties sold the building to Austeville Properties, and construction began that summer.
"It was very ineffective as a hotel," says Mr. Abramowich.
Because the layouts were already meant for apartment living, in terms of renovation, it was a relatively easy transition. With 20 feet of windows along one wall, as well as 20-foot-long balconies capturing ocean views, the apartments are unlike most condo layouts built around Vancouver. Because of the window wall, even the 400-square-foot studios in the no-smoking tower feel spacious.
"I looked at it as an opportunity to bring rental back to Vancouver and give life to an old structure," says Mr. Abramowich.
"The fundamentals weren't bad. We had a feeling that some of the old style was there, because before we did the reno, you could see some hints of it. But the building was clad in stucco and granite. It was hard to know what we were going to get until we peeled off the skin."

A renovated Rosedale mansion with the right stuff

Abstract: We'll never know, of course, because [Paul Oberman]'s very active professional and public life ended last year in an airplane crash. So it is that the large four-level Rosedale family home (currently on the market for $13,800,000), not the modernist villa he and Ms. [Lewis] could have built some day, stands as Mr. Oberman's final testament to his zest for architecture and his ideas about living well in a big city.

Full text: jmays@globeandmail.com
After 2006, when the massive job of refurbishing, modernizing and outfitting their 17,500-square-foot Georgian house in Rosedale was behind them, Toronto developer Paul Oberman and marketing executive Eve Lewis, his wife, used to talk about their next step. The six small children who had moved into the nine-bedroom home with them in 1995 were growing up, after all, so the couple naturally found themselves thinking of the time when they would be rattling around inside a house that had become too big.
But the new home they were imagining, Ms. Lewis told me, would be nothing like the circa-1930 Colonial Revival mansion they had rescued from neglect and that Mr. Oberman had restored. Nor would it be anything like the several architecturally and culturally significant old properties the developer rejuvenated over the years. Instead, one option for the house they dreamed about was sleekly modern from stem to stern. If executed with the same generosity of spirit and exacting attention to detail that Mr. Oberman lavished on the Georgian, this new dwelling might have become a stirring Toronto example of residential modernism.
We'll never know, of course, because Paul Oberman's very active professional and public life ended last year in an airplane crash. So it is that the large four-level Rosedale family home (currently on the market for $13,800,000), not the modernist villa he and Ms. Lewis could have built some day, stands as Mr. Oberman's final testament to his zest for architecture and his ideas about living well in a big city.
As I learned during a tour of the place last week, Mr. Oberman was content to put down roots in a very tight spot that's almost completely plugged by architectural fabric. The little space that the house didn't fill is now occupied by a four-car garage and an attractive garden in front, and a ravine-edge swimming pool at the rear. (Much of Rosedale is like this. American visitors have been known to marvel at the sight of large houses on too-small lots in Toronto's poshest neighbourhoods, but many people here are comfortable with this arrangement.)
Mr. Oberman also seems not to have minded the quite modest, retiring demeanour of the street-side façade - another typical Rosedale feature occasionally remarked on by people who think a big, costly house should brag about itself.
But viewed at close range, especially from the terrace off the music room, the exterior shows the excellent stuff of which it's made. There is the expert brickwork in walls and at corners and around windows, the lovely classical cornices that crown the walls - additions by Mr. Oberman - and other sharply focused details that we would expect to discover in any important 20th-century domestic building cast in the Georgian revival style.
This refinement is carried through into the interior of the structure. On the main floor, one encounters a stately procession of spacious, well-proportioned public rooms decorated with expanses of dark, elaborately carved wood panelling, flourishes of plaster moulding and other romantic touches - the kinds of things that graced many a baronial Rosedale home put up, like this one, during the Edwardian and interwar heyday of Toronto's old Anglo-Scottish elite.
The architects of the house, from the local firm of George Moorhouse & King, designed for this upmarket clientele, and apparently did this dwelling, 80 years ago, for a member of it who wanted something eminently respectable and old-school, but who wasn't fussy about stylistic purity. Instead of being laid out according to the strict symmetry admired by the 18th-century Georgians, for example, the main-floor interior is cheerfully irregular. The plaster and wood decorations in the principal rooms, similarly, owe more to Beaux-Arts exuberance than to the restrained temper favoured by the Georgians.
In his overhaul and furnishing of this eclectic house - a project undertaken in collaboration with Heintzman Sanborn, a Toronto architecture and interior design studio - Mr. Oberman carefully restored the opulent decoration and high-style finishes, as well as the handsome oak floors. The library, with its array of very good Art Deco furniture, is one of the best period recreations I've seen in any Toronto house.
As for the original plan, he spared the general sense of it, while changing the programs of certain rooms. During the renovation, for instance, the mahogany-panelled dining room was converted into an office, and the former pantry became the barrel-vaulted dining room. Some new windows were punched into the brick wall, and finished to look as though they had been there forever.
When Mr. Oberman and Ms. Lewis bought the place, it was the perfect house for aficionados of Toronto's deluxe dwellings from yesteryear. The elderly property badly needed practical renovation. Even more urgently, it needed love, admiration and care - all of which, heaped up and running over, the couple happily gave to it. I hope the next owners will appreciate what has been done here, and maintain this accomplishment intact far into the future.

A gallery exhibit looks beyond the construction cranes

Author: Leblanc, Dave

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/gallery-exhibit-looks-beyond-construction-cranes/docview/1030858845/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Screening DTAH's info-panels from the exhibit's other installations are suspended lengths of pipe removed during excavation work underway at the Pan Am Village. What's surprising here is the incredible age range, from barnacle-encrusted decrepitude to shiny turquoise plastic. "It's kind of that iceberg phenomenon," finishes Mr. [Joe Lobko]. "You see something at the surface, but below, boy, there's usually a lot going on."

Construction fencing, heavy machinery and dusty pylons litter the forecourt of Harbourfront Centre as it undergoes a transformation that will be complete in 2013. In every other direction are cranes, cranes and more cranes, as new office and condominium towers pop up, mushroom-like, in this city's never-ending makeover of itself.
Yet, inside Harbourfront's architecture gallery, a very different message of adaptive reuse and neighbourhood transformation quietly asserts itself at Born Again: The Repurposed City, despite the apparent irony.
"Irony might be one way to describe it; I would describe it maybe a little differently," offers architect Joe Lobko. "What we see is that there's a lot of new construction going on, especially in residential towers. ... Nevertheless, when you put that in total terms - total housing, total population, total growth - across the country we add maybe 1 to 2 per cent to our building stock on an annual basis. Where the real challenge is, perhaps, is not in new building but in renewing our existing communities.
"Many areas of the city are not seeing investment; so [in] Jane-Finch, people aren't lining up to buy property to put condos up."
To that point, Mr. Lobko and his team at DTAH have created a striking installation within the exhibit called Buildings, Streets, Neighbourhoods, that offers up bite-sized chunks of wisdom within dozens of small plastic frames grouped under the categories "A Community Renewed," "A Street Reborn" and "Buildings Reclaimed."
"You can skim it in 30 seconds, you could take five minutes," explains Mr. Lobko. "It's kind of weaving a story together that's deeper or less deep as you might want to get into it, and it may or may not raise more questions."
Interestingly, the community, Black Creek/Jane-Finch, is not viewed through the typical high-crime lens, but rather as an area lacking in the basic necessities other neighbourhoods take for granted, such as good transit, walkability, community facilities and access to fresh food. In fact, a small map proves the area can be considered a "food desert," with far more fast food outlets than greengrocers; another panel, from Toronto Public Health, suggests that higher rates of illness and premature death are the result. "As we start to think about the city that way," says Mr. Lobko, "as a city that has parts of it that are less healthy than others ... those places really need renewal." Other panels attempt to provide solutions via urban agriculture, which not only grows food, of course, but community pride.
The reborn street is Queens Quay West - just outside the gallery's window - a DTAH and West8 design about to start construction, and the reclaimed buildings are the former TTC streetcar repair barns that now make up the highly successful, multipurpose Wychwood Barns community. Wychwood, says Mr. Lobko, is an "unconventional" example of the pride of ownership that can happen when public land is given over to not-for-profit groups to run: "Government, as a general rule, is only going to be able to go so far - it can put the hand out, it can set the conditions right - but often the local community can really take things further and make something special go on." Could that happen in Jane-Finch?
Screening DTAH's info-panels from the exhibit's other installations are suspended lengths of pipe removed during excavation work underway at the Pan Am Village. What's surprising here is the incredible age range, from barnacle-encrusted decrepitude to shiny turquoise plastic. "It's kind of that iceberg phenomenon," finishes Mr. Lobko. "You see something at the surface, but below, boy, there's usually a lot going on."
Equally as visually arresting are the wooden shipping pallets used to create Lost & Found by Unit A Architecture: sawn and reassembled into two opposing "skylines," a closer examination reveals daubs of coloured paint and bits of metal edging. Just beyond the pallet skylines, floating in the air like an enormous orange storm cloud is artist Gareth Lichty's Tangle , made from strands and strands of hand-cut, zig-zaggy construction fencing. Both of these installations seek to recontextualize common, throwaway material to illustrate that abandoned/obsolete buildings can be reborn if given new uses, and these new uses don't necessarily have to wipe out traces of the old.
To give further shape to this concept, Kongats Architects has inserted an open-ended room into the gallery. Called Regenerate , the all-white walls, ceiling and floor offer tangible proof to gallery-goers that layers of history are created in any space. Visitors are invited inside (there is a white Eames shell chair to sit on) and asked to "record his or her experience" via the dirty soles of their shoes, greasy fingers or what-have-you. Each week, the room will be rotated 90 degrees to allow a different surface to suffer the same fate; during the last week of the exhibition, the cube will be unfolded and mounted on the gallery wall.
Since older layers of the city can sometimes be obscured by the new sport of crane-spotting, with this exhibit curator Patrick Macaulay has revealed a hard truth: While it may not be as sexy, the coming decades will see a much greater emphasis on the "repurposed city" rather than the one in which the developers would have us live.
Born Again: The Repurposed City runs until Sept. 16 at Harbourfront Centre's Architecture Gallery, 235 Queens Quay West. Admission is free.

Summer chill cools Toronto, Vancouver

Author: Morison, Ora

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/summer-chill-cools-toronto-vancouver/docview/1030858815/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Finance Minister Jim Flaherty has repeatedly singled out Toronto's condo market as overheated. "I also talk to developers, and I hear from some of them who are in the business of building condos that they don't really have a plan, they're just going to keep building them until people stop buying them. ...It will lead to a crash," he told the Globe and Mail's editorial board recently.

Full text: The cooling of Canada's two hottest housing markets has begun.
Sales of new Toronto condominiums fell by half in the second quarter from the year before, new data released Thursday show, while in Vancouver, the number of residential sales last month was the lowest for any July in 10 years.
Finance Minister Jim Flaherty has repeatedly singled out Toronto's condo market as overheated. "I also talk to developers, and I hear from some of them who are in the business of building condos that they don't really have a plan, they're just going to keep building them until people stop buying them. ...It will lead to a crash," he told the Globe and Mail's editorial board recently. In late June, he tightened the rules for federal insurance for mortgages in a bid to prevent Canadians from taking on too much debt.
Even before Mr. Flaherty's move, Vancouver's property market was showing signs of easing. Residential sales dropped 11.2 per cent from June to about 2,000 properties. July had the fewest number of new listings of any month this year at 4,802, but that still left about 18,000 properties on the market in Vancouver - 18.8 per cent more than last year.
The softening market adds further support to expectations that the Bank of Canada will maintain its 1 per cent benchmark rate well into the future.
"People appear to be cautious about making significant financial decisions right now. While our local economy appears to be quite robust, there may be some concern about the impact of international markets and the federal government's tightening of mortgage regulations," said Eugen Klein, president of the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.
Prices, however, are still holding up in Vancouver. The board's "benchmark price" for a typical home in greater Vancouver - including condos - is $616,000, about the same as a year ago. For a single family detached home, it's $950,000.
In Toronto, a record high 18,123 condo units were left unsold at the end of the second quarter, and condo sale prices grew at their slowest pace since early 2010. The average offering price in the second quarter was $566 per square foot, the same as the first quarter - a further sign that price inflation is cooling, said Ben Myers, an executive vice president at Urbanation, a condominium market research company.
The second quarter absorption rate, a ratio of new units built in Toronto to those sold, dropped to its lowest point since late 2008 when the market was mired in financial crisis.
"This hard data confirms the anecdotes of pulled project openings and construction delays this year," said Bank of Nova Scotia economists Derek Holt and Dov Zigler in a research report Thursday.
Mr. Myers said he expects fewer condo project launches in the second half of 2012 compared with 2011 as developers try to get rid of unsold units before starting on new projects.
But some developers are still moving ahead with construction. "Despite talk of tightening credit to condominium developers, 7,343 units started construction in the second quarter of 2012, the highest level in over a year," Mr. Myers said.
A record 343 new condo buildings are currently under construction in Toronto. "This will put downward pressure upon housing starts over the second half of 2012 as builders respond to the inventory overhang," wrote Mr. Holt and Mr. Zigler.

Full text: Los Angeles may be sprawling and Hollywood slightly seedy, but there's plenty of old-school glam if you know where to look
Beverly Hills was always a place that existed more in my imagination than in any real way, and in this I am not alone. With so many televisual references filling our psyches - from Mr. Brady's office to 90210 - it's often hard to see the forest for the pop-culture trees. And while the actual Hollywood can seem a little down at the heels, it's Beverly Hills that's home to the real glamour associated with the "H" word.
So when a last-minute invitation to an anniversary gala in Beverly Hills came my way, I decided a proper visit was in order.
For a non-driver who finds Los Angeles daunting in its sprawling splendour, Beverly Hills proved a perfect fit. It's essentially a small town for the wealthy, a luxury village (twinned with Cannes) with a surprisingly intimate feel.
My visit began, appropriately, at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Known as the "pink palace," the resort-like property, currently celebrating its centennial, began life as a bean field, before becoming the epicentre of Hollywood glam. While still channelling the ghosts of screen legends Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Norma Shearer, and boasting the bungalow where Marilyn Monroe romanced Yves Montand, the hotel remains the place to see and be seen.
As I stumbled up the entranceway in a slightly jet-lagged stupor, I spotted Warren Beatty, and caught myself gawking. I played it cool an hour later when I walked past Julia Louis-Dreyfus, taking a meeting in a booth at the legendary Polo Lounge (celebs mainly come for the power lunches or breakfasts, while the evening crowd is a bit more subdued).
But Ms. Dreyfus, dressed in an elegant black business suit, took a long look at me. Initially I was flattered - until I caught my reflection and realized my Vancouver boho chic ensemble of orthopedic black biker boots, yoga pants and a striped top needed an immediate upgrade.
The next day's task was to render myself gala-worthy in a few short hours. Thanks to a tip from some young Canadian actresses hanging at the famous hotel pool, I found the wonderful Beverly Hills Nail Design, an emporium of all things mani-pedi, and a favourite with locals and celebs alike. A walk-in costs a mere $36, and additional massage at $1 a minute.
Lacking the budget of Julia Roberts's character in Pretty Woman , I avoided Rodeo Drive, but found a plethora of charming boutiques - including Philippe Derey (philippederey.com), where I managed to score a $99 gown in David Hockney-esque 1970s technicolour for that night's gala.
The next day, I took in the Paley Center for Media on North Beverly Drive. Housed in a gorgeous Richard Meier-designed building, the Center is shrine to all things televisual. Highlights include the diner booth from Seinfeld, a Gen X-nostalgic collection of cartoon lunch boxes, and a sing-along TV theme area. The whole experience reminded me of how far-reaching American pop culture can be - especially for my generation of latch-key Canadian kids weaned on the boob tube.
Sometimes though, as the centre director reminded me, humour doesn't translate so well. Case in point: Everybody Loves Raymond bombed in Russia, until they changed the character Robert's profession from policeman to something more culturally benign. Programming at the centre also includes evening screenings (that night's was a documentary about Johnny Carson, with legendary comedians and ex-wives in attendance).
I walked to the nearby Grill on the Alley to meet a friend for lunch (there's a network of back alleys in Beverly Hills where much of the insider action takes place) and ended up bumping into Larry David. No longer able to play it cool, I chatted with him about my favourite episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm , but when I reached into my downsized-for-chic little purse, I realized I had no business cards. I scrawled my name and temporary 310 mobile number on a napkin and said, "call me."
What can I say? I left my heart in Beverly Hills, and I'm keeping that number artificially alive until Larry calls me, or until my next visit - whichever comes first.
*****
THE INSIDER / AN ART-COLLECTING SHERIFF
Richard Silverman, an 80-year-old art collector and volunteer West Hollywood sheriff who was friends with Leonard Bernstein, has been in Beverly Hills for nearly three decades.
"I'm afraid I don't do mornings - but if I did I'd go to Nate and Al's for the corn rye toast. George Burns used to eat breakfast there every day.
"For lunch the Polo Lounge and the Grill are classics, but I like to go to Ed's Coffee Shop on Robertson in West Hollywood for their homemade soups and burgers - it's an institution and a favourite for architects and designers. The Beverly Wilshire hotel coffee shop is great, and they change their menu every week.
"Wolfgang Puck's The Cut - also at the hotel - has the most incredible Kobe steak and is a good choice for dinner. But the Ivy in West Hollywood is the place to go for dinner if you want to watch cat fights between the Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan sets.
"I wouldn't be caught dead going into a gallery on Rodeo Drive - they're a bunch of overpriced phonies - but the jewellery's the thing. I love the Bulgari store. It's even better than Tiffany's. Beverly Hills has great public art and some fabulous architecture - like the city hall, which is across from the new Annenberg arts centre (under construction).
"It's one of America's best planned and maintained cities, but people still drive too much - and the old joke about the only people walking being the maids and the gardeners is still somewhat true - but it's starting to change."
As told to Hadani Ditmars
*****
THE BOHEMIAN HEART OF BEVERLY HILLS
The entire 400 block of North Beverly Drive is the bohemian heart of Beverly Hills - full of long-term tenants from before the days of sky-high retail rents.
Beside the Paley Center for Media is the incredible Cheese Store of Beverly Hills (cheesestorebh.com) - complete with regular wine and cheese tastings, a secret loft/late night rock legend recording studio upstairs, and a private room off the back alley for special musical tasting sessions.
The upstairs neighbour, an opera-singing custom bookbinder, presides over the Beverly Hills Bookbinding Service (beverlyhillsbookbinding.com) and is known for his impromptu arias.
Next door is the Organic Pharmacy (theorganicpharmacy.com), which offers everything from facials to homeopathic prescriptions. Across the street is the legendary Nate 'n Al's deli (natenal.com), which has been serving the same delicious Reuben sandwiches since 1945.
Nearby M Café offers vegan delights, while a few blocks south the Persian eatery Aram (aram-restaurant.com) offers delectable cuisine. (Half the people I met in Beverly Hills were either Iranian or Israeli, which leads me to believe that in addition to being a great foodie centre, the city could also hold the key to world peace.)
For a day out, the Greystone Mansion and Park (greystonemansion.org) is a worthy excursion and pairs nicely with a post-outing cocktail at Marilyn Monroe's one-time abode, the always elegant Avalon Hotel (avalonbeverlyhills.com).
For some modernist classics, check out the art and architecture walking tour of Beverly Hills (lovebeverlyhills.com) and the much anticipated new book Over the Top (trousdale-overthetop.com), about the fabulous midcentury glam of Trousdale Estates.
For good old unabashed luxury, the Peninsula Hotel is a must. Take high tea in the lobby and sip Earl Grey under bohemian chandeliers, or get a gemstone treatment at the spa and lounge poolside on the roof deck post massage, with the intoxicating aroma of diamond body oil on your skin. After all these years, they still are a girl's best friend.

Abstract: Over the decades Yick became an icon of Bell Island, probably its most recognizable citizen, and arguably its kindest. "I don't think anyone will ever know what [James Yick] did for people in need," said Gary Gosine, Wabana's Mayor. Certainly Yick would never mention the many favours he did. "He was a very caring person, inspirational, he was someone you could look up to," said Gosine.

Full text:   Starting as a 50 cent-a-week laundry worker, Newfoundland immigrant became 'to Bell Island what Wayne Gretzky was to hockey'
James Yick was born Gin Yick Choy in Toi San village, in Canton province in China. As the Chinese always announce their full names with their surnames first and then their given names, when he was asked his full name upon arrival in Newfoundland, he said Gin Yick Choy, Gin being his surname and Yick Choy being his given name. This is how he became Jim Yick, a very common occurrence with the early Chinese settlers.
As well, by the lunar calendar his birthday was May 15, 1912, but by the Gregorian calendar the date is June 29, 1912. A different name, a different birthday: This is symbolic of how much of his life was translated and transported from one completely different world to another. But Yick made a foreign land a beloved home.
When he came to Newfoundland he had to pay a $300 head tax. But he didn't let this discrimination - no other group had to pay such a fee - dampen his own determination for a better life, or his own decency. He didn't speak the language, so he taught himself to do so. He was incredibly hard-working and equally giving. He contributed so much to and was identified so strongly with his new home town he was, as his friend Gerald Tremblett told The Telegram, "to Bell Island what Wayne Gretzky was to hockey." James Yick died at his son Jim's home in St. Philip's, Nfld., July 11.
James Yick was barely 20 when he came to Newfoundland in 1932, where his father, Gin Tong Ming Tim, was already working in a laundry in St. John's, sending money back to his mother, Tam Yee Lan. Yick, in turn, was leaving his wife, Jean. They had married Dec. 10, 1931 and she was pregnant with their first child, daughter Helen.
Newfoundland, then a British colony, was not subject to the Canadian Chinese Exclusion Act. Which was not to say it was entirely welcoming.
The first Chinese immigrants - they were all men - had come to Newfoundland in the 1890s. While they'd been drawn largely from Pearl River Delta, near Canton (Guangzhou) in southeast China to North America by work in the mines and on the railways, their first enterprises in Newfoundland were hand laundry. They opened businesses in St. John's, Bell Island, Grand Falls, Botwood, Corner Brook and Port aux Basques.
A few, but only a few, married Newfoundland women. Most supported families in China, from whom they were separated for decades.
There was much political and social uneasiness over these "aliens" - "The Celestials" as they were first called - who formed, along with the Lebanese, Newfoundland's two largest minorities. The arrival of 50 Chinese men in late April, 1906, triggered great consternation, and a $300 head tax was set in place, and remained until 1949.
Still, the Chinese community grew, and their businesses expanded. In the 1930s and 1940s Chinese entrepreneurs began to open restaurants and cafes all across the island, and these became landmarks - the Starlit and Silver Bell in St. John's, The Dragon in Corner Brook. And as a community, they had their own organizations, including the Hong Heing Society, and the Tai Mei Society, and during the Second World War they raised money for the Chinese War Relief Society.
After that conflict ended, Canada repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1947, so the head tax ended in Newfoundland upon Confederation.
When Yick had first come he worked in a hand laundry in St. John's for 50 cents a week. The low wage, coupled with his need to repay the loan that covered his head tax, meant there was little left to support his family. He travelled right across the island to Stephenville looking for better work. Then, he settled on Bell Island.
Bell Island was then a busy mining community with what was once the largest iron ore mine in the world; its population would peak at 15,000. Just off the coast in Conception Bay, the island measures about 15 by five kilometres and Yick would settle "on the green" - one of the areas Bell Island was divided into, including its capital, Wabana, "west mines," and "the front." There his business opportunities started with a general grocery, the Service Store, and expanded into a restaurant, wholesale distribution, and real estate. (As a landlord, he was known to be a generous one who maintained his properties.)
After Confederation, he was able to sponsor his wife, and she was one of the first Chinese women to come to Newfoundland. At that point, they had not seen each other for 18 years. Then he sponsored his daughter Helen, whom he had never seen. He also adopted and sponsored a young boy, Wai Sun Jim, whom his family in China had been helping to raise. In 1954 their third child, Jim, was born.
Over the decades Yick became an icon of Bell Island, probably its most recognizable citizen, and arguably its kindest. "I don't think anyone will ever know what James Yick did for people in need," said Gary Gosine, Wabana's Mayor. Certainly Yick would never mention the many favours he did. "He was a very caring person, inspirational, he was someone you could look up to," said Gosine. Yick always thought of his community in terms of what he could do for others, never what he could gain from it, Gosine said. "I've been on council 25 years, and not once did that man complain about anything."
The Bell Island mine closed in 1966 and much of the population moved away, largely to Ontario. About 3,000 people live there now. Yick shifted some of his business interests to Cambridge, Ont., but not his home. He loved Bell Island, just as he loved the Newfoundland landscape, the seafood cuisine (especially lobster), and the local favourite drink of dark rum (Screech).
He worked in his store until he was 94. He left only after he broke his hip, and even then, his son Jim Yick said, had to be pretty much carried out of the premises. Yick moved across the Bay to live with his son's family. But he would say, "I want to go back to the green."
James Yick was predeceased by his wife in 1988. He leaves his daughter Helen Loo and sons Wai Sun Jim and Jim, and grandchildren and great-grandchildren living from Vancouver to New Zealand.

Race the triathlon in London for less than the price of a pint

Full text:   Swim the Serpentine, hop on a Boris bike, and run from Buckingham Palace along the Mall to your very own triumphant finish
Triathlon is the ideal tourist's sport: While competitors inside the Olympic stadium see little of London beyond the stadium around them, the lucky triathletes rip around the very heart of the capital, surrounded by many of the landmarks that make London, well, London really.
The even better news is that the pleasure of racing the Olympic course isn't only for those talented enough to be representing their countries. With the aid of a little local cunning, anyone can race triathlon on this wonderful route which slices through some of the capital's most prime real estate, and all for less than the price of a pint of beer.
How do I know? Simple. Not only am I local, I devised the route for this little event while looking for a way to spice up my regular training in the city. So if you want a completely different way to see London at its best, and you fancy a spot of exercise at the same time, here's how.
The Swim
The Olympians will be swimming in the Serpentine, a beautiful boating lake in the centre of Hyde Park - and precisely where you'll swim, too.
Because the £20 annual membership at the Serpentine swimming club lets you swim there between 6 and 9 every morning, 365 days a year (regulars break the ice for winter swims), that's just six pence a swim. (True, travellers won't swim here year-round, but let's not quibble.)
It's best to arrive as early as possible. Not only do you get a refreshingly tranquil swim despite being a stone's throw from Oxford Street, it also means you can take in the rest of the route afterward without the crowds.
Up close, the Serpentine water does not look good, and its ducky aroma (it's home to a lot of ducks) takes getting used to. But since leaping in with the British triathlon team for a story three years ago, I figured if it's okay for the world's best, then it can't do me any harm. And three swimming years later, it never has.
With buoys marking out 200-metre lengths, you can easily swim either 750 metres for a sprint distance triathlon, or go whole hog with 1,500-m for a true Olympic distance. Just remember to watch where you're going as, unlike a regular pool, Serpentine swim traffic goes both ways and colliding with fellow club members is frowned upon. If in doubt, wear a very bright swim cap.
Transition one: swim to bike
Now you need to get from water to wheels as fast as possible. The Olympians will be sprinting from the wet stuff on the north side of the lake across carefully laid matting to protect their delicate tootsies, before tearing around a bike course that runs around the park and down to Buckingham Palace. For this they will employ bikes that weigh less than the average envelope and cost more than a small yacht.
Your bike section will be tougher.
You'll need to sprint from the water on the south side of the lake where the Serpentine swim club has its area, before hobbling painfully across the concrete to the changing room. Having swapped wetsuit for bike gear and stashed your change of clothes in the rucksack you've handily brought along for the purpose, it's time to make a beeline for the "Boris bikes" racked behind the park's Lido Café.
These bicycles-for-hire are named after London's floppy-haired mayor, Boris Johnson, and are brilliant, although more for their ease of use than their technical prowess. In stark contrast to pro triathlon race machines, these bikes are heavier than a small yacht, yet cost less than the average sturdy envelope - a single pound pays for an hour.
Quite long enough for you to thunder out counterclockwise laps of the park's perimeter road at a handy five kilometres each, until your legs fall off. The latter happens far more rapidly on a Boris because: a) you are lugging the weight of two bikes at once, all with the aerodynamics of a tall building; and b) a Boris only has three gears instead of 30. Just completing the bike section on one of these behemoths makes you harder than an Olympic triathlete.
Well done, although there's no time for a breather yet. You've still got a run to do.
Transition two: bike to run
Having had their sightseeing, assuming they had time to look up from their handlebars that is, Olympians return to the north side of the Serpentine to ditch their rides and start pounding pavement for several laps of the lake itself.
You, on the other hand, will be dropping your bike at a brand-new location on the south side of the park - the joy of the Boris bike is it can be dropped at one of over 570 racks around the capital - and then stuffing your cycle helmet into your rucksack, before starting your run.
This will take you around the park perimeter, clockwise, allowing you to sample the park's many delights while also laughing (quietly, and to yourself of course - remember how reserved we Brits are) at the ever-swelling swarm of commuters who by now will be scurrying through the same park on their way to work while you rack up a great workout.
Before completing your full lap however, divert out of the park's southeast corner, just past the giant Achilles statue, and cross under the Wellington Arch while marvelling at its alabaster magnificence - though not for too long; you are racing, remember. Mark time at the crossing to Constitution Hill here while waiting for the lights to change (as this is no spot for jaywalking), and then dive down to Buckingham Palace before zooming onto the Mall for a triumphant finish across an imaginary tape, just by the temporary barriers closing the road halfway down for Olympic traffic.
Despite the Mall itself being the finish for the marathon, the start for the road cycling events, and part of the triathlon course during the Olympics, it will be open to pedestrians at all other times.
Having finished, if you now turn right and wander into St. James's Park you'll soon come to an excellent coffee stall and a bridge with one of the greatest views of the London Eye.
Now relax, and bask in the glow of a job well done. Congratulations. Return to your hotel with your head held high and a warm glow of satisfaction wrapped around you before taking a well-deserved headlong dive into the breakfast buffet.

The U.S. housing market is finally awakening from its six-year nightmare.
After suffering through years of falling prices and moribund sales, the market is witnessing a rise in home values and a burst of new construction.
The renewed activity is providing a small but significant boost to the broader economy, which is struggling to grow at anything beyond a modest pace.
Home prices appear to have hit bottom and are starting to creep up nationwide. On Tuesday, a closely watched index from real estate firm Zillow Inc. revealed that U.S. home values increased 0.2 per cent in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier, the first such annual gain since 2007.
Other key measures have also pointed to a nascent recovery in U.S. home prices in recent months, but most have focused on changes from one month to the next, or relied on broad averages rather than local comparisons, as Zillow's index does.
The announcement feeds into a growing stream of data pointing to a turnaround in the U.S. real estate market. Last week, for instance, government statistics showed that the number of new homes under construction hit a four-year high in June.
"Housing has switched from being a drag on the overall economy to being a slight positive," said Mark Vitner, an economist at Wells Fargo & Co. "It's so ironic: everything else seems to be losing momentum but housing seems to be gaining it."
Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. underscored that point in a note to clients on Monday that recommended buying the stocks of U.S. home builders. "Rising home prices will drive a 3-7 year up-cycle in the U.S. housing market," they wrote.
The fact that overall economic growth is far from vigorous isn't a big concern, they added. Previous housing recoveries have begun when the economy was in outright recession, they noted, plus the combination of rising home prices, adequate job growth, and a falling backlog of homes for sale will all help drive the market.
Housing is no longer as important to the economic health of the U.S. as it was during the boom years, but it exerts a major influence on the behaviour of consumers and helps spur output in a host of related industries. An improvement in the market isn't the solution to the country's economic malaise, but it will help buttress confidence at a time when consumers are hearing persistently bad news from Europe and beyond.
Of course, there's plenty of reason for caution. The housing market remains very far from normal. While the glut in supply is easing, inventories remain high, propped up by a steady flow of foreclosed properties. Roughly a quarter of mortgage-holders owe the bank more than their home is worth, making a move undesirable or impossible. And home prices are still down 33 per cent from their peak in 2006 through the first quarter of this year, according to the S & P/Case-Shiller national index.
As a result, most experts say the recovery in housing will be gradual rather than dramatic. Zillow predicts that prices will rise about 1 per cent over the next year. Conditions also vary widely from city to city.
"It's a mixed bag," said Svenja Gudell, senior economist at Zillow. In places like Phoenix and Miami, where the local market was devastated by the housing bust, prices have shot higher compared to last year, sparking tales of bidding wars. But in cities like Chicago and Atlanta, prices fell in the second quarter compared to a year earlier.
Still, the worst days for the U.S. housing market are behind it. Mike Ruzicka, president of the Greater Milwaukee Association of Realtors, remembers feeling something close to despair toward the end of last year as the market refused to improve. Then, he said, activity began to pick up - first in open houses and Internet listings - and that translated into actual deals in the first months of 2012.
Mr. Ruzicka attributes the change to a new sense of confidence among potential homebuyers, since the other ingredients for a turnaround - low prices, rock-bottom interest rates, and a wide variety of homes for sale - were already in place.
Even as sales increased in the first months of 2012, Mr. Ruzicka refused to believe the progress would last, remembering a similar upturn in 2010 which proved fleeting. But the momentum has continued into the summer and he now believes rising prices in his area will follow shortly.
"Things are going extremely well right now," he said. "We're pulling on the rope hoping the rest of the economy comes along."''

Full text:   New Westminster is enjoying an up-and-coming rep that's attracting a young, hip crowd
At the New Westminster Quay Market, a photographic silk-screened montage by artist Ed Pien depicts idyllic scenes from the banks of the adjacent Fraser River. Billowing elegantly over the top of an escalator, the work is called New Paradise .
While that may be an ambitious moniker for the city of 66,000 at the geographic centre of the Lower Mainland, it is certainly becoming the region's new real estate darling.
Affordability is a huge factor, as homes here are often $200 less per square foot than in Vancouver, and $100 less per square foot than in Burnaby - where Metrotown development has accelerated residential real estate prices. And at only 15 square kilometres, with an intact, largely Edwardian downtown, it's not only cheaper than many neighbouring suburbs, it's also much more attractive.
"My friends were a little hesitant about visiting me when we bought a house here last month" confides 30-year-old Michael Kaisaris, of his hipster friends from his old hood - the Main and Broadway epicentre of Vancouver cool, "but now a lot of them are moving out here too. The other day I even saw a guy on a "Fixie" [a fixed-gear bike] on the riverwalk."
But for Mr. Kaisaris and his wife, a sommelier at Gastown hotspot Jules expecting the couple's first child, the decision to move to New Westminster seemed like a natural progression. "Where else could we buy an 1,800-square-foot heritage home with a garden for $450,000?"
And with his new Re-up BBQ restaurant opening at the recently refurbished River Market on the Quay, his commute is a mere 10-minute walk. Mr. Kaisaris and his wife are typical of a new breed of young buyers - many of them cultural creatives who are rediscovering the city's charms. They're also part of the 25- to 39-year-old demographic - 24 per cent of the city's population - that's helped make New Westminster the most rapidly densifying area in the GVRD. Some say the young entrepreneurial energy of the 153-year-old city - B.C.'s first urban centre - dates back to its status as the pre-Confederation capital of the colony of British Columbia.
"New Westminster was always a commercial hub," says Lisa Spitale, director of development services at the city. And it was a distinctly Canadian one, with a business-minded population that hailed from the Great Lakes regions and the Maritimes. This was in contrast to the more British and bureaucratic tone of Victoria, that usurped the coveted capital status from the young town when Vancouver Island was incorporated into the colony.
But New Westminster's heyday was in the post-Second World War era, when its downtown core - known as the "golden mile" - was a regional retail hub and manufacturing, railway, forest products and fishing industries flourished. It fell on hard times in the 1970s, when shopping malls in nearby suburbs and new freeways killed the historic downtown, and traditional industries slumped.
When a provincial government backed Expo 86 initiative helped develop the waterfront - still a working river - and saw a new SkyTrain station built and Douglas College opened, the city enjoyed a mini-renaissance. The nineties era of suburban expansion largely bypassed New Westminster, partly because it was much cheaper to build tract housing and strip malls on vacant farmland and industrial sites rather than in a pre-existing community. Thanks to this as well as the city's preservation oriented policies, much of New Westminster's heritage architecture was saved.
Developer Robert Fung recognized the city's potential in the 2000s, purchasing two historic buildings on Columbia Street in 2005. "You can't really call this place a suburb," says Mr. Fung, "it has a real urban grain to it, and a strong sense of place."
But his plans to redevelop the late 19th-century Trapp and Holbrook buildings were put on hold by the 2008 global economic slump, and he ended up leasing them to a local non-profit society that assists homeless women and children. Now, finally, the moment is right. The development, consisting of a new concrete 20-storey building above an existing heritage podium level, is slated for completion in 2014. Designed by the IBI Group, it features a revitalized façade from the Trapp building paired with sleek modern interiors by Cristina Oberti. Enthusiastic presales have already begun.
"Of the 800 people who signed up in the first few weeks," says Mr. Fung, "most are young professionals in their 30s and 40s." They are of course attracted to the relatively low price point - with roomy, 750-square-foot two bedrooms with high, loft inspired ceilings and water views, starting at $339,000 - but also to the convenience of local transit hubs. With five sky-train stations in New Westminster, the city is only a 22-minute ride away from downtown Vancouver.
For an increasingly carless generation of "Y's," this is a huge selling point. "My friends from Vancouver are only coming in to see me tonight because of the SkyTrain," notes Mr. Kaisaris of his 30th birthday celebration at his new home, complete with artisanal beer kegs and local foodie friends who have opened shops and cafes along the old "golden mile. None of them own vehicles."
Easy transit access has also made New Westminster popular with businesses like the Lowe's Company - which recently located its first Home Improvement Warehouse in B.C. here - and a plethora of developers equally welcomed by the city's "open for business" attitude.
With plans to attract 21,000 new downtown residents by 2031, as well as investors and conferences, the city has embarked on ambitious new development plans. The $25-million, 3.8 hectare Westminster Pier Park opened this summer, and with it more pedestrian access to the waterfront. A $35-million, multi-use civic facility that will include a convention centre, 350-seat theatre, restaurant and museum, will be completed in 2014. Phase one of Wesbrook Properties $600-million redevelopment of the Brewery District at the old Labatt's site will feature a mix of office, retail, residential and health-care facilities.
And the Plaza 88 project, developed by Degelder Construction as a series of towers built on top of a SkyTrain station with adjacent retail, will soon include a fourth residential tower, bringing the total number of condos to more than 1,000 units.
But it's the Salient Group's new Trapp and Holbrook project that seems the best metaphor for a city whose historical roots are being tapped by a whole new generation.
Mr. Fung's usual high standards and commitment to heritage conversions have meant that even though he will have to gut the two buildings - vacant since 1976 - the original terracotta façade will be taken down and painstakingly refurbished and reassembled. And as construction begins along the former "golden mile," every effort will be made to preserve the area's retail sensibility - with ground-floor space featuring large wood-framed picture windows that engage with the streetscape. While the site is currently flanked on one side by the Art-Deco Paramount - a former cinema specializing in Disney flicks transformed into a strip bar - and a plethora of bridal shops on the other, there are signs of a sea-change - or at the very least a fresh riverine breeze - afoot.
There are now vegan cafes, mid-century furniture shops and yoga studios in the area that co-exist peacefully with the Army and Navy, comedy clubs and mom-and-pop retailers. The comparisons to Mr. Fung's historic Flack Block conversion in Gastown are evident. But New Westminster holds its own, insists Mr. Fung.
"There's such a strong sense of community here," he says," it's the glue that holds it all together. Without it, all this," he gestures to the several blocks of Columbia Street that take in heritage buildings, new storefronts and young mums with strollers who walk past smiling old-timers, "would not be possible."

Cadillac Fairview Corp. and FRAM Building Group are developing sleek, contemporary towers for the first two phases of a master-planned community in the established Don Mills community. But the latest condominium instalment, called Flaire, will be fashioned with a much larger and shapelier silhouette created with undulating glass and concrete balconies surrounding two 11-storey towers.
"We've taken the units that were very well received at Reflections and Liv Lofts ... and adapted it to the shape of the building, Flaire," says Niall Collins, senior vice-president of development at Cadillac Fairview. "What's unique about Flaire is that it has a curved component, so it's a very sinuous-looking building."
Since the spring launch, the developers have sold about 60 per cent of the 296-suite building - designed by Giannone Petricone Associates - in a large part due to its design, but more importantly, its premium location within the Shops at Don Mills at the southwest corner of Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue.
"It's at the doorstep of nearly a half a million square feet of retail that's been there for a couple years," Mr. Collins says. "We've had some very unique retail offerings that you won't find in very many locations, if at all even, in Toronto."
The urban village is home to Michael Kors and Coach, as well as a town square, Fisker Automotive showroom, upscale bistros and grocer, including Fabbrica and McEwan by celebrity chef Mark McEwan.
Seven residences will eventually occupy the site, which is also surrounded by reputable schools, a library and parks, including Edwards Gardens and Sunnybrook Park.
"It's proximity to downtown is fantastic, we're really around the corner from the [Don Valley Parkway]," Mr. Collins adds.
Residents can also look forward to more retail shops at the base of Flaire's four-storey podium, as well as a private gym, theatre, lounge with Wi-Fi access and party room with a catering kitchen, bar and dining room.
A rooftop terrace will offer cabanas, lounge seating and barbecues. The balance of the building will contain one and two-bedroom units with open principal rooms with nine-foot ceilings and walls of windows, along with glass kitchen cabinetry, granite counters and stainless steel appliances.
"We've got a selection of two-bedrooms with well over 900 square feet," says Mr. Collins, who receives a lot of interest from locals downsizing from single-family homes. "And we've had some two-bedroom units combined with a one-bedroom suite to create a very large unit."
Units will include a locker, parking and monthly fees of 54 cents per square feet, plus individually metered hydro. Occupancy is slated for late 2014.

Rental units proposed at Rogers Arena

Author: Bula, Frances

Abstract: "I'm very puzzled why [Aquilini] would build rental over strata," Vancouver's director of real-estate services, Michael Flanigan, said at a public hearing last week.

Full text:   City will have to amend noise bylaws and account for a loss of $35-million in developer contributions if apartments are approved
The Aquilini company's unusual decision to put hundreds of rental apartments in three towers pressed up against its Rogers Arena will force the city to change its financial plans and noise bylaws for the area.
In spite of that, council appears to be headed toward approving the unique project this Thursday, because it gives Vision councillors something they promised voters in the election: more purpose-built rentals that can't be yanked out of circulation the way condo rentals can.
The city will lose about $35-million in developer contributions to community facilities in the Northeast False Creek area that would have been collected if the buildings had been condos, according to calculations city planners just made public.
That's not a concession to the developer to get the rental units. It simply reflects the fact that the city's system of collecting money from developers is geared to condos, the dominant form of apartment building since the 1980s.
As well, the sound bylaw will have to be amended to allow higher noise levels from concerts and sports events in the arena, only a few metres away from many of the apartments.
Aquilini's move to build 614 rental apartments, which will sit atop several floors of office space in the towers, has mystified city staff and councillors, even as they welcome it.
"I'm very puzzled why Aquilini would build rental over strata," Vancouver's director of real-estate services, Michael Flanigan, said at a public hearing last week.
But Aquilini Development president David Negrin said the company, owned by the Aquilini family, has advantages over other developers, who usually see rentals as high risk and lacking the immediate profits that condos produce.
"The family has been in rental a long time and they know what it takes," he said. "And our cost of land is lower."
As well, Mr. Negrin said, that arrangement will ensure that the company doesn't put on too many events at the arena that would disturb the nearby tenants.
"We will lose some concerts, we know that. But we need to rent the places. It is in our best interests to control [the noise]," Mr. Negrin said.
As well, the Aquilini development and its neighbour, Canadian Metropolitan Properties, are working together to meet city quotas for rentals and community services in Northeast False Creek.
The size of the Aquilini development means CMP will not have to come up with rental apartments on its own planned project - a startling arch-shaped glass building with a cluster of lower towers around it.
CMP will contribute a hockey rink as a Canucks practice facility and part-time community centre for the neighbourhood.
That arrangement has prompted two local resident groups to give a strong thumbs-up for the project.
"This will bring much-needed community benefits to this area," said Patsy McMillan of the False Creek Residents Association.
She said the group, which has been lobbying for well over a decade to get a park and other services on the former industrial and Expo 86 land in Northeast False Creek, recognizes that the city is losing the $35-million on developer contributions.
But it will get the arena, a daycare, and a pedestrian skybridge across the area, Ms. McMillan said.
The Aquilini's apartments will rent for going market rates, something that has drawn criticism from the Vancouver Renters' Union and others who say that does nothing to improve affordability.
They want the city to subsidize the rentals to make them more affordable.
But city councillors have long said they believe that the new rentals will provide a stock of housing equivalent to the many walk-up apartments built in Vancouver during the 1960s and 1970s.
Those were originally rented at high prices for the day, and now provide older and cheaper housing for thousands.

DARYL KATZ HAS THE PRESCRIPTION FOR OILERS

Full text:   The reclusive billionaire owner wants a new taxpayer-assisted Edmonton arena for two big reasons: It will guarantee the team stays put, and it's good for the city. But, he warns, 'hockey is not philanthropy. This is a business, capital is portable.' David Ebner reports
The picture of Daryl Katz is fuzzy.
It was 1987 when the Edmonton Oilers won their third Stanley Cup. As the players leapt onto the ice after the Game 7 victory at home against the Philadelphia Flyers, there, in the back of a photo, is the curly-haired Katz, several rows behind the bench, his fists thrust up, jubilation on his face. The young lawyer was 26, had season tickets, and was friends with some of the Oilers.
Several years later, as Katz turned 30, he pulled off his first big business deal, buying the Canadian rights to Medicine Shoppe pharmacies for $300,000. In the two decades since, he has built a fortune worth more than $3-billion in drugs and retail, led by his Rexall chain and real estate. He is one of the richest men in Canada, but little is known of the reclusive billionaire or his privately held business.
Now the 51-year-old owns the Oilers, and he has an arena deal to sell. In late June, he granted a rare interview, at his mansion in Edmonton, nine-metre-tall windows in the living room overlooking the North Saskatchewan River valley.
"It was amazing what that team did for this city," Katz said, remembering the glory years. "It was a city that needed the lift. And that team gave this city such an enormous shot in the arm, and pride, and changed the whole feeling and personality of this city. There are some that would say you could see it happening again."
Katz bought the Oilers four years ago for $200-million.
At the same time, Katz and the City of Edmonton began a push to build a new $450-million arena in the north end of the city's downtown, where there is nothing but parking lots and a small casino on a desolate stretch of blocks. Edmonton city council convenes on Tuesday for an important vote on the project. Costs are rising, and councillors have to decide whether to push forward as the city tries to nail down the budget at $450-million. The crucial decision will come in September or October, when councillors vote on the final funding deal with Katz.
The debate largely hinges on the significant amount of public money at stake. All the up-front construction cash is public, with Katz paying back half over more than three decades. He gets full control of the building, and an agreement to keep the team in Edmonton is part of the overall deal.
Both sides have already spent tens of millions on land, design and other investments. The total budget stands at about $600-million.
Katz painted the arena two ways.
The Oilers are losing money, he said, insisting they can't survive in Edmonton if the club doesn't get a new building. This is an argument from the first page of the playbook of professional sports club owners. Many hockey experts are skeptical Katz could move the team, given flailing NHL franchises elsewhere, starting in Phoenix.
Second, Katz and Edmonton Mayor Stephen Mandel believe the arena is an essential one-of-a-kind spark for the city's downtown, a draw for people, real-estate development and a font of new property taxes. They want to replicate the downtown arena districts in places such as Los Angeles.
The demand to invest in sports is a constant pressure for North American cities. Seattle is one of the rare places that said no, and lost its NBA team to Oklahoma City. Quebec City this year approved a $400-million arena, underpinned by public funds, to lure back the NHL. The owners of the Calgary Flames have started work on how they can get a new arena built.
Critics of the Edmonton arena deal look at Katz's on-paper wealth and wonder why he can't just build an arena himself. This year he sold a portion of his business for almost $1-billion in cash. Others gossiped about the opposite, that Katz had to sell to raise emergency funds, that he is overextended.
Katz scoffed at both suggestions. He said he has enough money to back up his promises and dismissed arguments that he's getting a sweetheart deal. He said he has invested more than any other local would, and more than owners elsewhere. He feels Edmontonians underappreciate the money he has spent, and has committed.
"I'm not asking anybody for anything," he said. "If they don't want a new arena, don't build a new arena. It's up to them. I'm offering to step in. To the extent that no other owner has."
Katz lives in Edmonton only several months a year, spending winters in California, and time in Vancouver. He presented a front of emotional detachment from the city and even the hockey team as he stoked the spectre of no arena, no Oilers.
"Hockey is not philanthropy," he said. "This is a business, capital is portable. I can invest in real estate in Vancouver, Toronto, anywhere."
He spoke deliberately, and not quickly, punctuating sentences, punching words and phrases.
"I'm a builder," he said. "I can't say I really would have been interested in buying the team at all, but for the opportunity, through the team, to do such a transformational thing for the city, and also sustain the team, and sustain the NHL, and build a new arena, and revitalize the city. It was the whole kind of thing that was really attractive to me. I didn't have a burning desire to own a hockey team."
While there is often new development in the neighbourhood around arenas, peer-reviewed academic economics research does not find a broader boon for cities.
The findings are "strikingly consistent," according to a 2008 paper by economists Dennis Coates of the University of Maryland and Brad Humphreys of the University of Alberta. The professors said studies have uncovered "almost no evidence that professional sports franchises and facilities have a measurable economic impact on the economy."
But in Edmonton, whose most famous building is a sprawling suburban mall, many people share the instinct to invest in downtown.
Ian O'Donnell works for an architect and is a volunteer board member of the Downtown Edmonton Community League, a publicly funded group that represents residents in downtown development. The group was unimpressed with the first design for the arena in 2010, and Katz's development team has made changes to better encourage street life. O'Donnell does not yet feel it is ideal, but doesn't criticize the funding plan.
"What are we trying to do?" O'Donnell said. "Just good enough? Or a showcase of what this city is about? Nothing good comes cheap. Edmonton is perhaps trying to shake off some of that good enough. The city as a whole has realized, if you want something beautiful, it costs money."
The Oilers' current arena opened 15 minutes north of downtown, built with public funds, in 1974. It is one of the oldest in the NHL.
Whether any future Stanley Cup banners hang from the rafters of a new arena remains unclear. If there are enough yes votes, the building could be ready for the fall of 2015. Last time Edmonton city council voted on a stage of the arena proposal, in October of 2011, it was 10-3 in favour, stronger than an earlier 8-5 decision. But costs are climbing.
"It's not the Oilers I'm opposed to," said councillor Linda Sloan, who has voted against the deal so far. "I've spent many hours as a hockey mom. I have not been able to find another model where a municipality has so heavily subsidized a sports-franchise facility."
Katz emphasized the "once-in-a-generation opportunity" for the heart of the city.
"You've seen our plans," he said. "It's nothing short of miraculous."

WILLING TO TAKE A RISK
Edmonton billionaire Daryl Katz has always been a creative deal-maker. He staked his own money, but always pulled in cash from lots of other people.
To overcome a competing bid and clinch his first big deal, Katz brought in backing from the Government of Alberta. He did the deal with a partner, Vencap Equities, a venture-capital company set up by the Alberta Government to spur business outside the oil industry. Katz eventually bought out the government's share.
He rapidly expanded, aggressively using borrowed money. The son of an Edmonton pharmacist, Katz bought up drug stores on the cheap and tried to increase their profit. He piled up real estate, too. He brought in new technology and savvier sales strategies. An expansion into the United States was mostly ill fated, but his bet on the health-care business flourished in Canada.
"I put everything I had in every deal, for a long time," Katz said. "I risked everything on every deal."
His business goals remain big: to triple the number of Rexalls to 1,500 over the next decade, and to develop large real-estate projects.
Katz brings the same drive to his hockey team, the Edmonton Oilers. He has churned through coaches and personnel as he has overhauled the franchise. It has not been fun; the Oilers were the worst team in the NHL over the past three years. But there has also been tremendous luck. The Oilers have drafted first overall three years in a row. The odds of doing that, even when finishing last, last and second last, is 4.4 per cent. The young Oilers - Taylor Hall, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Nail Yakupov - appear poised to flourish, not unlike the young Oilers of the 1980s - Gretzky, Messier and the rest, who bloomed in their early 20s.

Victorian redo: A new way to renovate

Author: John Bentley Mays

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/victorian-redo-new-way-renovate/docview/1024641988/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Potential home buyers are being offered large, svelte but lightly old-fashioned downtown condominiums at prices - in the $600,000 to $700,000 range - that would get them considerably less elbow room in a typical new tower. Of course, anyone moving to Pembroke Street should be thoroughly city-proofed: The once-posh residential neighbourhood has long been a rough part of Toronto's inner east side.

The gentrification craze that began sweeping through Toronto's inner-city Victorian neighbourhoods 40 years ago was kind, generally speaking, to old streetscapes and house fronts, but much less gentle to what lay behind those façades.
If not forgivable, however, the stripping of interiors back to the bare bones in the name of "renovation" was understandable. Our bewhiskered great-grandfathers liked their living area diced up into clearly defined rooms, each with its distinct wallpaper, trim and decor. Modern taste circa 1970, in contrast, decreed that a house's space should flow freely from stem to stern, and that structurally necessary walls - the others were demolished - should be sandblasted down to the raw brick or painted stark white.
In their modernizing zeal, the pioneering fixer-uppers who took over Cabbagetown and other derelict 19th-century districts often renovated the character right out of their elderly properties.
The gutted interior, however, appears to have become less fashionable among homeowners than it was before the turn of this century. Younger fans of Victorian façades want their houses to be fresh, open and efficient: Nobody longs for the cramped kitchens and ill-lit rooms of old times.
But it may be that some would-be dwellers in Hogtown's antique housing are looking for more than standard modernity. They want interiors with something of the historic distinctiveness that one readily finds in the exteriors that have been better preserved.
One man who believes that such discriminating home hunters do exist in the marketplace is Mac Champsee, president of Toronto-based Rainbow Realty Ltd. and the developer (along with Sonal Champsee, his daughter) of an especially lovely, thoughtful condominium conversion at 103 Pembroke St., west of Cabbagetown and just south of Allan Gardens. The building at this address is a large, dignified Gothic revival home put up for a well-off local tea broker and his family in 1879 - and launched in that year on a career that has seen the sturdy old mansion plunge from the heights to the depths and, now, come back up again. After the prestige of the district collapsed early in the past century, the structure became a rooming house.
The basic shapes of the three units now for sale (plus one more, currently occupied) were carved from the yellow brick building in the 1980s and rented out. The roof was shot, the foundations were creaky, and the interior was a mess when Mr. Champsee's group bought the place five years ago, and began undoing decades of neglect and transforming the apartments from dumps into the spacious, comfortably conservative condos they are today.
The three available suites have much in common. Each is 1,400 square feet in area, and each has a ground-level entrance. Crafted by interior designer Linda Boorman, each apartment is clean-lined and open enough for any contemporary city dweller, but the elegant crown mouldings, baseboards and generous Victorian windows gracefully connect the unit's modern present to its architectural past. Each suite contains two bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, a gas fireplace framed by marble-textured ceramic tiles, and maple floors. Every unit comes with a parking space in the garage at the rear, and there are other shared features.
That said, no two units here are exactly alike, and the differences are significant. One of the suites, for example, opens into a perky new gazebo (which has replaced an older, ill-fitted one) perched on the sunny southwest corner of the house, overlooking the front garden and the street - an ideal inner-city spot, I imagine, for lingering in the long twilights of Toronto's summer days. An attractive element in the walk-up apartment (entered from the paved yard at the back of the house) is a small deck off the kitchen, an intimate place above and apart from the city, but still nestled (as balconies in high-rises are not) in the dense weave of the urban fabric.
Potential home buyers are being offered large, svelte but lightly old-fashioned downtown condominiums at prices - in the $600,000 to $700,000 range - that would get them considerably less elbow room in a typical new tower. Of course, anyone moving to Pembroke Street should be thoroughly city-proofed: The once-posh residential neighbourhood has long been a rough part of Toronto's inner east side. But downtown veterans unfazed by the district's reputation for rowdiness will probably be delighted by these tall-ceilinged flats, which have been designed with urbane flair and with attention to architectural heritage that was too often missing in Victorian overhauls of the 1970s.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/bloor-high-park-113-gothic-ave/docview/1024639975/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Several decades ago, a high-rise developer planned to raze low-rise homes on the east side of Gothic Avenue for a large development. But after opposition from locals, the existing homes were left intact on the grounds of the condominium community. Among the properties preserved was this semi-detached house, which now pays a monthly fee of $182 for cable and access to the high-rises' amenities, services and garage.

The Action: On a maturely treed cul-de-sac near High Park, this 2 1/2-storey house was visited by nearly 150 buyers with private showings and more than 200 shoppers who dropped by the open house. The large turnout translated into nearly a dozen buyers with registered bids.
What They Got: Several decades ago, a high-rise developer planned to raze low-rise homes on the east side of Gothic Avenue for a large development. But after opposition from locals, the existing homes were left intact on the grounds of the condominium community. Among the properties preserved was this semi-detached house, which now pays a monthly fee of $182 for cable and access to the high-rises' amenities, services and garage. Inside, there is a living room with marble fireplace, pot lights and new hardwood floors that flow into a dining area, as well as an updated kitchen with marble floors, stainless steel appliances and a walkout to a two-tiered deck that fills out the entire yard. Carpeting cushions the family room on the basement, which houses the smallest of two bathrooms. Four bedrooms are spread out on the second and third floors.
The Agent's Take: "It's part of the complex behind it - at 50, 80 and 100 Quebec - so the perk with that is ... it gets two parking spots in the garage downstairs ... basic cable, and they get to use all the facilities, which include the pool, tennis court and gym, and all their snow is shovelled," agent Michael Inwood says.
"It's a very unique situation and I think it's a huge bonus." Plus, the property is in a convenient and safe location. "That street is very kid and children friendly. Nearly every second house has younger kids and a lot of pets," he says.

LISTING AGENTS
Nancy, Elden and Daniel Freeman, Freeman Real Estate Ltd.
The Action: Time was of the essence in the sale of this three-storey, semi-detached residence in Seaton Village, from the speed to which the listing agents worked to complete the marketing materials to coincide with the bloom of the magnolia tree on the front lawn to the urgency the buyers felt to submit a bully offer after losing other local bidding wars.
What They Got: Across from Vemont Square, a lot measuring 16 by 100 feet supports this more than-century-old house with wood trims, hardwood floors and two fireplaces, including one in the largest of five bedrooms, plus a partially finished basement with a carpeted recreation room.
Updates in the past decade include new heating and cooling systems, more open living and dining areas, two remodelled bathrooms and eat-in kitchen with three appliances, a built-in desk and access to landscaped gardens, a flagstone patio and parking off the laneway.
The Agent's Take: "It's a beautiful house facing a park and it was all done up, so it had a clean elegance to it," says agent Elden Freeman.
"It's perhaps a little bigger than typical because it had two bedrooms on the third floor. In the area, there are more two-storey semis than three-storey semis with five bedrooms."

Spain's debt pains bring a backlash against austerity

Abstract: "It's a climate where private investment isn't happening and where money isn't coming from the public sector," remarked Gordon Betcherman, an economist at the University of Ottawa and a former World Bank official. "It's hard to imagine that unemployment won't go even higher."

Full text: A bloody clash between protesters and police in Spain highlights the growing pushback against the wrenching government austerity under way in much of Europe.
Police fired rubber bullets at protesting miners and thousands of supporters in the heart of Madrid on Wednesday, sending at least six to hospital, as Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced another dose of tough economic medicine.
The protests - the first large-scale demonstrations to hit the Spanish capital since the crisis began - underscore the growing resistance facing many European governments as they struggle with mounting debt and a downward economic spiral.
Spain's EUR65-billion package promises sharply higher sales tax, steeper energy bills and lower wages for many over the next 2 1/2 years. It also promises a longer and deeper recession - and therein lies the quandary for Europe's most heavily indebted countries. Tough budget measures are destabilizing already weakened economies and delaying a recovery.
As the Prime Minister was outlining the latest emergency measures, thousands of miners upset at subsidy cuts to coal producers marched into Madrid, joined by thousands of sympathetic locals.
The miners worry that budget cuts will lead to mine closings and thousands of layoffs. Ordinary Spaniards are also growing weary of seemingly endless budget cuts and tax hikes.
Mr. Rajoy acknowledged his unease, calling the measures "not pleasant, but they are necessary." He blamed changed circumstances for reneging on a campaign promise and hiking the value-added tax to a punishing 21 per cent from 18 per cent.
"We are trying to stick to a path that is not easy, short or comfortable, but we cannot avoid it. This is the only one that leads to recovery," Mr. Rajoy told lawmakers in the Spanish parliament.
The moves will hit consumers especially hard in a country already reeling from a flight of private investment, a real-estate meltdown and steep unemployment.
Spain's economy is expected to shrink 1.7 per cent this year as the country endures its second recession since 2008. The jobless rate is already the worst in the 17-member euro zone at nearly 25 per cent. More than half the country's under-25s are out of work.
"It's a climate where private investment isn't happening and where money isn't coming from the public sector," remarked Gordon Betcherman, an economist at the University of Ottawa and a former World Bank official. "It's hard to imagine that unemployment won't go even higher."
Compounding the continent's woes, Europe is facing years of hardship. "This is such a long haul. This is not your normal cyclical downturn," Prof. Betcherman said.
Spanish officials are predicting near-zero economic growth next year. Private-sector economists fear worse - contraction of 1.4 per cent as austerity takes a huge bite out of the economy.
Spain badly overshot its deficit target this year. On Monday, euro-zone finance ministers agreed to relax the goal to 6.3 per cent of gross domestic product this year, from an initial target of 5.3 per cent.
But even that mark could be tough to achieve. Spain rang up a deficit just shy of 9 per cent of GDP in 2011.
Canada's federal deficit is expected to hit 1.2 per of GDP this year and 0.5 per cent in 2013.
Spain is hardly unique. Other euro-zone countries already in recession, including Italy, Portugal and Greece, are facing a similar austerity dilemma. The more they clamp down, the more their economies shrink, worsening their fiscal problems.
In the Portuguese capital of Lisbon on Wednesday, doctors in white coats took part in protest marches and a national strike over cuts to the health budget. The Portuguese Health Ministry said 400,000 medical appointments and nearly 4,500 operations were cancelled.
Experts argue that Spain's tax hikes could make austerity less palatable to Spaniards. Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, said countries should focus more on spending cuts than tax hikes.
"People do not want to pay more for less public services," Mr. Aslund said. "It's much easier to sell to the population that the government is trying to trim itself with belt tightening ... and it also drives structural reform."
Mr. Rajoy and the Spanish government are facing growing pushback from Spaniards, fed up with the combination of budget cuts and higher taxes.
Spain and many other euro-zone countries have little room to manoeuvre and few good options.
Spain, for example, is attempting structural reforms, budget cuts and tax hikes - all simultaneously. In addition to the VAT hike, Mr. Rajoy announced tax hikes for heavily subsidized utility companies, reduced jobless benefits for younger workers and a 7-per-cent pay cut for federal workers.
Doing nothing isn't an option. In recent months, Spain has faced upward pressure on borrowing costs as investors fret about the country's mounting economic problems and worsening financial condition.
Borrowing costs eased a bit Wednesday as investors reacted favourably to the austerity package. The rate on 10-year government bonds fell 16 points to 6.62 per cent. In recent weeks the yield has neared the 7-per-cent mark - a level analysts said Spain can't afford.

Full text: Imagine a city full of public gardens and orchards where anyone, rich or poor, could pick fresh fruits and vegetables for free. Sarah Elton reports on a movement making this locavore dream a reality. But would you want it to sprout in your local park?
In downtown Kamloops, B.C., on a narrow patch of land near the hospital thrift shop and a tanning salon, there's a vegetable garden. Its raised beds are planted with kale, peas and squash - a whole variety of produce, growing in the open, with no fences to keep out passersby.
Which is exactly the point. The garden is called the Public Produce Project and has an official open-picking policy: Anybody is invited to come in and harvest food for free. There are signs instructing people what to take, when and how.
Chelsea Bailey, who runs the nearby restaurant The Ploughman's Lunch with her family, took advantage of it on her breaks last summer, as a refuge from her busy job. "I would go to the garden, pick a couple pieces of lettuce and sit on a bench and eat them," she says. "It was so freeing. You could just go outside and eat something."
There were always a lot of people coming, particularly children and university students, as well as the homeless. And the garden had a lasting influence on Ms. Bailey's own diet: "Since then, I have eaten more fresh foods, because I realized how lovely they are."
While governments in Canada have been distancing themselves from food production (as with the recent scrapping of the federal Canadian Wheat Board), the garden in Kamloops is part of a growing movement.
It advocates using public lands for food instead of flowers - creating spaces in cities for vegetable beds and fruit trees rather than lawns and dog walking. While the work may be done by volunteers, it requires the support of the state and the community at large. And despite critics who fear that food in common space will create messes or attract vermin and vagrants, it's spreading rapidly across the continent.
These initiatives come at a time of rising food awareness in the culture and a burgeoning need in the population. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, only about a quarter of us eats three servings of fruit and vegetables a day. Obesity rates continue to climb and large swaths of cities are classified as "food deserts" - areas where there is little or no access to healthy, fresh foods.
"The state has a responsibility to make sure the community is fed adequately," says Laura Kalina, co-chair of the Kamloops Food Policy Council, which started the garden with a group of residents. "There should be policy in place to make sure land is available to grow food."
While the garden was launched on land donated by people in the community, the municipal government was quick to join in, opening two more this summer, including a raised bed at City Hall with strawberries and pumpkins for all to harvest.
Elaine Sedgman, who is with the local chapter of Master Gardeners, an organization that teaches gardening to the public, saw how quickly people took to the idea. "There were ladies across the street who worked at the hospital thrift store who would pick. There would be homeless people and business people who picked the produce. ... Whenever I went to work there, there wasn't anything ripe because it was so well-picked."
Not for members only
For decades, city-dwellers have worked together to grow food in community gardens, which are often found in parks on plots allotted by the city. However, these plots are typically kept secure from anyone who is not a member of the community group. With public produce gardens such as the one in Kamloops, urban agriculture in North America is being transformed from a private grassroots activity to a public project with a whiff of social welfare.
There are many permutations. In one midtown Toronto city park, volunteers care for a public orchard of apricot, apple, pear and cherry trees, and harvest the fruit to share. This spring in front of City Hall in Baltimore, cold-tolerant greens such as collards and chard were grown by Master Gardeners and sent to a local food bank. Volunteers have replaced flowers with veggies at the capital building in Madison, Wis., and donate the produce to a social-services agency.
In Seattle in 2010, there was enough food grown on parkland to provide almost 42,000 produce servings to non-profit agencies. Now a parcel of land owned by Seattle Public Utilities is being transformed, with municipal grant money, into the Beacon Food Forest, where the public will be able to forage for berries, nuts and fruits. Last month, the Office de consultation publique in Montreal held public hearings into urban agriculture.
Even when Michelle Obama sowed her kitchen garden on the White House lawn, it was a symbolic gesture in the same direction - although those vegetables supply the presidential kitchen, not the public.
Replanting the commons
Growing food on public ground has roots in history. It recalls the "commons" that people who lived in rural communities shared for agriculture. Before the Industrial Revolution in England, villagers grazed their animals in public fields, until they were taken over by private landowners.
Today, the urge arises in response to multiple crises in North America - economic, nutritional and environmental, says Darrin Nordahl, an urban designer who lives in California. He coined the term "public produce" in his 2009 book of the same name.
"We've finally realized that the way we eat and procure our food is drastically affecting our quality of life," Mr. Nordahl says. "Even government officials are recognizing that we have an opportunity to bolster our cities' quality of life."
The amount of state involvement can vary from simply permitting volunteers to produce food on public land to providing labour and supplies. In Baltimore, public employees raise the seedlings for the City Hall vegetable beds in municipal greenhouses before they are planted by Master Gardener volunteers.
Mr. Nordahl recently worked with the city of Davenport in Iowa, where he enacted some of his ideas. "Probably 30 to 35 per cent of the real estate in every city boundary is publicly owned, and that's huge. We have an opportunity here."
What he identifies as public land includes hospital grounds, university campuses, school fields as well as the obvious parks, road boulevards and the government-building grounds - anywhere the public has free and open access.
In this way, publicly funded landscaping can play many roles beyond city beautification. It can fill hungry stomachs, improve health and ease the financial burden for struggling families.
"There is a whole lot of ornamental landscaping which isn't serving more than our visual appetites," says Deborah Lakowicz Dramby, a student at the University of Maryland who helped start a Public Health Garden on campus last summer. "Imagine if you could walk to a park and pick apples because you can?"
Public-produce gardens also can save the city landscaping fees, since volunteers do most of the work and there is no need to buy tulip bulbs. In 2008, when Provo, a city of just over 100,000 in Utah, cut its budget and decided not to put flowers in the planters at City Hall, a few planners sowed vegetables instead. They borrowed tools and compost from the city, tended to their planter gardens on their own time and donated the produce to the local food bank.
Some gardens even earn money. The beehives on Chicago City Hall's green roof produce honey that is sold to the public. At the University of California at Davis, where fallen olives on campus once caused bicycle accidents, the university now collects and presses them for oil, the proceeds of which are used to finance industry research and education.
'It was tense'
Not everyone likes the idea of food being produced in their urban neighbourhoods. Currently in Annapolis, Md., a dispute has erupted between people who want to open a community garden in a park and those who want the green space to be left alone rather than produce food for a less-prosperous area nearby. According to a local newspaper, the fight is so vicious that neighbours aren't on speaking terms.
In Toronto, there was acrimony in the Eglinton West neighbourhood near Ben Nobleman Park when the idea of launching a public orchard was first proposed. Some tried to stop it, fearing that the fruit trees would be neglected and attract bees that could sting children.
"It was tense and it was uncomfortable," says Susan Poizner, one of the founders. Nevertheless, the orchard of 14 trees was planted and the community has seen a transformation. "Suddenly, Ben Nobleman Park is a destination. It's not a just a park you walk through."
Over all, though, Mr. Nordahl has found that the idea of growing food on city land appeals to people on both sides of the political spectrum. "I thought this would be a liberal-versus-conservative issue, but everyone supports this," he says. "The liberals think of it as social welfare and the conservatives love it because it is a bit of agrarian tradition. We are teaching some measure of self-sustenance."
Perhaps surprisingly, there have been few reports of vandalism or hoarding. When gardens are picked clean by people hungry for free food, their caretakers see it as proof of a need to plant more, rather than to put up restrictions.
Certainly in Kamloops, there has been no opposition, according to city councillor Donovan Cavers. "There is definitely strong support," he says. "The symbolism is caring for your neighbour and pulling a few weeds for their benefit. It's a small idea, but the concept behind it is pretty profound."
Inspired by the Kamloops example, Cranbrook, B.C., started its own public produce garden this year. That's the way Mr. Nordahl believes this idea will spread across the continent. He predicts that within two decades public produce will be like recycling is today - an urban imperative.
"Wherever you live, there should be food growing. This has to be something that is much larger than it already is."

Full text: From birth pangs to boomtown, the 100-year-old Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth has been there for it all
American cowboy and showman Guy Weadick rode into this boomtown 100 years ago with an inkling that Calgary would be the ideal host for a Wild West festival with the richest rodeo prizes on the continent.
With his trick-riding wife, Florence LaDue, by his side, he convinced the city's most prominent residents - Patrick Burns, A.E. Cross, George Lane and A.J. McLean - known as the Big Four, to back the Calgary Stampede. With the event's staging, the city of about 70,000 suddenly ballooned to 100,294 with spectators.
With the Stampede now in its centennial year, organizers were so overwhelmed with applicants they had to turn away entries for Friday's parade, which featured more than 4,000 people and 700 horses to kick off the 10-day event. The so-called Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth is expected to attract a record number of visitors - more than 1.2 million - which outstrips the city's population, and will inject about $345-million into the economy.
For all the passing of years, some things don't change: At its core, Calgary is still an enthusiastic, unapologetic boomtown. It just looks a little different.
As Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi, the country's first Muslim big-city mayor, sat atop a horse named Garfield ready to ride at the front of the parade, he reflected on the historic nature of the event.
"I don't know what Guy Weadick and Florence LaDue thought they were building with the Big Four in 1912, but I'm sure that they understood that they were building something special and lasting that would end up in the bloodstream and the DNA of every Calgarian," he said. "I'm excited to be part of that this year and it's just amazing to be part of the centennial."
In fact, the inaugural event was supposed to be a one-time party, a kind of final farewell to the ranching way of life. (It didn't become an annual affair until 1923.) The coming of the railway had ushered in industry and, in the surrounding areas, cash crops were flourishing.
Not surprisingly, Calgary was a magnet for job seekers. Real estate exacted a premium. Speculators racked up personal fortunes. The city was growing at such a pace, planners and businesses were frantically building infrastructure to keep up with the boom.
"Calgary was creaking and groaning," said local historian and author David Finch.
Now, of course, it's oil and gas driving the Calgary economy and luring newcomers from other provinces, and even other countries.
As the Snowbirds aerobatics team flew overhead and the parade marshal, cowboy crooner Ian Tyson, stood behind him, Prime Minister Stephen Harper told Stampede-goers that this event has become a "real Canadian icon" known around the world.
"It's something that has preserved our values, our ranching values of hard work, enterprise, self-reliance - the things on which this city has been built," said Mr. Harper, who represents a Calgary riding.
"If I had one reflection on the centennial," he continued, "I think that if the founders could be here today and see this great city, see what has built up around this event, they would be amazed. They would be amazed to see that their Stampede has been part of giving birth to the greatest city in the greatest country in the world."
Alberta Premier Alison Redford, riding a horse named Rowdy, echoed those sentiments. "We're a pretty diligent, hard-working group of people, and the 100th anniversary really does celebrate what our successes have been," she said.
Of course, the Stampede has always had its detractors, both inside and outside the city. There are the animal welfare activists who decry the treatment of the horses, calves and bulls. There are also those who turn up their noses and call it 10 days of drunken cowboy Halloween.
Aritha van Herk, author and professor at the University of Calgary, said she isn't surprised Mr. Weadick pulled off this show - and that 100 years later the city is still revelling in it. Love it or hate it, she said, it's a brand that has come to define the city, and one that any other city would pay millions to embrace.
"We're Cowtown," she added, "but it doesn't mean we're not sophisticated."

High time for more low-rises

Author: Hadani Ditmars

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/high-time-more-low-rises/docview/1023899857/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: He notes that some towers in the area, like the Woodwards one, tend to be "inward looking" with a lack of "street-front engagement." Low-rises by nature have a greater engagement with the street and tend to go against the grain of the "commodity ubiquity towers" that proliferate around, say, the False Creek South area.

Full text: Developers see Vancouver's historic neighbourhoods as great opportunities for erecting buildings on a more human scale
The traditional "Vancouverist" model of a tower and podium may well be headed for a civic sea change. In the midst of controversy over proposed new towers - like the Rize Alliance development in Mount Pleasant that continues to draw significant community opposition despite being approved by council - several new "low-rise" projects are quietly making their mark on the urban landscape.
Call it the "slow-rise" revolution if you will, but the model that is gaining ground is one that evokes an earlier era and a more human scale, with uniquely contemporary design. Centred around Vancouver's historic neighbourhoods, projects like Gastown's Paris Annex, Chinatown's Flats on Georgia and Mount Pleasant's Collection 45 offer modernist architectural values that respect the surrounding built-and-social environments in a way that the city's growing number of cookie-cutter towers do not.
Developer Robert Fung, whose six-storey Paris Annex building will be completed this summer, and has already sold out, contends that "our region needs density - it's crucially important. But that doesn't mean that it has to be exclusively through high-rises."
He notes that Paris, one of the densest cities in the world, achieved that density largely through the six-storey walk-up typology.
While he believes that high-rises can be designed with sensitivity to their environment, low-rises offer certain advantages, says Mr. Fung, "They increase light in an area," he notes. "They offer a strong sense of identity and individuality, but at the same time make it easier for neighbours to get to know each other."
Because of the low-rise's need to be "strongly contextual to where they are," he says, "that can often mean a higher level of design, and greater attention to detail," noting that "our historic neighbourhoods tend to offer greater opportunities for this, as the buildings have to have a greater sense of engagement with their environment."
He notes that some towers in the area, like the Woodwards one, tend to be "inward looking" with a lack of "street-front engagement." Low-rises by nature have a greater engagement with the street and tend to go against the grain of the "commodity ubiquity towers" that proliferate around, say, the False Creek South area.
The Paris Annex is a conjoined fraternal twin of sorts to the next-door heritage conversion (and former HQ of Paris boot-makers) Paris Block. Both buildings, designed by architect Gair Williamson, share service core infrastructure.
"You have to walk through the old 1907 building to enter the new one," notes Mr. Williamson. "Every day, residents are literally moving through history."
The elegant 35-foot building of glass and steel will contain 2,500 square feet of retail on the ground floor and mezzanine, with 17 market residential units on the upper floors.
The constraints of these "character sites," as Mr. Williamson calls them, "make them unique. When you work on a 25-foot site, you have to respond with integrity and be hyper-aware of the surrounding environment."
Project architect Jenny Chow notes that large pivot windows and balconies in both buildings augment the relationship between residents and the street. Ms. Chow, who actually resides in the Paris Block, says "friends in the neighbourhood can literally call up to my window and I can lean out to say hello." This "living above the shop" feel lends an old-world Asian or European feel, while the sleek interiors offer modern design and creature comforts. Such a combination of high design and community building features would be hard to replicate in a taller building.
While Mr. Williamson notes that many of the new downtown towers are "hot in summer, crowded and expensive," he says, "low-rises are great for the community and the residents. But in terms of feasibility, that's another issue. There are so few character sites left that the low-rise in its historic context will soon become extinct."
But the city is recognizing this dwindling stock and is re-examining issues around parking requirements and height.
For the new Flats on Georgia development in Chinatown, the key to making an economically feasible low-rise, says project architect Sandra Moore of Birmingham and Wood, was permission to "build to the front and rear of property lines" on a traditional 25-foot lot. The extra space mitigated costs and also lent a historical authenticity to the project.
Clad in a steel and aluminum curtain wall, the nine-storey building features steel railings and shutters, evocative of historical Chinatown buildings, with at-grade street frontage also referencing neighbourhood shop houses.
This is the first project for Panther Construction Company, developers who have a long history in the neighbourhood and work with the inner-city revitalization non-profit group Embers. They were convinced by co-designer Inge Roecker of the site's potential and feasibility. Ms. Moore contends that "if the city can allow setbacks and more mass on small lots, this would be a huge contribution to housing supply and affordability. They need to focus more on small developments like this rather than big projects."
The building is flanked by a laneway to the east, which allows light in from three sides, and which Ms. Moore hopes will be revived as a traditional transitway.
The laneway is also celebrated in Collection 45, a new development in Mount Pleasant, just a few minutes away from the Rize Alliance tower site.
The 45-unit mixed-use development that broke ground last month is flanked by an east- and north-facing lane. New arts studios and an office café will overlook the laneways to facilitate greater engagement with the streetscape.
As Amela Brudar of GBL Architects explains, "We pulled the building in from the interior property line and created an internal street - a breezeway - that all the commercial units will face."
The 16-feet-high commercial base of the building is a glazed podium upon which two banks of stacked units "float." Irregular ground-floor setbacks allow for animation of street frontage by offering landscaping along the south facing edge.
The six-storey building with local industrial references of glass and steel and heritage brick is further connected to the streetscape by extensive glazing.
All interior corridors have windows and exit stairs are completely glazed.
With north-south orientation, most of the units have cross-ventilation and views. Some feature a unique "scissor" interior design, with bedrooms elevated and approached via a stairwell from the living area.
"People want to live in these suites," says Ms. Brudar.
Cristy Edmonds, vice-president of sales and marketing for developer Michael Ching, says, "The building is full of end-users. Towers tend to attract more speculators, while low-rises appeal to people who live and work in the community.
"It's nice to sell homes," she adds, "to real people."

Full text: Beer magnate Hugo Powell wanted to build a house that would last for generations. The result might be the largest dwelling in Canada
Hugo Powell's dog stared out the window, looking concerned.
The Hungarian Kuvasz breed is known for its suspicion of strangers and this one was scanning the crowd for a glimpse of Mr. Powell on the grounds of Chelster Hall in Oakville, Ont.
"They're fiercely protective of their masters," explained Mr. Powell, who adopted the abandoned dog from the Oakville Humane Society. He described how the breed was nearly wiped out in Hungary during the Second World War because the dogs were so intensely loyal to their masters that they were often shot by the German and Soviet soldiers who encountered them.
Mr. Powell is known as an animal benefactor and connoisseur of history; he is also renowned as a retired beer-industry magnate and the proprietor of what may be the largest dwelling in Canada.
On this occasion, he was hosting a fundraiser for the Oakville Chamber Orchestra. The event, held on a recent Saturday, marked a rare opportunity for town folk to visit the legendary estate.
"Because we've lived a very private, quiet life, this is only the second time we've had the gates open," Mr. Powell said.
During a stroll of the grounds, he explained the dwelling's English heritage, his reasons for building such a significant family home, and the legacy that he hopes will endure long into the future.
"If you look around you, anywhere in North America, after 50 years it's to the trash," he said of the constant razing of houses.
"We thought, surely there's a better way - built to last instead of to be trashed."
Mr. Powell's own roots are in India, where he was born in 1945, and England, where he was educated at Charterhouse School. He emigrated to Canada in 1971.
Mr. Powell was president of Labatt Brewing in 1995 when giant Interbrew SA of Belgium purchased the Canadian company. In 1999, he was promoted to chief executive officer at Interbrew and relocated to Belgium from Mississauga.
At the time, Mr. Powell and his wife Tracy had a young daughter and it was for her sake that they began to think about building a house in Canada.
Mr. Powell's sister is an educator, he explained, and she recommended sending four-year-old Britany to an all-girls school. The Powells decided on St. Mildred's-Lightbourn in Oakville.
Mr. Powell charged real-estate agent Christopher Invidiata with the task of assembling the four hectares of land.
"It was huge news. It went around the globe," Mr. Invidiata says of the vast project.
Meanwhile, from his post in Belgium, Mr. Powell had embarked on an ambitious plan to expand Interbrew's beer empire.
During that time, the British press seized on all opportunities to describe the acquisitive Mr. Powell's business dealings in terms of frothing, foaming and causing a fizz.
Perhaps it doesn't seem surprising then that Mr. Powell was undaunted by the prospect of seeking planning permission in Oakville for a waterfront house that would measure 54,000 square feet.
"It took three parcels - only one of which was for sale," Mr. Powell recalled.
As he looked toward the back of the multimillion-dollar house from a spot close to the water's edge, he explained that his inspiration came from Norfolk in the east of England. There, Blickling Hall was operated by the National Trust and open to the public. The stately home was once owned by Sir Thomas Boleyn, whose daughter Anne Boleyn would become the ill-fated second wife of Henry VIII.
Mr. Powell visited Blickling often when he was in England and his admiration was so strong that he hired architect William Hicks to design a grand house inspired by the English manor.
Along the way, Mr. Powell also consulted with the neighbours as he sought permission from the town planners. He agreed to decrease the size of the dwelling to approximately 47,000 square feet. One set of neighbours wanted him to cut down a tree that blocked their light; another wanted him to plant three trees to create more privacy.
Still, some residents were opposed to the scale of the estate. Those who were in favour decided they would prefer one large house to a newly built subdivision.
At the final public meeting, said Mr. Powell, his immediate neighbours spoke out in support of the project.
"We listened hard. That's why they all stood up and said, 'We would like to have it.'"
Along the way, Mr. Powell retired from Interbrew in 2002. In 2006 the house was completed.
As he recalled the lengthy undertaking, the musical ensemble played Vivaldi for the guests mingling on the lawns. Some wandered off to look at the lakeside pavilion, the tennis court and the chapel. A brown rabbit dashed from one side of the garden to the other.
Turning back to the house, Mr. Powell paused to study the rear elevation, which shows the Dutch gables, columns and curving ornamentation characteristic of Jacobean architecture.
"It was meant to look old when it was built and it was meant to look the same in 100 years."
He believes each owner of a classic house thinks of future occupants, as well as the current residents.
Future owners may make cosmetic changes to the interior, but he doesn't expect the exterior will be changed in any substantial way.
"I think the fundamentals are done well."
People always ask him the measure of the house in square feet; Mr. Powell says he doesn't know and couldn't care less. The height of the ceilings and the proportion of the rooms is key.
As many families do, the Powells congregate in the kitchen and family room.
Mr. Powell also has a two-storey library containing his collection of 3,000-odd books. A circular staircase connects the two levels.
The hall in particular has tremendous detail, he said, and required very specialized workmanship.
The spherical ceiling of the hall was so difficult to complete that the three craftsmen had to tear it out again and again.
"Three times it wasn't right and they had to redo it."
Many of the upstairs rooms are used to display the treasures amassed during a lifetime. Mr. Powell had his photo taken with Fidel Castro; he recalls the occasion as a "great treat." Ms. Powell has medals she earned as a competitive swimmer.
"We had families where all this went into drawers," he said of their respective childhood memorabilia. "To us, this allows it to live."
Nearly all of the materials used to build the house were found in Canada and the workers were local.
But the scope of the project was so large, it had to be divided up into many phases.
"It scared the small, entrepreneurial people away."
As Mr. Powell talked about the importance the house might have for Oakville's citizens, two of them walked by.
"Hi - we're your neighbours!" called out the female half of a couple as the pair made their way from the waterfront pavilion back toward the main house. Throughout the afternoon, politicians, business mavens and town residents paid their respects.
Mr. Powell affably allows that the citizens of Oakville appear to be deeply curious about what lies beyond the gatehouse. That's why he has placed two plaques outside the gates.
One explains that Chelster Hall is named for the family's two golden retrievers, Lady Chelsea and Manchester. The other explains that the chapel on the property is devoted to the patron saint of animals, St. Francis of Assisi.
The chapel is a place for private prayer and silent reverie.
"It's a special place. It's very simple," said Mr. Powell.
He explained that every house of consequence had a chapel in Norfolk, where the wool trade made many people wealthy.
"Any merchant who did well built a church."
He described how the sun rises above the water at dawn and illuminates the chapel.
"At 5 a.m. you've got this great ball of fire behind it."
He has yet to meet a person who has not been moved by the sound of music inside it, he said.
"As soon as people get back here, they feel how special it is."
To demonstrate, he turned on the sound and the interior filled with the sound of pipes and drums.
Passersby paused to listen; Mr. Powell was also clearly moved.
He hopes the estate will still be standing in 200 years.
"We see this building as a legacy to the community. It was wonderful to be able to do it."

Contrarian bet on RIM backfires

Abstract: It also helped that a glut of West Texas intermediate (WTI) oil at the major oil transportation hub of Cushing, Okla., has been pushing down WTI prices, at the same time as the price of imported Brent crude has risen on geopolitical concerns. HollyFrontiers' location in the middle of the United States means the refinery mostly processes WTI, so "they're not subject to the pressures of Brent pricing like some of the Eastern-based or Gulf Coast-based refiners," Mr. [David Sherlock] said.

Full text: Most experts in The Globe's annual competition are doing well, but RIM's woes drag down a pair
Halfway through their one-year commitment to a single stock, My One and Only stock-picking contestants are mostly smiling. But two of them are crying into their BlackBerrys.
Ten of the 13 financial experts in our annual stock-picking contest have seen their picks rise on a total-return basis (including dividends) in the first six months of the year - not bad considering the S & P/TSX composite index fell 3 per cent over the same period.
Leading the way is David Sherlock, portfolio manager at Calgary-based McLean & Partners Wealth Management Ltd., whose pick of Texas petroleum refiner HollyFrontier Corp. generated a six-month total return of 57 per cent. His pick benefited from a pair of 50-cents-a-share special dividends in March and June, as well as two share buyback programs since Januray.
"This is probably what's really gotten the stock moving," Mr. Sherlock said.
It also helped that a glut of West Texas intermediate (WTI) oil at the major oil transportation hub of Cushing, Okla., has been pushing down WTI prices, at the same time as the price of imported Brent crude has risen on geopolitical concerns. HollyFrontiers' location in the middle of the United States means the refinery mostly processes WTI, so "they're not subject to the pressures of Brent pricing like some of the Eastern-based or Gulf Coast-based refiners," Mr. Sherlock said.
The fall of Canada's struggling tech giant Research In Motion Ltd. has dragged two of our contestants down with it. Sienna Capital Management Inc. president Malvin Spooner and AlphaNorth Asset Management president Steven Palmer both gambled that RIM would turn things around this year - and lost nearly half their (hypothetical) money in six months.
"It was a contrarian pick and obviously it hasn't worked out," Mr. Palmer said. "Almost everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong."
The annual My One and Only contest follows the picks of some of the smartest investment and personal finance professionals in Canada over the course of one year. At the end of 2011, each contestant picked one stock, income trust, American depositary receipt or exchange-traded fund traded on a major exchange in Canada or the United States. The minimum market capitalization for Canadian securities was $100-million, and for U.S. picks it was $1-billion (U.S.).
"One and only" implies the contestants are wedded to their stocks for the duration of the year. For contest observers, it's entertaining to watch where this year-long commitment will take some of the best investing minds in the country. The prize? Eternal bragging rights.
But keep in mind that this contest encourages potentially risky picks that have the best potential for big returns - playing it safe may be a sound investing strategy, but safe stocks have little chance of being runaway gainers that typically win our contest. The RIM case is evidence that even for savvy investing professionals, trying to pick one big winner is a dangerous proposition.
The contest rules also highlight the potential danger of holding onto a winning investment for too long.
For instance, HollyFrontier is nearing Mr. Sherlock's target price of $39 (U.S.), and he thinks it will probably get there before August. At that point, he said, he would cash out if he had actually purchased the stock (he didn't). Under the contest, though, he's stuck to the end of the year with a pick that may be running out of upside.
This most recent quarter saw our first-quarter leader, financial author Gail Bebee, knocked from her perch. Her pick, auto parts manufacturer Magna International Inc., slipped to third place despite the company's announcement in May of a new contract to assemble Nissan Infiniti vehicles in Europe.
"It went down with the market," Ms. Bebee said. "If the economy doesn't go down the drain, I think it should do okay for the rest of the year."
Auto sales in the United States and Canada have picked up over 2012, but sales in Europe are a different story. Ford Motor Co., one of Magna's customers, recently warned of deepening operating losses in the second quarter, citing slumping sales in Europe, Asia and South America.
Ms. Bebee, who holds Magna stock in her real-world portfolio, said Magna's international presence was a reason she chose the stock, although she admits right now "Europe is a question mark."

East York gets a lesson in modernism

Full text: A sold sign was slapped onto a Barfield Avenue two-storey maverick home after just one day on the market
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
With the ongoing residential makeover the city has been enjoying for the past two decades, no neighbourhood is immune.
Take, for example, the formerly trapped-in-amber, postwar pocket of East York bounded by Broadview Avenue, O'Connor Drive and Coxwell and Mortimer Avenues.
While the late-1940s-early-1950s one-storey, hipped-roof bungalow is still king, a drive up and down any street reveals a considerable number of second-storey "top ups."
In some cases, tear-downs have allowed for stone-and-stucco mini-McMansions to be hastily erected; indeed, enough of these "faux châteaus" can now be catalogued to suggest they are no longer a rarity here.
What is a rarity within these borders, however, are new builds done in a thoroughly modernist style.
"You walk into all of them, they're all identical designs, same layouts," says newbie developer Rambod Nasrin, 36, of the new builds.
"So we came here and I said, 'I want to create a new product.' It was a bit of a risky venture because it hadn't been experimented with, but we ended up getting great results."
It's hard to argue with his cheery boast, since a sold sign was slapped onto 11 Barfield Ave. after just one day on the market. And while it's not the only two-storey home on the block - there are a few across the street, and Memorial Park Avenue to the south is lined with them - the flat roof, sexy black brick, generous windows and stainless-steel-trimmed cedar make this three-bedroom maverick seem like Arthur C. Clarke's monolith has come to teach the neighbourhood a lesson.
In a way, it has, says its architect, Andrew Reeves: "It is an up-and-coming neighbourhood," he offers. "There's a lot of neat retail [stores] and restaurants going in, frankly, because it's affordable, so you're getting restaurateurs who can't afford to be on Queen coming over and starting their first restaurant.
"So the question for us is: 'Do you design for the neighbourhood in transition, or do you design for the one-storey house that's next to you?'"
While Mr. Reeves has clearly gone with the former for Mr. Nasrin's two-year-old company, Upside Development, that's not a bad thing - at least as far as the neighbourhood is concerned. Many Barfield residents walked over during construction to say how much they liked the design and, says Mr. Nasrin, during the open house that inevitably followed, "probably a quarter" of the 200 people who visited were local contractors looking for ideas: "I had one guy pull up with a brick; he goes and puts it up against my brick trying to match it," he says with a chuckle.
So why the love-in? Well, other than looking fresh in a formerly static neighbourhood, Mr. Nasrin, formerly sustainability manager at Tridel Corp., has made it Upside Development's objective to build a premium product. Past the crisply tailored cedar-and-brick exterior suit, the interior is just as refined: wide-plank flooring in a lovely matte grey, an open staircase with glass walls, skylights to rain light down into all areas of the home (including the fully finished basement), and expert drywalling (with modern, there's no crown moulding to hide mistakes) that includes a notched detail in places.
Even with items one would be forgiven for not noticing, there is an unexpected level of finish and customization: doors are eight-feet tall; the "dead space" over the kitchen cabinets is replaced by a "live picture frame" clerestory window; there is a neat little niche for display-only firewood under the three-sided gas fireplace in the living-dining areas; in bathrooms, floating vanities and handsome tile-work abound; and tiles have even been laid under the stairs in a finished storage area.
"When we do a home, we do it from the front curb all the way to the back, upstairs to downstairs," says Mr. Nasrin. "My audience is the same as somebody moving into an executive condo: They don't want to come in here and have to finish their basement."
It's a level of detail that makes sense when building for an actual client, but for a speculative home in an untested neighbourhood? And other choices, such as removal of the ubiquitous (for this area) backyard garage for more usable outdoor space, why take the chance? For an architect who prides himself on "character-driven" homes, it can be difficult to design a spec home, since there aren't instructions like "I like to sit on the floor" or "I like to garden," says Mr. Reeves. "So you have to make up a fictitious buyer, which is a totally different design experience." In this case, he and his three staff members sat down and created a narrative of walkability: "It's not about the car," he says.
Whether the purchasers of this home prefer feet, bicycles or automobiles is unknown. What is known, however, is that they saw enough of a future in East York to pay $1.1-million to set up house. And if that seems expensive, look around, says Mr. Reeves: "It's a premium house, but, at the same time, in its range I think with the assembly of finishes and materials it'd blow the doors off the other guys who are doing a $1.2-million spec house."

In Vancouver, the seller's market recedes

Author: Perkins, Tara; Stueck, Wendy

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/vancouver-sellers-market-recedes/docview/1023289102/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Vancouver's slowdown is "striking, because nothing has really fundamentally changed in the market. It's hard to pinpoint. Something has affected the psychology," Mr. [Derek Burleton] said.

Full text: Vancouver's housing market is cooling to the point that the balance appears to be shifting in favour of buyers for the first time in years.
Prices in the country's most-expensive real estate market remain stable, but activity has dropped sharply.
The number of sales in June, normally one of the busiest months of the year for home deals, dropped more than 17 per cent from May and 27.6 per cent below June, 2011, the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said Wednesday.
Economists welcomed the decline in sales as an early sign that a correction is taking root, and said prices are likely to follow suit.
While that would not please many homeowners, it could provide some relief to policy makers both in Ottawa and British Columbia. A slowdown now decreases the chance of a more severe correction when interest rates rise later.
Local officials have been grappling with how to deal with what Vancouver's mayor has deemed to be "an affordability crisis," one that has been a long time in the making.
The benchmark price of a detached home in the city is now $961,600. That is up nearly 35 per cent from three years ago and about 50 per cent higher than in Toronto.
While there is anecdotal evidence that foreign investors are losing their appetite for real estate in the Vancouver, experts remain perplexed as to exactly why the city is seeing such a decline in transactions right now.
Toronto's equivalent statistics will be released on Thursday, but mid-month indicators from that city's real estate board suggest that sales are holding relatively steady and new listings continue to rise.
"The Vancouver market is leading the Toronto market in terms of a correction," said Toronto-Dominion Bank deputy chief economist Derek Burleton, who is calling for price declines of at least 15 per cent in both cities.
"Toronto's housing market correction is more likely to be a story of 2013, 2014."
A decline in prices tends to lag a decline in sales by one or two quarters, Mr. Burleton said.
The average price of a home in Vancouver rose 90 per cent from 2002 to 2007, compared with 40 per cent in Toronto, according to TD. But Toronto has seen prices increase more quickly since the financial crisis, adding to the view that Toronto is lagging its western cousin.
Vancouver's slowdown is "striking, because nothing has really fundamentally changed in the market. It's hard to pinpoint. Something has affected the psychology," Mr. Burleton said.
Only 2,362 properties changed hands in the Greater Vancouver area last month. June is normally high season for home sales, and that was the lowest level of sales recorded for the city in that month since the year 2000.
Tom Choy, a real estate agent with Sutton West Coast Realty, who has been in business since 1992, said he has noticed the slowdown. One customer backed out of a condo purchase after new mortgage rules were announced last month, saying his bank had told him that the new maximum debt-service ratios meant his planned purchase wouldn't work unless his wife also earned an income.
Other customers who are close to the federal government's new maximum debt ratios have also stepped away from purchases, Mr. Choy said. At the same time, he has had homeowners who are looking to sell reduce their asking prices.
"Conditions are favouring buyers, which means that buyers are going to have some negotiating leverage, increased selection, and an opportunity to get better terms," said Eugen Klein, president of Vancouver's real estate board.
"Vancouver has had about 10 years of it being a record-setting sellers market, so it's a change."
While sales decline, fewer people are listing their homes on the market. New listings in June were 18.9 per cent below those of May, and three per cent lower than a year ago.
A composite benchmark measure of house prices in the region suggests that prices are still higher than a year ago, but fell 0.7 per cent over the course of the month.
CIBC deputy chief economist Benjamin Tal agreed that the slowdown under way in Vancouver will soon begin in Toronto.
"We see less investment activity in Vancouver, and less Chinese money entering the city," he said.
"This is just the beginning of a downward trend in Vancouver. There is a bit of housing market fatigue."

Talking with the Americans (who are actually Canadian)

Author: Chowdhry, Affan; Hannay, Chris

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/talking-with-americans-who-are-actually-canadian/docview/1023192900/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "I think you'll see the real President [Barack Obama] unfold as a pure socialist - if he does get a second term." Higher taxes are not the way for those who have done well financially, Mr. [Dennis Sifton] argues, in a country where the wealthy are increasingly seen as the problem. It was high taxes and a "dysfunctional" medical system that drove him away from Southwestern Ontario in the 1990s.

Full text: Meet some of the members of The Globe and Mail's newly deputized U.S. election team: Canadian expats who will be reporting to us over the coming months through the lens of their unique Canadian sensibility
For Penny Stamp - indeed her real name, as she likes to tell people - the Great Recession in the United States has meant watching the value of her home get battered to the point that it is now worth less than half of what she bought it for before the housing crisis. But today, on Independence Day, this Canadian's faith in the American dream is not shaken.
"The American dream may have to be altered, but it still exists in many of the Americans I know," says the Orlando graphic artist who was born in Regina and raised in Toronto. Ms. Stamp, 38, followed her "snowbird" parents to Florida after graduating from York University in 1996 and became a U.S. citizen in 2000.
Ms. Stamp's abiding hope in America runs through a dozen detailed interviews from the nearly 400 Canadian expats who answered The Globe's call to reflect on life and politics south of the border, and to contribute to our ongoing coverage of the presidential election.
Immersed in U.S. society but with continuing links to the country where they were born - and where some harbour hopes of one day returning - Canadian expats in America offer a unique perspective through which to view politics in a pivotal election year.
They are all in the business of constantly explaining Canada to Americans and America to Canadians. But translating U.S. politics and key election themes for a Canadian audience is just one part of what makes these expats unique.
It is also their ability to psychologically step back from the polarized and volatile scene that is American politics today, suspend their judgment - which, as one expat in Arizona put it, is never easy and sometimes akin to biting one's tongue - and enter an ongoing conversation. It is that conversation we want to explore in coming months.
According to the 2010 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, 798,649 residents reported being born in Canada - with large concentrations of Canadian-born U.S. residents in California, Florida and New York. They are acutely aware of the joblessness and the choppy economic recovery that affects their communities. A few have opposed President Barack Obama's health-care overhaul and the delay in approving the Keystone XL pipeline, and with it, the jobs that it would create on both sides of the border.
But from Silicon Valley to Wall Street to the Rust Belt to the American South, similar themes are echoed by the expats: they still have hope in America and they think the country can rebuild its economy.
"The economy is bad? Well, the economy's been bad before," says 30-year-old Republican Keith Vincent, who was born in Newfoundland and has lived in Ohio, Tennessee and now Florida. "Americans have always figured out a way to support each other and always rebound after a recession."
A look at the stories of the Canadians who responded to our initial online call shows that many moved to the United States to pursue an education, a career opportunity or a relationship. Their American roots run deep and they are very aware of - and even involved in - the political debates that consume their adopted country. As we discovered, political identities follow along mainstream lines with Canadian expats who support either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party.
But then there are people like Ms. Stamp, who is a registered Libertarian Party member and has a long-term dream for American politics - a three-party system similar to Canada's. A viable third-party presidential candidate, however, has yet to emerge in 2012.
Come voting day in the hotly contested swing state of Florida, Ms. Stamp says she may have to choose between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama.
Right now, she leans to President Obama, whom she voted for in 2008. But that could easily change, she says. "I'm going to keep my mind open until the very last minute."

Originally from: Saskatoon
Politics: Republican
In Saskatoon, a fairly new three-bedroom house could run you $500,000. Not far across the border, in Big Lake, Minn., it'll cost you less than $200,000.
Carla Swanson lives in the suburbs just outside Minneapolis with her husband and two children. But the rest of her family is still in Saskatchewan.
"It's like two different worlds right now," she says. "If you were moving from the U.S. to Canada, it would be really tough to afford it."
Ms. Swanson says the value of her own house has dropped dramatically in just a few years, after the U.S. real-estate bubble popped.
Dropping house prices have caused many of her neighbours to lose substantial amounts of money and move away. The overgrown lawns down the street tell the tale of the abandoned, foreclosed houses.
Her daughter just graduated from a charter high school - a small, specialized school that focuses on preparing its students for post-secondary education.
The 18-year-old is now headed to a local community college with most of her friends, so she can live at home and avoid big student debt. Ms. Swanson said her daughter is looking at health care for good employment opportunities.
She hopes the economy will have improved by the time her 15-year-old son is ready to look for work.
"I'm really hoping that at the time he graduates, the job market is more rosy."

This lawyer's Beverly Hills clients worry about reducing their taxes, while her clients at a free Los Angeles family-law clinic - often illegal immigrant women - worry that by reporting domestic abuse they may be deported.
These are the two very different worlds Ms. Wolman knows well.
She understands the desire of her clients who want to hold on to their wealth and to vote Republican, the party of tax cuts. But Ms. Wolman also sees the importance of making the path to legal immigration - and access to health care and social services - easier for millions of illegal immigrants.
"But those two things are at odds: You can't have my rich clients getting tax cuts and the poor clients having easy access to immigration at the same time," says Ms. Wolman, who recently became a U.S. citizen and will be voting for the first time in the next election. She says she will be backing President Barack Obama in a state that is solidly Democrat.
Mr. Obama may not have fulfilled his promise on immigration in his first term, but on key issues - gay marriage, health care, women in the workplace - she says there is no other choice.
"Being Canadian, I think his ideas about health care are really important. And I see the difference it makes - friends of mine that don't have health care here, it's appalling."

Originally from: St. Thomas, Ont.
Politics: Republican
"[Barack Obama] is a cool guy. I like him," says Mr. Sifton, a 69-year-old physician. "I just disagree with his policies."
The disagreement runs so deep that if Mr. Obama is re-elected, Mr. Sifton and his wife would consider renouncing their U.S. citizenship and returning to Canada.
"I think you'll see the real President Obama unfold as a pure socialist - if he does get a second term." Higher taxes are not the way for those who have done well financially, Mr. Sifton argues, in a country where the wealthy are increasingly seen as the problem. It was high taxes and a "dysfunctional" medical system that drove him away from Southwestern Ontario in the 1990s.
Mr. Sifton, who offers free clinics to those who do not have health coverage, fears the debt burden of the President's signature health-care law. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act requires all Americans to purchase health-care insurance beginning in 2014.
According to Mr. Sifton, Mitt Romney will encourage economic growth and fiscal responsibility. And this time his wife, unlike in 2008, will also be voting Republican in the hotly contested battleground state of Virginia.

For Jason Sidhu, looking out from his Silicon Valley vantage in California, the future is bright in the land of venture capital, start-ups and innovation.
"I think it's a great place if you have an idea and you want to work hard," he argues. But there are some dark clouds, as he sees it, including the lack of investment in education, research and development.
"I don't have any kids right now - but once I do, I'm fearful of putting them into the American education system," he says .
The pull to return home to Vancouver - the city his grandfather immigrated to from India in 1906 - is there. If only the opportunities were also there, he explains.
Mr. Sidhu has voted Republican in gubernatorial, state and local elections. This November, the self-described Independent says he will vote for Barack Obama.
"Everybody I talk to in Canada - all my friends, relatives - they say the same thing: 'How could he lose?' I don't think they realize that the election is going to come down to a few states where all the advertising and money is being spent," he says. Florida, the state where he lived for 10 years before moving to Silicon Valley four years ago, will be one of those key battleground states.

Ms. Zhang moved to the United States to seek change and opportunity after 11 years in Canada that included studying business at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont.
"I really appreciate the entrepreneurial spirit I find in the United States," explains the Barack Obama supporter. It's a sentiment shared by her Canadian friends looking to kick-start new business ventures.
"I've seen a lot of my friends in Toronto have these really great opportunities in Toronto but then need to go to New York to pursue the funding they need or to get the contacts," she explains. Along with New York, Silicon Valley and Seattle, North Carolina's hub of high-tech research and development - known as the Research Triangle - is another destination.
The rise of China will be a theme on the campaign trail. Mitt Romney has described China's leaders as "currency manipulators" while President Obama has accused his opponent of shipping American jobs to China. Underlying the China bashing is anxiety around the collapse of U.S. manufacturing and China's gains.
China-born Ms. Zhang says America has nothing to fear.
"It's not a case where China is this monster that wants to overtake the United States and swallow it up. They just want their citizens to have the same quality of life as people in the West enjoy," she explains.
North Carolina is a battleground state that Mr. Obama narrowly won in 2008. It will be tough to win again.

Mr. Neata has a front-row seat to the drama of the Occupy Wall Street anti-capitalist movement. The 29-year-old is a New York investment banker who started just as the recession began.
"People forget that in 2008 when [President Barack Obama] came aboard the economy was on a precipice. It was a disaster," says Mr. Neata, who identifies himself as an Independent.
"I came to work on Wall Street that fall and everything was falling apart. [Mr. Obama] came in - and I don't think he's always made the right decisions, he's made mistakes along the way - but the fact that we are where we are today, versus where we were in January of 2009, I think you have to reward that."
Mr. Neata says, despite perceptions, it's "trendy" to be a Democrat on Wall Street. But bankers do feel sympathy for Republican Mitt Romney when he is attacked for his wealth and experience in private equity.
Democrats and the Occupy-movement protesters blame the financial industry for a lot of the economic woes in the United States. There may be some truth to that, Mr. Neata says, in the damaging way that some big investment banks behaved before and during the financial crisis - but the whole industry shouldn't be lumped together.
"Obama has been guilty of using the financial community as a scapegoat. ... [though] I don't blame him."

Full text: Lake Simcoe locals are digging in for a last offensive against a billion-dollar complex aimed at the GTA's vacationers
Friday Harbour sits at the mouth of an abandoned Lake Simcoe marina, a resort development that promises city-weary Torontonians a year-round escape from the blistering pace of their lives for less than the cost of a decent downtown condominium. The developer is quick to talk up the 242-hectare site's many amenities. The 2,000-some lakeside units, tucked in alongside a nature reserve, will range in price from $250,000 to a $1-million. They'll eventually sit next to a new golf course, a 400-room hotel, an amphitheater and dozens of high-end shops and restaurants.
Buyers need not even worry about their carbon footprints. The site is about 12 kilometres from the Barrie South GO Station, meaning anyone with a decent bike could make the trip to cottage country without ever sticking a key into an ignition.
While it sounds pretty idyllic, reality is a little more complicated. Markham-based Geranium Corp. launches a massive marketing effort this weekend that will culminate with a sales centre opening in the fall, but the company won't dwell on the 10-year legal battle that has dogged developer Earl Rumm every step of the way, costing both him and his opponents tens of millions of dollars.
His long and impressive list of enemies - which features both townies and millionaire Bay Street big shots who have vacationed in the area for generations and don't want to see their refuges disrupted by thousands of new part-timers - have fought for a decade.
Their concerns are myriad: They worry about the lake's water quality, they dread increased weekend traffic. They also wonder what would happen if the real-estate market weakened and demand for expensive second homes tanked, leaving a half-finished site fully tricked out with municipal water and sewer services.
"Some people are never happy," Mr. Rumm says, sitting in the back of a Land Rover during a company-sponsored tour of the site that started with a helicopter ride from downtown Toronto. "They keep losing and losing in every challenge they make, and still they get to come back and challenge every time we look for a new permit or try to move things further along."
As his excavators strip the site of trees to prepare for the billion-dollar development - which has the blessing of both the province and the municipality - his opponents are digging in for one last offensive that could render all previous approvals moot and chill resort developments across the province.
The whole project depends on blowing open the mouth of the harbour, digging a 24-hectare hole, deep enough for any boat that can navigate the Trent-Severn Waterway, and filling it with water. The thousands of vacation homes would be built along the artificial shoreline that is created, and the golf course's rolling hills will be built using the excavated dirt.
But the land around the harbour still belongs to the province. Mr. Rumm is convinced the land transfer is a rubber-stamp process, but environmentalists working under the umbrella Innisfil District Association hope they can keep the province from selling the land to Mr. Rumm.
"It should really be renamed Monday Morning Harbour because there is going to be a huge hangover when the environmental costs come due," says David Donnelly, the lawyer working with the group.
The environmentalists who oppose him have dismissed his ecological efforts but the company feels it's getting a bad rap, mostly from the part-time residents who oppose the project. Eighty-one hectares - a full third - of the site has been designated as an environmental zone.
"If this were a parking lot naturalization then I could see some positives," says Mr. Donnelly. "If you look at a satellite shot of Lake Simcoe, there's not a lot of forested shoreline left."
While Mr. Rumm is only months away from opening a sales centre, the project's roots goes back decades, to when he would visit the area as a child to spend time with friends and relatives in their summer homes. He says he has the area's greater good in mind - the company estimates the resort would have 1,000 full-time employees and generate about $4.4-million in annual property-tax revenue for Innisfil.
He grew to love the area, he says, and now owns one of the largest properties along the shoreline. That's put him in a strange situation over the last decade as he squared off with high-profile opponents who spend as much time on Bay Street as they do on the lake.
"They think they can be cogs in the system, when really all they are doing is creating a lot of noise and fuss for nothing," Mr. Rumm said.
"There is a process for us to follow, and we've followed that process every step of the way."
That's not to say he came out of the last decade unscathed. The development was cleared by the Ontario Municipal Board in 2007, but a string of approvals were needed before he could start clearing the land. He estimates the company has spent $100-million so far, and doesn't have much to show for it aside from the parcel of land and dozens of reviews and environmental remediation plans.
While opponents focus on environmental concerns, the greatest threat to the project has little to do with trees or permits. The project is targeted toward wealthy city dwellers who want to get away for up to 300 days a year. But the units are a hybrid of cottage and house, which means they are susceptible to the market forces challenging both types of properties.
The condo rush that pushed prices in the city up by double-digit percentages since the recession is showing signs of slowing. Household debt, meanwhile, is at the highest level on record.
A recent report from ReMax, meanwhile, underlines the challenges facing anyone trying to sell vacation properties. The market has been in the dumps for years, and hasn't enjoyed the same level of sales activities as the residential housing market. The average vacation property in the Innisfil area sits on the market for 235 days, with starting prices on winterized waterfront property starting around $500,000.
The report hints that slow sales in the area are the result of a lack of product, not a lack of interest. That's the kind of thing Mr. Rumm likes to hear as he prepares to stake his company's future on the massive resort development.
"This is going to happen," he says. "You can't time the market, you can't worry about things like that. This is all about the lifestyle. We'll be there to entertain you, so you don't have to worry about entertaining yourself. How can anyone be against that?"

Full text: daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
While much of the city wasn't paying attention, something incredible grew alongside the west end's dirty auto body shops, squat industrial buildings, warehouses and factories. Something snake-like, and with a rough charm that seduces young and old alike; something so long, it begins a few blocks north of Dupont Street and winds past Wallace Avenue, mighty Bloor Street West and, after a total of 2.1 kilometres, finally curls around to rest at Dundas Street West.
The West Toronto Railpath is more than a bike trail: it's an after-dinner stroller's paradise, a wildlife sanctuary, a "resilience ecology," an art piece, and, lastly, a weaving of residential neighbourhoods into a forgotten finger of land that once contained a narrow-gauge railway line.
Because of all that, this linear park may be the most important public space the city has created in the past decade.
"We set up a topography of things along here and tried to create a system," says architect James Brown of Brown + Storey Architects, who, with Scott Torrance Landscape Architect, began developing the WTR in 2006. "There's something rough and beautiful about integrating into these industrial spaces. You could easily do a high-end landscape project that would be out of whack with what's here - trying to find that match is a real interesting thing."
Starting at a wide plaza that's cheek by jowl with the auto body shops along tiny Cariboo Avenue at the path's north end, interest comes in many forms due to the "three characters" of the corridor the team was given to work with, explains Mr. Torrance. To Dupont, much of the path backs onto residential Osler Street - which recently added a row of new townhomes - then, once over the Dupont bridge, hulking industrial buildings, such as the former Viceroy Rubber Plant, push right up against the path; south of Bloor, vistas open up and birdsong multiplies.
Even more interesting are the subtle ways the team orients path users: Even where east-west streets are unable to physically intersect, the hardscape changes from the usual dark asphalt to bright white sidewalk; where streets do connect, they're celebrated. Such is the case at Ruskin Avenue, where a wide, welcoming plaza has been created near the beautiful red brick 1920 hydro substation designed by city architect Robert McCallum. Here, residents now gather under bright new streetlights to discuss topics great and small.
There are both manufactured and manipulated great and small items along the railpath. For instance, in the manufactured category are tall markers that identify intersections with three-letter codes - "CAR" for Cariboo, "DUP" for Dupont, "BLR" for Bloor and the like - fashioned from tough, rusty-orange Cor-Ten steel. Smartly anticipating the graffiti that would surely follow their installation, the team used voids for the letters to ensure visibility. Other custom-fabricated pieces are the geometric, Cor-Ten bollards that prevent cars from entering the path, sturdy benches, light standards that accept standard "cobra" fixtures, and a series of large, metal sculptures by John Dickson. These, offers Mr. Brown, are the path's "punctuation marks." The manufactured shape of the path is notable, too, he adds, because of how it widens, narrows, twists and turns and, by doing so, sets up "a little bit of seduction.
"The other trails that we've seen are a straight line, right to the end."
As for the manipulated items, these, of course, were the natural elements, although great care was taken to ensure the railpath didn't come out looking like a "manicured park," says Mr. Torrance. Once Canadian Pacific had removed the unused tracks and contaminated soil, the team moved in to catalogue native plants and collect their seeds. Large trees - even "weed trees" - were mapped and preserved where possible.
After regrading and paving was complete, an "extremely dry, sandy soil" was brought in to match what existed; this, explains Mr. Torrance, not only makes for a low maintenance park, it discourages big, non-native plants from taking root. Collected seeds were replanted and compatible species were introduced provided they wouldn't grow too tall.
In the two summers the path has been open (it was completed in October, 2009), things have grown well despite a few over-zealous parks department lawn-cutters. "If we'd put something back that wasn't as wild, we'd lose a major ecological corridor," says Mr. Torrance. "All these plants attract butterflies, insects, bees ... you can get a wild, native, natural experience here."
To help non-locals clue into that experience, the formerly drab railway bridges that cross Dupont and Bloor have been painted bright saffron; inspiration came from Central Park's 2005 installation The Gates by artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude. "It was really a way to say 'This is part of the public space now,'" says Mr. Torrance. "We really wanted to draw attention to this thing."
Judging from the joggers, walkers, baby strollers, bikes and the impromptu art affixed to the chain-link fence here and there, it's safe to say the immediate neighbourhood has indeed taken notice of the West Toronto Railpath. To get even greater numbers to pay attention, the city needs to build Phase Two, which would see the path extend south to Strachan Avenue.
"We'd love to do it," finishes Mr. Brown.

Capturing the ever-changing face of Hogtown

Abstract: Unlike his usual subjects - some of which have been variously embellished, gentrified, "arty-fied" - Mr. [Patrick Cummins]' depictions of them are nostalgia-free, dead-ahead, "full frontal" (as the book's title indicates).

Full text: Patrick Cummins's assembly of photographs is a pictorial souvenir of Toronto
jmays@globeandmail.com
Images of Toronto, tailored to suit every taste and budget, abound in our town's bookstores and gift shops. Visitors who just want a memento to remind them of Hogtown after they get home can pick up popular photo albums of famous sights, scenic postcards, place mats,tea-towels and ashtrays with views of familiar local landmarks printed on them. Passers-by (and citizens) in search of something weightier can find full-colour picture books that celebrate the high-style architecture in the city's most cherished Victorian and Edwardian neighbourhoods. But, to my knowledge, there's never been a pictorial souvenir of this metropolis quite like the new portfolio called Full Frontal T.O.: Exploring Toronto's Architectural Vernacular (Coach House Books, $24.95).
Introduced by Shawn Micallef, who hails from the circle of young big-city researchers and enthusiasts around Spacing magazine, this arresting little assembly of photographs by Patrick Cummins is a portrait gallery of the architecturally unimportant elements in Toronto's pre-1945 urban tapestry. The featured items include shabby corner stores on residential streets, ramshackle garages in laneways, exhausted-looking bungalows and Gothic cottages and semis, shop-fronts at the bottom of three-level infill structures on busy arterial avenues. These cheaply constructed buildings will never rate official protection as "historic properties," and nobody, I suspect, would fight to save them from modification, let alone demolition.
Unlike his usual subjects - some of which have been variously embellished, gentrified, "arty-fied" - Mr. Cummins' depictions of them are nostalgia-free, dead-ahead, "full frontal" (as the book's title indicates). But by carefully arranging these artless pictures into telling sequences, the photographer has created an atlas of the endlessly changing city that's far more fascinating than any individual picture in the collection.
Mr. Cummins did not launch his project back in 1978, however, with grand designs in mind. He began simply by striking out, via the TTC, for some place in downtown Toronto and photographing the prewar houses and stores he found there. Important buildings, Rosedale or Forest Hill mansions and such, and most things post-war, did not interest him.
Then, in 1988, the photographer catalogued the thousands of negatives he had made, and got a surprise. He discovered that, while not meaning to do so, he had snapped some buildings more than once. Lining up image after image of the same structure, he found that substantial changes (some amusing, others deplorable, most visually interesting) had often occurred with the passage of time. A very retiring, somewhat tattered Boulton Avenue bungalow he shot in 1980, for example, had bloomed by 1988 into a merry Chinese firewood shop with a jaunty sign hoisted above a large new window.
There was a system at work in his heap of photographs, he realized - one that was drawing many seemingly disparate images into cultural narratives about the churn of change. It was at this point that Mr. Cummins decided to turn his accidental rephotographing into a deliberate activity. So it has gone since 1988 until the present: a systematic retracing of steps, the re-finding of buildings photographed years earlier, and the making of fresh images that, combined with the old ones, add up to the visual tales in Full Frontal T.O. As we find in the book's opening sequence of eight photographs, for instance, the bungalow on Boulton Avenue captured in 1980 and 1988 has continued to change - adding a Chinese roof ornament and a roll-up garage door (1999), then losing the ornament and turning back into something that looks like a house (2012).
As you might expect, Mr. Cummins often returns to the site of an earlier photo shoot and finds his original subject has vanished. A neat, very modest (and very old) worker's cottage, bookended by two-storey houses, still stood at 229 Borden St. in 1986, when Mr. Cummins first visited the site. By 2000, when he returned, it had been replaced by a dull two-level townhome. The photographer makes little fuss about the aesthetics of the new building, and certainly sheds no tears. His preferred role is that of the rock-steady, patient witness to the transfigurations documented in the pictures he takes. He leaves it up to the viewer to decide whether these changes are for good or ill.
This ego-free, distanced, balanced point of view vis-à-vis the city's development (or desecration, according to your opinion of such matters) is controversial in the contemporary art and architecture worlds. Many critics and artists (and consumers of criticism and art) prefer cultural creators who are passionately engaged, forwardly polemical. So be it: Patrick Cummins's cool, dry artistic temperament has served him well over the last 30 years, giving him the patience and sheer doggedness to keep piling up his enormous photographic archive, which people who want to know what Toronto really looks like will surely be pondering forever.

Abstract: "Our asset base requires extensive capital to develop its large potential and ultimately access international LNG markets," Progress chief executive officer Michael Culbert said in a statement. "Petronas offers the size and scale that will enable our company to continue to grow and not be limited by the same cash flow challenges faced by many producers in the North American natural gas market today."

Full text: Malaysia's state-owned oil and gas company is making a multibillion-dollar bet on Canada's vision to export natural gas to Asia.
Petronas said Thursday it struck a deal to acquire Calgary's Progress Energy Resources Corp. for $5.5-billion. Petronas also chose Prince Rupert, B.C., as home of its planned export terminal for liquefied natural gas.
International energy companies have been spending billions on remote natural gas plays in Alberta and B.C., with plans to sell the gas in Asia where prices are substantially stronger. With a supply glut of gas keeping prices depressed in North America, foreign companies armed with big cash reserves are being welcomed by Canadian energy firms.
"Our asset base requires extensive capital to develop its large potential and ultimately access international LNG markets," Progress chief executive officer Michael Culbert said in a statement. "Petronas offers the size and scale that will enable our company to continue to grow and not be limited by the same cash flow challenges faced by many producers in the North American natural gas market today."
Natural gas in North America sold for less than $2.80 per million British thermal units Thursday. By contrast, LNG is worth as much as $18 per million BTUs in Asia.
This gap has producers in North America searching for partners to help them develop both their resources and export potential.
Indeed, Progress, which says it holds the most acres of land in the Montney shale play and controls 1.9 trillion cubic feet of proved plus probable reserves, struck a joint ventrue with Petronas a year ago.
"Petronas is a leader in the LNG technology business, but they don't have the resource," said Norman MacDonald, a fund manager at Toronto's Invesco Trimark Ltd.
"If one company brings the capital, the balance sheet, the disciple, and the technology, and the other company brings the real estate, it is a great marriage."
Under the deal, Petronas will pay Progress shareholders $20.45 a share, a 77-per-cent premium to the company's closing price of $11.55 on Wednesday.
Including convertible debt, the deal is valued at about $5.5-billion.
The Calgary-based company operates in the Deep Basin in northwest Alberta and the Foothills zone in northeast British Columbia.
Building oil pipelines across B.C. and exporting it out of ports on the West Coast has proven tremendously controversial, with some native groups standing in opposition.
Discussions around natural gas exports, however, have not been met with the same resistance. David Taylor, president of Taylor Asset Management, expects Canada to support the LNG market.
"If any nation has a vested interested in trying to get $3 gas to Malaysia or Tokyo [where it is worth $15], it is Canada," he said. A slew of companies are now investing in or considering LNG export facilities in Kitimat or Prince Rupert.
Petronas said it will retain Progress' employees.
The proposed takeover needs government and shareholder approval, although investors holding roughly 25 per cent of Progress stock have agreed to the deal.
Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver said there is great interest in rapidly emerging countries to invest in Canadian resource development, due to the size of the resources, the tax and regulatory regime and the open foreign investment climate.
"We don't have enough capital in the country to finance all these projects so we are open to business and welcome investment," he said.
He noted, however, that specific deals are subject to an Investment Canada review to ensure they represent a net benefit to Canada.
Ottawa has added additional screening for state-owned companies making major acquisitions in Canada.
They must show they are acting in a commercial, rather than political, fashion and are encouraged to establish a Canadian-based subsidiary with local people on its board.
"We certainly welcome companies that are acting like good corporate citizens," Mr. Oliver said.
"But we're looking at each investment on a case by case basis."

Full text: Mystery writer Louise Penny sets her novels amid the rolling hills and idyllic inns, but a recent tour turns up nothing nefarious
Comfortably ensconced in wicker chairs on the wide veranda of Hovey Manor, we're sipping sparkling wine and talking about life as sheets of rain pelt down on the lake.
"It's a play of light and dark. Let's just hope that the dark doesn't come out tonight," says Louise Penny, with an air of mystery and a mirthful grin. Clearly, this renowned mystery writer speaks as she writes, giving you pieces and leaving you to puzzle out the parts left unsaid.
"I've gone through periods in my life that have been difficult - and dreamed of a place that was safe," she says. She found it in the Eastern Townships, the setting of most of her seven books, an hour southeast of Montreal.
We're here exploring Ms. Penny's Quebec, driving winding roads around Lake Memphremagog and Lac Brome, through Sutton, Lac-Brome (Knowlton), Georgeville and North Hatley, stopping in bookstores, bistros, boutiques and country inns that have inspired one of Canada's bestselling mystery writers. We even get to spend the first evening with the author herself.
There's "a sense of idyllic place," Ms. Penny says of the region. And it's usually here where murders take place in her books - shattering the seemingly indestructible beauty. "Place is really character for me. It's really a love letter to this area."
By reading her first four books in order, she hopes people "will get a sense of what it's like to live in Quebec," as each is set in a different season. But she wants you to actually come, to smell the pines, feel the air and enjoy the local dishes.
At Hovey Manor, where we start our trip, Ms. Penny jokes that she "sleeps around," referring to the many rooms she and her husband, Michael Whitehead, have stayed in on their numerous visits. You can see why they had their two-day wedding party here. This stunning Relais & Chateaux property was inspired by George Washington's home in Mt. Vernon, Va. It's steeped in history - and romance. It is also the inn on which Manoir Bellechasse ( The Murder Stone ) was loosely based.
I could easily while away the evening next to the fireplace, if not for the Magdalen Islands lobster, the chocolate custard and sesame seed ice cream that beckons me to the table. At night, I eat chocolates laid out for me on the bed, slip under my quilt, and sleep until the birds sing me awake the next morning.
Day 2
The Old Mansion House in Georgeville is our next stop. Formerly Auberge Georgeville, it was the inspiration for the possibly haunted Hadley House in The Cruelest Month . Despite the real-life rumour about a young girl falling from her horse to her death, this rambling, pink estate has a welcoming vibe. Originally built as a rooming house in 1889, it has eight bedrooms, eight bathrooms, seven living rooms, a wraparound porch on the first and second floor, a renovated kitchen with a beautifully lit coffered ceiling and a wide lawn for croquet.
Our next stop is Brome Lake Books in Lac-Brome (Knowlton), where you can buy a Chief Inspector Armand Gamache mug (for the uninitiated, he's the steady and likeable crime-solving detective in Ms. Penny's books), and get a free licorice pipe with your mug, the same old-fashioned candy that the Inspector gets when solving mysteries in Three Pines, the fictional village Ms. Penny's readers long to visit. Or, as I did, you can buy a signed copy of one of Ms. Penny's books. Owners Danny McAuley and Lucy Hoblyn hosted the author's first book launch here, and they have held an event for each new book. But because the last turnout was so big, they will be hosting the launch of Ms. Penny's next book, The Beautiful Mystery, on Aug. 25 at the local community centre.
Our final stop for the day is at the Auberge du Joli Vent in Lac-Brome, owned by Quebec-born Patricia Provencher and her eccentric but affable German-Swiss husband Hans Christiner. With a doctorate in endocrinology, Ms. Provencher - recognizing the link between stress and disease - creates a relaxing experience for her guests. The rooms are basic but comfortable, there's swimming in the outdoor pool or the lake, which is just minutes from the Auberge. When I set out to explore the 46-hectare property, I have trouble finding a hiking trailhead until Mr. Christiner - emerging from the kitchen in chef's apron - insists on taking me out on the back of his four-wheel-drive tractor for a personal tour. Then he's back to the kitchen to create a spectacular dinner of marinated Atlantic salmon with Asian-style rice noodles and seaweed salad, home-grown asparagus risotto, Brome Lake duck leg, and a dessert sampler that includes to-die-for chocolate terrine. Their restaurant is one of about 20 in the first year of the Chefs Createurs program, which recognizes Eastern Township chefs who use local food producers.
Day 3
At Vignoble Domaine Bresee in Sutton, on the Quebec Route des Vins, vineyard co-owner Stacey Richardson introduces us to a fabulous rosé with hints of strawberry and cranberry (Rosé Nessa) and the winery's impressive white Bressoc, which is made from the first clear drops of juice from the flesh of red St. Croix grapes. This is a labour-intensive process that has yielded close to 5,000 bottles since she and her husband Rick Bresee began producing it in 2008.
Feeling lazy and content after a picnic and glass of rosé on the lawn, we get back into the car, this time headed to Gîte Vert Le Mont B & B in the heart of Sutton village, not so far from Ms. Penny's home, for our last night. The 1916 Loyalist-style bed and breakfast is typical of many homes in the Townships, influenced by Loyalists who settled here after the War of Independence. British owner Lynda Graham shares gossip and information on all things Sutton, and I take her lead when I explore. I visit Café Tintoretto , the bistro Ms. Penny drops into for soup and scones; La Rumeur Affamee, with its fabulous selection of cheeses, the Galerie Farfelu , a co-operative of local artists selling jewellery, leather and other wares frequented by Ms. Penny, and the Sutton Museum , with its special exhibit on Jehane Benoît, the culinary author who lived on a sheep farm in the Townships until her death in 1987.
Our final supper of the trip is at the Auberge des Appalaches up the road. John Kostiuk, also a member of Chef Createurs, has concocted an intriguing menu - Darjeeling tea-poached scallops with fennel and radish to start, a rillette of house-smoked trout and a duck leg confit as a main. By the time we finish our meal, it is late, and we drive the short distance back to the B & B in satiated silence.
Day 4
It's almost time to leave this idyllic B & B but we've got time to linger over breakfast: homemade rhubarb, pear and apple compote, scrambled eggs and smoked salmon on the wraparound porch. We'll soon be heading north across the Champlain Bridge, and the bruised and swollen grey sky that we arrived in now a brilliant clear blue. The journey home seems long, but I have a copy of The Murder Stone in my purse, and I know time will fly.

Full text: Province's preparedness for disaster in doubt while rescue resumes at mall where at least two people are feared dead under a collapsed roof
Ontario's Premier acknowledges that confusion and delays in the effort to reach possible survivors of a shopping mall roof collapse have raised concerns about the province's capacity to respond to serious emergencies.
"There will be a time for questions that need to be asked about what and when and how and why not," Premier Dalton McGuinty said Tuesday, after being asked how a race to reach potential survivors could be halted and then resumed only after his intervention.
As heavy equipment began rumbling up the highway to the Algo Mall in Elliot Lake to undertake the task of prying apart heavy concrete slabs inside an unstable structure, questions also grew as to whether clearer lines of communication and stronger leadership on the ground could have saved precious time.
Saturday's collapse sent concrete slabs crashing through two floors of the Algo Mall, killing at least one person and injuring more than 20. At least one person was still trapped under the rubble and alive on Monday. The number of missing has moved up and down in the days since, and stood at 12 on Tuesday.
Staff Inspector Bill Neadles, the man in charge of the Toronto-based Heavy Urban Search and Rescue team, appeared to indicate on Monday that the work stopped because of an edict from the provincial Labour Ministry. But provincial officials hinted Tuesday that mere safety concerns expressed by an onsite engineer from the ministry were misinterpreted as an edict.
Government sources also suggested that a combination of exhaustion, emotion and frustration may have impeded the provincial emergency workers and officials from considering a full range of options when it was deemed unsafe for efforts inside the collapsed structure to continue. Only after Mr. McGuinty asked whether anything else was possible did they shift to Plan B, which involves using heavy machinery operating from the mall's exterior.
Mr. McGuinty's intervention - which included calling Prime Minister Stephen Harper to ensure support from the Armed Forces - is credited for restarting the efforts. But the provincial New Democrats, who represent the riding in which the northern community is located, are asking whether the Premier was fully engaged quickly enough.
The rescue mission, newly equipped with a 90-tonne mechanical arm, was poised to reboot Tuesday evening, more than 24 hours after it was halted.
The abrupt decision to stop searching over fears the structure was too precarious for rescuers came directly from Staff Insp. Neadles of the HUSAR search and rescue team that was deployed to Elliot Lake shortly after Saturday's collapse.
When Elliot Lake Mayor Rick Hamilton declared a state of emergency Saturday afternoon, that put the accident in the hands of Ontario's emergency management office, which called in Staff Insp. Neadles's team. The team of rescuers, technicians and engineers worked gingerly on the site through Monday afternoon, when Staff Insp. Neadles phoned Ontario's Community Safety Commissioner Dan Hefkey, who is responsible for emergency preparedness. They had to stop their operation, Staff Insp. Neadles said.
"They're there under the auspices of the province. But that's what I call a tactical decision," Mr. Hefkey said in an interview. "And I leave it to Staff Inspector Neadles to make that tactical decision."
In press conferences Monday and Tuesday, Staff Insp. Neadles said the decision to stop the rescue was out of his hands. "Our authority did end when the building was deemed unsafe by the ministry and other structural engineers," he said.
But Ontario's Labour Ministry, which is responsible for workplace safety, issued no orders on Monday. A trio of orders issued Tuesday relating to on-site safety explicitly noted they don't affect rescue efforts.
Hours after the rescue effort was halted, following a flood of entreaties and a call from Mr. McGuinty's office, the situation had changed. By midnight, Mr. Hefkey says, they had a new plan in place. "With the enhanced authority given to me by Mr. Hepkey through the province of Ontario to then set the next plan in motion, I think you're going to see some very serious machinery rolling through town," Staff Insp. Neadles said after the call went out to Toronto-area Priestly Demolition for an excavator.

Worried residents keep vigil nearby
STEPHEN SPENCER DAVIS and JANE SWITZER
As rescue operations at a collapsed mall in Elliot Lake, Ont. entered their fourth night, dozens of frustrated residents kept vigil nearby, desperate for news of any survivors.
Sitting in lawn chairs and standing beneath umbrellas, they watched Tuesday as governments and private companies sent truckloads of heavy machinery to the small northern Ontario town in an effort to aid the stalled rescue operations. The loud scrape of metal against concrete could be heard throughout the afternoon, as rescuers worked to remove the rubble without causing further damage.
Dan Hefkey, commissioner of community safety for the province of Ontario, said rescue crews would work through the night using a Komatsu PC 850 long-arm crane to remove the fallen concrete.
The mall collapsed Saturday afternoon when a rooftop parking lot crashed through two floors, killing at least one person and trapping at least one more. As many as 12 others are considered missing, revised down from 30.
Near the scene, people spoke in hushed tones about the ongoing rescue efforts, but few were willing to share the names of people they feared might still be trapped in the rubble.
Elliot Lake resident Rosario Capillo handed out bottled water to people near the site. Mr. Capillo said he bought a lottery ticket last Saturday from a woman named Lucie (Aylwin) who is now feared to be dead in the rubble. He said they joked about the ticket being a winner before he left the mall around 11 a.m.
Another resident, 17-year-old Patrick McDonald, stayed near the mall until 3 a.m. on Monday night, saying "people inside and outside need support."
Elliot Lake Deputy Mayor Al Collett visited the scene Tuesday morning, removing his baseball cap and observing a moment of silence beside the candles and notes spread out along the mall's perimeter.
Joanne Graham said she has visited the site of the mall every day since the collapse. Stopping by Tuesday afternoon with her two young children, she says the town's only mall was the "community hub" for people like her 84-year-old grandfather, who was at the centre last Saturday but left before the rooftop parking garage caved in.
"For a lot of seniors and teenagers, it was the only place to go," she says.

Mall owner sued for leaky roof
ADRIAN MORROW
In the years before Algo Mall's roof collapsed, business owners complained it was leaking, and one successfully sued the centre's owner.
Eastwood Mall Inc., which owns Algo, is controlled by Bob Nazarian, 66, of the Toronto area, who has previously owned other malls and appears connected to a real-estate investment company in California.
Mr. Nazarian refused to comment on Tuesday, referring all questions to his lawyer.
"I have had several buildings and I have always had good relations with everyone and never this kind of thing has happened, so I can't discuss about my past or what happened," Mr. Nazarian said, adding that the Algo is the only commercial building he currently owns.
Anne Marie Letarte ran a restaurant and take-out counter in the food court in 2007 and 2008. She alleged in court documents that leaks above her food counter twice caused the ceiling to collapse and she had to shut down the business.
In court filings, Eastwood asked for the suit to be dismissed, but a judge sided with Ms. Letarte last year and awarded her more than $11,000 in damages.
That year, Eastwood hired contractors Peak Building Restoration. In court documents, the company said it did $823,657 worth of work repairing and waterproofing the roof of the building, but Eastwood paid only a fraction of the fee. Peak took out a lien, which expired in 2010.
Property records indicate Eastwood bought Algo in August, 2005, for $6.2-million.
Mr. Nazarian's entire business history is unknown, but provincial documents show he registered Eastwood as a numbered company in August, 1994. He has owned a house in Richmond Hill, a suburb of Toronto, since 1995.
In January of that year, he bought Eastwood Square, a strip plaza in central Kitchener, Ont., for a little over $3-million. The property was sold in August, 1999, for $4.7-million. A newspaper report in 1999 also identified a Bob Nazarian as the owner of a plaza in London, Ont.
Mr. Nazarian is also listed as an officer of Hillcrest, a real- estate company registered to a suburban office building in Torrance, Calif., that owned a piece of property in a residential neighbourhood in Los Angeles several years ago.

HUSAR team leads rescue effort
TIMOTHY APPLEBY
He's the man who has been answering all the tough questions.
Staff Inspector Bill Neadles is the leader of the Toronto's Heavy Urban Search and Rescue (HUSAR) team sent to Elliot Lake. It's an all-volunteer team of firefighters, paramedics and police officers that is world renown for its wealth of expertise in extracting people trapped inside collapsed structures - HUSAR teams had a role in the 9/11 rescue effort.
Toronto's HUSAR is one of five such units in Canada. The others are based in Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg and Halifax, all under the umbrella of Public Safety Canada.
When he's not volunteering, Staff Inspector Neadles heads the Toronto police force's Public Safety Unit, which deals with cases that range from missing persons to terrorist threats. He's described as a world leader in his field by colleagues on the Toronto force.
He's also in charge of the investigation into other tragic structural collapse of the summer - the stage at Downsview park's Radiohead concert.
HUSAR teams know hope is usually measured in hours rather than days. The two key elements in a rescue mission such as the one at Elliot Lake are specially trained dogs and electronic search equipment, both deployed to sniff out and detect signs of life.
The HUSAR team at the scene comprises 37 members and a structural engineer.
Although the HUSAR units ultimately report to the federal government, which picks up most of the cost, the response to emergencies is co-ordinated with provincial and local authorities under the Joint Emergency Preparedness Program, set up in 1980.
But when crisis strikes, the chain of command is provincial, and in this instance authority rests with province's Emergency Management Ontario.
EMO keeps closely attuned to advice and insight from those on the ground.
"Keep in mind, the office of emergency management brought them in for their expertise," said Toronto district fire chief Stephan Powell.

Full text: MARKETING REPORTER
There is a pattern to many athlete endorsements. For many sports stars seeking a boost to their salaries, sports apparel and equipment, soft drinks and cars are common advertising targets. Mixed-use commercial real estate is not.
But on Wednesday, while Canadian tennis star Milos Raonic sweats it out at Wimbledon, a complex of office towers and retail space in the heart of Toronto's financial district will declare itself "home court" for the sport's highest-ever-ranked Canadian tennis professional.
Commerce Court, which counts CIBC and Stikeman Elliott among its office tenants, will announce a two-year sponsorship agreement with Mr. Raonic. It will kick off with his first appearance at the building complex next month.
With this deal, owner GWL Realty Advisors Inc. is looking for some love. With shiny new entrants in office space in the Bay St. vicinity - such as the RBC Dexia Centre and the Bay Adelaide Centre - boasting newer styles and environmental certifications, old bank towers are .
"There's a lot of attention going to some of the newer towers being built, and we're trying to create some awareness around some of the older bank towers," said GWL president Paul Finkbeiner. He added that the complex is about to add some new tenants, as well.
The four buildings and underground space that make up Commerce Court currently have a 27-per-cent vacancy rate, far above the overall rate in downtown Toronto, which hovers just above 5 per cent, according to commercial real estate company Avison Young. And there are more challenges to come.
"We're now in the midst of another development cycle. More than likely, we'll see tenants drawn out of major towers in the development core," said Bill Argeropoulos, Avison Young's vice-president and director of research for Canada. That includes Deloitte & Touche, a major Commerce Court tenant that will be moving in 2015 or 2016 as the lead tenant in the new phase of the Bay Adelaide Centre.
"One of the challenges with all of these vintage towers is that they have higher tax and operating costs," Mr. Argeropoulos said. "They don't have the latest technology, the latest systems that the newer buildings offer. The leading green buildings are the buildings of the future."
GWL is hoping to increase community activities around the building in order to market the perks of being a tenant. Mr. Raonic will appear at the building when he is in Toronto and will host tennis clinics for tenants in the complex's courtyard. "Viewing lounges" in its west tower will provide seating for live screenings of events from the London Olympics and the Rogers Cup in August.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
While athletes are associated mostly with their big-name endorsements, it is not uncommon for them to make extra money with smaller, local business endorsements as well. But this type of deal is relatively new.
Mr. Raonic, among professional male tennis players, has sponsorships from companies such as and .
"He has numerous blue-chip global partners," said Graham Cross, Mr. Raonic's agent and vice-president of Lagardère Unlimited's tennis division. "Our goal is to continue that moving forward, but at the same time, we want him to have the Canadian connection."

CORRECTION: GWL Realty Advisors Inc. is the manager of the Commerce Court office complex in Toronto, not the owner. Incorrect information was published Wednesday.

Full text: When the Pan Am Games athletes leave their village in 2015, Toronto will sport a new green walkable community
It seems like a daunting challenge: Take a parcel of derelict land on the east side of Toronto's core that has sat unused for more than 40 years, and transform it into an urban community that rivals the city's most thriving neighbourhoods. But the minds behind the new development in the West Don Lands believe they are going to accomplish just that.
"We're going to create the most sustainable mixed-use development that the city has ever seen," said Jason Lester, president of Dundee Kilmer Development Limited, the real estate developer leading the creation of the "Canary District" - named after the now-closed Canary Restaurant that operated from a 19th century Cherry Street building since the 1960s.
Their task is twofold. First, the Ontario government has given Dundee Kilmer the job of creating housing for 10,000 athletes and coaches for the 2015 Pan American Games. But the end goal goes far beyond a sporting event. The buildings will be converted and sold as condo and townhouse units, creating the foundation of a new downtown east side community that will knit together other communities such as St. Lawrence Market, Corktown and the Distillery District.
"By the time the entire West Don Lands is built out, it's going to be approximately 5,000 units ... multiple daycares, community centres and schools," Mr. Lester said. "I think we're going to see a community that all of Toronto can be proud of."
Creating a successful neighbourhood from nothing is no small feat, but with a commitment to mid-rise, mixed-use development, ample recreational space and a progressive private-public funding model, the players involved hope they will create a community that works, while avoiding the pitfalls of athletes villages of the past.
The Canary District is a community that has been meticulously planned. Waterfront Toronto was enlisted by the Ontario government to do a precinct plan for the 80 acres of West Don Lands area back in 2005.
"This is long before Pan Am was a twinkle in anyone's eye," said Meg Davis, vice-president of development at Waterfront Toronto, an organization created by all three levels of government to implement the waterfront's renewal. "When they went after the bid, we got a call from the province asking, 'Can you fit the athletes village into the West Don Lands block plan?' We were excited about the Pan Am, because it meant advancing the West Don Lands [development] by about five or 10 years, getting it to market that much sooner."
The precinct plan resulted in a set of urban design guidelines governing everything from the location of the streets to sidewalk widths, building heights and setbacks. Through these stringent guidelines, Waterfront Toronto will ensure the area stays walkable and "human scale," Ms. Davis said.
"We set up the streets and blocks so no block is very long; it will be very pedestrian friendly. Lots of permeability, lots of pedestrian connections and bike connections," she said. Front Street will be a wide boulevard that will encourage foot traffic.
"To create a neighbourhood that feels like it's grown over time, we have in the bylaw a requirement for animated space on all the ground-floor areas of Front, Bayview and Cherry [streets]," Ms. Davis said. "You will have restaurants, cafes, grocery stores, banks - all those things will happen so that on the ground floor there aren't dead spaces. People will be walking to their local café and local bakery and cheese shop and butcher."
One of the essential elements of the area, Mr. Lester said, is the 18-acre park being built for a pricetag in excess of $15-million, which will connect with the Don River Trail to the north (a project funded by all three levels of government through Waterfront Toronto).
"It will act almost like a trailhead to the ravine system on the east side of Toronto, as well as to the waterfront to the south. It's quick access to the trail system for biking and walkers," he said. "There's probably more parkland as a ratio to the community being built in this neighbourhood than any other community in downtown Toronto."
Instead of a sea of massive condo towers, the plan is to keep things mostly mid-rise and definitely diverse in the Canary District.
Residential buildings along Front Street will range between 11 and 15 storeys high, while heights on narrower Mill Street will drop down to eight storeys. In addition, four different architectural firms were called upon to design the buildings within the athletes' village, to avoid a homogenous look and achieve what Dundee Kilmer calls "cohesive diversity."
Toronto's largest YMCA will be built at the corner of Cherry and Front streets. (The Y will also act as a training centre for athletes during the Games.) In addition, there will be a 500-student residence built for George Brown College, and 20 per cent of the housing in the Canary District will be designated "affordable" - at or below average market price.
Urban planning guru Ken Greenberg of Greenberg Consultants Inc. said the area is poised to become one of the city's great neighbourhoods.
"One of the failures of so many of these new condominium neighbourhoods is their monocultures, so the fact that you have George Brown College here, you have the YMCA ... [it means that] there are other things happening here."
He said putting limits on building heights is a "huge thing" that will ensure a community that can grow as it ages.
"You need a variety of living arrangements so you don't get thousands of bachelor units. We should make communities where you can raise kids, where older people can live, where you can age in the community and move from one type of housing to another," he said.
Another important aspect of the Canary District development is a funding model that ensures the budget does not escalate as it has at athletes villages in the past, such as Vancouver's Olympic village. Mandy Downes of Infrastructure Ontario said they have a fixed-price contract with Dundee Kilmer, a key part of the model that ensures the $514-million the province is spending on the village will not increase.
"We do a lot of upfront due diligence so [developers] know exactly what they're getting into," Ms. Downes said. "They don't get paid until the work gets done, so there is a big financial incentive for them to complete it on time. They take the risk so that the province and the taxpayers are not on the hook for things we are not in control of."
Ken Tanenbaum of Dundee Kilmer adds, "In Vancouver, they were designing and figuring out construction costs as they went along. [In this case], everything from a construction and delivery standpoint is locked down. You will not hear the words 'cost overrun' in the context of this village development."
*****
CANARY DISTRICT FACTS
* The athletes village will be comprised of eight buildings, designed by these architectural firms: architectsAlliance, KPMB, Daoust Lestage Inc. and MacLennan Jaunkalns Miller.
* The heritage building that houses the now-defunct Canary Restaurant was built as a schoolhouse in 1859. The building will be retained as a "gatepost to the new community."
* After the Games, housing in the area will include 787 market condominiums, 28 townhomes and 12 loft units, 253 units of affordable housing with a broad range of housing types and George Brown College's first student residence.
* Buildings will all be constructed to LEED Gold standard. In a nod to the late urban planning visionary Jane Jacobs, the buildings will employ her "eyes on the street" thesis to create safe and connected urban environments, with open streetscapes, large-scale building windows and balconies.

Vancouver eyes way to cut housing costs

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/vancouver-eyes-way-cut-housing-costs/docview/1022114679/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The creation of a city agency to develop lower-cost housing is also similar to what Toronto has done - once in the late 90s and again more recently - after federal and provincial funding evaporated, said Mark Guslits, a former chief development officer with the Toronto Community Housing Corporation. Mr. Guslits was a member of Vancouver's housing task force.

Full text: With average house prices more than 10 times median income, city task force urges creation of agency to end 'affordability crisis'
Vancouver is hoping to make a dent in the demand for housing from less-wealthy residents by creating a housing-development agency, the way the city's two universities and the ski resort of Whistler have.
A task force on affordable housing recommended that the city set up a separate agency that could negotiate with private developers on deals to build units on discounted city land. The rents would have to be guaranteed at lower rates than usual for new units.
As well, the agency would then manage the hoped-for thousands of units created to ensure they go to people with lower incomes.
But Vancouver is willing to take on that more aggressive role because the city is "in an affordability crisis," said Mayor Gregor Robertson, the political leader of a city where the average sale price for a house is around $800,000, more than 10 times median income.
"The city hasn't had a big focus on stimulating the development of affordable housing historically," the mayor said, as he announced the task-force recommendations.
He didn't have any numbers on the cost of setting up a housing authority or on the value of city land that Vancouver might commit to future housing projects.
The recommendations also included creating new "transition zones" that would be geared to different forms of housing than the towers and single-family homes that dominate in Vancouver. There was also a requirement for developers to include more affordable options in major projects.
A housing authority would create a specialized team operating at arm's length from the city and able to move more quickly to take advantage of real-estate trends and opportunities.
Both the University of B.C. and Simon Fraser University have, through their property-development divisions, focused on creating new models of affordable housing.
Vancouver deputy city manager David McLellan said the city agency would be most like the UBC Properties Trust, which set a goal of building 20-per-cent rental among the new housing developed on its extensive holdings.
"We put the land in and that makes it possible for our rental units to operate on a cost-recovery basis," said Paul Young, the trust's development director. The university has created 380 apartments that rent for less than the usual market rates, which go to faculty and students only, and another 375 that are rented at standard rates to anyone.
Whistler started its housing authority in 1977 as, like many high-end ski towns, it discovered that its local residents, essential for the resort's service businesses, were being priced out of the market. It now manages almost 2,000 rental and home-ownership units.
Oliver Clegg, a 31-year-old who has worked as a hotel and golf course employee and in property management, just bought a three-bedroom townhouse in the resort as a result of the program.
"It's the best thing I've ever done," said Mr. Clegg, who had to agree to Whistler's rules that homebuyers can only get a limited amount of profit out of their homes, pegged to the rate of inflation.
The creation of a city agency to develop lower-cost housing is also similar to what Toronto has done - once in the late 90s and again more recently - after federal and provincial funding evaporated, said Mark Guslits, a former chief development officer with the Toronto Community Housing Corporation. Mr. Guslits was a member of Vancouver's housing task force. (TCHC's recent woes over managing its older social-housing properties isn't connected to any of the agency's housing development work.)
Mr. Guslits said having a separate agency, staffed by people who understand the real-estate market and can negotiate with developers, gives any city its best chance at finding ways of using the private market plus city assets and non-profit agencies to create lower-cost housing.
"When cities have tried to be a developer [without that separate agency], they have either failed or spent far too much money," said Mr. Guslits.
Many other cities have created housing authorities or corporations to find ways of developing lower-cost housing where the private markets don't seem to be serving their residents well.

Full text:   Ned Pratt dominated the local profession for decades. Now, his son Peter has reinvigorated the family home
In 1951, when architect Ned Pratt built his family home on the foothills of West Vancouver's British Properties, he made a statement far beyond aesthetics. As well as shelter for his family, Mr. Pratt designed the house as a showpiece for new building technologies and materials. Still, as his architect son, Peter, recently reflected: "It's easier when you have a client that can state their needs. For an architect to design his own home, that's quite a challenge - because architects can never make up their minds! That's the hardest damn thing."
He knows whereof he speaks. Peter Pratt has just completed a double-whammy, restoring and updating his father's crumbling house, and designing his own home just a few metres away. With steel colonnettes and cement-board panels, the son's newly built abode is emphatically different from the father's, but it's linked both literally and metaphorically to the first house by a cedar pergola.
"It is a metaphor," concedes Mr. Pratt. "I did what I wanted to do, but at the same time it's linked to the old original. That designer over there" - he gestures towards his father's benchmark house - "he was a Romantic. I have my own way of doing things. But we're both in the same racket."
That "racket" - the architectural profession - was dominated by his father for a good chunk of Vancouver's history. Ned Pratt was a principal at the city's largest design firm, Thompson Berwick & Pratt. As well as houses, TB & P designed a wealth of modernist milestones, including the B.C. Electric Building and Dal Grauer Substation on Burrard Street.
In texts for the 1949 exhibition "Design for Living" at the Vancouver Art Gallery, Ned Pratt had cited the five key West Coast characteristics that should drive local house design: rainfall (so, generous roof overhangs); muted sunshine (hence, huge windows to bring it in); view (shift priority from the streetfront façade and focus on glazing the walls that face trees and ocean); exterior treatment (natural unpainted locally sourced wood); and plan (flat roof, high ceilings and few interior partitions). Mr. Pratt then incorporated most of these principles (with the exception of "high ceilings") into his own family home. The 1951 Pratt residence's prefabricated plywood wall panels within a modular framework - which eventually became a standard housing system - was radical at the time.
Now, more than 60 years later, the son has restored his father's house back into a show-stopper. Much of the original cladding has been replaced by new glass and panels, and the original layout has contracted to become more of a couple-oriented home than the nuclear family hive it once was. The bedrooms that once comprised the northern wing of the house were beyond salvation, says Peter Pratt, and so he razed them - though his own childhood bedroom is still hanging in there, serving as an all-purpose junk room.
The renovated interior now features a new and starkly contemporary kitchen, gently lit by potlights. Yet Ned Pratt's aura and original scheme still dominate. The exposed beams still define the ceiling; the modular panel construction still defines the rectilinear massing. The living area is open and expansive, defined at one end by the original brick hearth and Darth-Vadaresque black metal fireplace hood and at the other end by a colourful backlit mosaic wall, created by Ned and his star designer at T B & P, Ron Thom, using fibreglass, dye and recycled egg cartons. Another wall bears the remaining traces of the gold foil that had served as a defining gesture of the original interior.
As for his own dwelling, Peter Pratt created something distinctly different for himself and his own young son, but he was careful not to upstage the original house a few metres away. "When I set out, I thought: 'I don't want to attack it; I want to maintain its own presence, but I am going to build my own house,'" he says. Like a good modernist, he availed himself of the present-day materials and technologies rather than try to copy the older home. "In those days, they didn't have glulam, double-paned glass or steel columns," notes Mr. Pratt, who used plenty of all of these.
Despite its heavy wooden joists, the new house reads as a predominantly concrete and metal structure. The living/dining area is a cedar-framed glass box with polished-concrete flooring anchored at each end by concrete hearths, and glass doors that slide open to the huge back garden and pond. True to Pratt Sr.'s Design-In-Living principle, the streetfront façade is almost invisible: It's the soaring glass of the rear façade that beckons you inside.
Flanking the open kitchen on each side are two short stairways that lead to the rear sleeping quarters and bathroom. The entire square footage is less than 1,200 square feet, yet laid out intelligently enough to serve as a comfortable home for a father and son, as well as a convivial party place on occasion.
Freshly completed, the restoration project is already garnering buzz. The West Vancouver Museum is featuring the house in its annual home tour this July, and Vancouver filmmakers Mike Bernard and Gavin Froome shot footage of the construction cum restoration project for their upcoming documentary film Coast Modern , which premieres at DOXA next month. (Mr. Bernard himself also happens to be a biological offshoot of the Pratt dynasty: He is Ned's great-nephew. )
The Pratt project, notes Mr. Bernard, is one of the happier end-stories of the midcentury West Coast Modernist homes that his film team has been documenting. "He's made it current and relevant and still useful," says Mr. Bernard. "His dad was such a heavy hitter, it must have been a personal victory for him to pull something off so complementary."
And despite the inherent challenges of a designing his own home, Peter Pratt is content with the results. His nutshell summary: "It's a good handshake between father and son."

Full text:   Ridership is increasing, but infrastructure is not. The solution to this squeeze play will shape the future of the city
Like thousands of 905ers, Andrew Simurda's daily trip to work has given him a window-side view of Greater Toronto's mounting transportation problems.
For the past 15 years, the portfolio manager has eschewed the car in favour of a leisurely 45-minute GO train commute from his home in Richmond Hill to the Union Station terminus. In that time, GO has tripled the size of the parking lot at his suburban stop. At the other end of the journey, he says he mostly avoids the PATH network "because the congestion in the tunnels is pretty bad." Those throngs, however, are just the thin edge of the wedge.
Within 15 to 20 years, according to Metrolinx, the number of bodies passing through the 85-year-old Front Street terminal is expected to double or even triple, propelled by the turbo-charged combination of population growth, expanded GO service, and the construction of more downtown office buildings, such as the second Bay Adelaide tower, announced earlier this month.
This looming squeeze play has Metrolinx casting about for answers. After almost a year of discussions with three consulting teams, the provincial transportation agency is focusing on two possible - and radical - solutions to a central dilemma: should Metrolinx attempt to force millions of additional commuters through an already constrained portal, or should it seek to disperse the traffic volumes elsewhere in the downtown?
One proposed fix involves digging a GO rail tunnel underneath the existing Lakeshore corridor that would be linked to a new underground platform concourse just to the southeast of Union Station .
The other option looks at creating a second terminal further west, on the rail corridor near Bathurst or Strachan, and then building a downtown relief subway line that connects this "shoulder station" to the downtown office district, then runs east along Queen Street and ultimately swings up the Bloor-Danforth line around Pape (this DRL would also extend down to the CNE). That new terminus, dubbed the Bathurst North Yard Station, would mainly serve commuters from the north and western regions of the GTA. It could divert as many as a third of GO riders before they reach Union Station, according to the agency's preliminary estimates.
Given the growth projections, that could mean more than 200,000 riders per day. This option could drastically alter the future growth of the downtown by re-directing office development westward. In fact, any major changes to Union Station - the focal point of the GTA's rapid transit network - will have a ripple effect. "We need to understand the impact on the entire system," says Leslie Woo, the agency's senior planner.
Metrolinx has yet to reveal details about the expected cost (large), the planning and construction timelines (lengthy), the funding strategy (uncertain), the implications for its other expansion projects (complicated), or its preference among the two options (under review). The agency has promised to release a long-term investment strategy next year, and Ms. Woo says officials will be in a better position to offer cost estimates by then.
Even at its current volume, Union Station is by far Canada's busiest transportation hub. Approximately 250,000 people use the Front Street station each weekday, and the entire train, subway and bus system operating within the station precinct handles upwards of 65 million riders per year. Lester B. Pearson International Airport, by comparison, handles half that volume.
If Metrolinx's projections bear out, the tsunami of commuters flowing from GO trains, as well as the overtaxed Yonge-University-Spadina subway line, will eventually congeal into a massive blockage, even with the $1.1-billion GO concourse expansion currently underway and a $90-million project to widen the platform at the Union Station subway stop.
"There's only so many tracks, and you can only get so many trains in and out of there," says former chief planner Paul Bedford. And, he warns, 2031 (Metrolinx's current planning horizon) "is not that far away."
To put the date into perspective, construction on the Air Canada Centre, which re-oriented the Union Station precinct towards the railway lands, started 15 years ago. The TTC's subway platform project has been in the works for a decade.
Ms. Woo says that over the next 10 years, Metrolinx will double the station's capacity with the introduction of faster trains and other logistical changes. Transit experts also predict that future TTC expansion - new LRTs on Eglinton, Sheppard and Finch - will pour even more traffic into Union Station.
The longer they wait to make a decision, the fewer choices they may have. Rapid growth south of the tracks may soon eliminate the option of a second, underground concourse, as ongoing high-rise development could block possible entrances and exits.
But transit experts are concerned about an even more fundamental problem associated with attempts to enlarge Union Station: "In general, the more you focus on one point, [the more] you're creating congestion and new problems for yourself," observes University of Toronto professor of civil engineering Eric Miller, a transit expert who headed the panel that recommended the LRTs to city council earlier this spring.
Mr. Bedford points out that most large city-regions have multiple train stations, which serve to spread out the load and link different types of transit services. Toronto, in fact, used to have many smaller suburban train stations, as well as the Summerhill station, now an LCBO outlet. But the railways decommissioned these stops in the post-war period as car ownership replaced the train as the preferred mode of travel.
"Some degree of decentralization has to happen," adds Roger Keil, director of York University's CITY Institute, citing large European transportation hubs that link local, regional and inter-city transit service to airports and central business districts. "You can't just try to solve one problem at a time."
Ms. Woo stresses that Metrolinx will only build a new station where demand warrants, which means anticipating the changing shape of the downtown core. In recent years, new office buildings have sprung up in the so-called "south core," near the ACC (more, such as an 800,000 square-foot tower proposed by Cadillac Fairview, are on the way. And since the late 1990s, commercial developers have converted millions of square feet of brick warehouses between Spadina and Liberty Village - an area that a second, more westerly terminal, would serve directly.
Yet Iain Dobson, a real estate consultant who studies the office market for the Canadian Urban Institute, points out that the supply of convertible warehouses is finite. "At some point," he says, "we've got to build more office space downtown or those jobs will go someplace else."
A possible shoulder station around Bathurst, linked to a new subway into the core, will almost certainly attract the attention of commercial builders, large corporate tenants and speculators, even if these dramatic infrastructure options are, for the time being, no more than lines and circles in a report to the Metrolinx board.
But Mr. Bedford wants Metrolinx officials to put the pedal to the metal so they can have solutions at hand before Union Station begins to seize. "You've got to think ahead," he urges. "This stuff doesn't fall from the sky, and it isn't free."

Abstract: "We basically took it from when the walls were just taped and there was no flooring," says Mr. [Ian McFadyen], to which Ms. [Belinda Chun] adds: "We did all the framing and drywall; we had a contractor do the tiles, plumbing and electrical and we did everything else." And the best thing about the DIY approach, says Cathy Garrido, a partner at Altius, is that "you put a level of care into it that you don't get from your average trades person."

Full text:   The tall, dark and handsome three-storey building is full of 'little things' to savour and big gestures to boast about
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
In the past, walking east along Howard Park Avenue after crossing busy Roncesvalles was a chore: auto body shops, a squat 1970s apartment tower and a sprinkling of workaday Bay-n-Gables assaulted the eyes.
Despite giant letters spelling out "Believe it or not, THIS IS THE PLACE" over a variety store positioned where Howard Park is swept away by Dundas Street West, not many believed this to be true, despite the excitement of the coin laundry and janitorial contractor buildings nearby.
Today, however, facing Howard Park at 2068 Dundas St. W. is a tall, dark and handsome three-storey beacon designed by Altius Architecture for Belinda Chun and Ian McFadyen.
But Gallery House almost didn't happen: "We almost didn't continue at one stage, we almost abandoned the project," says Mr. McFadyen. "It was a hard two weeks."
Those difficult weeks would have taken place some time after Valentine's Day, 2010, when the couple purchased the two-and-a-half storey, flagstone-clad janitorial building with a rabbit warren of dark rooms and a long, attached garage, and October, 2010, when construction began to transform it into a wide, bright art gallery on the first floor, and the couple's home on the existing second floor and proposed third floor.
Although the duo had purposely selected "an as broken-down a building as possible," a confluence of things - a completely crumbled foundation, a constantly rising general contractor's quote and stress at their jobs - led to a discussion of killing the dream and reselling the building at a loss.
"You can only evaluate a building like this so much before you start uncovering things," says architect Joe Knight, who worked on the project while with Altius (he's since started his own firm, blackLAB Architects). "[The clients] had some very specific ideas to start with when we first met." These were big, sexy ideas that were often at odds with the small budget, which had to include unsexy things like ensuring the building wouldn't fall over first.
The solution, all agreed, was to make Gallery House a partial Do-It-Yourself project for the young couple.
"We basically took it from when the walls were just taped and there was no flooring," says Mr. McFadyen, to which Ms. Chun adds: "We did all the framing and drywall; we had a contractor do the tiles, plumbing and electrical and we did everything else." And the best thing about the DIY approach, says Cathy Garrido, a partner at Altius, is that "you put a level of care into it that you don't get from your average trades person."
And the stuff that happened before the couple took the reins? "We basically gave Joe and Cathy creative freedom," explains Mr. McFadyen. "Belinda's in the arts, I'm in design; if you give creative people freedom and let them do what they want, you'll end up with something way better, so we just suggested little things here and there."
Trusted partners in heavy lifting, you might say, and the result is a building full of "little things" to savour and big gestures to boast about: For instance, the façade asserts itself with eight glass exclamation points within a well-tailored suit of dark fibre-cement panels and cedar strips; under this is a fully glazed street level.
Yet, a step inside the cool, white, 2,000-square-foot gallery - currently filled with the strange and steampunky works of Ray Caesar, Gottfried Helnwein and Anita Kunz - and the eye might wander to a small detail, such as the point where drywall stops short of the floor to allow for an indented tile baseboard (an easy-clean trick Ms. Chun borrowed from NYC galleries). The eye will most certainly travel up the wide staircase before the feet do; while it's a wonderful moment of ceremony, it also serves to separate the formal space from the lounge, where guests are encouraged to sit and chat by the double-sided fireplace, which Mr. McFadyen built using an inspirational photograph as a guide.
Those lucky enough to be invited upstairs will be rewarded in similar fashion. While the two residential floors sacrifice square footage to allow for skylights over the first floor lounge, they still offer gallery-like openness, albeit with warm wood underfoot.
It helps that art on the walls is by the same artists - the best gallery owner is an art collector - and that other items, such as the octopus chandelier by Philadelphia's Adam Wallacavage over the dining table, kitchen cabinets by Leslieville's Greentea Design, or the bathroom vanity by local recyclers Brothers Dressler, all contribute to a single design language.
That the backdrop for these moments, big and small, has been put together by a combination of naivete - "Now that we know, I don't think we'd do it again," laughs Ms. Chun - instructional YouTube videos, backbreaking labour, late-night telephones calls to their contractor, regular site visits by Altius, and the help of the local Home Hardware guys - makes this adaptive reuse project all the more sweet.
"They stretched every penny," finishes Ms. Garrido. "We really pushed them and I think it looks fantastic."
Walking down Howard Park, in other words, will never be the same: believe it or not, this really is the place.

Torontonians often wonder if we are getting multi-unit residential architecture of the same high quality that residents (and countless visitors) find in other aspects of the city: Its very liveable neighbourhoods, for example, its vivid musical, film and other arts scenes, and so on.
If by architectural "quality" is meant gorgeousness or avant-garde styling or physical longevity in the usual downtown condominium towers, then the answer is: No, we're probably not. Too many of the apartment stacks put up since the onset of the current real-estate boom, for example, are humdrum (or merely novel), and they add nothing or very little that's aesthetically engaging to the streetscape or skyline. And some expert observers worry that those popular, but hastily-constructed all-glass tower façades, which appear so sleek and neat in the short term, may not hold up well against harsh Canadian weather over the long haul.
But looking elsewhere - closer to the ground, that is, at the numerous lower-density housing complexes Toronto architects are crafting these days - one more frequently witnesses the interesting design quality we want to see on our urban streetscapes.
In this column, you have recently encountered some memorable instances of what I'm talking about: Among others, Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg's Canary District Condominiums, Richard Witt's Abacus Lofts and David Anand Peterson's six-storey Ritchie Avenue condo building. As far as exterior style is concerned, each of these structures differs from the others on this roll. All, however, are mid-rise residential projects with good modernist bones, sensible attitudes toward context, sidewalk and street, an air of aesthetic seriousness - and no faux-Victorian flimflam or laboured "contextualism."
Here's another one to consider adding to the roster: Toronto designer Roland Rom Colthoff's 109OZ condo block, an 85-unit structure that will have some architectural features that we should welcome in new mid-block, infill housing. But before I tack it on the list, I want to see the completed building. Judged solely on renderings and the model in the sales centre, 109OZ could be too genteel for the quick-paced place it's going into: The strip of galleries, restaurants, bars and shops in antique storefronts along Ossington Avenue just north of Queen Street West.
This is, of course, Toronto's current magnet for affluent, design-savvy hipsters. (It was ground zero for more indigent local cool-hunters just a couple of years ago, before the hipsters took over.) "Young professionals in the neighbourhood," as Mr. Rom Colthoff politely called them, are the people to whom 109OZ is pitched.
They, and the odd empty-nester couple, will find that the six-storey complex has several practical things going for it: an interesting downtown location with excellent public transit, fairly generous lofts (504 square feet to 1,160 square feet in area) and fairly standard new-condo prices - from around $285,000 to $700,000. The open-plan apartments come in one- and two-bedroom formats. Some have dens. There are no three-bedroom suites. (For the record, the developer is Reserve Properties Ltd.)
The site of 109OZ is about 150 feet wide and is currently occupied by a parking lot, a former car-repair spot (now the spacious sales office), and another elderly building. The lot stretches a considerable distance along the east side of Ossington, in other words, and Mr. Rom Colthoff will reinforce the walkable, shoppable sense of the street by devoting the sidewalk level to retail. The residents' entrance is off at the south end of the block, and it's small and quite inconspicuous - a sound, neighbourly move that makes the bottom of 109OZ mostly about strolling and getting and spending, like the rows of old storefronts that adjoin it.
To animate the façade above the sidewalk and cause it to vibrate in sync with the irregular streetscape round about, Mr. Rom Colthoff has broken up the horizontal, buxom chunk of architecture into so many jauntily stacked, punched one-storey boxes meant to jump and jive. Some of these elements thrust outward, others fall back. Two swing out at somewhat rakish angles vis-à-vis the long axis of the fabric.
My problem is that all this pushing and pulling and swinging is not as rakish and bold as it should be - not in this style-conscious neighbourhood, anyway. Earlier versions of the scheme sported large splashes of colour on the façade; the final rendition shows the exterior clad in Bay Street black and grey. By jostling the façade, the architect has created a design that probably manages to avoid middling modern tastefulness - though by a margin that's not nearly wide enough.
I could be wrong about 109OZ's conservative tendencies. We'll know for sure when the building is up and running in hipster heaven, and standing among the many other new mid-rise residential projects that, for better or worse, are reshaping Toronto's arterial streetscapes.

The Action: On a 58-by-125-foot ravine lot in Bayview Village, this Cape Cod-style residence was sought out by about 20 buyers requesting showings. It later sold on the day offers were accepted.
What They Got: About two decades ago, an original brick and stone bungalow from the 1960s was expanded into a two-storey house with a peaked roofline and sky-lit staircase to four bedrooms, including a master retreat with an office, a walk-in closet, balcony and six-piece ensuite, which is the largest of four bathrooms. Entertaining areas consist of a living room with a gas fireplace and a study area, a formal dining room and a combined kitchen and fireside family room with a walkout to a 189-square-foot deck, in addition to a lower-level recreation room with a wet bar, brick fireplace and a walkout to the interlocking patio.
* Other assets include an extra bedroom and kitchen in the basement, a newer high efficiency furnace and an attached double garage.
The Agent's Take: "It's on beautiful tableland ravine on a quiet, cul-de-sac," says agent Bill Thom. "The house is definitely very spacious with a granite kitchen and a fireplace, but it just needs some updating because it has some wallpaper. Other than that, the bones are good." Many visitors were also pleased by the quality of local amenities.

* Inside, quarter-sawn oak hardwood floors and intricate ceiling treatments dress up the fireside living room, adjacent dining area and combined eat-in kitchen and family room. The space also includes walnut and high gloss cabinetry, marble and stainless steel counters and garden doors to the south-facing backyard.
* There are three bedrooms on the second floor, including a master retreat with a sky-lit ensuite - the largest of five bathrooms with heated floors and marble or porcelain tiled walls. The third floor accommodates a sky-lit office and a fourth bedroom with a balcony and another sky-lit bathroom.
The Agent's Take: "This is certainly a family home, but it isn't a conventional family home because it has many modern elements, yet it is in a neighbourhood where traditional architecture is prevalent," agent Boris Kholodov said. "Landscaping is an integral part of a residential property and it is overlooked in many new infill homes these days. But in this case, a lot of time and effort was invested."
Practical details were also looked to in the construction, starting with built-in storage in the master suite.
"What's very unique is that it has a vestibule that acts as a walk-in closet. The room is fully panelled, has floor to ceiling, wall-to-wall mirrors, and is separated from the sleeping area and landing with pocket doors," Mr. Kholodov explains. "The powder room is thoughtfully located downstairs, straight ahead ... of course, it's a large and luxurious room, which would not be possible if it was on the main floor."

Abstract: In Edmonton, being in a low-rent end of town includes ethnicity. Asian stores, halal stores and Polish sausage stores cluster around us. Though I love to buy ingredients I can't name - and did it all the time in Montreal, where "ethnic" = "trendy" - I haven't worked up the courage to stick my feet in the doors of Edmonton's ethnic shopping enclaves. We shop at Costco a lot.

Full text:   Three years in a low-rent neighbourhood helped me overcome my pretensions and prejudices
Three years ago, when I discovered I was pregnant, my husband and I were living in a crowded apartment in the student ghetto close to the University of Alberta in Edmonton.
We were thrilled about the baby, but realized we needed a house to accessorize it, as we would have had to stack the baby vertically in our tiny place.
Unfortunately we were caught with our pants down in the wallet department: I was a graduate student, while my husband had a steady job which unfortunately hadn't kept pace with local real-estate hikes.
While we'd been blithely renting, national house prices had exploded. The only houses we could afford were dodgy ones enclosed by chain-link fences, rusted cars and abandoned shopping carts.
We bought a townhouse in a somewhat-run-down, blue-collar part of town. It didn't have the garage we wanted, but it didn't have hookers on the street corner either.
As a cradle for my offspring, it seemed dismal: The local schoolchildren looked hard and scary, and the playground graffiti offered us a new vocabulary. It was hard to reconcile my pursuit of higher education with children who looked like they made schoolteachers cry.
The first time I wandered around our local discount store, I was shocked by the empty or mis-stocked shelves and filthy bathrooms. I felt like I was in a Third World country. The local mall was full of retirees and tough-looking teenagers, and nobody was shopping. Most of the new moms in the mall - my future peer group - were teenagers.
In Edmonton, being in a low-rent end of town includes ethnicity. Asian stores, halal stores and Polish sausage stores cluster around us. Though I love to buy ingredients I can't name - and did it all the time in Montreal, where "ethnic" = "trendy" - I haven't worked up the courage to stick my feet in the doors of Edmonton's ethnic shopping enclaves. We shop at Costco a lot.
Our kids play with the local ne'er-do-wells: children who home-school, which in this case means no school, wearing dirty clothes that don't fit. They are nice children, but I had a knee-jerk reaction to snatch my cosseted little girl away when I saw her holding hands with her grubby friends.
What did I think would happen? I felt like they were leading her away into a different way of life, but in truth all that happened was that her hands got grubby.
For an academic whose mind is theoretically open to other cultures, I realized I had a long way to go. An ethnomusicologist is only a couple of songs away from an anthropologist, and where was my tolerance for living among diversity?
Economic diversity is as valid as ethnic diversity, though, shamefully for Canada, they often mean the same thing here.
How could I be uncomfortable in our new neighbourhood when I'd been planning for years to live among the Roma in Europe, one of the most economically depressed groups in the world? Could the gap between theory and practice truly be that large?
I hadn't realized my tolerance for diversity had limitations: I was prepared to live in slums as an outsider, but not as a permanent resident. I was prepared to live there as an adult, but not to watch my children grow up there.
We're moving to Calgary this month. I'm almost done my degree and my husband's income has skyrocketed, so this time around we've bought a beautiful house in a new suburb.
Odds are that our new neighbourhood will be filled with white, educated, middle-class families. And I'm starting to mourn the things I will miss about our neighbourhood.
I will miss "fitting in" at the playground. As a person with ethnically ambiguous features, it's nicer to be surrounded by people of visible minorities than to stick out as the only non-WASP.
I will miss the convenience of going to the mall in old sweatpants and Crocs. And I'll miss hearing different languages at the playground and seeing enormous extended families having picnics.
I will even miss the blank look on people's faces when I explain I am finishing a PhD. (I can almost see the bubble over their heads: "Why would she do that?")
Most of all, I will miss the sense of familiarity with "other."
The local high school students don't look scary any more, and I love our park, graffiti and all.
We know all our neighbours, and they want what we do: to raise their kids right (even when they're grubby), to relax with friends, to have more money and so on.
Ivory towers, whether academia or white ethnic enclaves, are lovely to live in, but they make it too easy to bypass the fundamentals of humanity - everyone wants a better life for their children, and sometimes dirt is just dirt.
After three years I've finally unloaded my pretensions and prejudices. I don't particularly want them back, but I suspect they're lying in wait for me in Calgary, inside the attached two-car garage or the shiny graffiti-free playground.
Melaena Allen-Trottier is moving from Edmonton to Calgary.

Hilton joins remake of Calgary's oldest neighbourhood

Full text:   Rebranded as East Village, a new mixed-use community sprouts from historic roots in the city's downtown east end
Since it was incorporated as a town in 1884, Calgary's downtown east end has seen its share of colourful hotels come and go.
Locals speak fondly of the now-closed King Edward Hotel, the legendary "Home of the Blues," or the shuttered St. Louis Hotel where Ralph Klein, former Calgary mayor and Alberta premier, often imbibed and ran successful election campaigns in the 1980s as he mingled with everyday folk in its beer parlour.
Others, such as the Atlantic Hotel, dubbed "Bucket of Blood" following a 1902 murder, have added to the checkered past of an area best known for its crime and homeless population - once labelled as skid row in 1940 by a medical officer of health.
But this seedy image may be relegated to the history books. In 2009, the Calgary Municipal Land Corporation announced its plan to redevelop 49 acres of the downtown east end into a revitalized community called East Village.
This spring, the commission added a key component when U.S.-based Widewaters Group, a commercial real estate development firm, said it would build a 315-room, $75-million Hilton Hotels facility. Unlike any hotel in the east end's existence, the 208,000-square-foot, 14-storey building is expected to open in 2014.
Ed Shagen, Widewaters' director of development, was quickly sold on the area's unique potential.
"What East Village has done is quite something," he explains. "You just don't see blank slates next to downtown cores in the scale that is presented here. In my travels I have not experienced something like this in a city that has such a strong economy and [presents an] opportunity like this."
East Village is designed for mixed use and includes two condo towers to be built by Vancouver-based Embassy Bosa Inc. and Ontario-based FRAM+Slokker. A National Music Centre, park space on St. Patrick's Island and a RiverWalk are also in development.
A new $70-million underpass has opened that makes Fourth Street S.E. a much needed north-south connector, linking East Village to, among other places, Stampede Park, home of the Calgary Stampede.
The Hilton Hotels location, on the corner of Fourth Street S.E. and Seventh Avenue S.E., is next door to the downtown core, and while East Village amenities are "a bonus," Mr. Shagen says they're not necessary for the hotel's success.
"We don't have to wait for East Village to develop," he says. "The connectivity, it just jumped out at us that this is perfect. The new Fourth Street connector also helps."
The hotel project is dual-branded. There will be a Hilton Homewood Suites (117 suites) and a Hilton Garden Inn (198 hotel rooms) under one roof. Each facility will have its own separate lobby and specialty branding, but the setup provides cost-sharing amenities such as a pool, gym and laundry.
Hilton Hotels does not have a downtown presence and the market is underserved, making the project a "no brainer," says Mr. Shagen, who expects construction to begin in 2013 with the doors opening in 2014.
The timing fits well with other development, says Susan Veres, vice-president of marketing and communications for Calgary Municipal Land Corporation. (CMLC is the legal entity managing the infrastructure of East Village and leading a broader-based plan for urban renewal in Calgary communities.)
Ms. Veres says the first tenants of the condo towers are expected to move to their new homes by the third quarter of 2014. If the vision for East Village is fully realized, the community will include 11,000 new residents by 2025.
As well, the first phase of the National Music Centre, being built in the restored King Edward Hotel, should be open in 2014. "The Eddy" was closed in 2004 and had gained national acclaim in the early 1980s when it became the smoky home to headline artists such as B.B. King, Pinetop Perkins, John Hammond and Otis Rush.
Heritage buildings such as the St. Louis Hotel and the Simmons Building (a bedding manufacturer) are being refurbished and present attractive, historic spaces for potential businesses, Ms. Veres says. CMLC says East Village will need to bring in grocery, general merchandise and home improvement businesses for residents.
Ms. Veres adds that since CMLC took on the project five years ago, it has worked to mitigate potential concerns. Bordered by the Bow River to the north, areas of East Village have been raised above the flood plain, Ms. Veres says, in some cases by up to three metres.
CMLC has also worked from "the very first day" with the Salvation Army and the Calgary Drop-In and Rehab Centre, whose homeless clients will remain in the area.
Calgary historian Harry Sanders says East Village presents a potentially remarkable transformation for the area.
"It's prime real estate," Mr. Sanders says. "It is right next to the river and handy to downtown. They were going to do urban renewal in the 1960s but it wasn't fully implemented.
"Since the earliest days there have been hopes for the east end to become something," he adds. "If the current plan is implemented, it will be that. It will be something."
*****
RIVERWALK ACCOLADES
RiverWalk is a highly visible part of East Village's urban renewal - and has already been singled out for praise.
* When completed it will stretch four kilometres, following the south side of the Bow River from Centre Street to Fort Calgary, and then along the west bank of the Elbow River to Stampede and Lindsay parks.
* The first kilometre of RiverWalk is open and this year was named a finalist for the 2012 Urban Land Institute's Urban Open Space Award along with four U.S. candidates. The award will be announced this October and recognizes projects that transform or revive their surrounding community.
* Calgary-based Stantec Consulting Ltd. designed RiverWalk, which includes separate walking and bikeway promenades, washrooms, new lighting, public art, three riverfront observation decks and terraced steps down to the river.

Abstract: As chairman, Mr. [Jeff Mallett] also brings advice on letting go. At Yahoo, founders Jerry Yang and David Filo handed executive control to CEO Tim Koogle, and Mr. Mallett, very early. Then Mr. Mallett let go and left when he didn't win the CEO's job. Indochino may be at an inflection point this year, says Mr. Mallett, and he has counselled the young co-founders to be ready to cede some control.

Full text:   With investments in baseball, soccer and an online suit seller, the former Yahoo president has lots of new balls in the air
Jeff Mallett's first gig in technology was hawking fax machines and other digital telephone equipment. His father and stepmother had quit their jobs at government-owned BC Tel and started their own company, Island Pacific Telephone.
It was the mid-1980s and Mr. Mallett was in his early 20s. He had a natural gift for gab - a decade later, when he became a top executive at Yahoo Inc., a colleague nicknamed him Sparky. But the skilled talker was a bit of a nerd, too. He'd cart a fax machine to customers for demonstrations, and was able to sell the technical details in a clear way to convince customers to buy.
"I remember lugging around - I mean, frickin', those things weighed 35 pounds," Mr. Mallett says over halibut and chips on a wooden pier on Victoria's Inner Harbour.
"I really got into product. I would study the heck out of it. It wasn't just sweet-talking."
His dad wanted him to take over Island Pacific but Mr. Mallett had bigger ideas. He felt the lure of Silicon Valley, after going to college and university in the San Francisco area, and marrying a local girl. "Victoria seemed too small."
Success in California came quickly, first in word-processing software, before he landed at a tiny company called Yahoo, in October, 1995. Mr. Mallett was 31 and hired as its 11th employee. As the No. 2 executive - president and chief operating officer - he helped lead it through the first Internet bubble, from an initial public offering in 1996, to $1.1-billion (U.S.) in revenue and profit of $71-million in 2000, to his departure in 2002, after being passed over for the CEO job.
Along the way, according to securities filings for 1996 through 2001, Mr. Mallett cashed in $150-million of stock options - and at the peak at the bubble in 2000 was worth a reported $800-million, on paper.
He socked most of his money away but set aside 20 per cent - tens of millions - for a front-row seat in sports: His biggest investment is an ownership stake in baseball's San Francisco Giants, the team's stadium and downtown real estate, and its regional sports cable TV operation. More recently, he bought a minority piece of the Vancouver Whitecaps of Major League Soccer.
But it was in Victoria that he found a promising Canadian technology startup, Indochino Apparel Inc., a Vancouver and Shanghai-based online seller of custom-made suits. Mr. Mallett, 47, says he likes to keep a hand in fledging tech plays "so I'm not just telling Yahoo stories. They're good - but they're getting old."
Victoria has a hold on Mr. Mallett. On the harbour, eating fish and chips at Red Fish Blue Fish, Mr. Mallett is accompanied by his 17-year-old daughter Victoria, named after the city in which her father spent his teenage and some early adult years.
They've come to the city for the annual presentation of an entrepreneurial award, which was first bestowed on Mr. Mallett in 2004, and then named after him by the University of Victoria, which Mr. Mallett attended for just one year.
It was in 2008, at the entrepreneurial awards, that Mr. Mallett was introduced to Kyle Vucko, an Indochino co-founder with Heikal Gani. Mr. Mallett saw promise, put up $175,000 in seed financing, and became chairman. The company raised $4-million last year, led by Madrona Venture Group, an early investor in Amazon.com.
Indochino predicts it can more than double its revenue in 2012 to nearly $20-million. Mr. Mallett says the company could be worth about $50-million if reaches its goal. Competition, however, is growing, including from the likes of upscale U.S. retailer Nordstrom Inc., which is investing heavily in digital and mobile, and experimenting with custom suits.
Mr. Mallett likens Indochino's challenge to that of Yahoo, which Mr. Mallett remembers as being just three or four months ahead of its competitors. "It can be a huge advantage if you don't make the wrong turn," Mr. Mallett says.
As chairman, Mr. Mallett also brings advice on letting go. At Yahoo, founders Jerry Yang and David Filo handed executive control to CEO Tim Koogle, and Mr. Mallett, very early. Then Mr. Mallett let go and left when he didn't win the CEO's job. Indochino may be at an inflection point this year, says Mr. Mallett, and he has counselled the young co-founders to be ready to cede some control.
"You don't have to always be The Guy," Mr. Mallett says.
After Yahoo, it took Mr. Mallett a couple of years to adjust to "I'm just Jeff, the guy." It was, he says, "a big change for me."
The field of play, Mr. Mallett's first love, filled some time: He traded watching the ups and downs of Yahoo shares for tallying wins and losses. With his Yahoo money, he started Mallett Sports and Entertainment LLC.
His first move was his best. The San Francisco Giants, owned by a group of individuals, were looking for new cash from someone younger, with management savvy and tech credibility, and in 2002 welcomed Mr. Mallett and put him on their eight-person executive committee. The team, which reached the World Series that year, and won in 2010, also owns a valuable regional sports cable television broadcaster land around its stadium that is slated to become a $1.6-billion sports-and-entertainment district.
In soccer, his record is mixed. In May, Women's Professional Soccer, in which he invested some money with basketball superstar Steve Nash, shut down. Over in England, Mr. Mallett has a minority stake in Derby County Football Club. The team plays in the tier below the English Premier League and finished 12th of 24 sides in the season recently ended.
Back in Vancouver, Mr. Mallett also has a minority stake in the Whitecaps, now in their second Major League Soccer season after a dead-last finish in their expansion campaign. The team doesn't yet make money, but it is now winning, ranked seventh of 19 teams this season.
Mr. Mallett also puts in a lot of hours for the league itself. Major League Soccer juggled its assets several months ago, creating a new company to house its media business and some merchandise. And the league brought in a private-equity player, Providence Equity Partners LLC, which injected upward of $200-million.
Mr. Mallett and three other league team owners will help oversee the new entity, with one goal to make soccer's broadcast rights more valuable.
"I always try to be the little guy," says the buoyant 5-foot-5 executive of how he parlayed his money into an array of sports investments. "I usually am the smallest dollars in, but the biggest sweat. I'm a sweat-equity guy."
Not entirely unlike selling fax machines in the mid-1980s.
"It's like back to the Island Pacific days in Victoria. I'm the one who loves the details, and reads the details, and cares about the details."

They came running. And what they lacked in numbers, they made up for in intensity. A trash can flew into the glass door, cracking it. A student protester kicked the sprawling spider web, hard. The door shattered.
The stunned guests retreated in the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec's grand hall as nervous security guards told them to stay inside until the riot police could secure their exit.
Sunday was the opening night of the 18th International Economic Forum of the Americas - or the Conference of Montreal, as it is commonly known. About 200 of Quebec's most prominent business people came to hear Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney, the rock star of the banking world, talk about financial reforms. The Montreal corporate establishment was there in force, from Power Corp.'s Paul Desmarais Jr. to Quebecor's Pierre Karl Peladeau to National Bank's Louis Vachon to Desjardins' Monique Leroux - not to mention the host of the private dinner, Michael Sabia, the Caisse's president and chief executive officer.
Lost to student protesters is the fact that Mr. Carney and Mr. Sabia have now come to embody, in other circles, the good guys of capitalism. They are the men trying to clean up the mess and enforce new and stricter rules.
Mr. Sabia is transforming the Caisse in a way no one expected when the province's Liberal government shocked Quebecers by endorsing his nomination in 2009. He is making his name as a nationalist investor.
It has been three years since he took over the Caisse, one of the most powerful money-management institutions in Canada. Yet he is still marked by the events that brought him there. He insists on the importance of making "concrete investments," not betting on "abstract products whose value depends on mathematicians' calculations." That remark, made in his last speech, was yet another swipe at the type of complex financial products that led the Caisse in 2008 to a $40-billion loss, the worst in its history.
With $159-billion in net assets at the end of last year, the Caisse has barely recovered, just surpassing the level of assets it held at the end of 2007. So Mr. Sabia is working on what he calls the "second wave of changes." The first was stabilizing the Caisse and improving its ability to manage risk. Now he is implementing a no-nonsense investment philosophy: The organization is concentrating on infrastructure, real estate, and on companies that either manufacture day-to-day products or offer plain vanilla services. To do so, it favours investing in private companies while shying away from the stock market.
"In an excessively volatile world, private placements will allow us to generate returns," Mr. Sabia said. The weight of stocks in the Caisse's portfolio, which stood at 36 per cent at the end of December, should fall over the coming years, he predicts.
What is rising is the Caisse's belief that it can make good returns by investing in Quebec companies. Mr. Sabia has stated this time and again since he took over the Caisse's presidency, but Quebecers have remained skeptical - in the same way many wrongly perceive him as an Ontarian, even though he lived in Montreal during long tenures at CN and at BCE. But he backed the words with action, raised the Caisse's investments in Quebec companies and real estate to $15.5-billion last year from $13.7-billion at the end of 2010, a 13-per-cent increase.
This explicit commitment to placing bigger bets on Quebec firms is an about-face for the Caisse. Mr. Sabia's predecessor, Henri-Paul Rousseau, rejected the Caisse's so-called dual mission, which states that it should seek the best returns for its depositors while contributing to the development of Quebec's economy.
For Mr. Rousseau, Quebec's development was often at odds with the pursuit of better returns for retirees. Unduly favouring Quebec companies brought risks - of political intervention and investment mistakes.
But Mr. Sabia has found a politically astute way of reconciling the Caisse's dual mandate: He stole one of François Legault's best punch-lines. The co-founder of Quebec's newest party, Coalition Avenir Quebec, has long criticized the Caisse for its aloofness toward Quebec as it was losing corporate headquarters such as Alcan. He argued, university studies in hand, that "proximity investments" generate better returns than those made at the opposite end of the world, since institutional investors have an intimate knowledge of local companies and their management.
And so the Caisse has made a flurry of investments in Quebec companies in the past months. Two weeks ago, it invested $1-billion in CGI Group to help the Montreal IT services company finance its $3.3-billion acquisition of U.K.-based Logica. This is the Caisse's biggest bet under Mr. Sabia's rule.
Then it invested $98.5-million in engineering firm Genivar, which also acquired a U.K. company, the WSP Group, for $442-million. Finally, it channelled $100-million into Laurentian Bank so that it could buy AGF Trust for $415-million. With close to 10 per cent of the shares, the Caisse has become the bank's biggest shareholder.
In normal times, these investments in Quebec companies should have restored the Caisse's bruised public image and benefitted Premier Jean Charest - even if Quebec's main pension fund manager is technically at arm's length from the government. But it is lost in the clamour of the student unrest, with the strike going on its fourth month. When Mr. Charest gave a lunchtime speech at the Conference of Montreal on Monday, he did it under airport-tight security. Outside, riot police watched all of the hotel's entrances. Inside, participants were screened with metal detectors.
Mr. Charest talked about Canada's free-trade negotiations with Europe. The crowd, filled with dignitaries, central bankers, CEOs and scholars, should have been his. But the applause was polite at best. Many of the Quebeckers who favour his government's tuition fee hikes are unhappy with his handling of the strike, and some are repulsed by the new Bill 78, which is intended to quell student demonstrations by curtailing the right to protest.
Here lies the irony. Michael Sabia, the Caisse's most contentious choice as a CEO, has finally earned the respect of Quebeckers. Yet the Premier who put him in the job won't get credit for it any time soon.

A beachside update stays true to its origins

Abstract: It's well-known that white walls are desirable because they make a dim space brighter. What's understood less is that such walls need a measure of pigment to look their best. A truly white space - especially here on the West Coast, where the light is naturally flat and grey - needs a lot of light to save it from dinginess.

Full text:   An older apartment can be spruced up without attempting to mimic the look of a modern condo
kdeck@globeandmail.com
Recently we were asked to give a beachside living room a refresh ahead of its most important season. The home is a one-bedroom apartment in Vancouver's Kitsilano neighbourhood that belongs to a friend of mine, a teacher named Jane.
She wanted to fling open the windows, so to speak, and let summer's warmer winds carry in an air of sun-bleached sophistication.
Like most buildings in Kits, Jane's was built between 1950 and 1960. A three-storey walkup with a large Arbutus tree in the front yard, its 10 or so suites are on the weathered side, but saved by wonderfully simple floor plans, hardwood floors, and, of course, proximity to the beach.
Our design mission was to bring the atmosphere of the seashore inside, giving an older apartment an update without attempting to make it look like the modern condo it isn't.
Here are the three big questions we answered in undertaking the design mission:
Why the light walls and window finishes?
The 700-square-foot apartment has windows on the its north side only. They have two drawbacks - the light they let through (not much) and the view (of a Dumpster in the alley).
It's well-known that white walls are desirable because they make a dim space brighter. What's understood less is that such walls need a measure of pigment to look their best. A truly white space - especially here on the West Coast, where the light is naturally flat and grey - needs a lot of light to save it from dinginess.
Our choice for the task was Natural Linen, by Benjamin Moore. It's one of my favourite neutrals.
It doesn't look too tawny and pairs well with both cool and warm hues.
For window coverings, we used the existing valance to our advantage.
The drywall drop you see was common in Vancouver from the 1940s through the 1970s. Although the feature is an emblem of its era, Jane has always felt it an ugly one. (I agree.)
But removing the drop would have cost $1500 - too much for a simple refresh.
Instead, we played the hand we were dealt, installing two layers of custom Roman blinds. One is sheer and diaphanous, and it's almost always down.
It allows light in while screening sight lines to and from the apartments across the alley.
The other, higher layer of natural linen is very close in colour to the wall, one Jane can deploy for evening privacy.
Why the odd collection of tables?
It's not often that tables, plural, play so prominent a role in a single design, but it was the case in Jane's living room.
The challenge was to find tables that worked well with the existing furnishings, whose air was one of artful casualness. Matched tables, we knew, would add nothing to the room, so we gave ourselves the more difficult job of hunting down an ensemble cast of complementary pieces.
The side table gave us the most trouble: it needed to be unusually tall to look good beside the over-height sofa (which had 36-inch arms). And it needed to be delicate; anything substantial would look blocky and out of place.
To our delight, local design boutique The Cross offered up a bronze and glass side table that met our odd requirements. Its silhouette adds intrigue to the room, its antique gold finish brings warmth, and its glass shelves provide welcome display space.
By comparison, the coffee and accent tables are organic.
The kidney bean of the coffee table, in particular, exudes softness. In a small space, it's much easier to move around than a piece with sharp edges and corners, and its glossy white deploys a hit of playfulness.
The wood stool came from a consignment store, though it might have escaped from a log boom.
Its elemental chunkiness offers the room an important injection of rawness and "un-design."
No one should fuss about setting a cup of coffee or glass of wine on it.
Why such big art?
In an open floor plan with an eclectic mix of furnishings, it's always a sound plan to make the artwork large and powerful. The alternative - arranging a gallery wall or grid of photographs - will add busyness to busyness, unhappily congesting the room.
Our approach was to start with a large investment piece - this magnificent David Burdenay photograph of gondolas in Venice - over the sofa.
The scale and atmosphere of the image define the living room without overwhelming it.
For the area over the desk we chose a quiet, modern painting. It distinguishes the work from the living room without trying to compete with it.
And on the wall adjacent the sofa, over the console, we placed two prints we'd selected from an artist online and framed in store-bought frames.
In the curation of a small space one thing we always consider is how the viewer interacts with each piece of art.
Here, the large photograph meets you the moment you walk in the room - you need some distance to appreciate it, while the subtlety of the painting over the desk rewards closer scrutiny.
The prints are full of whimsicality whose detail requires that you lean over and study it. Three kinds of interactions; three considerations of space.

LEGENDS OF THE SMALL

Author: Calleja, Dawn

Abstract: I think I've fired two people in my whole life. I don't have the temper for it. I'm the reverse of Donald Trump - I'd rather say you're hired than you're fired.

Full text:   These veteran entrepreneurs made the leap from small-business owners to big shots. They shared with Dawn Calleja their stories, challenges and turning points, and offered advice for their growth-minded counterparts
HEATHER REISMAN
Indigo Books & Music Inc.
Toronto | 1996 | Close to 7,000 employees | 244 stores | $1 billion revenue
The most important thing is to do something you feel insanely passionate about - so passionate that the challenges that will inevitably come up and the people who will tell you that you can't or you shouldn't, all of those things will be minimized by your passion and determination to make it happen.
When your business is tiny, you are the owner of the vision, the person who has to make everything happen, and you sweep the floor and lock the door. You do it all.
You are going to make mistakes. Every entrepreneur will tell you this - that they have made so many mistakes, but they've done more right things than mistakes. But it's close.
If you can get your business to a million, you can get it to a billion.
It is hugely helpful to have someone close to you who believes in you totally. Entrepreneurs will inevitably have moments of doubt, so having someone whose advice you truly value, who can give you perspective, allow you to stand back and see things in context - that is invaluable.
It's hard to start a business with absolutely nothing. You will need a bit of seed money. Sometimes it's as little as $5,000 - I'm not saying it has to be $1 million. But you can't fool yourself either. If you don't have any resources, you will burn yourself out.
When men make mistakes, they seem to think, "That's a mistake," and move on. Whereas women who make mistakes, especially early on, tend to say, "Oh no, my entire career is over."
Starting Indigo was the single most challenging thing I've ever done. I am at an equally challenging moment now. While sustaining the book business for all people who care about it, we also have to transform it to deal with the reality that 30% or 40% of books will be bought digitally. That means 30% of my business that needs to be replaced. That's a big transformation.
Starting and building businesses is what drives me every day. We started Kobo from scratch. Everybody said we were nuts. In 23 months, we went from a standing start to being identified by Wired in January, 2012, as the best e-reader in the world.
My husband and I love the entrepreneurial spirit. This is the moment for entrepreneurs, and we need them. If we can get the entrepreneur thing really happening here, there will be no stopping this country.

ELLIS JACAB
Galaxy Cinemas (now Cineplex Entertainment)
Toronto | 1999 | 130 theatres | 1,359 screens | 10,000 employees | $1 billion revenue
It was scary when I was let go from Cineplex. I had a wife and two young kids. I was taking a big risk. I took all of my assets and put them into Galaxy. It could have turned good, or it could have turned really bad. You're never sure in those situations.
When I asked Robert Lantos, who ran Alliance and was an investor in Galaxy, if he wanted to see the business plan, he said, "No, you're the business plan." That put a lot of pressure on me because I had to deliver.
Work hard and be lucky - but you have to create your own luck, too.
My claim to fame is, nobody's ever quit on me, in my 30-odd years of working. The only person who ever left me - and he's very close to me now - is my partner at Galaxy. I think it's important to have great people who you can trust.
My big focus is customer service. It's tough because you're dealing with a lot of young people. The positives are, they're young and you can mould them. The negative is, they have a mind of their own.
Always keep your ego in your pocket. Because people in our business, especially, their ego takes over. You have to treat everybody like you expect to be treated.
I learned a lot from Garth Drabinksy, but he had a different way of operating. He was driven, but he also threw a lot of good money after bad things. Sometimes you have to say "I made a mistake," and move on.
We still try to keep our entrepreneurial focus, but it's a little tougher when you've got 10,000 employees.

FRANK HASENFRATZ
Linamar Corp.
Guelph, Ontario | 1964 | 16,200 employees | 39 manufacturing facilities | $2.8 billion revenue
I was a stowaway. I came from Hungary by boat in 1957 and arrived in Quebec City. An immigration officer came on board and asked what I was doing here. I said I was a refugee and wanted to immigrate to Canada. He gave me $5 and said welcome to the country. It took 15 minutes. I was 22.
I started washing cars for 25 cents a car. I even saved money. Eventually I came to Guelph and got a job at WC Wood, which did a lot of work for the Avro Arrow. I'm a toolmaker by trade. My boss and I disagreed on how to make a part. One day I walked into his boss's office and said, "You have to fire this guy or I quit." Guess what he said? "You quit."
When things are really bad, don't go and hide. Just think, can you make a profit out of it? I set up some machines in my basement and garage, and we made Ford oil pumps - 1,000 a day. Each time we started up a machine, the television went down. Two years later, we built a small plant next to the house. For seven years in a row, we put an addition on the building, but we paid for everything in cash.
What you gotta do is, you measure everything. Everything. If I read a book, I measure how long it takes to read a page. If you don't measure, it doesn't get done. I'm a freak about that.
Almost all of the people I've hired, they start at the bottom. You have to learn how things are done on the floor if you want to manage people. I only know one job where you start on top: when you dig a hole. And guess where you end up? In a hole.
Since my daughter Linda took over in 2002, I haven't been to a meeting. Cost-cutting is my job now. We call it CAB, for Cost Attack Team. We look at the floor, at shipping, at every penny and see what we can come up with. I never have a [situation] where I don't find $200,000 in savings on an annualized basis.
Never, ever, think you have it made. The day you think you have it made, you go the other way.

RON JOYCE
Tim Hortons
Hamilton | 1964 | 4,042 stores | $2.9 billion revenue
When I started out, they tried to teach me the doughnut business with a Ouija board. The first store had been open for about nine months. There were no formulas, no operating manual.
I hired a gentleman who was highly qualified - a Harvard graduate - and he began to change the whole philosophy. That didn't work, and after a year we decided that maybe he would move on, and I would continue the role I'd started with.
Probably one of the greatest errors in judgment was to sell the company to Wendy's. I made the decision for estate planning purposes that I would exit, and find a company that could take the chain on. We didn't know until after the fact that they were a troubled company.
Keep it simple, stupid. Don't try to be all things to all people.
The words "That's good enough" don't exist in business. You cannot rest on your laurels. The auto business suffered badly by making a product that was inferior. They learned their lesson. Quality first, as Ford would say. And I think that's true in anything we do.
At the grand old age of 81, I'm still active. You have this age-65 mentality that a lot of people still have today. They believe it's time to quit, and I guess, really, that's stupid.

1-800-GOT-JUNK
Vancouver | 1989 | 1,500 employees | About 180 locations in three countries | $95 million revenue
My father, who is a transplant surgeon, had to go to school. But entrepreneurs are different. You just have to problem-solve on the fly. A lot of it is difficult to teach. I think that's why so many entrepreneurs are high school and university dropouts.
My biggest mistake turned into a positive. In 1994, I had a team of 11, and I decided to fire them all. I sat them down and said, "I've let you down as a leader. I either haven't hired the right people or trained you enough or given you enough attention." I went from five trucks and a two-person call centre down to just me. What it taught me was that it's all about finding the right people, treating them right.
Finding the right people is 100 times more important when you're finding a franchise partner. One of our loose parameters was, would we invite this person into our home for dinner? We wanted a cultural fit beyond just the passion and the belief in the vision.
The experts all told me, "Don't franchise this business. It won't work. Anyone can go out and buy a pickup truck and haul junk." They were right in the sense of, don't go franchise this business as it currently exists. One of the big things we put in place was a call centre. I want our franchise partners out there driving sales. I don't want them dealing with booking and dispatching. That was one of the secret sauces.
The name change from Rubbish Boys was hard. I don't want to say it was a mistake, but it was a painful transition. Our revenues declined substantially, but I had to have faith that 1-800-GOT-JUNK was the way to go.
I had a heckuva time trying to get the phone number. It was owned by the Department of Transportation in Idaho. I had so much confidence that I was going to get it that I ended up hiring a designer to design the logo, the whole bit. I made phone call after phone call, and eventually I got someone in the department who said, "You know, you're really bugging me. Clearly this phone number is more important to you than it is to us." And we exchanged the number for free. He just wanted me to go away. That's obviously one of the key things for the business - the crystal-clear belief that something is possible, that I can make it happen.
Have a clear vision of what the future looks like. And not just in your head, but on a couple pieces of paper. It takes the picture from my mind as the entrepreneur and shares it with everyone in the business.
Read The E-Myth by Michael Gerber. That was my manual on how to scale and grow a business. I grew up with ADD. I had trouble focusing and I was terrible with books - I'd get three pages in and then put it down. This one, I read cover to cover, put it down, took a five-minute break and read it again.

MICHAEL COWPLAND
Corel
Ottawa | 1985 | $180 million revenue in 2000
I met Terry Matthews at Microsystems, and we started Mitel. Most people thought we were taking a heck of a risk, because we both had good jobs as managers, and we were leaving for the unknown. But it turns out the whole place was shut down one year later, so we made a good move.
Mitel's first two products weren't winners, but we reacted quickly and moved on to the next opportunity. Then we doubled every year for 10 years in a row.
Microsoft played tricks on Corel, for sure. It got to the point where we'd get WordPerfect bundled on Hewlett-Packard computers, which would have been a very good deal, with tens of millions of copies going up. Then Bill Gates wrote a letter to the president of HP and said, "If you put WordPerfect on your machines, you won't get Windows." We sued them and eventually got $150 million [through a share purchase], so that was sort of a consolation prize.
Corel ended up being one of the top 10 software companies worldwide even today, and that's good to see, because if it just dissolved, that would be disappointing.
Terry is invested in about 80 companies. He's been extremely proactive in investing in other companies, which is great. I did a bit of venture cap, including owning sports clubs and restaurants, and I found out that most of the time it's easier to lose money than to make money. So I decided to focus on what I'm good at, which is high-tech.
We focus at Zim on enterprise databases, which is kind of boring. But on the other hand, enterprise clients are good customers because they don't mind paying for things. Whereas if you look at the consumer field, virtually everything now is free.
The most common mistake entrepreneurs make is the Excel spreadsheet forecast that goes up like a hockey stick and is not based on actual sales.
We do some small investments at Zim in companies that are a strategic fit. We always look for ones that have real sales, because getting customers is not as easy as it looks.
People who just have an idea on the back of a napkin - you used to be able to raise money like that in the Y2K bubble, but now investors are a little more skeptical.
You have to get as close as possible to customers so you understand what they really want. Quite often a product has a lot of features, and maybe 20% of them are really necessary, and 80% are fluff.
I like being back at a small company. At the bigger companies, you tend to have a lot of large meetings, which take too long and are kind of boring. I much prefer to be in a small, fast-moving organization.

After I divorced, I didn't know what I was going to do. No one wanted to hire me because I didn't have a particular skill - I wasn't a hairdresser or a banker. I wanted to be a writer. But I knew how to cook, from my mother.
I can remember my grandfather saying, "Don't sell the skin of the bear before you kill it." Meaning, don't spend more money than you save. Even when I didn't have money, I always paid my bills. When you start with nothing, you learn to save money, have discipline, to count and plan. Now, we don't have any debt at all.
Money is the thermometer of an enterprise. You don't take any actions that don't make you money.
Wanting a business and being committed to it are two different things. For a miracle to happen, you have to be committed. Many people don't think business is work. Work is the biggest ingredient in the recipe.
Another big thing was focus. I decided to make breakfast - that's all that we do. That made me an expert. I have nearly 2,000 cookbooks, and they're nearly all about baking and breakfast and bread. You know how many times people have said to me, Why don't you open at night? But we're committed to being an international leader of breakfast specialties.
You also need a dash of salt in the recipe - a little bit of doubt. What could I do to better my product? That keeps me always wanting to learn.
Will I ever retire? Retirement is a state of mind that we should do when we're in the box. As the big boss, my office is in my head. How can I retire?

My father was a guy who sealed a deal with a handshake. He showed me that honesty and integrity are important qualities when running a business.
The turning point for Ledcor, our family business, was the ability to expand geographically. The moment we had the capacity to move into new markets was a milestone.
My brother and I aren't total opposites, but we balanced each other. There is also a loyalty there - we knew that no matter the challenge, we would be stronger together than apart.
My biggest mistake was underestimating the time and energy needed to launch a start-up. Getting any new business off the ground is tough, but wine demands patience and perseverance.
Bigger isn't always better. Not all businesses are scalable. If you do choose to grow your business, make sure you and the organization are really ready.
Something I learned from Ledcor is that you should hire the best people and give them the opportunity to share in the company's profits. When the company is successful, everyone benefits.
At first, putting my name on the vineyard was awkward - I didn't want to do it, but my management team convinced me it was important. They said, and now I see, that by putting my name on the bottle, it is a commitment to the wine inside.
We are always looking. I enjoy the process of evaluating options, and the deal itself is a real thrill. The acquisition of Breggo Cellars two years ago, an Anderson Valley-based winery focusing on aromatic whites and Pinot Noirs, was a great fit. Any new acquisitions will be done to further diversify our wine businesses.
You should find pleasure in what you do, particularly when starting up a business, because life is short. New companies demand a lot of effort, and you should be able to wake up in the morning and feel good about what you are doing.

I did not have a goal, except one: to conquer the world.
I didn't have any financing from a bank. I started the company with a very limited budget - maybe $25,000.
When I was teaching women at my school - etiquette, how to walk, how to apply makeup - I had to use foundation from this brand, lipstick from another, mascara from another, to satisfy my own criteria. I thought, "You know, I should just make my own makeup." I believed strongly that if it would satisfy my own needs, it would satisfy the needs of women around me.
Before I launched in 1972, I did a marketing study that was a catastrophe. Nobody believed in the Lise Watier beauty line - and that gave me the adrenalin to prove them wrong.
When you grow a business day by day, you don't even realize it. It's a natural type of evolution. It's like growing old. When you look at yourself in the mirror, you don't see the difference. I'm still 28 or 48.
I've had a few setbacks. I had a fire that destroyed my whole office and warehouse in 1990. We never could find out what happened. After the fire, bankers wanted to have their loan back. But I guess the spirit never left me. I would get up in the morning and prove the bankers wrong, and I did, because I had faith - I believed in it so much.
I think I've fired two people in my whole life. I don't have the temper for it. I'm the reverse of Donald Trump - I'd rather say you're hired than you're fired.
Beauty is emotion. I'm in the business of emotion. Women are very sensitive. They have a sense of insecurity vis-à-vis their beauty. I was married, I was in love, I had children, I was divorced. I was filled with a lot of emotions - good ones and not-so-good ones. I understand women because I am one.
I haven't done any advertising for 15 years. I am no longer the face of the company. The brand outgrew the founder, which is what I wanted.
One person cannot make miracles, but a group of women can move mountains.

The turning point, for me, was around 1992, when I realized that Canadians only get two weeks of holidays, and I was running a holiday company. That's when I first approached the idea of exporting tourism, which was revolutionary. This was before e-mail or even the fax machine. The idea of a German booking an African safari with a Canadian company was unheard of.
I had to reinvent the space by offering a new style of travel that involved local transportation, local accommodations, culturally focused, fair-trade prices. It was ecotourism before the word existed. Outside of funding, my biggest challenge was getting people to understand what we were doing. If people saw an ad for a tour to Thailand, they'd think of an air-conditioned coach, staying at a Best Western hotel, and a Canadian guide with a microphone.
Half of my employees, I might never meet, and I have to get them to love my company and make them want to work hard. That's a very different type of leadership.
I travel a lot of miles, but social media has made it much easier. Twitter has revolutionized our business. Facebook has done the same thing. We have the ability to deliver our culture anywhere in the world now.
When you start to hire staff, you hire people that you like or you relate to or want to have a beer with. They are like you, and they have the same skills as you. But you need to look for people who complement your skills. You have to find people who fill your weaknesses. They will kind of irritate you. People who are extremely anal and make lists bug me, but I totally need those people.
Know your audience. Entrepreneurs spend too much time on the product when they have to know who's going to buy it. There are lots of people who can put out good products. The minute you do, someone will knock you off, and they might do it cheaper and faster. The skill is in the selling.

My dad always said, hire better people than you, and keep them. You don't want to have turnover.
When I moved out west from Toronto, I was starting the business from scratch, calling on all these oil and gas businesses. My dad would say, when you're in those office buildings, say hello to everybody. Talk to the janitor, because next time you come in, the janitor could be making the decisions.
Both my sons started at the very bottom - Brad in the call centre, Jim laying cable. They would not have got where they are if they weren't qualified and didn't love the business. I always said, you've got the first opportunity, and if you don't want it, we'll just have to go to professional management.
I remember when we were buying out the Jeffery family in Woodstock, Ontario - they owned London Life. Joe Jeffery, a good friend of my dad's, said, "Young man," - I wish you could say "young man" today - "let me tell you a few facts of life. One of them is the future wealth of this country is owning land and buildings and real estate. Cable television is nothing more than a passing fad." I never, ever forgot that. That was written in my brain. But we just kept plugging ahead, and it is what it is.
I have a love-hate relationship with the business. I love it because it's always changing. I hate it because it's so capital-intense.
Ted Rogers started from pretty humble beginnings. He used to tell me, "I had all these bills to pay and not enough money to pay them. We'd put all the invoices in a big jar, and if your name got drawn out, you'd get paid."
I try not to get too involved in the detail. I just want to have a sense of where it's going and a gut reaction that it's the right thing to do.
One of the acquisitions I didn't make early on was The Weather Network. I made too quick a decision and passed on it, and I've regretted it.
If you're in negotiations, never leave a table that you can't return to. If you disagree, leave it in such a state that you can come back to the table. Keep yourself open. Like when we were dealing with Goldman Sachs and the bondholders in New York on buying Global, we hung in, and see what happened?
This is one life. You need to enjoy it.
I have slowed down a lot, but they'll probably carry me out of the office in a pine box one day.

Full text:   Market reflects disillusion with European leaders' handling of debt crisis and the ongoing flight of capital, analysts say
Bond markets have renewed their attack on Spanish and Italian debt, signalling a lack of confidence that European leaders are close to corralling the spreading debt crisis.
Spain's borrowing rates soared to record levels Tuesday and a raft of Spanish banks suffered fresh credit downgrades, amid worries that the EUR100-billion lifeline tossed to Spain's floundering banks will worsen Madrid's own dire financial straits while proving no tonic for the increasingly vulnerable banking system.
"In the eyes of the market, all that has changed with the bailout announcement is that Spain will get the money from the Europeans at a lower rate instead of having to borrow it in the market," said Beat Siegenthaler, senior foreign-exchange strategist with UBS in Zurich. "All the rest remains the same, including how exactly the banking issues will be addressed."
The market response reflects general disillusion with the Europeans' handling of the entire crisis and the ongoing flight of capital, said Arthur Heinmaa, managing partner with Toron Investment Management in Toronto. "What you're getting are slow-motion bank runs. The banks can't sell their assets fast enough [to keep up with the loss of deposits]."
The yield on the 10-year Spanish government bond climbed above 6.8 per cent at one point, the highest since Spain joined the euro at its inception in 1999, after Fitch Ratings cut its ratings on 18 Spanish banks.
By the end of the day, the benchmark bond rose 20 basis points to 6.71 per cent. The bond-rating agency sharply downgraded Spain's sovereign debt by three notches last week to triple-B, citing the deteriorating economy and worsening fiscal outlook. This is putting further stresses on the banks, particularly those heavily exposed to the battered Spanish real estate market. Non-performing loans are rising, business volumes are falling and margins are being squeezed.
"This solution is still some way off," Credit Suisse said in a note to clients. "Spanish GDP could end up falling another 5 per cent on account of fiscal tightening ... bank deleveraging and falling wages. This will have a negative impact on the fiscal arithmetic and credit quality."
"We think Europe is only half-way through resolving the crisis," the Credit Suisse analysts added. "In particular, we believe that we will need an ECB [European Central Bank] deposit guarantee or a EUR2 trillion five-year [long-term refinancing operation]."
The fog surrounding Spain is also costing debt-ridden Italy dearly, as its economy slides deeper into recession and it is forced to borrow additional billions of euros to cover its 22-per-cent share of the Spanish bank rescue tab. "There is a permanent risk of contagion," Prime Minister Mario Monti told an economic conference during the weekend.
The yield on 10-year Italian sovereigns reached 6.3 per cent, the highest since Jan. 25, before settling to 6.17 per cent, an increase of 14 basis points. Rising costs raise the spectre that both Spain and Italy - like Greece, Portugal and Ireland before them - will find themselves essentially shut out of the capital markets. But unlike those small countries, Spain and Italy are simply too big to bail out.
Madrid has been calling for a euro-zone banking union with a single regulator, the capacity to refinance troubled banks, and deposit insurance to cover euro accounts in any member country.
Without such a euro-wide deposit guarantee, banks in Greece, Spain and other battered countries face a continuing leakage of money. With such a backstop, even Greeks might be confident enough to leave their money in local banks, knowing they will be reimbursed in euros, regardless of whether Greece leaves the monetary union.

Even new parents should make a will

Abstract: "Every word means something," Mr. [Les Kotzer] says, but often, that something is open to interpretation. Vague phrasing such as the words "antiques," "memorabilia" and "personal monies" plagues estate distribution. When it comes to wills, clarity is a fine balance between specificity and generality. As an example, Mr. Kotzer suggests that a phrase such as "remainder of the estate" works well to both simplify and summarize assets in a broad stroke.

Full text: It's 'a living, breathing document' that needs to be updated as your status changes
Hollywood loves an open-ended will, but off the silver screen, there is rarely anything funny about an inheritance battle. Family ties can be kept from unravelling with the help of a Last Will And Testament ... that is, if you have one. For harried new parents navigating a series of practical considerations and paperwork, "make a will" often lingers on the bottom of the to-do list.
"You're so busy hour to hour it's tough to focus on the big picture," says London, Ont.'s Katrina McIntosh, whose son, Parker, is nearly one. Ironically, as resource co-ordinator at the Student Success Centre (University of Western Ontario), Ms. McIntosh is always planning ahead: "I spend a lot of time working on students' futures, but it can be tough to take your own advice," she says.
While making a will is as responsible as acquiring a health card, social insurance number and registered education savings plan for your child, it is such an emotionally and culturally laden document that it may seem a morbid exercise in worst-case scenarios for parents starting families.
Jean Blacklock, lawyer and author of The 50 Biggest Estate Planning Mistakes ... and How To Avoid Them, confirms this unease. "It can be hard signing your name to a document to be used when you're not here."
The best way to deal with any fear of death (and/or lawyers) is just to deal with it, at least so your loved ones will not be left sorting out a messy estate.
Les Kotzer, a lawyer, inheritance expert (he offers free will reviews) and purveyor of cautionary tales ( Where There's An Inheritance is his most recent book), suggests, rather poetically, "A will is a living, breathing document." Over time, a will is as much about life as death. The passing of property, goods and memories to later generations is a form of continuity.
Beautiful and/or terrifying, the Last Will and Testament can also be a "ticking time bomb" (a Les Kotzer catchphrase). In order to craft a will that does not create problems, there are a few common issues that are easily solved on paper, if not in real life.
"It is daunting," Ms. Blacklock says. "Take it one step at a time, and do it in bite-sized pieces," she advises.
For new parents feeling overwhelmed by information, decisions and all of modern life's hazards, consider this: When it's done, it's one less thing to worry about.
FOUR COMMON TROUBLE SPOTS
The outdated will
It is crucial to update a will to include new additions to the family; don't let your will go the way of the third child's baby book.
Social media condition us to update our statuses at every turn, but when it comes to keeping the Last Will and Testament current, it can be decades between amendments. An outdated will is nothing but trouble; if new children, a change in marital status or major purchases go undocumented, the implications can play out in court.
For example, "separation means marriage in will terms," Mr. Kotzer warns. If your will doesn't reflect your current circumstances, it opens the door for potential dispute among all involved, including those who have left the family.
Guardianship and in-laws
For new parents, guardianship can be a difficult issue. Blood relatives are often a first choice, but Mr. Kotzer points out that if a brother or sister and spouse are appointed, a marriage dissolution may result in "their custody battle over your child(ren)."
For Ms. McIntosh, the question of guardianship went hand in hand with ensuring that her son's caregivers receive financial support. She and her husband chose guardians and named them as beneficiaries in a new life insurance policy. But with this came uncertainty about the legal ramifications: "I wasn't sure what we needed, we just knew we needed something. At least we're covered until we have time to do something else," Ms. McIntosh says.
So, is she covered? Not really. Life insurance has no legal bearing on guardianship, so the will is an essential piece of the puzzle when planning your child's care. "The important thing is for parents to step back and look at what they want to achieve with regards to the care and raising of their children. Keep this separate from the issue of financial security. The law keeps these two aspects of estate planning separate," Ms. Blacklock states.
Confusion about the goods
The idea that a will is a comprehensive itemized list of one's complete personal inventory is a "common misconception," Mr. Kotzer says. In addition, "equal is not to be confused with fair," he warns. Splitting strictly according to dollar value can leave one family member feeling shortchanged on sentimental value.
"Every word means something," Mr. Kotzer says, but often, that something is open to interpretation. Vague phrasing such as the words "antiques," "memorabilia" and "personal monies" plagues estate distribution. When it comes to wills, clarity is a fine balance between specificity and generality. As an example, Mr. Kotzer suggests that a phrase such as "remainder of the estate" works well to both simplify and summarize assets in a broad stroke.
What of one's digital footprint? It is increasingly important to leave instructions regarding personal electronics, data and account access details, including computer passwords and account logins. Consider photographs - many new parents have volumes of images stored exclusively on their computers. This is the case for Ms. McIntosh, who notes, "Our entire photographic archive is digital. I would want Parker's guardians to have access to these digital memories."
Alternative wills
A handwritten will might appeal to those who shop local, eat farm-to-table and generally opt for alternative ways of doing things - what could be more DIY than putting pen to paper? This is called a holographic will and is not for the sloppy of penmanship.
DIY might be desirable for indie rock and wedding themes, but what may seem simplest (and cheapest) may not necessarily be best. There are a wide variety of will kits for sale, mostly online, but taking it into your own hands can lead to fists. For example, your will kit may not be written for Ontario or B.C. law (wills are a provincial matter); your will kit may not be properly notarized, and in your customization you may omit key clauses related to the issues above.
Hollywood might favour the video will for instant comedy gold (see: Brewster's Millions ), but across Canada, video wills are technically invalid.
If you get it right, some alternative types of wills can be just as legally binding as the one made by a lawyer, but remember, a simple mistake could leave the wrong legacy.
According to Ms. Blacklock, it's all in the details: "Most estate planning mistakes are not of a grandiose nature," she says. "Mistakes are usually about the little things."

Canadians big buyers of U.S. real estate

Author: Waldie, Paul

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/canadians-big-buyers-u-s-real-estate/docview/1019872040/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "The average price paid by an international buyer was $400,000 compared to the overall U.S. average of $212,000," the survey said. "The international client is typically wealthier than the domestic buyer and is looking for a property in a specialized niche, for example, a larger property suitable for multigenerational living, or a property that establishes the individual's presence and standing in the community."

Full text: Account for 24 per cent of international sales
Canadians are playing a larger role in the U.S. housing market than in any year since 2007 and they outpace buyers from China and Mexico by far, according to a new survey of American real estate brokers.
The survey by the Washington-based National Association of Realtors (NAR) said foreigners snapped up $82.5-billion (U.S.) worth of houses in the 12-month period ending March 31. That compared with $66.4-billion a year earlier.
Canadians made up the largest share of purchasers, accounting for 24 per cent of all international sales. That compared with 23 per cent in 2011 and 11 per cent in 2007.
Chinese buyers made up the next largest segment at 11 per cent, followed by Mexicans at 8 per cent.
While sales to foreigners make up only about 10 per cent of all U.S. home sales, they are among the fastest-growing segments of the market. International sales climbed 24 per cent last year, according to the survey.
People from Canada and elsewhere are being lured by rock-bottom prices, a massive supply of foreclosed properties and record-low interest rates.
"Today's advantageous market conditions have drawn more and more foreign buyers to the U.S. in recent years, signalling how desirable and profitable owning property in this country can be," said NAR president Moe Veissi, who is also a real estate agent in Miami.
"I do a huge volume, all to Canadians," said Diane Olson, a former Winnipegger who now sells real estate in the Phoenix area under United Brokers Group. She and other real estate agents make regular trips to Canada and speak at seminars on how to buy property in the United States.
"I just got back from speaking to probably 1,500 Canadians this last week and about 1,700 a couple of weeks ago," Ms. Olson said. "And I'll tell you it's extremely powerful going up there and listening to these people and what they are looking to do."
She added that about half of her Canadian customers are looking for a second home or vacation property while the other half are interested in investment purchases. Her typical customer is 51, she added.
Foreign buyers tend to pay in cash and buy more expensive properties, the NAR survey found. The median purchase price for an existing home sold to a foreigner was $252,000 last year, up from $200,000 in 2010.
In comparison, the median home price for all existing home sales in the United States was $165,000 last year, compared with $170,000 a year earlier.
"The average price paid by an international buyer was $400,000 compared to the overall U.S. average of $212,000," the survey said. "The international client is typically wealthier than the domestic buyer and is looking for a property in a specialized niche, for example, a larger property suitable for multigenerational living, or a property that establishes the individual's presence and standing in the community."
Foreign buying is largely concentrated in Arizona, Florida, California and Texas. "Florida has been the fastest growing destination of choice, accounting for 26 per cent of foreign purchases," the survey said.
The push by Canadians and others is being felt in many local markets. House prices in Phoenix, one of the markets hardest hit by the recession, have climbed about 25 per cent in the last year. Miami and Southern California are also seeing a strong rebound in prices and fewer foreclosures.

Ossington Village is home to an increasing number of attractions that are gaining rave reviews, such as Enoteca Sociale, Delux and Brockton General.
But an unlikely event venue gaining traction at the up-and-coming community is the sales centre of a new boutique condominium, which hosted a preview party with a pop-up concert by local indie band Eight and a Half, formed by Justin Peroff of Broken Social Scene, along with Dave Hamelin and Liam O'Neil of The Stills.
"We spend all this time, effort, energy and money to create these fantastic spaces to sell from, so it's nice to be able to use them for alternative uses that is a little more out of the box, creative and engages people outside the simple sales process," says Reserve Properties vice-president Shane Fenton, who also threw fashion shows and speakers series at a midtown sales centre.
"We're trying to cater towards people who are looking for great experiences."
This six-storey mid-rise, due to replace a former auto repair shop on Ossington Avenue, just north of Queen Street West, will be steps away from access to galleries, fashion boutiques, cafes, bars and restaurants.
"Ossington is a street that's really taken off and transformed over the last five years and it's not a street that's seen tremendous condo development," says Mr. Fenton. "So it's rare where you get a parcel like this on such a great commercial strip where it's not going to be surrounded by other large condo projects."

LISTING AGENT
Ed Allan, Royal LePage West Realty Group Ltd.
The Action: Because of the enduring popularity of the Queensway community, many properties sell swiftly in fierce bidding wars. A dearth of homes on the market make this especially so. Offers were held back on this brick bungalow while it was given six days of exposure, drawing over 200 visitors. The sellers then chose from among 12 offers, with the winning offer going $91,100 over asking.
What They Got: On a quiet, tree-lined street, the over 60-year-old bungalow was outfitted with new roofing and five appliances in the last three years, while its heating and cooling systems were replaced over a decade ago.
* Original charm ranges from hardwood floors beneath broadloom in the two bedrooms, living and dining rooms to a brick fireplace in the lower level recreation room by the guest bedroom and second bathroom.
* Off the kitchen, there is a covered deck, patio, indoor and outdoor parking.
The Agent's Take: "It's a great area because it's in the Queensway close to ... TTC and Mimico GO stations and the QEW that will all take you to the downtown core, and it's ten minutes to Pearson airport and Billy Bishop airport," agent Ed Allan said.
"And it's part of the Queensway theatre district and there are two local No Frills grocery stores, good shopping and excellent schools."

A darling of Hollywood North faces a crossroads

Author: Lederman, Marsha

Abstract: "I think it's quite good," B.C. Film Commissioner Susan Croome says. "We lost three, but we gained four. We're net up one ... so we're holding our own."

Full text: Once upon a time, the land of Hollywood North was in despair, fighting the evils - a high dollar! tax issues! - of the local production industry.
At Vancouver Film Studios, last January was especially dire: Only three of their 10 stages were occupied, largely owing to the cancellation of the Syfy series Eureka last year.
Then Prince Charming appeared in the form of pilot season. Nine pilots rode into town, eight of which went to camera - including Beauty and the Beast , which requested VFS's last two available stages, and even took over the administration's desks to accommodate production.
But, alas, a fairy-tale ending was not to be.
Beauty and the Beast did not get picked up. And now that both the Canadian and American networks have revealed their fall lineups, B.C.'s production industry is assessing some less than inspiring results: Of the pilots shot in Vancouver, the U.S. networks have picked up only four: Arrow ; Emily Owens, MD ; Cult and Red Widow . Meanwhile, Alcatraz , The Secret Circle and the Canadian sci-fi series Sanctuary were cancelled. Fringe was put on notice that it would just one more season on Fox.
Coupled with a disappointing number of features, none of this is what the industry needs to calm fears over its future. And with a high Canadian dollar, the imminent disappearance of the film-friendly HST, and - the real evil stepmother in this story - a lack of parity on tax credits, the B.C. production industry is now looking to protect its billion-dollar industry. One step is lobbying the province on tax credits. Another: aiming at a national film strategy.
Certainly, any talk about the film and TV industry in B.C. is bound to lead to tax credits: the provincial tax credit on foreign film production is 33 per cent on B.C. labour, compared with the far more attractive offers in Ontario and Quebec: 25 per cent of the overall spend. As a result, work has gone east.
"I think it's quite good," B.C. Film Commissioner Susan Croome says. "We lost three, but we gained four. We're net up one ... so we're holding our own."
It's not quite good enough to calm fears about B.C.'s production industry. The level of feature work is a concern, even with the big budget Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters shooting in town.
"They're shooting a feature called Pacific Rim in Ontario," says Peter Mitchell, president and chief executive officer of Vancouver Film Studios, referring to the Guillermo del Toro film shot in Toronto earlier this year. "I mean, come on."
B.C. production types like to play down the competition with Ontario, but there were quiet gasps when industry figures came out earlier this year. While 2011 saw a 16-per-cent increase for B.C., it slipped to the No. 4 ranked production centre in North America, with $1.19-billion in production compared with Ontario's $1.26-billion.
With its significant market share and locations across the country, lighting equipment giant William F. White can be seen as a barometer for Canada's production industry. And Chairman and CEO Paul Bronfman believes that the situation in Vancouver last year was even worse than the film commission's figures suggest.
"I don't know where they get their numbers," he says. "Our market share runs about 60 per cent in Vancouver - and Vancouver was way down." By about 29 per cent, he says.
"If we are on an equal playing field with Ontario in terms of tax credits, we'll kill them," Mitchell says. "I don't think we need to do that. We just need to get closer."
Peter Leitch, president at North Shore and Mammoth Studios, is working on it. As chair of the Motion Picture Production Industry Association of British Columbia, he is is in talks with the province about the tax-credit situation. And at the federal level, he is trying to raise interest in creating a national strategy on film and television production. A more level playing field would benefit B.C., but also ensure that provinces don't compete against each other so much as they compete against jurisdictions in other countries.
Vancouver lost the big feature The Wolverine to Sydney, after the Australian government offered a $12.8-million (Australian) tax incentive to the X-Men sequel. And some U.S. states are offering generous (some argue unsustainable) tax credits, including Louisiana.
New Orleans is calling itself Hollywood South these days, and has lured a couple of features that some feel belonged in B.C.: Vancouver native Seth Rogen's The End of the World , currently shooting in New Orleans, and 21 Jump Street , based on the Vancouver-shot TV series.
Moreso than Ontario, B.C. is heavily invested in the so-called service industry - with foreign productions accounting for about 80 per cent of the business traditionally, and domestic productions only 20 per cent. Leitch says that has probably fallen to 15 per cent.
Canadian announcements did confirm new B.C.-shot series Motive and Package Deal, which join locally shot Canadian productions such as Arctic Air , Continuum , Mr. Young and Primeval-New World, as well as high-profile reality series such as Real Housewives of Vancouver and The Bachelor Canada.
The industry wants to see more of the higher-budgeted scripted series. The B.C. Producers' Branch of the Canadian Media Production Association is part of a coalition calling for the creation of a B.C. Media Development Corporation, similar to Ontario's, to help boost Canadian productions.
The digital-animation and visual-effects sector meanwhile, has seen substantial growth. Major players such as Pixar, Sony Pictures Imageworks and George Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic have set up shop in Vancouver. And local companies are growing to accommodate the demand.
"This is now a destination for Hollywood," says Jason Dowdeswell with Image Engine, a Vancouver company that established itself with its Oscar-nominated work on Neill Blomkamp's District 9 . "We have what I call the three Ts: the tax credit, the talent and the time zone."
The 17.5-per-cent Digital Animation and Visual Effects (DAVE) tax credit has helped to boost the industry to the point where there are almost 20 major visual-effects houses operating in Vancouver.
While both Leitch and Mitchell warn that their studios are owned by real-estate developers, who could decide that townhouses would be more economically viable than television, the players seems to be betting on a future for this industry, with continued investment in infrastructure.
VFS is building two more stages. Across the bridge, North Vancouver's Capilano University recently opened the Nat and Flora Bosa Centre for Film and Animation, funded in large part by the Bosas, who own North Shore and Mammoth. The $40-million, 6,662-square-metre state-of-the-art facility serves as a gleaming commitment to the future of film in this part of the world: a sort of castle, counting on a happily ever after.

Full text: Cash-strapped governments face a difficult juggling act: offering incentives to attract and retain big employers without blowing a bigger hole in their budgets
AUTO INDUSTRY REPORTER
When Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty goes a-courtin' auto makers for new investment, he needs to remember to bring flowers.
The flowers won't cause executives to swoon in his arms, but it's the thought that counts - as Tennessee discovered in 2005 when "Rita" was part of the pitch the state made to land the North American headquarters of Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.
"Rita" was a new strain of African violet. Matt Kisber, Tennessee's Commissioner of Economic and Community Development, convinced a local grower to name it after Rita Ghosn, the wife of Nissan chief executive officer Carlos Ghosn and an avid botanist.
When state officials made their pitch to Nissan, then-governor Phil Bredesen hosted a dinner party for the Ghosns at which vases of "Ritas" sat on every table, and presented her with the flower in a mahogany box with an engraved brass plate.
Mr. Bredesen is quick to say that Mr. Ghosn and Nissan chose Tennessee for reasons other than the gift given to his wife. But it surely didn't hurt.
"I think they say, 'Look, they're being creative, they're thinking about going beyond the usual kinds of things and maybe if they're that creative in this, they'll be creative when we've got problems and we need some help,'" he said in an interview.
As the decline in Canada's competitiveness erodes the country's status as an auto-making power, creativity will be essential for Mr. McGuinty and the federal government in fielding new requests for financial support from the Detroit Three car companies.
For these governments, the challenge of attracting auto makers goes beyond contending with a currency that's near parity with the U.S. dollar.
They face the increasing aggressiveness of Tennessee, Alabama and other U.S. states and Mexico, which are throwing incentives worth hundreds of millions of dollars at auto makers to finance training, infrastructure and real estate purchases and provide tax holidays to land the thousands of jobs created by assembly plants.
While those jurisdictions chase auto makers, austerity is the order of the day at both the federal and Ontario levels. That leads to a critical question: Does it make sense for cash-strapped governments that are cutting thousands of jobs and freezing the salaries of doctors to provide subsidies to profitable businesses?
That issue is on the table now as Ontario and Ottawa evaluate a request by Ford Motor Co. for financial help to retool its Oakville, Ont., plant to allow it to build vehicles on a global platform or basic vehicle underbody. It would assemble the next generation of the Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX crossovers, with production scheduled to begin in 2014.
Based on what is becoming the industry standard of 30 per cent government support for such a project - with each of the two levels contributing 15 per cent - Ford's request for the $1.2-billion Oakville project is in the range of $400-million.
Ford will not discuss its negotiations with the governments. But sources familiar with its proposal noted that a global platform would represent a strong underpinning for the future of Oakville and 2,800 jobs, and potentially provide new export opportunities beyond the U.S. market, which is the destination for about 80 per cent of the four models made at the plant now.
Ontario needs to be well positioned to take advantage of new export markets, the sources said.
The federal and Ontario contributions to the bailout of Chrysler Group LLC and General Motors Co. - and whether they should continue to offer subsidies to the industry - are still the subject of debate.
The argument that subsidies to auto makers mean fewer dollars going to tax cuts or health care makes little sense to David Wolfe, a University of Toronto professor of economics and public policy.
"Investment in economic development that is going to generate jobs and tax revenue can't be looked at in the same way as paying for another MRI or another hip replacement," Prof. Wolfe said.
For Leslie Shiell, however, a University of Ottawa economics professor and co-author of a recent report on the topic of auto subsidies for the Institute for Research on Public Policy, subsidies should be a last resort and a response if companies hold a gun to governments' heads and threaten to move elsewhere.
One way to think of subsidies in a different way, Prof. Shiell argued, is that they shield workers at the Detroit Three plants from wage cuts.
"In effect what we're being asked as taxpayers is to subsidize the automotive sector so that these workers don't have to adjust down to what's a more realistic or more competitive level of pay," he said. "And that's not the best economics."
One positive result of the retooling of existing plants is that such investments are all but guaranteed to improve productivity and competitiveness generally because of innovation and other advances in manufacturing. In the Oakville case, for example, the factory was revamped in 2004-06 to make it a flexible plant that is able to produce several different models off more than one platform.
Since then, the robots used in vehicle assembly - to cite one example of how innovation is revolutionizing manufacturing - have become much more capable.
"The robots are stronger, the robots are faster, the robots are more accurate, the robots are also more efficient, not only with respect to energy, but with respect to space," said Peter Fitzgerald, general manager of Fanuc Robotics Canada Ltd., the Canadian subsidiary of Japan-based Fanuc Corp., which supplies robots to most of the major auto makers.
Tennessee's experience in winning the Nissan headquarters came into play three years later with an even bigger prize when Volkswagen AG returned to vehicle assembly in the United States and chose Chattanooga as the site for an assembly plant, which is already expanding one year after production began.
Mr. Bredesen calls such investments anchors that attract other development.
"When Volkswagen decided to come here, there was a lot of public who looked up and said: 'Whoa, that's a smart company. Something's going on in Tennessee. Maybe we ought to put them on our radar screen,' " he said.
*****
HOW TENNESSEE WON
It took a $578-million (U.S.) incentive package for Tennessee to win the Volkswagen AG assembly plant sweepstakes. It ended up in Chattanooga, giving a huge boost to "Detroit South."
"We routinely considered the U.S. South to be our only real competition," said one source familiar with the unsuccessful bid that the Ontario and federal governments made to land Volkswagen.
To aid in the Canadian bid, this source and others said, Ontario officials mentioned quietly to Volkswagen executives that they might regret building their only U.S. assembly plant in so-called Tornado Alley.
Tennessee's incentives for the German auto maker included training money, construction of a training facility, tax rebates and infrastructure improvements. The state is not permitted to write cheques to companies, noted Phil Bredesen, who was governor at the time.

Here's what one banker is telling international investors about the Toronto market

Author: Ireland, Carolyn

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/heres-what-one-banker-is-telling-international/docview/1017987300/se-2?accountid=14656

I can't imagine what it's like to be a Bank of Nova Scotia economist facing a room full of foreign real estate mavens.
Investors around the globe are fascinated by Canada's housing market. When Scotiabank vice-president Derek Holt did the rounds of U.S. cities last week to present Canadian Housing in a Macro Context , he must have been besieged.
Canada's housing market is stretched but there are lots of mitigating factors that should quell some of the anxiety floating around, according to Mr. Holt, who narrows in on "Why it's Different from the United States".
Interest rates in Canada will stay low a while yet according to Mr. Holt and Dov Zigler and Adrienne Warren, who put together some of the forecasts for the road trip. They add that inflation won't challenge Bank of Canada targets while growth in wages remains weak.
Household debt growth is already cooling, they add, and the central bank shouldn't push that too far. For one thing, other factors - including the strong Canadian dollar, real wages and regulatory tightening - are already doing the work of the Bank of Canada.
Still, the economists point out some of their worries: Canada's record-high rate of home ownership has surpassed the rate in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, Canada has overshot the United States on average house prices, and the ratio of insured mortgages to uninsured has swelled.
Confidence should be bolstered by the fact that the sellers' market of the past few years is returning to a better balance between buyers and sellers. There's no evidence of too much building in the single-family house market, they add, and the rules surrounding long mortgage amortization periods and paltry down payments have already been strengthened.
As for the number of cranes filling the sky in cities such as Toronto, Montreal and Calgary, there are plenty of things driving the demand for high-rise condominium units, say the economists. They point to the fact that condos are more affordable and provide more to choose from than single-family houses. People are moving here from overseas and those who already live here are changing their lifestyles. There's a trend to urban intensification, vacancies for rental units are tight, and investors are still keen to own condos.
But the economists do note some "pockets of concern": Vancouver has seen a jump in the inventory of unsold condos compared with the long-term average, while Calgary's condo market is not lean either. Toronto's condo boom masks the shrinking amount of building in the market for detached and semi-detached houses, they add.
As for why Canada is different from the United States, the economists look at stronger household finances on this side of the border. Canadians have more home equity and more real estate assets.
Meanwhile, the country's diversified economy means that economic shocks - when they do hit - never hit all of the local housing markets in various cities in the same way.
Canada's banks are strongly capitalized and there is far less shadow banking than in the United States. That revolving-door-financing so popular south of the border is not prevalent here.
Canadians don't default when house prices correct: In Toronto and Vancouver since the late 1980s, mortgage arrears have barely budged even when prices dropped.
The chart showing average existing home prices as a multiple of income per capita is particularly striking: While the line plotting the U.S. numbers turned downwards back in 2006 or so, the Canadian trajectory has been mostly upwards since 2001.

New homes - and new ideas - for old streets

Abstract: Then there's the middle bedroom, almost as dark as any similar place in a Victorian Gothic semi, despite a little notch-like opening that, in fact, admits so little light one wonders why the window is there at all. It's always hard to get natural light into a room at the centre of a house, of course, but trying to solve this old problem here would have been worth the architects' effort.

Full text: When aging structures just won't do, Kyra Clarkson and Christopher Glaisek hope a more modern look will catch a buyer's eyes
jmays@globeandmail.com
While prices for detached homes in Toronto's working-class Victorian and Edwardian neighbourhoods continue to climb toward (and exceed) the million-dollar mark, many of the much-desired houses themselves are past their structural prime, and nearing the ends of their natural lifespans.
Renovation can add years to the useful career of an old house. But all elderly dwellings can't be effectively or economically overhauled. And even after extensive surgery, a lot of them are still too small for the relaxed lifestyles of singles and families nowadays. For at least some of these home buyers - especially those allergic to suburbia and committed to living in single-family digs on shady old streets not far from the downtown towers - the best solution may involve a tear-down and the raising of fresh, modern infill housing on the site.
In the belief that more and more house-hunting Torontonians will be resorting to this strategy, architects Kyra Clarkson and Christopher Glaisek, partners in life and art since their graduate-school days at Yale, have fashioned a new infill house near the intersection of Coxwell Avenue and Dundas Street East that they hope will be the first in a series of similar dwellings. (For the record, Mr. Glaisek is vice-president of planning and design at Waterfront Toronto, the public agency overseeing the development of the city's harbourside brownfields.)
Called MODERNest House 1, and set to go on the market for upward of $800,000, the detached two-storey building stands alongside a street lined with century-old cottages and bungalows, none of which it faintly resembles. Ms. Clarkson and Mr. Glaisek could have opted, of course, to give their project a pseudo-historical face of some kind - a bad architectural move, in my view. Instead, they have let their work, inside and outside, appear to be exactly what it is: a very plain, efficient house that is purely and simply modernist.
So far, so good. But because this residence is meant to be a pilot project for a line of modernist downtown homes, it's worth asking what, if anything, MODERNest is adding to the conversation about modern living.
The basic interior layout, for instance, is entirely routine, and not very different from the result you'd get after most any modernizing renovation. (With one exception: There is a single washroom on the bedroom level for everyone, and none on the ground floor. Individual bathrooms, powder rooms at entrances and such have proliferated in houses built recently, and it's unusual to find a new family residence with just one where everybody sleeps.) The open-plan main level features a dining area near the front window, a kitchen in the middle, and a living-room zone at the rear, overlooking the ample back garden and the foot of an enormous ash tree. The three bedrooms are on the second level, up the glass-sided, open-tread staircase.
But if this general scheme is completely familiar, the refinements Ms. Clarkson and Mr. Glaisek have introduced into their design go part of the way - though not the whole distance - toward rescuing MODERNest from being just another humdrum modernist house.
Take, for example, the attention paid to making sure most of the interior is brightened by natural light. A wide window at the front of the main floor opens toward the parking pad and the street beyond. The living-room area is bountifully lit by nine-foot glass doors that give on to a deck running the nearly 15-foot width of the house. At the top of the staircase, in the middle of the upper storey, is a fine skylight that spares the bedroom corridor from gloom. All these moves are good.
But then there's the middle bedroom, almost as dark as any similar place in a Victorian Gothic semi, despite a little notch-like opening that, in fact, admits so little light one wonders why the window is there at all. It's always hard to get natural light into a room at the centre of a house, of course, but trying to solve this old problem here would have been worth the architects' effort. By not tackling it, the designers have simply reproduced, in a modernist idiom, a bothersome condition common in conventional Toronto houses that are, like this one, packed tightly within the city's residential fabric.
In launching this initiative, Ms. Clarkson and Mr. Glaisek are responding to what they believe to be a real phenomenon in the local real-estate market: the desire of home buyers to move into well-designed detached downtown houses that don't require massive, expensive renovation. Future dwellings in the MODERNest series may go beyond the ordinary. This one doesn't.

Kicking the bucket: They used to be KFCs, and they can't hide it

Abstract: [Scott]'s and Priszm used to be part of Scott's Hospitality, founded by the late entrepreneur George Gardiner, which opened its first "Scott's Chicken Villa" under the KFC banner in 1962 and owned hotels, Black's photo shops, the Manchu Wok fast-food chain and 6,000 school buses before being dismantled in the 1990s. Entrepreneur John Bitove bought the KFC operation in 1999 and split the restaurant and real estate assets into separate businesses.

Full text: When the Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet closed in Ottawa's Hintonburg neighbourhood last May, community members held a mock wake at a tavern next door. One resident wore a chicken mask; others read poems about the departed. The event turned serious when a church leader reminded the flock that KFC had been an affordable dining option for the poor before the area gentrified.
One year later, local burger joint Hintonburger has moved into the old KFC outlet and business is booming. Customers now pay $7 for a hand-made burger instead of KFC's "Toonie Tuesday" specials but "this is definitely an improvement and great news for the neighbourhood," said Jeff Leiper, the wake's organizer.
It's a similar story at Mia's Indian Cuisine, which opened earlier this month to brisk business at another former KFC outlet in Ottawa's west end. The exterior bucket sign is gone, the interior is completely renovated, and the aromas of bhaji and tandoori have replaced the smell of deep-fried poultry.
"We made it 10 times better," said Mostofa Mia, one of four children of restaurant owner Samsu Mia.
Across Canada, a host of restaurateurs are proving there's life after the local KFC kicks the bucket.
In March, 2011, Priszm Income Fund, the largest Canadian franchisee of the U.S. fast-food chain, filed for bankruptcy protection. About 15 per cent of Priszm's 428 KFC outlets have since been abandoned.
Priszm's largest landlord, Scott's Real Estate Investment Trust, with 188 KFCs, was stuck with 44 disclaimed KFC leases as the receiver sold off the fast-food operator's assets. But 14 months later, Scott's has leased 34 of those outlets to new tenants.
The new tenants range from large U.S. chains to single-location eateries. It expects to fill the rest within a year.
"We're ahead of plan," said Scott's chief operating officer Kevin Salsberg.
The reclaimed outlets are in good locations and have taken on average four months to be renovated and re-leased, faster than expected. The changeovers have cost Scott's a 5- to 10-per-cent hit on rents, but "we're thrilled with the results," he said. "We've done a good job keeping occupancy high and backfilling with excellent tenants."
Priszm's wind-up has also removed uncertainty hanging over Scott's, whose stock has mostly recovered after falling by 39 per cent in 2011.
Scott's and Priszm used to be part of Scott's Hospitality, founded by the late entrepreneur George Gardiner, which opened its first "Scott's Chicken Villa" under the KFC banner in 1962 and owned hotels, Black's photo shops, the Manchu Wok fast-food chain and 6,000 school buses before being dismantled in the 1990s. Entrepreneur John Bitove bought the KFC operation in 1999 and split the restaurant and real estate assets into separate businesses.
While Priszm endured years of disputes with KFC owner Yum Brands Inc. and was squeezed by costly renovations demanded by the franchisor, Scott's bought new retail buildings and diversified its tenant base.
Shoppers Drug Mart now leases 32 per cent of its space, and the variety has increased as new restaurants have leased the disclaimed KFC outlets. Dixie Lee Chicken has taken 11 of the outlets while other KFC franchisees have signed up for five. Pizza Pizza, Starbucks, Subway and A & W have taken locations, along with the independents such as Burger Palace in Olds, Alta., Boss Hog's Smokin' Chophouse in London, Ont., and China Factory in Windsor, N.S.
Some are completely changing the real estate while others are keeping some of the vintage look. In Carleton Place, Ont., Dixie Lee removed the signature KFC parapet but kept the red-and-white awning.
As for Hintonburger, it has drawn some double-takes by passersby since it moved into the former KFC outlet in January, from a tiny nearby shack it had outgrown. The owners spent $100,000 on interior renovations, removing the takeout counter and adding a dining area and bathroom. At first they left the exterior almost untouched, with its weather-beaten cedar shingles and white gable. Now they are planning to change the roof and install a new sign. While some residents are sentimental about the old KFC bucket, its days are numbered.
"I'd like to get rid of that for sure," said Hintonburger co-owner Thomas Williams "We still get customers confusing us with a KFC. Some people are disappointed. They're looking for a nine-piece bucket."

Full text: LAW REPORTER
Before his business crumbled amid allegations of fraud, Ontario entrepreneur Derek Elliott ran a luxurious but money-losing resort in the Dominican Republic that once hosted Hollywood celebrities and a Maxim magazine beauty pageant.
Now, he faces a complaint from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that he and a former U.S. business associate, James Catledge, were behind an "international fraudulent scheme."
The SEC alleges that the pair sold timeshares and ownership interests in Mr. Elliott's resorts and took in more than $163-million (U.S.) from about 1,200 investors, who were "falsely" promised attractive guaranteed returns. The allegations have not been proven in court.
Mr. Elliott, 41, of Hillsburgh, Ont., northwest of Toronto, ran the Sun Village Resort & Spa near Puerto Plata until 2009. That's when local banks foreclosed on the property after a lawsuit filed by investors in Florida alleged that he and his father, Fred, had blown investor cash on private luxuries like a small plane and gambling expenses. They denied those allegations, and the case against them got bogged down in legal wrangling before being dismissed.
The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Nevada on May 24, contains similar allegations about the way timeshares and ownership interests were sold to investors by Derek Elliott and Mr. Catledge, who is based near San Diego and was the head of various "multilevel marketing" companies.
In a "road show" put on for investors called "Real Estate Secrets of the Wealthy," the SEC complaint alleges, the pair falsely guaranteed quarterly payments of 8 to 12 per cent to convince investors to invest their home equity and savings in the Sun Village resort and another hotel being remodelled near Juan Dolio.
But very little of the $163-million in investors' money ended up going into the resorts, the SEC alleges. Nearly $59-million went into "exorbitant" commissions for Mr. Elliott, Mr. Catledge and their related companies, the SEC alleges.
Investor funds for the Juan Dolio hotel were used to pay returns to previous investors in the Sun Village, the SEC alleges: "Consequently, the Elliott resorts operated as a Ponzi scheme."
Mr. Elliott, who has since launched a new luxury vacation rental website called Preferred Escapes, said he had not heard about the SEC allegations when contacted by The Globe and Mail.
"I'm not aware of it, and I can't really give you a comment," he said.

Full text: Canada is an aging nation, but not all areas of Canada can be painted by the same demographic brush. The nation is too vast and varied and, as such, population problems tend to be regionalized rather than national. Thus, an examination of two communities facing very real, and very different, challenges
Bridgetown's biggest employer these days is the seniors home - and that, in a nutshell, tells the story of what is happening in rural Nova Scotia.
The province is aging, more so than the rest of Canada. And it is small towns such as Bridgetown, nestled in the lush Annapolis Valley, that are trying to deal with this new demographic reality - an elderly and declining population - as industry leaves rural Nova Scotia, with young people not far behind.
Over the 10 years leading to the 2006 census, the median age in Nova Scotia increased by six years, compared to just four years in Canada as a whole.
The province has the highest proportion of residents older than 65, at 16 per cent. By 2036, projections show somewhere between one in four and one in three residents will be of retirement age.
But, like other small towns, Bridgetown is resilient - forced to reinvent itself every few decades, or die.
In 2011, Bridgetown's population dropped to 949 residents, down from 972 in 2006. Five years before, the population topped 1,000 people.
In the 1980s, Bridgetown lost its main employer when the Acadian Distillery factory shut down, leaving between 200 and 300 people out of work. An aviation manufacturer moved in to the building - but that didn't work out. The elastics factory that had also employed more than 200 people closed its doors in 2004 - and has been idle since.
Now it's the Mountain Lea Lodge and the Adult Residential Centre that provide the most jobs - about 200.
Steve Raftery, the town's community development co-ordinator, says Bridgetown's economic strategy is "new dividends from old stock."
"We can't be working to build new buildings for every project in town when we have empty buildings," Mr. Raftery says.
The old distillery, at 58,000 square feet, which has operated as the town's development centre, was purchased last year for $25,000 by local business people.
Terry Saunders, 49, and his brother Shaun, 50, who grew up in Bridgetown and have seen most of their friends leave, have already converted about half of the space into a sports facility with a hockey rink and a soccer training area.
They hope to market it eventually as a hockey academy and are in discussions with the school board.
"You have to shoot big," Shaun says. "We have to."
*********
SHUTTERED SCHOOLS
Enrolment at the local schools in Bridgetown is a familiar story for population-challenged towns.
Enrolment is declining and communities are fighting hard to save their schools.
Last year, there were 161 children enrolled at Bridgetown Regional Elementary school; this year there are 135. The high school, which just this year became a Grade 6 to Grade 12 school, saw its enrolment increase from 379 to 414. But there is a proposal to close the elementary school after 2015 and renovate the high school to have just one location providing kindergarten to Grade 12.
In its budget this spring, the Dexter NDP government realigned funds due to declining enrolment: $13.4-million was chopped from the $1-billion education envelope.
INDUSTRY AWOL
Steve Raftery has seen no big industry move into Bridgetown since he became the community development co-ordinator seven years ago.
He is frustrated, too, by recent cuts to the regional development body, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, which removes a layer of potential support for the small town.
Unemployment in Nova Scotia is around 9 per cent, higher than the national average and three points above that of Halifax.
Premier Darrell Dexter's government has been wrestling with this, announcing a controversial plan in its March Throne Speech that would see nearly 100 provincial government jobs move from Halifax to rural areas.
The jobs are not going to the Annapolis Valley, but to other parts of the province.
KEEP JOBS, KEEP PEOPLE
A big challenge for rural Nova Scotia is retaining its population and attracting new people - and as industry goes, so goes the labour force.
Projections are that within a couple years, Halifax will employ half the province's work force.
"We have to fight hard to keep what we have," says Steve Raftery, Bridgetown community development co-ordinator, noting there is a new movement of "townsizing" - some younger and middle-aged people are looking to get out of the city but still live in an "intact community."
There are about 30 homes for sale in and around the town. Real-estate agent Bruce Hutchinson says this is fairly typical. However, he adds, "We seem to see more forced sales and prices below assessed value in recent years."

Abstract: "Transit is extremely important to us and we feel it's also important to the proper development of the city," said David Gerofsky of Great Gulf, which is building the Monde Condominium complex at Queens Quay and Sherbourne Street. "Our residents are looking for sustainable development, they're looking for alternatives to the car and they're looking for connections to Union Station."

Full text: There's a new streetcar line under construction in Toronto, the first in more than a decade and a surprising development during the tenure of a mayor who is outspokenly opposed to light rail.
The tracks are being laid this year along the northern portion of Cherry Street, where they will operate in a dedicated right of way. When it enters service after 2015, this small stretch will provide transit to new West Don Lands neighbourhood and the Distillery District.
The project is under the aegis of Waterfront Toronto, the tri-government agency charged with redeveloping the lakeshore, and is separate from the $8.4-billion scheme to build light rail lines in the suburbs. As such, it avoided the messy battles at city hall that pitted LRT proponents against the anti-streetcar administration of Mayor Rob Ford.
However, the preoccupation with bringing transit to the outer reaches of the city has meant that little attention has been paid or funding committed to servicing the new developments rapidly sprouting up in the eastern waterfront.
Waterfront Toronto's plan calls for the Cherry Street line to eventually extend south of the Gardiner Expressway into the Port Lands and an LRT to run from Union Station down Queens Quay east of Bay Street.
But there is no money to pay for the majority of this proposal and Metrolinx, the provincial agency overseeing the suburban light rail projects, is keeping its distance.
The full Queens Quay East line would cost roughly $300-million to build, said Waterfront Toronto CEO John Campbell. His agency has only $90-million for the project.
"Our mandate is not just to develop real estate, it is to revitalize the waterfront, to build the city, to curb sprawl," he said. "To do all of that, you need transit."
One major hurdle is the tunnel to Union Station. The loop doesn't have the capacity to accommodate the number of light rail vehicles needed to service the new line. There's also a sewer at Queens Quay and Bay Street that will make it hard to build an eastern portal to bring the tracks to the surface.
Waterfront Toronto has hired HDR, an international consulting firm, to study interim solutions - such as building a dedicated corridor for buses - that would plug the gap for a decade or more, until the full line can be built.
The fate of southern Cherry Street, meanwhile, is up in the air: after Mr. Ford's brother tried to take control of the Port Lands away from Waterfront Toronto last fall, city staff were tasked with finding ways to speed development in the area. Their report, which has been delayed until the fall, could rewrite the current plans.
A solution of some kind will certainly be needed. George Brown College's waterfront campus is set to open this fall; several apartment and condominium complexes on Queens Quay East and in the West Don Lands will follow over the next few years. When all is said and done, there will be roughly 20,000 residential units in the area, plus 8,000 jobs and 3,500 students.
It all makes the suburban-centric bent of light rail discussions somewhat absurd, argues transit activist Steve Munro.
"The focus of all the transit debate has missed the largest development that's happening on our doorstep. I can see these buildings, but there's nothing going to them," he said. "Everyone seems to be looking the other way and they completely missed the waterfront."
The promise of new streetcar lines was also part of what enticed developers in the first place.
"Transit is extremely important to us and we feel it's also important to the proper development of the city," said David Gerofsky of Great Gulf, which is building the Monde Condominium complex at Queens Quay and Sherbourne Street. "Our residents are looking for sustainable development, they're looking for alternatives to the car and they're looking for connections to Union Station."
But they can't look to Metrolinx for those streetcars. The agency's job is to plan and fund regional transit, and it considers the project a local concern for the city and the TTC, spokesman Malon Edwards wrote in an e-mail.
So, for the time being, the eastern waterfront will have to make do with buses - and a few blocks of track on Cherry Street.
*****
QUEENS QUAY OVERHAUL
Noticed the stacks of streetcar rails on Queens Quay?
They are a sign of another Waterfront Toronto project that starts this summer: The renovation of the lakefront thoroughfare from Bay Street to Spadina Avenue.
When construction is finished in late 2014, car traffic will be reduced to two lanes - one in each direction - on the north side of the street. South of this will be the streetcar right of way, then the waterfront trail and a granite pedestrian walkway with a row of trees. The north sidewalk will also be widened.
Harbourfront streetcars will be replaced by buses until spring of next year while the tracks are re-aligned, said TTC spokesman Brad Ross.
The Spadina streetcar, meanwhile, will be shut down intermittently from June to November while the TTC rebuilds track at several intersections and expands platforms to handle the new, longer streetcars entering service in 2014.
Buses will run the 510's route during every closure.

Abstract: Like many local residents, these ones stayed for over three decades to raise a family. "That house is over 2,000 square feet, so it's not like you need more space," says Ms. [Linda Ing-Gilbert]. "You're walking distance to all levels of schools and you have parks and beach just down the street."

The Action: Earlier this spring, this renovated family home near Greenwood Park was decluttered and repainted before welcoming over 100 open house visitors and another 50 shoppers with private appointments.
Half a dozen came back with offers, including one proposal of $751,177, which set a benchmark for the street where another property lingered on the market.
What They Got: In 1981, a 1930s bungalow on this 25-by-117-foot lot was topped up to create a 2,500 square-foot space, complete with three bedrooms upstairs, each with cathedral ceiling and a master retreat with the added luxury of a walk-in closet and access to one of three bathrooms.
The Agent's Take: "This was a solid, detached home and it had a great workshop at the back," says agent Linda Ing-Gilbert. "It's rare for this kind of house to be that well maintained."
Like many local residents, these ones stayed for over three decades to raise a family. "That house is over 2,000 square feet, so it's not like you need more space," says Ms. Ing-Gilbert. "You're walking distance to all levels of schools and you have parks and beach just down the street."

Full text: Vancouver developer Ian Gillespie is bringing architecture's rising star - Denmark's Bjarke Ingels - to Don Mills
jmays@globeandmail.com
As contemporary architects go, Frank Gehry is certainly more venerable than Danish designer Bjarke Ingels. Daniel Libeskind is more controversial, and Peter Zumthor more esoteric. But these days, nobody can rock the world of architecture quite like Mr. Ingels, 37.
When he appeared in Vancouver recently to unveil his first Canadian project - a dramatically twisting 49-storey residential tower complex, called Beach and Howe, to be dropped among the ramps and traffic decks of the Granville Street Bridge - Mr. Ingels drew a capacity crowd of 1,300 politicians, architects, students, reporters from around the world and citizens without portfolio, and, according to an eyewitness, left them cheering.
So why is Vancouver wild about Bjarke Ingels? To find out, I talked with the architect's most ardent local fan: real-estate developer Ian Gillespie, founder and president of Westbank Projects Corp., the $10-billion company behind Mr. Ingels's scheme.
"In the last dozen years," Mr. Gillespie said, "you've had over a hundred high-rises built in Vancouver, and the vast majority of them have been background buildings at best. I think Vancouver is really getting tired of that. Why do all the buildings have to look like they were built in the eighties? The city is crying out for some creativity."
Mr. Gillespie's answer to that cry was his request to the young, prolific Dane - "probably the hottest architect in the world today," according to the developer - to design a tall building for a dauntingly tight site. The property Westbank had to work with, at about 100,000 square feet, was not small. But once all the restrictions were factored in - off-ramps and on-ramps serving the downtown bridge, municipally mandated setbacks, and so on - the place suitable for the foot of a tower was a triangle only around 6,000 square feet in area.
"We're trying to put a reasonable amount of density on the site," Mr. Gillespie said. "And so the idea was to slowly increase the size [of the floor plates] as the tower went up, so that by the time you get to the top, it's a 12,000-square-foot building. It rotates as it's doing that in order to create this gateway to the city." The developer likens the effect of the tower's gradually expanding gesture to "pulling open a curtain in a theatre. That's the way to imagine it." The result of various forces - the severe constraints on what could be built, and Mr. Ingels' artistic talent in dealing with a difficult assignment - "is a very beautiful object, and people have reacted to it in an emotional way."
Mr. Ingels tends to stir strong emotions. In the six years since he founded the Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) in Copenhagen, he has become sought after by public and private clients throughout Europe, in the U.S. and now Canada. (A few weeks from now, Mr. Gillespie will unwrap a BIG development that he and his business partners intend to put up in the Toronto suburb of Don Mills.) He has earned renown as a superb communicator and a strong thinker about what makes cities successful, but also as a practical architect keenly attuned to the specific problems that come with each job.
"He is one of the smartest persons I've ever met, absolutely brilliant," Mr. Gillespie remarked. "He is also a very authentic individual. There are a lot of architects out there who come up with a great, grandiose building, and then go find a site for it. That's not how Bjarke designs. The shapes of the buildings come from the constraints of the project. They're not designs looking for sites, they are designs that come out of the sites."
But while he is and probably always will be the most famous figure in his expanding office - which recently opened a branch in New York City - Mr. Ingels hardly stands alone. Mr. Gillespie has high praise for BIG partner Thomas Christoffersen, who is working alongside Mr. Ingels on the design of Beach and Howe, and for project manager Agustin Perez-Torres.
"The one thing that people underestimate about BIG is that there's a lot of bench strength there. When people think of BIG, they think of Bjarke, but the reality is somewhat different. He has a very, very strong team, much stronger than people realize. That's how he's doing what he's doing. Some of his people are as strong as I've ever seen - first class, at the top of their game. When you have multiple buildings going up, as we do, it's nice to have an interjection of new, fresh ideas."

Full text:   U.S. home prices are headed up, suggesting that a sector that has seen nothing but bad news for five years is finally beginning to contribute to the nation's recovery.
The property market south of the border has been caught in a vicious circle, with falling prices causing foreclosures, which in turn cause prices to fall even further, prompting more distressed sales.
Now, rising prices and an uptick in sales indicate the worst may finally be over.
A resurgence in the sector would give a boost to the entire U.S. economy, which has been dragged down by the plunge in home construction and the devastating hit that falling home prices have delivered to the banking system and household wealth.
The biggest reason for optimism: home prices seem to be picking themselves off the mat in dramatic fashion as buyers snap up bargains.
According to figures released Tuesday by the National Association of Realtors, the median price on previously owned homes sold in April rose by a healthy 10.1 per cent over the same month a year earlier, matching levels last seen in July, 2010.
"A housing recovery would be a game changer for U.S. consumers and U.S. [financial firms], who have been struggling with falling prices for five years," said Ed Sollbach, strategist at Desjardins Capital Market.
Also helping lift spirits were home sales, which rose 3.4 per cent in April, with gains spanning all regions of the country and both single-family homes and condos.
Some regional markets reported hot numbers. In Miami, for instance, where prices have been rising for five months, the median sales price of condominiums increased 30 per cent to $150,000 (U.S.) compared to a year earlier, according to the Miami Association of Realtors and the local Multiple Listing Service system. The median sales price of single-family homes rose 8.2 per cent to $183,000.
The U.S. housing market has been in a deep funk since 2007, with prices suffering their longest decline since the 1930s. The real-estate collapse prompted a sharp fall in construction and is a major reason why the country's rebound from the financial crisis has been slow.
While home sales probably benefited from a mild winter, many analysts believe more fundamental factors are driving the recent rebound.
Thanks to a brightening labour market, record low interest rates and high affordability, buyers are showing a new willingness to bid on properties.
The new data offer evidence "that housing market conditions may in fact be seeing fundamental improvements, with the uptick in activity more related to the firm labour market and attractive affordability conditions than just [a] temporary weather-related boost," said David Onyett-Jeffries, economist at Royal Bank of Canada.
Capital Economics said in a report released Monday that it believes the housing bust is over, but cautioned that the recovery will be slow and prices aren't likely to match their former peaks any time soon.
One worry in the U.S. has been that banks, caught up in the robo-signing scandal over sloppy foreclosure practices last year, might start dumping inventory of foreclosed properties on the market.
But banks appear to be refraining from flooding the market with the approximately one million properties they would likely have sold over the past 18 months had the scandal not intervened.
Not everyone is buying the housing recovery story. Gary Shilling, president of A. Gary Shilling & Co., a New Jersey-based money manager, recently told his clients they should have sold their homes "yesterday if you plan to do so any time soon."
Excess inventories are likely to push prices down another 20 per cent over the next few years, he says.

THE QUESTION
I get annoyed by how many cars sit in line idling at drive-throughs. Is there something we can do about it?
THE ANSWER
At Briar Hill Elementary School in Calgary, when parents sit idling waiting to pick up their kids, the students knock on their windows and ask them to turn off the engine.
That's action. But it's just a start.
Frustrated at seeing customers at drive-through windows getting more attention than those who walked into the store, Markham real estate developer Dave de Sylva started counting cars at the 29 drive-throughs in his city, using a stopwatch to time how long they sat idling. Using a formula from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, he calculated that in one year the residents of Markham were wasting enough gas idling in line-ups to drive a car around the world 85 times.
Imagine you pull into the drive-through for your daily dose of Tim Hortons during the morning rush. The line takes about 10 minutes. With a three-litre engine, your idling car has just burned a quarter litre of gas, according to Natural Resources Canada.
Gas prices across Canada (at time of writing) are anywhere from $1.10 to $1.44 a litre. Using a midway price of $1.26, that quarter litre you wasted in the Tim's lineup means your coffee cost an additional 31 cents - $1.55 a week if you idle every morning. So the young woman who parks her car and walks into the store saves enough on gas every week to buy a bonus large coffee, with a few cents left over for a Timbits treat.
That idling is also costing you on car maintenance. Your engine isn't running at peak temperature, so fuel isn't fully combusted. This causes residue buildup, reducing fuel efficiency and damaging engine parts.
In Perth, Ont., Peggy Land and her local chapter of the Canadian Federation of University Women convinced their town council to enact a by-law prohibiting idling. While researching the issue, they consulted an experienced mechanic and learned that emissions-control systems - the devices that make your car pollute less - only work at full efficiency when driving.
If every Canadian driver reduced idling time by just three minutes a day, it would reduce carbon emissions by 1.4 tonnes a year. That's like taking more than 196,000 cars off the road for a year.
Admittedly, on a Canadian January day when it's twenty below, you don't want to sit long in an unheated car. But some people have the misplaced it takes a long time idling to warm up your engine. "It doesn't. Thirty seconds, you touch it and whoa! It's hot," says Honda dealership mechanic Ricky Forgeron of Halifax, who supports the Dads Against Dirty Air, or DADA, campaign.
So how can we put the brakes to idling?
* Skip the drive-through and meet the nice people pouring you your coffee. If you absolutely must use a drive-through, switch off your engine when you're sitting for more than 10 seconds.
* If your city doesn't already have an idling by-law, start a campaign to enact one. Dadacanada.com has sample by-laws and other educational resources.
* Get your kids involved. Ms. Land and her colleagues performed a skit for local Grade 4 classes, pretending to take the class on a road trip to Ottawa. They acted out picking up each student and stopping for snacks, while one student watched the clock to count how much time was spent idling.
So tomorrow morning at Tim's, get out of the car and buy your java from the friendly folks behind the counter. On Friday, you can savour that bonus cup you've earned.

Abstract: Yet for novelist Michael Winter, who came to Newfoundland from England as a small child, "shack" doesn't exist - the operative words are the utilitarian camp ("for hunting from, or for picking berries'), the "house around the bay," (a fixed-up outport house) and the cabin, made for pleasure and situated on a "pond" (i.e. lake).

Full text:   Canadians share such a deep love of nature that people from coast to coast feel they simply must have a special place where they can enjoy it. What they can't agree on is what to call it. John Allemang examines why
Canada is a country with no shortage of nature and not nearly enough summer.
No wonder the weekend-exodus season begins as early as it does: With the head start provided by Queen Victoria's thoughtful holiday, time spent at the summer getaway is precious for those Canadians who have one.
If the national identity is defined through some ever-evolving sense of accommodation between a small number of people and a vast amount of wilderness, then the summer place comes close to the heart of Canadianness. But the place that has the power to unite the country in a collective understanding of pleasure and beauty and carefree escape also has the strange ability to make us different from one another.
It all begins with language. Where do you go in the summer, or where do you hope to be invited by friends who see you as an essential refinement in their authentic backwoods experience? The cabin, the cottage, the lake, the chalet, the camp, the shack or - my, aren't we fancy - the summer house?
"The whole phenomenon is such a central part of the Canadian experience," says Katherine Barber, editor of the landmark Canadian Oxford English Dictionary . "And yet I can't think of any other item that has this much variation in terminology."
At the linguistic level at least, we're a nation divided. Most of the words we use for our hinterland retreats are suitably rustic and modest, but just because they come close to being synonymous in the dictionary doesn't mean you can trot them back and forth across the country and treat them as all-purpose lingua franca.
When Charles Boberg, a professor of linguistics at McGill University, conducted the North American Regional Vocabulary Survey from 1999 to 2005, he asked respondents what word they would use to describe "a small house in the countryside, often by a lake, where people go on summer weekends."
The answers he got back were all over the map. The preference for the word cabin ranged from 85 per cent in Newfoundland and 72 per cent in the Vancouver-Victoria area to zero in Toronto. Camp was under 10 per cent across the rest of the country, but in New Brunswick was the choice of 28 per cent and in Northwestern Ontario soared to 78 per cent.
Chalet as a summer place barely registers outside Quebec, but 21 per cent of English-speaking Montrealers used the term. Cottage is dominant in Prince Edward Island (67 per cent), Nova Scotia (78 per cent), and Eastern and Southern Ontario, peaking at 89 per cent in Toronto (where a few also refer to "the lake," which is more widely embraced in Manitoba, along with cottage and cabin).
In Alberta (66 per cent) and Saskatchewan (58 per cent), cabin is the majority preference. Pretty well every region admits cottage as an option, but that doesn't mean they have to like it.
In fact, the best way to inflict a centre-of-the-universe attitude on fellow Canadians, linguistically speaking, is to talk about your summer cottage. They may understand what you think you're referring to, but that doesn't mean they want to hear the Southern Ontario norm being imposed on their particular patch of idealized nature. You might as well say the Maple Leafs are Canada's Team.
For novelist Michael Crummey, growing up among Newfoundland's cabins and camps, "there was something grand and effete in the notion of the cottage. A cottage was where rich people lived when they weren't hanging out at the mansion."
He went off to live in Kingston, Ont., and not surprisingly his working vocabulary adapted. The problem is that he continued to use the foreign term when he returned home. "People still make fun of me if I slip up and use it: 'Oh, the Cottage,' they'll say in something approaching a fey English accent."
Not fair, say the good people of Ontario who, after all, are only using the word they've grown up with, the one they use to communicate with their own kind.
But, of course, they'll do the same thing to outsiders who violate the local linguistic code. "When I first moved to Ontario," says Cameron Clark, a lawyer from Victoria, "people would raise their eyebrows if I referred to a cabin."
'Originally used for a peasant's home or farm'
It's a strange thing to stand accused of committing a linguistic faux pas when you're using the word that's correct and exact in your own milieu. Yet most Canadians would raise their eyebrows in similar circumstances, as if you were passing judgment on their habitat or somehow elevating yourself by reaching for exotic terminology - if your outsider's term doesn't sound would-be genteel, then it's probably faux-rustic. Either way, it's jarringly foreign in a highly localized context where people are used to understanding and agreement.
Because even though a cabin is virtually synonymous with cottage at the level of assumed humbleness, the implications in a Canadian setting are far different.
"It's interesting that, in Ontario, the word recruited for this meaning was originally used for a peasant's home or farm," Prof. Boberg says. "Whereas the one used in Western Canada referred more to a rude shack built in the woods by pioneers or loggers - perhaps indicating a more virile western kind of experience versus a more genteel Ontario experience. And then camp is the ultimate virile word."
Them's fightin' words. But even without an innate sense of conflict based on local self-image, descriptions like cabin and cottage may be predisposed to have a regional distinctiveness. "The terms evoke a very different summer experience dictated by geography, temperature, climate," Mr. Campbell notes with lawyerly precision.
That's part of the explanation for the amazing variation in our summer-house vocabulary: A building so deeply integrated with our understanding of nature is subject to huge variations in terrain, the materials the landscape provides, the physical conditions under which buildings are built and people choose to live.
But language at the local level responds to many other pressures of history and the contributions of settlement and the whimsy of etymology. Why do Anglo Montrealers call their rural getaway a chalet? From the French, of course, but also, Prof. Boberg speculates, because the real-estate word for cottage was already taken by a two-storey city house.
The dominance of camp in the two widely separated entities of Northwestern Ontario and New Brunswick troubles word people. Ms. Barber speculates that the joint connection is through logging camps common to both areas - "rudimentary but permanent structures for seasonal use in the countryside," is her phrase for tying it all together. Prof. Boberg notes that camp is also a popular word in New England and may have simply migrated across the border, but he can't explain Northwestern Ontario's outlier position.
Even further apart from the norm is Cape Breton, where the standard word for a summer place is bungalow - originally a Hindustani word used to describe a low house with a veranda in the cooler foothills of the Himalayas that the British would have adopted as a summer retreat.
Somehow the word got to Cape Breton, and Cape Breton alone, to a denote a beloved family cottage of the kind British potentates wouldn't acknowledge.
"Cottage here has the notion of something more expensive than a bungalow, more upper class," says William Davey of Cape Breton University. "A bungalow is very modest, put together on weekends; you buy the cheapest materials you can and don't worry about longevity. But there's a great pride about them because most have been in the family for several generations."
According to Newfoundland humourist Ray Guy, writing in 1975, the most common term for a summer place in his part of the world, however beautiful or spacious, is "a shack in the country" - one of those self-deprecating terms that grounds contemporary backwoods longings in a simpler, rougher past. The language of local habitat seems to have a natural conservatism, especially in buildings that pass from generation to generation - it's a lot easier to keep an older word in the family, even as the shack gets renovated and upgraded into something more cottage-like.
Yet for novelist Michael Winter, who came to Newfoundland from England as a small child, "shack" doesn't exist - the operative words are the utilitarian camp ("for hunting from, or for picking berries'), the "house around the bay," (a fixed-up outport house) and the cabin, made for pleasure and situated on a "pond" (i.e. lake).
"Camps rarely turn into cabins," he says, "but cabins surely do get renovated into pretty spectacular residences."
From Millionaires' to Billionaires' Row
Of all the terms used in Canada, cottage was the first to move upscale in its pretensions to grandeur, which may explain its residual snob associations. Muskoka, a handy escape for Toronto plutocrats and American industrialists, had its Millionaires' Row in the early 1900s, and vacationers who wanted a sampling of the wilderness experience were already scorning its golf clubs and yacht regattas.
Highway development and automobile ownership opened up cottage country and made it more accessible to the do-it-yourself masses, restoring a certain democratic humility of habitat. But more recently, cottage megalomania has returned: Muskoka now has a Billionaires' Row and helipads for Hollywood holidayers - a far cry from "cottage" in its original sense.
"It's possibly a word brought here by Loyalist settlers," Ms. Barber says, "although these were people who probably didn't have secondary country residences." Native people lived in the woods, and their encampments would occasionally be visited by intrepid travellers such as Catharine Parr Traill in search of the picturesque. Loggers might indeed build a seasonal residence to shorten their commute to work, but it was a makeshift shelter with a down-at-heels name to match - a shanty, a shack, a tilt.
But when railways made the lakes and wilderness more accessible to the upper classes in the later 19th century, the word cottage was available to describe the civilized version of roughing it in the bush - nothing too fancy, but not too crude either, with all the advantages of the city available in a simpler, more restful setting.
This return to nature was predicated on an easy relationship with the beauties of the wild, as seen from the comforts of the veranda in the company of people like oneself. People stayed in railway-owned lodges at first, secure in the company of others. But quite rapidly a rougher, more individualized sense of wilderness experience begin to develop, creating the link we now recognize in Canadian English between the camps and cabins of the loggers and settlers and the cottages of the wealthier urbanites on holiday.
Luxury hotels come to Ontario's rugged Algonquin Park in 1908. By 1912, the Grand Trunk Railway is opening "outpost camps" with individual cedar cabins for guests who want to get closer to the wild (while maintaining access to hot and cold running water). A railway brochure touting the park's creature comforts promises "real camp life with only the rough edges taken off."
So the built-in tensions between vocabulary, locale and experience are integral to the summer-getaway experience.
"The whole thing goes back to the essential Canadian dream, the cabin in the north, the return to nature," says Dom Joly, a British comedian who discovered Muskoka's summers a decade ago. "But Muskoka has gone insane in the 10 years I've been going there. Now, it's like Kennebunkport, with all these uber-cottages."
The linguistic fit may be more of a mismatch than ever. But the pleasure at the heart of it all, the one Mr. Joly keeps returning to despite these delusions of grandeur, remains the throwback experience the summer-getaway words suggest.
"For all that, there's still a sense that you're going back in time a bit," he says. "You don't have to worry about the kids all day, you don't watch television, you play board games, you're cut off from the stress of normal life."
There's only one problem he faces when he tries to spread the word about his Canadian cottage experience, and it's once again a problem of language.
"Do you know what cottaging is here in Britain?" he asks. "I'm being polite here, but it's what George Michael might get up to in a public convenience with another man. So when I tell people I'm off cottaging in Canada, it causes great confusion."

NATIONWIDE SURVEY
Readers explain regional differences
Janice Rosen from Winnipeg:
"My place is a cabin, but when I rent it out for the summer months, I call it a cottage. You can charge more for a cottage."
Chris Graham from Toronto:
"Among places I've lived, it's: cottage in Southern Ontario, camp in Northern Ontario and cabin in B.C. Cottages also seem to reflect a different mindset, a different place to sit on the patio and drink beer, rather than camps or cabins, which are a place to sleep at night while you go hiking or canoeing or hunting."
Laura Young from Alberta prefers getting away to the hills:
"Group-site camping in RVs with extended family at the lake. A 40-plus-year tradition of kids running wild and free, the young ones easily within eyesight, the older ones showing up to eat, get out the games or water guns. Three generations enjoying one another's conversations around the firepit at day's end."
Linda Little from Manitoba:
"The place where the cabin is. Since my family is blended - I come from Northwestern Ontario, where that building is called camp, and my husband is from the Prairies, where the building is called the cabin. So we go to 'the lake.' It saves arguing."
Dawn Green in Alberta:
"We spend time at the cabin or the shack, at Waskesiu, Sask., in Prince Albert National Park. In the early days, people used shack tents (wooden floors and walls, canvas roof). There were communal bathrooms every few blocks, camp kitchens - with electricity (!) and much fun was had."
Rhonda Hutton in Newfoundland and Labrador:
"St. Joe's - our cabin in St. Joseph's, St. Mary's Bay, with neighbouring towns of St. Catherine's and St. Vincent. Also known as 'Holy crap, this is beautiful!' "

China makes headway in cooling housing market

Author: Wheeler, Carolynne

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/china-makes-headway-cooling-housing-market/docview/1014216006/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: All of this comes ahead of an expected transfer of power at the top that is supposed to begin with the Communist Party's national congress in October. "You can make a pretty strong case that it's overvalued, the property market, so I personally don't think there will be any reversal ... I think they'll hold the line," said Alaistair Chan, China economist with Moody's Analytics.

Full text:   For middle-class Chinese, buying a first home in the country's previously roaring property market is slowly falling back within reach.
Property prices fell again across most of China in April, as central government regulators intended, down year-over-year in 46 of 70 major cities across the country.
Homes in Wenzhou, scene of a local debt crisis last fall, fell hardest, down 12.3 per cent from this time last year. Homes in top-tier cities Beijing and Shanghai were also cheaper, down 1.0 and 1.3 per cent, respectively, from last year.
Government regulations that have slowed the market are seen as risky by many economists, some of whom - following a wave of dismal month-end results on imports, exports and industrial production - are now busy revising their forecasts down for China's growth this year. Goldman Sachs cut its forecast for the year this week to 8.1 per cent from 8.6.
Still, Chinese officials are pledging to continue their strict home purchasing regulations. The regulations vary from city to city but generally limit purchases to those with permanent residency permission, or hukou , for the city, as well as restricting purchases of multiple properties.
"We will keep our severe crackdown against investment and speculative housing demand," Zhang Xiaohong, vice-head of property market supervision at the Ministry of Housing, was quoted as saying to news portal www.china.com.cn. "We must firmly stick to the tightening measures, further strengthen our achieved results and drive home prices back to a reasonable level."
At stake is the role of the housing market in China's economy. The real estate market made up about 13 per cent of GDP last year; it's seen as the best and safest investment in a country with an immature financial market and notoriously volatile stocks, and was heading for a bubble when government introduced the regulations last year.
Now that property bubble is deflating fast, although some economists say the market is still overvalued. More importantly, though, restricting property prices to try to keep them within reach of China's rising middle class is seen as key to preserving political stability. For an authoritarian regime obsessed with maintaining a harmonious society, this has been a relatively dramatic year of labour protests, self-immolations by Tibetan activists, continuing food inflation and then a political scandal involving the murder of a British businessman that felled one of China's most popular politicians.
All of this comes ahead of an expected transfer of power at the top that is supposed to begin with the Communist Party's national congress in October. "You can make a pretty strong case that it's overvalued, the property market, so I personally don't think there will be any reversal ... I think they'll hold the line," said Alaistair Chan, China economist with Moody's Analytics. In some cities, he pointed out, there has been something of a recovery even without policy change; last December, about 49 cities saw falling prices, compared with the previous year, which means a few cities are already seeing prices stabilize.
Still, some property developers are settling in with what they have, and downgrading any ambitions of big acquisitions.

Swoons in the real-estate market are relative. Take the price plunge making news here on the West Coast.
To hear some people talk, one of the hottest housing markets in the world is experiencing a serious course correction. Prices are down significantly over last year.
But what does that mean?
To some, at least, it's a sign that the astounding buying spree we witnessed at the high end of the market in Vancouver last year is over - at least for now. Homes that were selling for $3-million or $4-million - some hundreds of thousands over the asking price - aren't moving. It's like everyone got the same memo: Are you nuts?
But the sales of those higher-end properties in 2011 also inflated median house prices and skewed the overall picture somewhat.
Now that those multimillion-dollar homes aren't being gobbled up at the rate they once were, house price averages are taking a hit.
Of course, even a levelling off of house values is big news in these parts. And it generally precipitates a fresh round of housing bubble speculation. Is this the massive downturn that so-called experts have been predicting for, well, years now? Everyone wants to know.
While there are certainly those outside the city - including economists at some of our more reputable financial institutions - who think Vancouver is heading for an abrupt decline in house prices, those in the know out here don't seem to be too alarmed by what they're seeing.
Tsur Somerville, the oft-quoted real-estate economist from the University of B.C., doesn't see signs of a major real-estate story brewing. He actually holds a refreshing perspective on the local scene. He won't even go so far as to say that buyers hold the advantage at the moment, even though supply far exceeds demand.
"When the average house price is still north of $800,000, then buyers' market is a term I like to avoid using," he says.
What may be noteworthy is the impact that Vancouver is having on real-estate numbers nationally. Usually, the city is being blamed for driving up averages across the country. Today, however, it's being blamed for dragging them down.
A report released this week by the Canadian Real Estate Association said the average home price in Vancouver dropped 10 per cent in April, compared to a roughly 20-per-cent increase in the same month a year earlier. Canada's housing prices, meantime, showed an increase of 0.8 per cent from March to April, 2012, compared with a 7-per-cent increase in April, 2011.
"Netting Vancouver out of the national average price calculation yields a 4.9-per-cent year-on-year gain," the report said.
Leaving Vancouver in, however, produced a 2.2-per-cent decline over the same period.
The market got overheated last year in large part due to immigrant purchasers who took many forms. Some were speculators from Mainland China, some were landed immigrants with plenty of cash in their pockets, and still others were rich visitors temporarily setting up shop while their children attend school. Together, they helped fuel a price surge that, frankly, was not sustainable.
Some think that while the housing market might not be ready to go bust just yet, the condo arena is. But marketer Bob Rennie, someone who follows this area more closely than anyone in the city, says that's nonsense.
In an address to the Urban Development Institute on Thursday, Mr. Rennie said talk of housing bubbles makes for provocative sound bites but isn't based in reality. He produced a dazzling array of charts and graphs to back his claim that the future of condo sales has never looked brighter.
Now, you might expect someone who sells condos for a living to say something like that. But Mr. Rennie makes a pretty compelling argument that something is afoot that backs his claim. A massive demographic in Greater Vancouver - those between 55 and 74 - is sitting on $88-billion in equity. They are beginning to downsize.
According to Mr. Rennie, they are using their windfall to help their kids get into the market.
"For 80 per cent of the condo market last year, you only needed an income of just over $52,000," Mr. Rennie told me on Friday. "To me, that's not a bubble anything. There is a major flight to affordability going on.
"And we're also beginning to see the boomers using the equity from the sale of their homes to finance the down payment for their kids. That's a significant development - that's the big story in the market right now."
And he may well be right. But for now, the market is colder than it's been in a while. That may not be a bad thing.

Vancouver limits developer incentives to rental-only construction

Full text:   Vancouver council is going to restrict incentives to developers who build rental housing in this high-cost city to curtail some subsidies that soared to as much as $70,000 per unit.
The Vision Vancouver-dominated council, which has been peppered with criticism over its rental-incentive program, decided Tuesday to limit it to developers who are building rental-only buildings. The program, which began two years ago, had been open to those trying to mix rental units with condos for sale in the same building.
So far under the program, almost 1,700 units have been proposed and are working their way through the system.
"More units were created in the projects that were 100-per-cent rental," housing planner Dan Garrison told council Tuesday before the Vision councillors voted to approve the change.
More important, those units also needed far less public subsidy.
Developers of the rental-only buildings got a subsidy of just $4,900 a unit, partly because those units were in low-rise structures that are built of wood, rather than more-expensive concrete.
The units mixed into buildings with condos ended up requiring $23-million in city subsidies to create just 327 units, or $70,000 a unit. That $23-million consisted of fees that developers normally have to pay to help cover the cost of new city services needed as their new buyers move in.
If the money hadn't been used as a rental incentive, it would have gone into parks, daycares, community centres and other services for residents.
The program had many critics over the past two years. Local resident groups near some of the projects said they were created out of scale for the neighbourhoods and that developers were given too many freebies.
Resident groups and critics from the left also made the case that the program didn't actually create any affordable housing. The units, none of which has come onto the market yet because they're still under construction or awaiting approvals, will be renting at the high end of the range.
Critics from the right, like Non-Partisan Association Councillor George Affleck, asked why the city thinks it has to provide subsidies to have developers build rentals when 1,300 condos a year come onto the rental market, as investors buy them and rent them out.
But Mr. Garrison argued that, as those units age, they will become part of the pool of cheaper housing.
The staff report noted that one-bedroom units renting for $1,500 a month in the 1990s, when they were new, are renting for $1,000 a month now.
He said rental housing continues to be the only option for many people in Vancouver, where it takes an income of $90,000 to buy a one-bedroom condo, $160,000 for a two-bedroom.
The staff report also said the rental housing being built is 70-per-cent cheaper for renters than if they were paying a mortgage on similar-sized condos in the same neighbourhood.
And Mr. Garrison said investor-owned condos are unreliable as permanent stock, because investors may sell them off as real-estate prices rise.
Vancouver, along with other Canadian cities, saw thousands of apartments built in the 1960s and early 1970s when investors could get federal tax breaks meant to encourage rental-housing construction.
But when those tax breaks were ended, apartment building dropped, nowhere more so than in Vancouver, where high land prices helped reduce apartment construction to almost nothing.

Vancouver's real estate swoon deepens

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/vancouvers-real-estate-swoon-deepens/docview/1013738183/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: One reason for the decline is fewer buyers from Asia, something that had been driving parts of the Vancouver market in recent years, according to agents. "The number of buyers from China is definitely down this year," said Andrew Hasman, a real estate agent who specializes in high-end homes. "We're seeing far fewer buyers from that part of the world and that's the reason our sales are down."

Full text:   * Despite hot demand across Canada, purchasers are backing off and creating a buyers' market * 9.8% Drop in the average home selling price in Vancouver in April compared with a year ago
Mayur Arora is seeing something few would have expected in Vancouver's real estate market - people walking away from deposits on houses, convinced prices will fall further.
"It happened twice in the last month. One [deposit] was $75,000 and one was a $20,000 deposit, the guys just walked away from it," said Mr. Arora, who runs Oneflatfee.ca in Surrey, B.C. "They are going to wait it out. So they lost $75,000 and $20,000, but if the market comes down $150,000 on a $1.5-million house, that's not uncommon."
Vancouver's once-overheated housing market has cooled sharply, with the average price falling nearly 10 per cent in April from a year ago to $735,315, according to figures released Tuesday by the Canadian Real Estate Association. That was the largest drop since the recession and it marked the fourth decline in the past five months.
In a market once famous for being overheated, Mr. Arora said he hasn't seen a bidding war in months.
"It's totally a buyers' market. Buyers are determining the price," he said. "And sellers are surprisingly accepting it. They are taking it."
One reason for the decline is fewer buyers from Asia, something that had been driving parts of the Vancouver market in recent years, according to agents. "The number of buyers from China is definitely down this year," said Andrew Hasman, a real estate agent who specializes in high-end homes. "We're seeing far fewer buyers from that part of the world and that's the reason our sales are down."
Mr. Hasman said money flowing out of China has slowed considerably and Canadian banks have also tightened their mortgage lending rules, especially on larger loans commonly associated with high-priced real estate. Jean Zhang, who works for Sutton Group in Vancouver, agreed and said she is also seeing fewer immigrant buyers.
Over all, home sales increased slightly last month across Canada and the average price jumped 0.9 per cent on a year-over-year basis to $375,810, according to CREA figures. Prices were up in 80 per cent of all local markets. Toronto remained one of the hottest markets, with sales up 2.5 per cent and the average price climbing 8.4 per cent to $517,556 from a year ago.
"While growth in Canadian housing activity has lost some steam over the last year, the level of Canadian home prices and sales remain high," said Diana Petramala, an economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. She added that low interest rates continue to push demand and estimated that Canadian housing is 10 to 15 per cent overvalued, particularly in Toronto and Vancouver.
While Toronto has garnered much attention for its price appreciation and flurry of activity, it's not the only real estate market that's bustling.
In Regina, ?year-to-date prices are 9.4 per cent higher than the same period a year ago. Sales and average prices set a record last month, driven by strong population growth, including migration, and the lowest jobless rate in the country. The average home price in Regina is now $312,873, according to CREA.
"The picture that emerges from the April existing homes statistics continue to support our view that housing market activity - at least on the resales side - is on a path of moderation over all in Canada but that regional divergences remain," said Robert Hogue, a senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada.
Not everyone is convinced there's a housing bubble. Economic fundamentals are driving activity and prices, and many markets are still undersupplied, said Peter Norman, chief economist at Altus Group.
He points to an improving labour market, low interest rates, population growth and pent-up demand from the recession as driving activity. "I wouldn't say it's out of control but it certainly indicates strengthening demand in a relatively supply-constrained market," he said.
Even in Toronto, where talk of a bubble is most concentrated, rising prices simply reflect population growth of about 100,000 people a year in a city where "severe land constraints" are limiting the ability to build single homes, he said.

Full text:   Why 'farmland funds,' which buy land and lease it to growers, are getting paid off handsomely
bmilner@globeandmail.com
When Shonda Warner first set out to attract wealthy investors for a fund to acquire farmland across the vast U.S. grain belt, she was almost laughed out of the drawing room. That was back in the halcyon days of 2006, when ordinary mutual funds were delivering double-digit returns, gold gained 19 per cent and mortgage-backed securities and other derivative-based junk were still being snapped up by unwary institutional investors. Heck, even cash accounts were bringing in something north of 4 per cent.
"Nobody was interested," Ms. Warner says with a chuckle. "Nobody would talk to you, because the returns weren't sexy enough. You can't argue with people about those kinds of things."
Still, the former derivatives trader with Goldman Sachs suspected a lot of investors would come to rue the day they had listened to Wall Street's siren song and turned up their noses at her projected real returns of perhaps 10 to 12 per cent annually.
Needless to say, Ms. Warner, the affable founder of Chess Ag Full Harvest Partners, turned out to be right. After one of the great financial meltdowns in history and years of miserable returns on a host of mainstream and alternative investments, she finds no shortage of interest or competition today on her own turf. At least five farmland funds have cropped up in Canada, mainly in Saskatchewan and Alberta, where Chess and other U.S. players are kept out by restrictions on large-scale foreign ownership.
What they offer is a pricey but compelling story for long-term investors, essentially buying up land, leasing it to growers and collecting a share of the proceeds, while benefiting from appreciating property prices.
So people are banging on her door, demanding admittance, right?
Well, not exactly. "My sense is people still aren't raising a ton of money, because everyone thinks there's a bubble [in U.S. farmland]," Ms. Warner says from her office in Clarksdale, Miss., best known as the birthplace of the Delta Blues and long a centre of cotton production. Cotton, an expensive crop to finance and grow, is increasingly being displaced by more profitable corn.
"So people are holding off because they think it's too hot a story. The weird thing is, unlike other alternative asset classes, nobody really ever played," she says, laughing heartily at the absurdity. "While there's interest and it's certainly getting on folks' radar screens more than ever, there's still not massive [institutional] participation."
That actually suits the conservative Ms. Warner, who recently closed her second fund to new investors and seems a tad embarrassed by the funds' current outsized returns of 15 to 17 per cent. She emphatically avoids using recent results as a marketing tool. "I didn't really want a bunch of money right now, because I think the market's rather high. So I've certainly been quiet about it on this go-round." Altogether, Chess has about $150-million (U.S.) under management.
Higher food and land prices in the U.S. are unlikely to be sustained, as China's growth engine sputters, Europe heads deeper into double-dip territory and demand elsewhere flattens. Such key crops in Chess's arsenal as soybeans and wheat got beaten up last week and U.S. corn prices fell to a 14-month low.
Ms. Warner doesn't like issuing forecasts. But if she had to gaze into the crystal ball, she sees returns sliding over the next five years to the lower end of the typical annual range of 8 to 12 per cent. Like most others in the field, she and her crew aren't interested in farmland as a real estate play. "We're all kind of farmers. So we look at vertical integration and what we can grow."
For her part, Ms. Warner would rather own the land than invest in companies like Viterra that trade what the land produces. Prices of publicly traded firms in the agriculture space are subject to much more than farm or market conditions.
"Corn prices could hang in at $5 plus and if the [stock] market [loses] 20 per cent, they [farm-related equities] will be off 20 to 30 per cent. Having a financial background makes me very leery of the percentage of the market that consists of high-frequency trading and all that kind of thing. Don't think agricultural equities aren't going to be subject to that."
Ms. Warner, who hails from Nebraska farm stock, started out in the markets as a grain trader with Cargill. In the early 1980s, she and a handful of colleagues were asked to investigate some new-fangled financial arbitraging. "One thing led to the next, and all of a sudden I was running some big derivatives book at Goldman."
But farmland kept beckoning. Unlike financial derivatives, plenty of data exists on land prices and agricultural production going back a century or more. And right now, the numbers tell her that the market is too frothy.
For those looking for a cheaper way to get into the game, she recommends planting a garden and selling the produce at the local market. "It's the original investment. I promise you'll make a higher return than you would on almost any listed index and security in the next five to 10 years."

Full text: Hotel Americano isn't just for guests. It's also a popular gathering place for local galleristas, fashionistas and filmmakers
Hotel Americano
518 West 27th St., New York;
hotel-americano.com. 56 rooms from $325 (U.S.). No eco-rating.
For many years, the heart of New York's Chelsea warehouse district was a strangely hotel-free zone. It was a great place to cab to for underground nightclubs and industrial style speakeasies, but not for high-thread-count overnight stays.
Enter the Highline: New York's mile-long linear park, built on the bones of the old elevated railway and redesigned as an aerial greenway, spurred neighbourhood growth and real estate development when it opened in 2009.
It was only a matter of time before a hipster hotel like the Americano, which opened in the fall of 2011, made the scene. But the first North American property of the Mexican company Grupo Habita is so much more than a hotel.
The bar and restaurant are popular hangouts for local galleristas (this is still the heart of New York's gallery world) and fashionistas (it's located next door to the Elite modelling agency).
The striking architecture by Mexico's Enrique Norten make it a destination for filmmakers, too. When I stayed there, the filming of an independent Mexican movie about two madcap playboy brothers who spend a weekend in New York was in full swing.
Like a cinematic hôtel particulier , the Americano is the antithesis of the bland corporate hotel.
It is a place to hide out, hold court or just sip a latte lobby-side and watch the neighbourhood roll by.
DESIGN
Norten's distinctive architecture - the hotel is a sleek glass structure encased in a metal mesh façade that pays homage to the neighbourhood's industrial roots - makes it a Wallpaper* magazine favourite. A glass-enclosed elevator ferries guests from the lobby all the way to the 10th-storey rooftop terrace.
ROOMS
There is a residential loft feel to the rooms and studios designed by Arnaud Montigny, the French designer known for his work at Parisian boutique Colette. A Japanese element - wooden platform beds, muted colours and an urban ryokan vibe - is married to a mid-century one, with classic modernist furniture and the odd beanbag chair thrown in for good measure. There is an understated minimalism at play here - serene not sumptuous, low-key rather than luxurious.
AMENITIES
The rooftop terrace offers a pool and cabanas in the warmer months and an outdoor thermal bath in wintertime. The technology - such as the Samsung LED TVs with full HD and customized iPad with in-room controls - is as cutting-edge as the design. The soft-washed denim bathrobe by Loden Dager (also the designers of the staff uniforms) makes a chic and cozy in-room wrap and the oversize Turkish bath towels, Japanese Imabari washcloths and Aesop toiletries make up for the often inconsistent water pressure (staff were still getting the plumbing kinks worked out when I visited last month)
Guest bicycles provide the means to explore the nearby Hudson River Greenway bike path that runs from the Cloisters down to the Statue of Liberty boat docks, as well as the surrounding area dubbed by locals as the "Chelsea Riviera."
FOOD
The lobby café is a great hangout for guests and locals - especially at breakfast when the lattes and croissant amandines augment the people-watching experience. The Americano dining room offers Latin-influenced French fare by chef Joseph Buenconsejo. The Oxacan lobster is noteworthy and the entrecote grille done comme il faut (as it should be). The dining room also offers a chance to rub shoulders with art-world darlings (spotted: Chinese artist Huang Yong Ping dining next to a semi-famous male model). In warmer months the outdoor terrace offers an intimate al fresco experience, and the 24-hour room service fare comes in bento boxes - quirky, and delicious. SERVICE
The dining room service was impeccable and the hotel staff are enthusiastic. Taxis are hailed with a modicum of speed and a minimum of fuss, and impromptu hotel tours can be had if the moment is right. Some dodgy plumbing fixtures in my room were attended to by multiple well-meaning staffers with eventually efficient results.
VERDICT
This hotel is young but it's growing. It is still rough around the edges, but this is part of its charm. Its narrative grain and cinematic edge make it the perfect New York pad.

Full text: Towering condo slated for Toronto's financial district takes a cue from the past
jmays@globeandmail.com
The small office block that stands at the corner of Wellington Street East and Scott Street, on the eastern edge of Toronto's financial district, is surely not one of the city's shiniest architectural treasures, but it rates at least a footnote in the story of our downtown development.
Crafted around 1950 by Toronto architect James Allen Parrott, the sturdily graceful limestone and red granite cladding of a very ordinary frame eloquently recalls the art-deco styling known as stripped classical. This pared-down exterior treatment had enjoyed an international vogue among the architects of public and commercial buildings in the 1930s, before going out of fashion after the Second World War. But if late and a bit backward-looking, Mr. Parrott's streamlined design for the façades, realized in upmarket materials instead of concrete, is a good local example of deco elegance applied to what would otherwise have been just another 1950s stack of steel and glass.
That said, few people would object, I imagine, if Concert Properties Ltd., its current owner, were to sweep the little structure off the map and bring the 58-storey 88 Scott residential tower now proposed for the tight inner-city site down to the level of the sidewalk. Fortunately for fans of Toronto's modern architecture, Concert has decided to do something better. It aims to save the plainly patterned natural stone cladding - the only distinctive thing about Mr. Parrott's building -and attach it to the outside of the tower's new podium.
If I correctly understand what Concert has in mind - it was explained to me last week by Kelly Wilson, the company's vice-president for development - this move will not be another instance of the disagreeable practice of pasting a few scraps of architectural salvage onto an obviously contemporary building.
The height of the new base will exactly match that of Mr. Parrott's five-storey office block, which will be denuded of a clumsy two-storey addition piled on top of it in the early 1980s, and given back its original cornice. And the 1950s façades - on Wellington, Scott and Colborne Street - will be returned, largely intact, to their old positions. At the end of the day, Toronto should have a credible reconstruction of the most attractive aspects of the office building - the faces it turns to adjacent streets and to the city - and an item of historical preservation that acknowledges the past with a gesture more effective than the usual perfunctory nod.
In addition to this platform, the large 88 Scott complex includes a deep parking garage, retail outlets opening onto Wellington and Scott streets, a wing of office space stretching west from the tower along Wellington, and 479 residential suites. Except for the notably wide variety of unit layouts - there are 70 of them - the apartment sizes and prices are usual for the financial district.
The most plentiful suite type on offer, for example, is the one-bedroom plus den, which ranges in area from around 550 square feet up to 750 square feet.
The average price, sales office staff told me, is $690 a square foot. The numbers suggest that 88 Scott's customers, predictably, will be drawn from the pools almost every developer is fishing in these days: affluent single professionals, high-earning childless couples, downsizers, empty-nesters and, of course, real estate investors.
Less predictable, however, is the tower that Concert plans to raise over Mr. Parrott's reconstituted office building. Designed by Brian A. Sickle, a principal and executive in Page + Steele/IBI Group Architects, the soaring structure certainly will be different from the modernist glass boxes (and assorted other glassy shapes) that have dotted the downtown landscape since the onset of the condo boom.
Instead of meeting the city with sheer glazed surfaces that rise smoothly from base to crown, Mr. Sickle's skyscraper bristles with busy details. Grids of precast concrete start to climb up the tower, get part of the way up, then evaporate, as though they had changed their minds. Large, transparent, two-storey volumes thrust out from corners here and there, with no visual logic that I can make out. The jumbled upward motion of the façades terminates in a bundle of glass oblongs that manages to be odd and banal at the same time.
Heaven knows that the art of building tall is in need of rejuvenation. And I can appreciate the developer-driven pressure on Mr. Sickle and every other tower architect to try out new approaches, new ideas - anything, in fact, to avoid bringing yet another routine housing product into the marketplace.
But mere novelty, of the kind we will see in the tower of 88 Scott, is just not good enough. What does work for me is the tower's base - James Allen Parrott's very modest but dignified contribution to Toronto's streetscape that Concert has happily decided to conserve.

Full text: The house that Group of Seven painter Lawren Harris once called home gets a 21st-century restoration and expansion
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
Tim Morawetz's book, Art Deco Architecture in Toronto (2009 Glue Inc.), contains exactly two single-family homes. This, however, is fitting: While the progressive movement was acceptable for gas stations, movie houses and the odd apartment building, Torontonians of the 1930s and 1940s did not embrace the style for their private dwellings.
It is fitting, also, that one of those two houses - the masterpiece designed by Russian-born, female architect Alexandra Biriukova for Group of Seven painter Lawren Harris in 1930 - is now owned by a couple who previously resided in the kind of home that was acceptable to our forbears: a Georgian.
All of this to say that, in local architectural circles, the Harris house is the Hope Diamond. It's magnificent and rare, and, perhaps, even more magnificent after a recent restoration and small expansion by architect Drew Mandel.
"It's a well-known house in the city," he begins, "so it was interesting to have the opportunity to dance with it." And what a dance: an elegant Foxtrot in one room, interpretive Bob Fosse in another, and a mix of the two elsewhere. In other words, respect was given to the house's restored formal rooms, such as the large oval foyer or the massive living room, while softening them just a little.
And despite the expected informality of 21st-century spaces such as kitchen, breakfast nook, mudroom and family room, even these were "elevated" to speak a slightly more formal design language; a task made somewhat easier by placing most of them within a new 600-square-foot pavilion tacked onto the rear of the home.
Standing in the breathtaking restored foyer, one understands immediately how Mr. Mandel's disparate dancers unite. Under repaired cove lighting, the rhythmic, sweeping staircase (formerly covered with a busy "White House-y" carpet) unfurls to practically hold hands with a Cary Grant-esque ship's bar purchased at a Paris antique market by the homeowners (who have asked to remain anonymous). However, above this choreography is a massive light fixture that resembles a playful, kinetic Alexander Calder mobile. Furthermore, a look through one door reveals the dark wood panelling of a masculine office, while a swivel of the head points the eye down a light-filled corridor to the creamy, woodsy kitchen.
In that large kitchen - which occupies some of the old, small kitchen's footprint but also pushes out into the new addition - Mr. Mandel has given his clients an airy, modern and lighthearted entertaining space that connects to the breakfast room, family room and compact patio. Yet elegance is found over the stove, where a backlit chunk of marble hangs as art, underfoot via black terrazzo, and above the 12-foot Corian island, where refurbished 1960s Regal Constellation hotel ballroom fixtures sparkle.
One step down, the family room achieves intimacy with a low ceiling height as well as humour via a multi-coloured Missoni sofa.
Tying the kitchen, breakfast room and family room together is an open fireplace: "It's got that pinwheel thing," explains Mr. Mandel, pointing out that it also helps to marry the three different ceiling heights. The "restricted" materials palette also works at unification: "It was a strong colour theme of light wood, black and white, with the occasional limestone and marble."
A visit to the formal living and dining rooms - which fill the two wings on either side of the front door - reveals small gestures of informality.
In the dining room, a photo montage by Diana Thorneycroft is an ironic take on the Lawren Harris painting Davis Strait, while the large living room remains mostly unfurnished so it can be used for yoga classes and, on a few occasions, salsa dancing.
These rooms are "part of this formal geometry and the highlight of the house, but they're fallen out of use," offers Mr. Mandel, "so I think it's great not to let them sit totally abandoned."
Upstairs, the second floor contains the children's bedrooms (one of which has the Harris's original, curved, built-in dressing table) and the third floor - once Mr. Harris's painting studio - the magnificent master suite.
Outside, one bay of the former three-car garage has been converted into a poolside cabana, which also allowed the backyard to be widened.
For privacy, Mr. Mandel designed a covered colonnade/garden wall that draws inspiration from Gerrit Rietveld's 1955 pavilion at the Kröller-Müller Sculpture Garden in the Netherlands.
The home's original steel-framed, single-pane windows have been repaired, which, says the architect, are "a challenge to live with" since, on cold days, "you bring your scraper in from your car," he laughs. Joking aside, the decision to retain them - combined with the fact that Mr. Mandel's excellent addition is not visible from the street - means the house looks exactly as it did when Lawren Harris shook the Northern Ontario dirt off his boots at the front door.
"This is definitely the biggest house I've worked on," says Mr. Mandel about the restoration-renovation-addition, but he could just as easily be speaking of the home's reputation. And for this challenging architectural choreography, the Ontario Association of Architects will give the project a 2012 Design Excellence Award tonight in Ottawa.
A way to honour a very rare jewel.

The Action: In the advertisements for this detached two-storey house, it was stated that offers would be held off until ten days of market exposure. But only three buyers got through the doors before one presented the sellers with nearly $100,000 more than the list price the next day.
What They Got: In 2007, the owners of this 1930s brick residence modernized its decor and design, so it has new hardwood floors throughout, two remodeled bathrooms and a stylish kitchen with granite counters, stainless steel appliances and a peninsula overlooking the dining room, as well as sliding doors to the south-facing backyard.
* The basement was professionally finished with a separate entrance, carpeted recreation and play areas.
* Original elements retained include stained glass windows, wood trims and a formal living room with a brick fireplace and French entry doors.
* Other assets range from a den off the largest of three bedrooms upstairs to a front pad and detached garage linked by a wide driveway.
The Agent's Take: "It's pretty turnkey and in move-in condition, and I think that's what this buyer was looking for," agent Nutan Brown said. "It was a great little street that is literally a block long, and it doesn't really go anywhere, so it's very quiet with local traffic only."

Full text: OLG chair urges council to get all the facts before deciding but says billion dollar business would complement downtown
Paul Godfrey, the chair of Ontario's lottery corporation and a long-time force to be reckoned with in Toronto politics, says he'd like to see a casino on the city's downtown waterfront and is urging local councillors to wait for all the facts before they dismiss the idea out of hand.
The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp. revealed earlier this year that it wants to open a casino in the Greater Toronto Area as part of a sweeping overhaul of the province's gaming industry. No site has been chosen, but major casino operators have signalled they want a downtown location and provincial Finance Minister Dwight Duncan has talked enthusiastically about a new waterfront gambling complex that could create a "golden mile" on the city's shore.
Mr. Godfrey, a prominent figure in the city's business and political circles since the 1970s and a long-serving chair of the former Metro council, added his voice to that chorus Wednesday, saying he believes a downtown site is the best option for a multibillion-dollar casino and entertainment complex because it would be close to existing hotels and restaurants, as well as public transit. His endorsement for a downtown location comes as Mayor Rob Ford's executive committee is set to consider the controversial casino question next week and the lottery corporation prepares to begin formal discussions with potential operators.
"My personal preference today would be somewhere along the Toronto waterfront," he told The Globe and Mail's editorial board. Other sites, he said, would not attract as much interest from international casino operators or the same level of investment.
"You probably wouldn't get the same type of facility. It wouldn't be as iconic," he said.
Mr. Godfrey would not pinpoint a specific site, but said a soon-to-be released request for interest document likely will identify five or six locations and ask for feedback on them all. "That is going to help us determine the acceptability, the possibility of making it happen," he said.
Talk of a Toronto casino, possibly at Ontario Place, has divided council, with the mayor and many suburban councillors endorsing the idea under the right conditions. Several downtown politicians already have responded with a flat-out "no thanks."
The province has said it will not force any community to take a casino, but it also is clear that a new complex in Toronto would generate more investment and more badly needed revenue for the province. OLG predicts its efforts to update the province's gaming system, including Internet gambling, will increase its contributions to the province by $1.3-billion annually in five years.
The OLG, Mr. Godfrey said Wednesday, has a selling job to do - particularly to the people of Toronto and city councillors. "They should know all the facts before they say yes or no," he said.
But two councillors who have anti-casino motions before the mayor's executive committee on Monday say they have all the information they need already.
Councillor Michael Layton, who represents the ward that includes Ontario Place, wants it removed from the list of possible sites. "A casino is not an economic development mechanism, its a mechanism for taking money," he said. "All the research I've done, it's saying run and hide from these things."
Adam Vaughan, who is asking that no casino be built in the city without a referendum, said if Mr. Godfrey believes he has a case, he should make public OLG's studies and the business case behind the proposed Toronto casino.
"I appreciate that everybody wants an iconic piece of real estate on the waterfront for this and that," he said. "Our job as city councillors is to talk to our communities, our business communities, take a look the planning issues, and make a decision which is a balanced decision - not simply line up behind Paul Godfrey and the OLG."
Councillor Mark Grimes, chair of Exhibition Place, said local politicians should wait to see proposals before taking a stand. "I think we all need to take a step back and see what comes forward."
Mr. Godfrey said talk of increased crime caused by casinos has been "blown way out of proportion," and he disputed claims that a casino would hurt surrounding businesses.

Full text: German Chancellor Angela Merkel finds herself increasingly isolated despite holding the euro area's purse strings, as the drive for austerity collides with the reality that ordinary Europeans are fed up with the brutal impact of aggressive belt-tightening measures. Voters in seven European countries have ditched leaders or governing parties in less than two years, while budget slashing has strangled economies and driven the region's jobless rate close to a 15-year high. On the flip side, Ms. Merkel risks a further backlash at home if she gives in to pressure to show more flexibility. Jeremy Torobin reports on where austerity stands in six key countries:
FRANCE
François Hollande, who next week becomes the first Socialist to win a French presidential election since 1981, has pledged to renegotiate the European fiscal compact struck in March, which would compel countries to balance their budgets or face stiff penalties. Ms. Merkel has said the deal cannot be reopened, while indicating a willingness to talk with Mr. Hollande about ways to spur growth in the region. The extent to which these two can replicate the common, albeit uneasy, front forged by Ms. Merkel and Nicholas Sarkozy will be key in determining the euro bloc's future.
GREECE
After Sunday's defeat of the pro-austerity government, this is the euro zone's least politically stable member. Antonis Samaras, leader of the New Democracy party, which won the most seats, couldn't reach a deal with other parties to form a government, so Alexis Tsipras, head of second-biggest Syriza, is trying. Mr. Tsipras says he won't work with either of the two pro-austerity parties and, should he manage to form a government with left-wing parties, will reverse fiscal reforms and scrap Greece's bailout accords. Further failure to forge a coalition could mean new elections, possibly within weeks. Regardless, there may be too little support for austerity to avoid an exit from the euro zone.
SPAIN
A housing crash-fuelled recession in Spain, where half of people under 25 are unemployed, threatens to derail deficit-cutting plans, just when Madrid is also scrambling to restore confidence in its financial sector amid reports that its most real estate-heavy banking group, Bankia, may need billions of euros to avoid collapse. Spain's deficit is the region's third-biggest. Cuts have hurt Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's popularity, but he leads a majority.
ITALY
Former European Commissioner Mario Monti came to power late last year, replacing Silvio Berlusconi, and now leads a so-called technical government tasked with pushing through a EUR20-billion austerity plan aimed at erasing the country's deficit in 2014. Even with the Italian economy struggling - the country slipped into recession again in the last quarter of 2011 - tax revenue is rising, thanks to higher value-added tax and gasoline surcharges imposed by Mr. Monti's administration. Bond yields have fallen since he took office. Still, he faces pressure to slow his deficit-cutting even from parties that support him in Italy's legislature.
THE UNITED KINGDOM
British Prime Minister David Cameron's coalition is bleeding support, but he is forging ahead with near-record cuts that are being blamed for the U.K.'s first double-dip recession since the 1970s. On Tuesday, he made a rare joint appearance with Nick Clegg, his Liberal Democrat coalition partner, insisting they "can't let up" on difficult decisions to wrestle with the country's debt, while promising to redouble efforts to spur growth. Both parties suffered big losses in May 4 local elections, to Labour candidates who argued the cuts have been too fast.
IRELAND
A May 31 referendum will decide whether Irish voters buy into the European fiscal compact struck in March, or join the tide against austerity. The country's EUR68-billion rescue program runs out at the end of 2013, and it has been out of bond markets since September, 2010, a couple of months before it had to accept the controversial bailout.

Ford's ambitious Woodbine project running out of time

Full text: It's been promoted as a billion-dollar project that will bring more than 9,000 jobs to a needy corner of the city, but Woodbine Live, the entertainment and retail project touted by Mayor Rob Ford as proof of his ability to attract investment, is in jeopardy of losing its tax breaks from the city.
The 180-acre proposed development, on property adjacent to the Woodbine race course in the mayor's former ward, remains an empty field close to four years after council agreed to tax incentives to kick-start the project - envisioned as a tourist destination with shopping streets, a hotel, restaurants, nightclubs and entertainment. A proposed second phase would include office and residential development.
Those tax incentives will expire in October, 2014, if the first 800,000 square feet of development is not complete. With no final site plan, subdivision agreement or building permits yet in hand, city staff say it will be difficult to meet that deadline in less than 2 1/2 years.
Nick Eaves, CEO of Woodbine Entertainment Group, the racetrack operator that owns the site, says the delay is a result of a disagreement with its partner, Baltimore-based developer The Cordish Cos. "There certainly is a dispute between the parties," Mr. Eaves said. "Those issues are being dealt with through confidential arbitration."
Cordish provided no reasons for the delay when contacted. "Woodbine Live, among other things, has always been about world-class entertainment that acts as a major regional tourist draw," it said in a written response. "We are in the fortunate position of having both anchor and inline tenants committed and tenant interest has been off the charts."
Mr. Eaves would not predict when the partners' differences might be settled, but city staff say there isn't much time left.
"Time is running short," said Mike Williams, the city's general manager of economic development and culture, which oversees the tax-incentive program. "It's not impossible, but it's pretty tight."
The sprawling site at the corner of Rexdale Boulevard and Highway 427, was a centrepiece of Mr. Ford's pro-business credentials during his race for mayor.
"I know how to deal with CEOs of huge corporations - that's how I landed the largest development in Toronto's history," he told a reporter during the campaign. "Woodbine Live, I did that."
Councillor Doug Ford, who now represents the Etobicoke ward, said he is working to resolve issues, but gave no details.
"We aren't happy about it," Councillor Ford said Monday. "I can assure you the mayor and myself are working every single day on this issue. Every day."
Mr. Ford said what is needed is a meeting with both partners. "We just have to get the two parties in the room together," he said, conceding it is largely out of the city's control. "We are a facilitator, not an arbitrator," he said.
Regular weekly meetings between city staff and Cordish ended in July, according to a staff report that will go to council Tuesday.
Several real estate executives said the Rexdale site has had difficulty attracting tenants and Cordish began floating the concept of an outlet mall for the property last year. The project also suffered because of the downturn in the U.S. market, they said.
"Their timing couldn't have been worse," said John Crombie, of Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real-estate firm. After sitting on the market for so long, Mr. Crombie said the site has "lost a bit of its zip" with potential tenants.
The property has returned to the news recently as a possible location for the new Toronto casino proposed by the province's lottery corporation. Mr. Eaves has called the racetrack, with its 3,000 slot machines, a "logical place" for casino expansion. Cordish also endorses the idea, saying, "There is no better site for a full casino in North America."
Such talk has some worrying the proposed casino will be used to bring new life to the Woodbine project. Under the deal with the city, a casino is not permitted.
"I fear the casino will become the default to Woodbine Live," said councillor Janet Davis, who requested the status report to council. "The city has been working for years in good faith and it drew to a complete halt last summer. I want to understand why."
Toronto is not the only city to watch a Cordish site sit vacant for years following high expectations. The U.S. developer had two prime downtown sites in Niagara Falls, N.Y., under its control for decades - a parking lot that was used as a base for balloon rides and a mall that eventually closed.
Niagara Falls mayor Paul Dyster came to office as a reformer, promising to take on "do-nothing developers," he remembers. These days, Mr. Dyster has good things to say about company leader David Cordish, who in 2010 agreed to hand over the properties - for an undisclosed charitable donation - after a local college expressed interest in opening a hospitality and culinary institute on the site of the former mall.
"I was flabbergasted," said Mr. Dyster, remembering a conversation where Mr. Cordish made the offer. "He couldn't make it work for himself but instead of standing in the way and just sitting and speculating on these properties, he decided to do something extraordinary."

Abstract: Banks are now requiring borrowers to disclose incomes and assets before mortgages are approved, as of the last six weeks," said west-side realtor Marty Pospischil, who specializes in selling single-family homes owned by long-term residents. Last year, he says 90 per cent of his 100 house sales were to "offshore buyers" - people not living here yet, who flew in to buy.

Full text: Realtors say the small boom of sky-high prices for Vancouver west-side houses - one that prompted media around the world to claim with scant proof that mainland Chinese investors were buying up the city - is fizzling out.
Both sales and prices are down at the top end even more markedly than in the rest of the region, which has also seen a general slowdown this spring. A house in the 3000 block of West 24th Avenue, first listed at close to$4.5-million six months ago, sold on April 15 for $3.35-million.
Fresh statistics from the Greater Vancouver Real Estate Board show the number of sales on the west side is down by nearly 40 per cent for the first four months of the year. Only a third of the nearly 400 homes listed in April have sold - one of the lowest rates in the region.
Realtors say the slowdown is a result of a combination of tighter lending practices by banks, which now want proof of income to service large mortgages, more restrictions on how much capital can be taken out of China, and fewer immigrants.
"Banks are now requiring borrowers to disclose incomes and assets before mortgages are approved, as of the last six weeks," said west-side realtor Marty Pospischil, who specializes in selling single-family homes owned by long-term residents. Last year, he says 90 per cent of his 100 house sales were to "offshore buyers" - people not living here yet, who flew in to buy. This year, it's less than a tenth of that. "We're now seeing a 50-per-cent collapse rate in deals, when it's usually more like 5 per cent," he said.
He and other realtors are saying the west-side slowdown is a good thing because the short-lived boom, which prompted local owners to start listing at increasingly inflated prices, was unrealistic and unhealthy.
"I always thought that market was not sustainable. Every local person was juiced out of the market. The average household income on the west side doesn't support those prices," said Andrew Hasman, who specializes in single-family homes on the west side.
Prominent condo marketer Bob Rennie said the high-end house prices in west-side Vancouver were so out of line with the rest of the region and country that it was skewing people's perceptions of real-estate increases, not just in Metro Vancouver, but in all of Canada.
"In 2010, reports were saying real estate went up 8.9 per cent in Canada. But if you took out Vancouver, it only went up 4.3 per cent," he said.
A number of realtors said early signs started appearing six months ago that the market was slowing down, but the difference really appeared in early March.
There is usually a surge of buying in Vancouver around Chinese New Year, as visitors from China come to see family or friends in the city and often make decisions to buy.
This year, the buying spree after Chinese New Year was much smaller, and house sales have slowed in March and April instead of the typical pattern of accelerating into spring.
Jean Zhang, with Sutton Group, said her clients, who tend to be immigrants looking to settle here permanently, are waiting longer to make offers.
"A few months ago, people were thinking, 'I have to get in right away,' " she said.
"Now, they see there are lots of choices. And they are giving lowball bids. They want to have good bargains in this market."

THE OUTSIDER'S INN

Author: Ladurantaye, Steve

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/outsiders-inn/docview/1011026940/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "It generally hasn't been because of product offerings," he says when asked about Mr. [Jeff Stober]'s prospects. "In a lot of cases it can be difficult on families, and that usually doesn't have anything to do with business plans. Whether you're a high-profile person or not, it takes a lot of work to make something like this a success and it doesn't happen overnight."

Full text: When Jeff Stober opened the Drake Hotel, he changed the face of Queen West, to mixed response. Now he's exporting his brand to a boutique hotel in Prince Edward County. As Steve Ladurantaye reports, it's an empire-building gamble in a place where locals don't have a history of rolling out the welcome mat
A decade after establishing the Drake Hotel and turning it into a bastion of cool, Jeff Stober, the city's hippest hotelier, is expanding his empire.
In some ways, the new Drake Hotel will be indistinguishable from his Queen Street boutique hotel/hotspot when it opens early next year - the art will be meticulously curated, the playlist hand-picked by someone who knows better.
But anyone wanting to bask in the retro cool of the new property will need to do more than step off the 501 streetcar. They'll need to get in a car and drive 207 kilometres east to Wellington, a picturesque village on the edge of Lake Ontario in Prince Edward County.
It's a long way from downtown Toronto, and represents an enormous challenge for Mr. Stober. Many deep-pocketed investors have tried to bring cool to the county, only to find themselves thwarted by suspicious locals resistant to change and the fickle whimsies of the weekend jet set.
And if he does manage to win over the locals - a difficult task for anyone, let alone a dot-com millionaire who runs artsy hotels in the big city - his success could attract more ambitious, out-of-town interlopers anxious to develop another rural getaway of Torontonians desperate to spend the weekend anywhere other than the city.
For the village's 1,700 residents, most of them retirees who fled cities such as Ottawa, Kingston and Toronto for a quieter life, it's a pressing concern.
"We haven't done a good job of welcoming development over the last 20 years," says real-estate agent Jim Wait. "The community has always been a bit scared of what might happen. They are afraid this place could get turned into a Muskoka or Collingwood."
Mr. Stober brushes that all aside as he sits in the lobby of the Drake, somehow appearing both relaxed and tightly wound at the same time. His purchase of the former Devonshire Inn for $1.3-million should be seen as an isolated event in the village's history, he insists, not be watched as a barometer of the region's cool.
"We think the benefits to the county are multiple, never even mind all the eyeballs we'll bring by coming," he says. "We will authenticate our commitment to the local community, and locals who are interested in dining, in hearing music or seeing art will feel most welcome and appreciated."
An urban oasis in the country
The 52-year-old Mr. Stober, who started a headhunting firm in his early 20s and sold it at the height of the tech bubble, has been planning to expand the Drake brand from the minute he finished renovating the Queen Street location and flung open its doors in 2004. It's an eclectic mix of old and new, with locals drinking coffee at the bar in the morning and dancing maniacs from across the region spilling in at night.
His presence in the area was initially bemoaned by many who feared gentrification and worried about the hordes of partygoers the Drake was attracting to a region that was once better known for hookers than hipsters.
"It's funny when you look around here," he says, turning his head to look out at the lunchtime crowd walking past his Queen Street windows. "Everybody else is growing up, but we're the ones who are being true to our history and expanding outwards instead of upwards. That's so important to us, to maintain the history of the neighbourhood."
His experience along Queen Street has informed his approach to the county. He spends a lot of time talking about how the Drake Devonshire Inn, as it will eventually be called, will draw from the county's richest traditions when it opens and provide a cultural hotspot just as accessible to the locals as to vacationers looking for a good time.
"This isn't about building something for ourselves," he says. "This belongs to everyone."
As ambitious as his Toronto plans are, he's always wanted to build something in the country. He grew up visiting Quebec's Eastern Townships, a rolling countryside that draws tourists from the Montreal area year round and is markedly similar to Prince Edward County. Both regions, he points out, were settled by British subjects who opted to flee the United States rather than fight for its independence in 1775.
"I always thought it would be so positive to do something in the countryside," he says. "We had several ideas and looked at a lot of different things, but this site spoke to us and we decided it was the best fit."
Buying the former Devonshire Inn wasn't his first choice. He originally scoured the countryside - he pointedly avoids using the word "rural" because he worries the term comes loaded with judgment and presumptions - for a farm, with the intention of creating a weekend getaway that would see guests eat food that was grown onsite and pitch in with some of the day-to-day chores. "That turned out to be more complicated than you would think," he says.
It was just as well. He fell in love with the old Devonshire Inn, which has been operating as a bed and breakfast for the last 100 years. The quaint house sits on the edge of a large lakeside lot; the deck offers an expansive view of Lake Ontario. A local contractor is handling the renovations, and trying to preserve as much of the original interior as possible.
Inside, the six-room inn will trade doilies for coasters, and offer its guests locally sourced food and wine from down the road. There will be an old-school games room where visitors can play pool or backgammon.
"We think of it as summer camp for grown-ups," he says, though it will operate year round.
Innkeeper-to-be Chris Loane is a veteran Drake employee, and also a veteran of Toronto's indie music scene, who will draw on his deep connections to attract musicians to play small, intimate sets.
"I left the corporate world appreciatively and happily," Mr. Stober says. "The point I would make is that we had offices in many cities and I was able to transport our DNA very effectively. That has everything to do with your people, and this is no different. They understand what we stand for, and will bring that with them to this new experience."
Converting the locals
There's no guarantee people will flock to his small, six-room hotel no matter how cool a property he develops. Other tastemakers have been drawn by the region's underdeveloped charm, only to find themselves surrounded by resentful townies and longing for the warm embrace of King Street West in the summer.
Mr. Wait, who grew up in the area, says the anti-outsider mentality has softened in recent years, as the locals come to realize the only way to maintain their quality of life is to build their municipal tax base. The region has seen trends come and go - barley farming during prohibition, tomatoes in the 1970s - and many residents have come to realize that despite the best efforts of wide-eyed developers, things never actually change that much.
"I've lived in the county all of my life and nothing changes really quickly," says the real-estate agent. "Folks that moved here in the last two years think that there are all kinds of big changes [coming], but it's always been more gradual than that. Things come, things go. You'll see a new restaurant come in and be at the top of its game and everyone says it's the greatest thing since sliced bread, and then the next one comes along and that's that."
The county's largest cities - Belleville and Trenton - are largely blue-collar centres struggling as manufacturers close and throw hundreds out of work. The region has suffered several recent setbacks, including cardboard maker Norampac's decision to close a local plant and Parks Canada cuts that could leave dozens more unemployed along the beautiful Trent-Severn Waterway.
Economic development officials have spent much of the last two decades rebranding the area with tourism in mind, mindful of the need to diversify. They've got a lot to work with - Lake Ontario is at its most dramatic near Sandbanks National Park, dozens of wineries dot the landscape and the region's farmers provide a smorgasbord of organic and meticulously cultivated crops.
While the region has attracted its share of high-end restaurants, not all have found success. One noted failure was Harvest, founded by noted Toronto chef Michael Potters and closed within five years of its much heralded opening. Mayor Peter Mertens says businesses come and businesses go, but it hasn't been a lack of clientele that has determined their fates.
"It generally hasn't been because of product offerings," he says when asked about Mr. Stober's prospects. "In a lot of cases it can be difficult on families, and that usually doesn't have anything to do with business plans. Whether you're a high-profile person or not, it takes a lot of work to make something like this a success and it doesn't happen overnight."
For Mr. Stober, success is something of an afterthought. He appears bored by questions about profits and brand, and waves off questions about the broader corporate world.
"Who will the customer be? We don't know," he says. "All we know is that we can prime the canvas, and then wait to see who makes it their own - that alone will be one of the best artistic moments."

Full text: Popular Peggy's Cove beacon one of about 500 in Canada that needs a heritage designation to avoid possible demolition
Except for the nine years he spent in Ontario, where he was desperately homesick for the sea and salt air, Ivan Fraser has lived his entire 67 years along Peggy's Cove Road in the shadow of one of Canada's maritime icons.
Mr. Fraser, a retired printer, today scrapes together a living selling his paintings and photographs of the Peggy's Cove lighthouse. The idea that the beacon on Nova Scotia's South Shore, visited by more than 500,000 tourists each year, faces an uncertain future is, he says, simply "devastating."
"Where is the thinking? Why didn't the government snap that up, bingo! Get it cleaned up, open it up," Mr. Fraser says. "People should be able to go into that. It's a crying shame."
The Peggy's Cove lighthouse, badly in need of paint and repairs, is one of some 500 Canadian lighthouses that the federal government has declared surplus as it gets out of the business of owning and maintaining what have become, for the most part, outdated navigational aids. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans, which is responsible for the lighthouses, wants to replace them with simple metal or Fibreglas poles with lights on them.
If communities or other levels of government do not petition Ottawa for heritage designation by May 29 - a designation that would ensure that a lighthouse would not be altered architecturally and could not be sold or transferred without public consultation - many of Canada's maritime monuments could be blown up, burnt down or bulldozed.
In Nova Scotia, about 70 lighthouses are at risk, 21 of which are the subject of petitions for heritage designation. No one, however, has filed one for Peggy's Cove.
Former B.C. senator Pat Carney has become one of the leading forces in the bid to save Canada's lighthouses, sponsoring the federal Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act, which came into effect in May, 2010. She notes that Peggy's Cove draws thousands of tourists each year, and lighthouses, as major attractions, are important economic drivers: "They have social and economic development potential for very distressed coastal communities."
In Ms. Carney's native province, the job of getting heritage designations has been easier - notwithstanding the high-profile advocacy of a former senator - because only 18 lighthouses have been declared surplus. B.C. also received money through the federal economic stimulus plan to repair a handful of its lighthouses. Nova Scotia has seen no such government largesse.
"I don't want to cry the blues," says Barry MacDonald, president of the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society. "But I would pose the questions to Canadians: Money got spent in the West, why not the East?"
Lighthouse preservation groups, including the Heritage Canada Foundation, had hoped that DFO would partner with communities to preserve the structures. But the department appears uninterested.
"We don't need to own them any more," says Andrew Anderson, the DFO official in charge of real property, safety and security. "The technology that supports navigational systems has evolved pretty rapidly over the course of the last number of years and it's gotten to an extent that we don't need to own large structures or real estate."
Mr. MacDonald says his society will put in a petition to save the Peggy's Cove lighthouse if no other group comes forward before May 29. On Friday, he met with his local MLA to discuss the issue, and he's travelling to Ottawa next week to talk to federal ministers.
Still, Mr. MacDonald marvels at the complacency of Maritime communities when it comes to preserving their heritage. In Peggy's Cove, which has only about 60 families, there is a view, he believes, that "as long as the government will look after it, we don't have to."
"People just think, 'Well, they've always been here, they'll always be there because the government has always been there taking care of them,' " Mr. MacDonald says. "But the times they are a-changing. This is the wake-up call for communities to step up ... because we're going to lose part of our history."

Brawny Modernism, hard-hat heritage

Full text: Designer Johnson Chou takes the rough materials of a hard loft and adds a taste of macho
jmays@globeandmail.com
After a half-century of trying to civilize us men, feminists and their allies among the interior designers and architects have largely succeeded in taking the hard edge off traditional modernist alpha-male aesthetics.
This shift in taste from tough to easy-going is evident in the ascendance of the relaxed, open-plan interior over gender-based spatial schemes (the kitchen as mom's territory, the living room as dad's), and in the general popularity of softer, more domesticated fabric, paint and stone finishes. In most renovations I'm seeing around Toronto these days, simplicity of line is still cherished, but the old high-contrast austerity and strict tailoring and swank of high modernism (which was a very male business) seem, by and large, to have gone the way of the flat-top haircut and Old Spice.
Every now and then, however, I come across a new Toronto residential interior with gender politics rather different from those I more frequently encounter. The one I have in mind today can only be described as male, or at least male in the sense that word carried circa 1960 - as forthrightly masculine, in fact, as Mad Men 's Don Draper, and as suave, self-assured and sensuous as James Bond in black tie.
Crafted by Toronto designer Johnson Chou, the overhauled one-bedroom, two-level penthouse in the Candy Factory is the local pied-a-terre of a successful businessman who also resides in Ontario's cottage country and in London. The suite Mr. Chou has delivered to his client is a composition of luxurious materials drawn into strong, sleek forms, and of sharply contrasting darks and lights, with sombre tones and textures predominating.
On entering the 2.700-square-foot apartment through the front door, which is padded with white leather to dampen noise in the public corridor, the visitor is immediately treated to vivid sculptural forms and visual sensations. A tall, undulating curtain of luxe, mirror-polished ebony rises on one side of the door, for example, concealing a closet and a small washroom before straightening out and sweeping into the spartan kitchen area. There, the lines of a long, massive black granite island carry the eye forward to the spiral metal stair, a dense affair painted a gleaming black.
Situated beyond the stair, near the large south-facing windows of the apartment, the great wooden slab of the dining table seems almost baronial, and would surely appear to be over-scaled were the object not surrounded by furnishings and architectural elements (such as the white-painted brick arcade separating the living and dining areas) that are as assertive as it is.
The shape of the suite's main level is unusual, somewhat like that of a hammer: long and narrow near the entrance, becoming broader as one approaches the windows. Mr. Chou has emphasized this spatial variation by raising and lowering the floor here and there, in this way creating a distinctive, different place for each dimension of his client's programme for dwelling.
The spare living-room area, for instance, takes the form of a sunken conversation pit. The atmosphere here is serious, even slightly formal. The shadowy book-lined study, with handsome shelving designed by Mr. Chou and a heavy desk framed by elephant tusks, is perched a few steps above the living room, standing separate and aloof. The foot of the spiral stair (which leads up to the bedroom and out to the spacious deck) touches down on a high platform fashioned from wood and back-lit translucent glass. Lighting, recessed under the cantilevered steps and edges demarcating each level, emphasizes the transitions that make passage through the space a lively experience.
The result of Mr. Chou's careful attention to detail and effective capture of a certain broad-shouldered male sensibility in the stuff of architecture and interior design is thoughtful and certainly dramatic. But, for the record, he had interesting bones to work with.
The Candy Factory was one of this city's earliest conversions of an industrial structure into a stack of condominium lofts, and several attractive features of the original building - high, rugged wooden ceilings and sandblasted timber pillars, thick brick arches separating bays, large windows - were retained when the transformation took place. Mr. Chou has respected the hard-hat heritage of the factory, using its old, sturdy elements to counterpoint the chic, sophisticated materials and shapes he has introduced. The combination works.
Maybe it's just the unreconstructed modernist in me talking - I came of age, after all, in the 1950s - but this project made me a little nostalgic for the long-ago days when masculinity like James Bond's was still in vogue.

I've been duped.
I went to meet intern architect Sony Rai to get a taste of the Jane's Walk he'll lead on Sunday May 6 at 11 a.m., "Albion Road, Exploring the Fringe and its Food," on the promise of eating curry - lots and lots of curry.
And despite opening my salivating mouth to a number Indian delights, Mr. Rai delivered a great deal of eye-openers as well. Sneaky. Here, on what was a forgotten fringe of failed factories, threadbare strip plazas, towers-in-the-park and a smattering of tidy 1960s bungalows, are some of the most interesting examples of adaptive reuse I've ever seen.
"I grew up here," began the affable 39-year-old while standing in front of the large Sikh Spiritual Centre at Carrier Drive and Highway 27, which still resembles the Canadian Tire it was in a former life.
Mr. Rai then painted a picture of 1980s Rexdale as a thriving, middle-class manufacturing centre sucker-punched in the early 1990s by recession and the loss of major employers to the greener, lower-tax pastures of Vaughan. "You just saw a downturn in the look and feel of the place," he says.
But this community did not wallow in self-pity long. Handed a number of architectural sow's ears, silk purses now abound in these industrial husks: in addition to Sikh temples, there are specialty grocers, furniture stores, ethnic restaurants and other independent merchants, all involved in the ongoing transformation. "So there's become this line of traffic of people coming on the weekends," he explains. "What it's spurred is a lot of the retail along Westmore Drive, so it's become a destination."
Our second stop was a South Asian grocery store beside a popular flea market - both located on Highway 27 in what Mr. Rai remembers as an abandoned factory - where we prepared for our two-hour walk with a bag of plump, delicious samosas. On the way out, Mr. Rai pointed to the cornucopia of imported products, including Lays "Magic Masala" potato chips and more traditional staples. "My mom, back when we were growing up, she had to make paneer, which is labour intensive but delicious," he laughs, "but now you wouldn't imagine doing any of that stuff."
After we toured the bustling flea market - a low-risk place for newbie retailers to gain valuable experience - we walked to Albion Road to see a large strip plaza under construction. "For other places, it's almost a dying form," he offered. But not here. Then, it was into Singh Food Centre/Crispy Pizza (a former Pizza Hut), for a spicy bowl of aloo tikki on chana masala and a cup of tea (which comes out of the urn pre-sweetened and with milk, cloves and cardamom).
After showing off the tandoori oven in Tandoori Time restaurant - which still wears its former KFC architectural clothes - we walked through a pleasant late-1960s townhouse complex, past a few 1970s high-rises (now awaiting permits to build townhouses on the edge of their properties) and then through an enclave of single-family homes so Mr. Rai could illustrate how these housing typologies are all within a stone's throw of one another. "It's a place that allows you to move from rental to purchaser," he offered. "It's got an unusual mix of housing types, which also parallels the loose scattering of the retail."
Of interest to me in particular were homes on streets such as Elmvale Crescent and Silverstone Drive: solid post-and-beamers and split-levels with carports surrounded by mature trees providing ample shade.
"This was another victim of the recession," said Mr. Rai as we approached the halfway point of the tour, the Albion Centre mall. After losing its mainstream stores in the 1990s, the owners decided to subdivide the retail units to make them affordable to one-off businesses. Meanwhile, the multiplex cinema became a Bollywood-only house.
After a lengthy trek east along Albion (wear comfortable shoes), we arrived at the older commercial hub clustered around Islington Avenue. Rubbing retail elbows in old strip plazas are sari shops, roti restaurants, medical and law offices, beauty salons and jewelers. "Of course a lot of this is based on the whole wedding industry," he laughs. "Buying the sari, buying the jewellery, a lot of that drives the [local] economy."
At one curious place, Royal Paan, we were offered a DVD rental or a lassi, the popular Indian yogurt drink (we chose the latter). We finish with more food at Rajdhani Sweets & Restaurant, but I won't ruin the surprise of what Jane's Walkers will eat there, except to say that a highlight was watching Mr. Rai demonstrate the proper way to eat pani puri.
Jane's Walks work because they celebrate the ordinary rather than the extraordinary. They work because guides are local, enthusiastic and don't sweep problems under the rug: Mr. Rai isn't out to convince walkers that Rexdale is pedestrian-friendly - it isn't. He doesn't try to prove the area's former factories or strip plazas are beautiful - they're not.
But something beautiful has been made out of them: community. And if it takes curry to entice non-locals to understand that, then I'm one happy dupe.

The Action: This detached, brick house collected multiple offers from Etobicoke locals and shoppers from neighbouring cities in GTA West.
What They Got: In the last three years, this mid-1960s residence became larger and more lavish with a new family room constructed with an electric fireplace, vaulted ceilings and entry to the garage and kitchen, which was also redressed with granite, glass and stainless steel finishes, as well as hardwood floors and crown mouldings like the living and dining areas.
* The basement was refinished with a floor-to-ceiling gas fireplace in the recreation room and a laundry area with heated floors and a patio door.
* Upstairs, there are four bedrooms, including one with entry to the smallest of three updated bathrooms.
The Agent's Take: "It was an extremely attractive, updated home," agent JoAnne Gludish said. "There was a breezeway between the garage and the house that they converted into a family room, which worked really well."
Buyers were also a fan of the setting of the 48-by-116-foot corner lot.
"It's in Richmond Gardens, which is a planned community, so it's truly a residential area, but well located to the highway and good shopping," Ms. Gludish said..
"It only has a side yard - not a backyard - but it was a very pretty side yard."

Full text: Cassels Brock & Blackwell files counter-claim as it faces conflict-of-interest allegations over GM bailout
jgray@globeandmail.com
Cassels Brock & Blackwell LLP is suing close to 150 law firms and lawyers across Canada as it faces conflict-of-interest allegations in a closely watched lawsuit.
The Bay Street law firm is a defendant in a $750-million class-action suit launched by more than 200 former GM car dealers against General Motors of Canada Ltd. over the rapid-fire shutdown of their businesses in 2009, as the car maker sought a government bailout and teetered on the brink of bankruptcy.
That original lawsuit accuses GM of using "shock and awe" tactics to pressure the dealers into agreeing to close their businesses in just a few days, allegedly violating franchise laws. The suit also alleges that Cassels had an "undisclosed conflict-of-interest" in the case.
The suit alleges that Cassels advised both the auto dealers' association and the Canadian government on the matter, as Ottawa was allegedly pressuring GM to cut its number of dealerships to receive a bailout and avoid bankruptcy. The allegations have not been proven in court.
In response, Cassels has filed a claim against almost 150 lawyers and law firms across Canada.
Cassels' claim targets the lawyers from whom the individual GM dealers were required to seek independent advice when they were given just six days, over the Victoria Day weekend in May, 2009, to accept their "wind-down agreements" from General Motors.
Cassels' claim, filed late last year, demands that any damages it is forced to pay to the auto dealers should be instead covered by this list of lawyers; the claim also seeks legal costs for Cassels.
The list ranges from Cassels' Bay Street rivals to small-town solo lawyers, and other unknown lawyers it identifies as "John Doe." If any harm were done, the claim alleges, it was because of those lawyers' "negligence," not Cassels.
The class-action suit's allegation that Cassels was wrong in acting both for the federal government and for the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association has attracted wide attention in legal circles, because it raises fundamental questions about conflicts of interest.
The way the profession deals with conflicts has been a source of contention for years, especially as law firms merge into larger entities more likely to end up with clients with opposing interests.
David Sterns, a Toronto class-action lawyer with Sotos LLP acting for the GM dealers in their lawsuit, calls Cassels' move to sue nearly 150 lawyers unprecedented. "For one law firm to be suing that many other law firms is pretty unusual," Mr. Sterns said.
Cassels declined Tuesday to comment on the case. Lawyers and law firms on the list contacted on Tuesday also declined to comment.
Claims such as this one are usually handled by the insurers that provide lawyers with their malpractice policies.
The original case against GM and Cassels was certified, or given a green light as a class action, by Mr. Justice George Strathy of the Ontario Superior Court last year.
Judge Strathy said in his decision that he recognized the $750-million action may be "an embarrassment" to the Bay Street law firm. But he refused a request that the case against Cassels be put on hold pending the result of the fight against GM.
Both GM and Cassels lost appeals of the certification decision in Divisional Court, in rulings released in March. Cassels is now seeking permission to appeal that ruling before the Ontario Court of Appeal.
Jerry Gazarek, 71, lost both of his family dealerships in Pickering, Ont., east of Toronto, where he had sold cars for 32 years. He said he only had a few days to find a local lawyer to look over the wind-down agreements from GM over the holiday weekend in May, 2009, which he said was not enough time.
He said he had spent more than $5-million on renovations to his main dealership at GM's behest in 2006. And the $600,000 he received from GM under the wind-down agreement, he said, was barely enough to cover the costs of terminating his nearly 100 employees.
Mr. Gazarek said that while he decided to sell his real estate to cover his costs and retire, some of his fellow dealers ended up in much worse financial shape.
"They gave us three or four working days to surrender our lives," he said. "'Get independent legal advice by your local solicitor and get it in by Tuesday or we'll go bankrupt and you won't get anything.' Talk about a gun to your head."

China's private-sector recovery hinges on government ties

Full text: State-owned business accounts for as much as half of national GDP
In China's heavily connected business world, some private enterprises are finding if they can't beat the state-owned behemoths that dominate the economy, they should simply join them.
Private enterprises have largely regained the share of China's economy lost after the 2008 financial crisis, but are doing so in part by mimicking their state-owned counterparts' behaviour when it comes to forging state and Communist Party connections.
"Today the winning recipe is more complex: It requires both integration with the national economy and blending into the political mainstream," Scott Kennedy, director of the Research Centre for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University, wrote in a research report entitled "Pink Capitalists in Bloom."
In 2008, as China's roaring economic engine began to quiet under the strain of global recession, the central government unveiled a 4-trillion yuan ($586-billion at the time) stimulus package to keep its economy growing.
It worked, but at a price for the private sector, unable to compete with state-owned enterprises getting cheap bank loans.
Then, with inflation, bank lending tightened. Even the limited lending available to private firms was gone and in cities like Wenzhou, famous for its entrepreneurial spirit, factories began closing and owners fled the country or even committed suicide to avoid the shame of bankruptcy.
Last fall, central policy makers stepped in with bailouts and, in Wenzhou, an experimental project to formalize some grey-market lending is in the works.
Now, six months on, Prof. Kennedy argues that with the exception of real estate and construction, in which private firms have lost ground, the private sector has generally weathered the storm better than most realize. And the most successful firms often look very much like their state-owned counterparts when it comes to their larger business bases and their connections.
"I think a significant number of them made peace with the system so they are not trying to operate at the margins of the economy," Prof. Kennedy said in an interview in Beijing.
Many successful private enterprises have former government officials as founders or managers; it is considered standard practice in many places for entrepreneurs to be Communist Party members and to form Party committees in their firms, Prof. Kennedy said. Business leaders are also becoming more prominent as delegates to their local or national People's Congress, the formal legislating body in China's authoritarian one-party system.
At the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government advisory body closely linked with many ministries, there is acknowledgment that despite much official encouragement, the private side of China's economy is still facing roadblocks.
"Overall, China's private economy has significantly developed in recent years, but we have seen that the private economy has come across many hindrances in the process," said Ju Jinwen, a professor in the Institute of Economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government advisory body closely linked with many ministries.
State-owned enterprise still makes up 40 to 50 per cent of GDP, Prof. Ju said. In the United States, its economic contribution would be 6 to 7 per cent, while in most of Europe, it runs about 10 per cent, he said.
Restrictions against private enterprise remain in monopoly industries like railways and aviation, as well as in natural resource industries like mining and oil. Access to financing is also limited; banks are set up to deal with large-scale, state-owned enterprises and even the corporate bond market is dominated by state-owned companies.
Ideally, Prof. Ju said, Chinese policy makers would like to shrink the state-owned enterprise share of the economy to 20 to 25 per cent - but that process may take as long as a decade.

Ghost malls haunt China's real estate market

Full text: As developers try to cash in on the expected shopping spree of the growing middle class, empty stores are often the result
To see evidence of a slowing in the retail leasing market in China, you only need to take a lonely stroll through the basement level of Sanlitun SOHO, a much-anticipated development in a prime area of central Beijing.
Stationed at the top of a long, empty corridor, Flour patisserie and bistro should be serving coffee, sandwiches and cakes to the well-heeled foreign and local office workers and diplomats from nearby embassies and offices.
Instead, server Huang Xiuxiu is lolling behind a counter, the strains of a Nora Jones ballad echoing in the empty hallway.
"The structure of this area is confusing. It's hard for a customer to remember how to find us," said the 23-year-old, explaining the empty shop. "The business here is not very good ... It takes time for people to get to know there is a new shop in a new mall."
The many half-empty corridors of this complex of five sprawling towers, which has been open two years, is an indication of a wider trend, retail analysts are beginning to warn. Caught up in the heady rush of the world's largest consumer market and a booming economy, Chinese retail developers may have built too much, too quickly.
"It's all happening a little bit too fast so there's no opportunity to say this ... is becoming oversupplied; there's no chance to catch a breath and look at how the market is developing, because you have to move fast in this market," said James Hawkey, executive director of retail services for Cushman and Wakefield in China.
Though Mr. Hawkey cautioned against too much pessimism in what is still the world's fastest-growing consumer market, he said second-tier cities in particular will notice more vacant shop fronts in the next year or two as a result of overeager developers.
"In the next few years there will be lots of new supply of office and retail and some of it will experience some problems. The more experienced developers ... will suffer less and their projects will, generally speaking, be successful. Some of the smaller developers ... may have trouble attracting powerful international brands to keep their developments going," Mr. Hawkey said.
China's residential market still makes up 70 per cent of all real estate activity and, until last fall, was roaring into what many predicted was a massive bubble. Fuelled by an air of general excitement, easy money under loose bank lending policies, and the promise of the world's big brands moving into China, developers turned their eye to retail and commercial projects.
Now those projects are coming of age as the country's gross domestic product growth rate is slowing, with a government target of 7.5 per cent this year.
"As with anything in China, you see a lot of the herd mentality. But some of that unbridled bullishness towards commercial [real estate] has cooled a bit," said Michael Klibaner, regional director and head of China research for Jones Lang Lasalle.
Some flashy new developments are poaching tenants from older buildings, leaving them empty and echoing. In others projects, poor management has failed to attract tenants. It's common for developers to sell retail space piecemeal to individual owners, as they would with residences, but a single, small-scale owner has little hope of attracting a big brand to that space.
A short walk from Sanlitun SOHO, for example, another mall, the Village, is considered one of Beijing's more successful developments in part because Swire Properties, a leading Asian property developer and manager, has been able to attract flagship tenants including adidas and Apple.
That means staff at the Mai Tian leasing company in Sanlitun SOHO have their work cut out for them. They say occupancy rates in the complex range from 20 to 80 per cent, building by building.
"The market is getting better," said Saya He, Mai Tian's team leader, adding that the complex's occupancy rate has picked up since they first started trying to lease its shops nearly three years ago.
Some of a glut of retail space may be temporary, until the buying power of China's expanding middle class catches up to the shops around them.
"Demand is growing really quickly in China. Retail sales of 17 per cent in 2011 ... is still a pretty significant number. But supply is growing even faster," Mr. Hawkey said. "The retail market in China is one of the investment opportunities of this century, I believe. The problem is, everyone has seen that."

Full text: Renewable energy may have met its loudest foe yet, with 'The Donald' threatening to take his millions elsewhere if turbines ruin the view from his new golf course. Will climate change trump tourism? Elizabeth Renzetti sticks her finger in the wind to find out
In the battle between those two great forces of nature, Donald Trump and the Scottish wind, you might want to put your money on the one that blows so fiercely and relentlessly. On the other hand, you might want to back the wind.
Mr. Trump was in Scotland this week to protest the installation of wind turbines four kilometres off the coast of Aberdeenshire, in direct sightline of golfers playing the new course he will open in July ($300 for 18 holes, slightly less for locals.) In his usual fashion, Mr. Trump did not conserve his own energy while criticizing the Scottish government's enthusiasm for wind power: "It will be the destruction of Scotland if this madness continues." He then pooh-poohed the idea that climate change was caused by humans, and went on to compare Scotland's commitment to wind farms to its decision to release the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, from prison.
You can perhaps see why Mr. Trump is such a divisive figure in Scotland, where his £750-million luxury resort and golf course just north of Aberdeen has earned him a bucket load of foes and fans alike. Those opposing sides were out in force in Edinburgh to greet Mr. Trump after his testimony before the Scottish parliament's Economy, Energy and Tourism committee. His supporters carried signs that said, "Tourism, not Turbines." His foes banged drums and called the New York real-estate mogul a windbag. A member of a group called WIGS (Wind is Good Scotland) held an orange balloon over Mr. Trump's head so that his famously dense coiffure was drawn, as if by magic, into the air.
The ballyhoo outside Holyrood - at one point, police had to keep the pro- and anti-wind factions apart - was compelling political theatre, but also indicated just how vitriolic the fight over wind power is becoming in Great Britain. Does a country that sells itself on its unspoiled scenery and majestic castles want to trade that landscape for the promise of renewable electricity? (The UK is committed to getting 15 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020, up from almost 10 per cent now; Scotland has a much loftier goal of 100 per cent renewable in the next eight years.)
From one end of the UK to the other, there are fights brewing over the placement of wind turbines in historic or picturesque locations. Ironically, some of the most heated battles involve battlefields: There may soon be turbines built at Naseby, where Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army defeated King Charles I's troops in 1645, and the site of the battle of Hyddgen in mid-Wales, where the nationalist hero Owain Glyndwr trounced English forces in 1401.
Apart from Mr. Trump's fight, the highest-profile wind-farm contretemps is happening on "the wild and windy moor" (as Kate Bush sang) where Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw fell in love. A 60-metre high test mast will soon go up near Top Withens, the ruined house set in desolate moorland that inspired Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights . The Bronte Parsonage Museum, located in the house where Emily, Charlotte and their siblings grew up, joined the campaign against the mast, which it fears could lead to the construction of four giant wind turbines.
"One of the things that draws people here is the landscape," said Andrew McCarthy, director of the museum, which hosts 80,000 visitors a year. "People do want to go out onto the moors and experience the wilderness that the Brontës knew. The proliferation of wind turbines within that landscape is at odds with that."
By far the biggest tempest is swirling around the east coast of Scotland, 25 km north of Aberdeen, where the Swedish company Vattenfall is leading a multinational coalition to build 11 wind turbines - "monstrosities" and "ugly windmills" in Trump-speak - a few kilometres off the coast.
Mr. Trump is worried that the turbines will spoil the view from the back nine. He has threatened to take his millions and go home if the wind farm goes ahead: That is, he will not proceed with the controversial luxury hotel and housing development that he had promised to build adjacent to the golf course, which opens on July 10. (And Mr. Trump knows how to hold a golf-course grudge: He once sued a town in California where he was building another course, in part because it refused to rename a road "Trump National Drive.")
The real-estate tycoon assumed the air of a seduced and wounded maiden in Edinburgh this week, saying that he had been "lured" to invest in Scotland by its leader, Alex Salmond, who had promised him that there would be no wind farms in the vicinity. ("Utter nonsense," Mr. Salmond responded.)
"The project is a small one for me, but it's important," Mr. Trump said, after letting slip to members of parliament that his net worth was $7-billion: His resort, where environmentally sensitive dunes were bulldozed to make way for the golf course, is meant to honour his mother Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born on the remote Scottish island of Lewis.
Mr. Salmond would counter that he is merely honouring his promises to voters. The country has one-quarter of Europe's offshore wind potential, which the government claims could lead, eventually, to £30-billion investment in the economy, and as many as 28,000 jobs. But for Mr. Trump, this investment in industry would be offset by a plunge in tourism: "Wind turbines, made in China, are going to be the destruction - almost a total destruction - of your tourism industry," he said. When asked for his evidence, Mr. Trump responded: "I am the evidence. ... I am considered a world-class expert in tourism." This caused pro-turbine MPs to pull out a recent poll taken by Visit Scotland, which showed that 80 per cent of people wouldn't avoid visiting a destination just because a wind farm was nearby.
Mr. Trump's allies in the fight against turbines believe he's right about tourism: "All these special places are being destroyed," says Susan Crosthwaite of Communities Against Turbines Scotland. "Everyone wants to go to these places for their holidays to relax, but you can't relax under a wind farm." Ms. Crosthwaite's group also objects to the expense of wind energy (it is partly subsidized with a levy on electricity bills), and the fact that local councils are "bullied" into accepting turbines. She is worried that the approximately 130 wind farms in Scotland will triple in the near future if all planning applications go ahead.
But it appears the wind is blowing in favour of turbines. At a conference on clean energy in London this week, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced a 20-country deal to co-operate on offshore wind generation and carbon capture. It would be "a second renewable energy revolution in the North Sea," he said, and would be a step towards Mr. Cameron's goal of increasing wind power by almost tenfold, to 18 gigawatts, by 2020. Mr. Trump had better hold onto his hat (and hair.)

Changing Legion looks to unlock its land value

Abstract: "I approached this from the perspective of, 'is this a place I would want to live?'" Mr. [John Blackburn] says. "And when we had the design for Meaford ready, my answer was, 'yes, I certainly would live there.'" Mr. Blackburn says as people age and find their homes too much to cope with, often they are reluctant to sell and move into a hotel-style residence because of the expense. With monthly fees of $3,000 to $5,000, their money can vanish quickly, he says.

Full text: Across Canada, branches of the Royal Canadian Legion face falling membership and tightening budgets. But in the Georgian Bay town of Meaford, plans to create more housing for the age 55-plus crowd is giving the local branch a new chance to thrive.
They had to shut Meaford's old Legion building down a couple of years ago because the organization couldn't afford to pay for necessary repairs. But it will soon open again - in a new building - thanks to an innovative plan to build Royal Manor, a condominium-like development on the Legion's property that's close to the town's business district, green space and waterfront.
"We knew we had to do something if we were going to survive," says former Meaford Legion branch president Ron James. "We were property rich, but cash poor."
John Blackburn, president of Toronto-based BrightStar Corp., is a Legion member himself and, realizing the pressure the organization is under to remain healthy, approached the organization's Ontario Command with a proposal: He would partner with local legion branches to provide housing for seniors under the life-lease model. BrightStar would pay all the upfront costs. The legions would provide the property and in return could use space in the new buildings, and perhaps even gain a few new members.
"I approached this from the perspective of, 'is this a place I would want to live?'" Mr. Blackburn says. "And when we had the design for Meaford ready, my answer was, 'yes, I certainly would live there.'" Mr. Blackburn says as people age and find their homes too much to cope with, often they are reluctant to sell and move into a hotel-style residence because of the expense. With monthly fees of $3,000 to $5,000, their money can vanish quickly, he says.
"Let's face it," he says, "a lot of seniors don't want to put out that money. They'd rather leave it to their children."
With life-lease, buyers still own an asset which they can sell if the day comes that they want to move to a facility that offers some form of care. Or, he says, when that day arrives they can even stay in their life-lease residence and purchase optional packages that offer meal plans, prescription drug dispensing, personal care and housekeeping.
Life lease is more like condominium ownership than it is a "lease." The difference is that title to the units remains with the sponsoring organization - in this case the Meaford Legion. The buyer signs a lease for 49 years and 11 months, the maximum allowed under Ontario law to avoid paying land transfer tax. Owners pay a monthly fee to cover amenities, management and maintenance, just as they would in a condo.
Should a life-lease owner decide to sell, the Legion receives five per cent of the sale price to cover costs and find a buyer - they anticipate there'll be a waiting list - and the seller keeps the rest, including any increase in value.
Mr. Blackburn says with 40 per cent of the suites already spoken for, construction on Royal Manor should commence this summer and residents could begin to move in 14 months later. BrightStar has partnered with a financial institution, which will offer financing options. Meanwhile other legions have been beating a path to Mr. Blackburn's door. The model has been endorsed by the Legion's Ontario Command and the Port Dalhousie branch, which also faces rising costs and falling membership, is eager to join, says first vice-president Brian Bowman.
"We can't wait until they get the shovel in the ground up in Meaford," Mr. Bowman says. "Our board has approved the idea and would love to proceed."
Mr. Bowman adds that a complication they need to deal with first is that the City of St. Catharines, where Port Dalhousie is located, is currently studying an overall development plan for the old port area.
Mr. Blackburn says the next project could be with the Polish Legion branch in downtown St. Catharines. There have also been discussions with Legions from Goderich, Owen Sound and Wiarton and with 400 branches across the province, he believes BrightStar will soon be busy planning new projects based on Meaford, with adjustments in façades and number of suites. Port Dalhousie, for instance, located at the north end of the Old Welland Canal, could sport a nautical theme.
Royal Manor offers 13 unit models ranging from one bedroom to two bedrooms plus den, from 550 to 1,100 square feet, with patios or balconies. Prices range from about $150,000 to $300,000. Units in the four-storey building are aimed at the needs of seniors, with lower countertops, walk-in bathtub/showers, lower light switches and 24-hour, on-site staff. Common facilities will include a media room, library and banquet room and residents will have access to the Legion's bistro-style restaurant.
Royal Manor will be operated by the Legion through a not-for-profit corporation.
BrightStar is also throwing in a one-year membership to the Legion and Mr. Blackburn hopes many will sign up afterward.
Mr. Blackburn, whose BrightStar is building Crates Landing, a four-season lifestyle community on the Keswick waterfront, likes the idea of partnering with the Legion, a trusted entity in small towns right across the country. "We don't want to come across as the big-city developers," he says. "We plan to use local construction as much as possible."
He says many smaller communities need this type of facility for those 55-plus because it's these places where people go to retire after leaving their farms and homes in under-serviced rural areas.

An urban condo aims at a maturing client

Author: John Bentley Mays

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/urban-condo-aims-at-maturing-client/docview/1009800088/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: So far, local condo developers have been slow to address the needs and desires of this maturing cohort. Some tell me they are trying to appeal to this urbane edge of the market by sprinkling a few large apartments into buildings otherwise set up for the usual young singles and no-kid couples. What the entrepreneurs fetch into such units, of course, are empty-nesters, not growing families.

Full text: Edition Richmond's spacious, up-tempo modernity seeks to please a second-generation condo crowd and their budding families
jmays@globeandmail.com
I don't remember exactly when I first heard that Toronto's downtown condominium market was on the verge of going bust, but it was a long time ago. The rumours of impending disaster have become so common, in fact, they should perhaps be regarded as normal features of our boom-time urban culture, like the immense cranes that punctuate the skyline and the plywood hoardings that crowd the sidewalks.
If the condo surge shows no signs of slowing, however, some aspects of it appear to be gradually evolving.
Take, for example, the demographic. High-earning young people, either single or coupled but childless, have flocked into the new downtown towers and the overhauled warehouses during the last 15 years or so, turning formerly desolate industrial districts into hatcheries of affluent, inner-city lifestyles new to Toronto. The conversions and the early wave of condo stacks were developed with such young folk in mind, and the target customers have responded by making the downtown area more densely peopled than it's been since the Second World War.
But many in this first generation of condo-dwellers have outgrown the clubs, bars and boutiques of the city's youth culture, moved up in their professions, become family-minded. They want homes that are more ample than little high-rise apartments, yet they don't want to exile themselves to suburbia. Some want to go on enjoying the efficiency, convenience and central location they have come to appreciate while living in newly-built digs high off the ground.
So far, local condo developers have been slow to address the needs and desires of this maturing cohort. Some tell me they are trying to appeal to this urbane edge of the market by sprinkling a few large apartments into buildings otherwise set up for the usual young singles and no-kid couples. What the entrepreneurs fetch into such units, of course, are empty-nesters, not growing families. By and large, Hogtown remains an unsympathetic place for deep-dyed urban people inclined (and financially able) to go through their child-rearing years in well-appointed, sensitively designed downtown apartments. That said, I occasionally come across a new Toronto residential project pitched seriously and thoughtfully to well-heeled, 30-something graduates of the condo experience in search of a downtown nest. An interesting one that's recently caught my attention is called Edition Richmond.
Designed for developers Adam Ochshorn and Gary Eisen (Curated Properties) by Toronto architect Gianpiero A. Pugliese, 35, founder and principal of AUDAXarchitecture Inc., this low-rise, 20-unit modernist building is slated to go up on the site of a former auto repair shop a block south of Queen Street West and Trinity Bellwoods Park. Once a working-class residential district, more recently a zone dotted by chic shops, galleries and restaurants, the area round about now seems on its way to becoming home turf for Toronto's new informational proletarians and their families.
The suites in Edition Richmond range in size from around 1,000 square feet up to just over 2,000 square feet - quite large enough, that is, to accommodate two grownups and a couple of children who don't object to compact modern living. As for layouts, customers can pick from three formats: two-storey apartments, some with rooftop decks; two-level lofts with fully outfitted basements, and three-storey, three-bedroom townhomes with walk-out roof gardens. The interiors, crafted by the Toronto-based international design firm of Cecconi Simone, are open-plan, functional, well-appointed - exactly what you would expect in a contemporary multi-unit complex.
One touch by Cecconi Simone, however, deserves a special mention: the bathroom off the master bedroom in each townhouse. This essential place is notable, simply because it's large and luxurious, quietly illuminated by a light-shaft descending through the house from the roof, perfect for a long soak in the freestanding tub. It's free, in other words, of the old Toronto prejudice that has long encouraged builders to make bathrooms small and mean, and as inconspicuous as possible. At last: a condo bathroom a home-owner can actually enjoy living in.
Like the townhouse bathroom, Mr. Pugliese's vigorous treatment of the exterior seems aimed at young, design-conscious veterans of relaxed downtown cultures. The geometry of the grey-trimmed white-brick facades is bold and punchy, devoid of historical ornaments or references, and insistent on its up-tempo modernity. The strong vertical elements rise, bend sharply and meet at the summit of the building to form unusual, gazebo-like rooftop pavilions that stand out against the sky.
If Edition Richmond is a market success, and developers catch the wave and multiply projects of this kind, downtown Toronto could some day be full of children again, as it was a century ago. That's a possible outcome of the recent condo boom that I, for one, hope comes to pass.

Abstract: No doubt, buyers were also drawn to new local restaurants, bars and shops popping up on the former brownfield site. "In the last five years, [Liberty Village] has become one of the west end's true, urban lifestyle neighbourhoods," says Mr. [Harman Atkins]. "It's a really good example of successful, urban reclamation."

The Action: No staging was needed to add modern style to this one-bedroom plus den suite, which generated a steady flow of traffic among buyers wanting to move into a loft-inspired high rise in Liberty Village.
What They Got: Built last year in a 20-storey residence, called Bliss, this more than 800-square-foot suite has a two-storey plan with an open living room and kitchen with a granite-topped island, laminate floors and stainless steel appliances, as well as access to a 21-foot long balcony and double height ceilings along the west-facing windows.
* A storage area is hidden beneath the stairs to the second floor, where there are laundry facilities and a master bedroom with entry to one of two bathrooms and a closet that partially separates the den.
* The unit comes with parking and a monthly fee of $461 to cover the cost of water and heating, concierge services and visitor parking, along with a gym, indoor pool, party room and rooftop deck.
The Agent's Take: "That was a two-storey, loft-style suite with huge sets of window banks. Most suites in that building are more typical single-level condo apartments," says agent Harman Atkins. "It was very tastefully decorated as well."
No doubt, buyers were also drawn to new local restaurants, bars and shops popping up on the former brownfield site. "In the last five years, [Liberty Village] has become one of the west end's true, urban lifestyle neighbourhoods," says Mr. Atkins. "It's a really good example of successful, urban reclamation."

Full text:   How can you start a business on the cheap? Do for others what they can't do for themselves
Do you have fresh ideas? No cash? No job? You can't remember life before the Internet? As you read this, you may figure out that your best job prospects are on the computer screen you now use mostly to download movies from BitTorrent while you worry about your future (that is, not having one).
What if someone told you that you can start a business or get a job simply by marketing what you know, and squeezing every dime out of your personal expenses to help devote more money to your business? Would you try? What have you got to lose?
Young people and curious seasoned types with fresh, open minds have a solid foundation on which to build a business. Your best asset is that you don't think like an old man set in his ways. Lots of older people who run businesses need your ability to see something not being done as efficiently as it could be. So, to start a business, think of a result and then backward-engineer a process to achieve it.
You have no money? I know you can start a business without any money. I'm talking about working capital to build an infrastructure. I now have money, and like other people with it, I will pay for information that I don't have. Here's how you can start:
1) Think about how to save somebody money
What do I pay for that you can teach me to do for less or for free? Here's a good example. I thought that my cellphone was too expensive and a friend told me that she could renegotiate my bill. After an hour on the phone with my cell and cable provider, I had the same service for $1,600 less per year. She did that as a favour, but I encouraged her to start a business and charge 25% of the first-year savings. If you sign up 20 new people a month and save them all that much, that's a decent business.
2) Don't waste time
I don't watch TV or surf the Net until I've exhausted all the work I need to do. Time wasted is money wasted. Keep a detailed log of what you do every hour of the day. Cut out wasted time and replace it with activities that will make you richer or smarter. Do you get up early? Do somebody's shopping for them at an all-night grocery store and charge them.
3) Trade skills
If you cut hair for a living and need a website designed, find a web designer who needs haircuts. If you can take photographs and need a laptop, find a computer store that sells used computers and needs better photos for its site. Catch my drift?
4) Use online information aggregators to identify opportunities and customers
Online word of mouth is a great thing. You can be in Nelson, B.C., Yellowknife or in your underwear in your basement in Corner Brook and start a page on a social network or place a classified ad on Kijiji to explain what you can do. Find me a place to get cheap business cards, cheap winter tires or a flight to Marrakesh for my next holiday, or do some other research for me. You can be an information slave to one person or many. And get a PayPal account so you can get paid.
I didn't come up with this idea. Users of cheap labour congregate on sites like Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Check out what people are asking others to do, and see how they are paying for it.
Or identify something they aren't doing yet but might want to do as they expand their own businesses. Barbara Edwards was an assistant in a Toronto fine art gallery who began approaching respected local artists to represent them in a new gallery that she hadn't actually opened. After she got a small space, she wrote to the estate managers of several big-name deceased U.S. artists, asking if she could represent them in Canada. After meeting her, a couple of them agreed.
I spoke to Edwards about her lack-of-cash experience at an artist opening recently. Everything in her gallery looked expensive. I asked her how far her apartment was from her work. She sheepishly pulled a heavy curtain back. There was her bed and clothes closet. She had renovated what was a rough-and-ready space by herself. The gallery kitchen doubled as her personal kitchen. Nice. The art she shows comes on consignment. She hustles. She can afford her own place now, but she still lives there.
I did it, too. Ten years ago, I had lots of ideas and knew some stuff about business. I wrote several articles online for free and then sent them to editors at this paper. They gave me a try. Now I get paid to give advice.
Write me at dsteiner@globeandmail.com and tell me your no-money-to-success story. I'll convince my editor to let me write about you. He'll pay me and you'll get free publicity. You get it now? Once you start hustling using your brain, and see the fruits of your labour, you'll never stop.

Abstract: It was a bachelor's dream come true: a month of Sundays. The key was [Mark McIntyre] himself, who reflected what you might call the aggressive average-ness of middle Canada. "He didn't have chiselled abs," says Angus Tucker, a partner at John St. "He probably had an extra 20 pounds on him. He wasn't shy about it, or weird about it. He was just like, 'This is what I look like in my underwear.'"

Full text:   It's been a buzz term for years, but the most effective ways for businesses to use social media remain elusive. Can the right ideas lead to sales, or are tools such as Facebook and Twitter strictly about creating awareness? These six Canadian small businesses have built substantial, sustained campaigns with remarkable impact. Here's how they did it, and what you can learn from them.
FreshBooks: Keep a foot in the real world
To get potential members to sign up for its virtual communities, the company takes real-world road trips.
FreshBooks never wanted to keep social media in a box. It took it on the road.
The online invoicing and bookkeeping company's original customer base was part of a crowd of social-media web-heads, the type who converge every year at the annual South by Southwest Interactive festival in Austin, Texas. So in 2008, founder Mike McDerment and a handful of staffers launched a stunt that bridged old and new media: They flew to Florida, rented an RV painted in the company's colours, and took a road trip to Austin, talking to as many people as possible at real-world events and local hangouts - and blogged the whole thing.
That first adventure, detailed online, drummed up interest at the conference and helped brand FreshBooks as a business willing to use every medium it could to connect.
Today, FreshBooks has 4.5 million users, but it still blends online social-media and real-world outreach every day. The company eschews any single approach. If you talk about FreshBooks on Twitter, it will talk back. If you want to make a feature request, join its web forums. Stuart MacDonald, the company's chief marketing officer, cheerfully relates a moment from late last year when hundreds of users piled on to the FreshBooks blog to sound off on a design change that had been made there, prompting the business to change course.
"We're really lucky to have such passionate users," says MacDonald. "When we do something they like, they let us know. When we do something they don't like, they let us know."
When reaching out to specific groups - such as chartered accountants - the company will host in-person events across the continent, then sign up members to digital communities and pinpoint them on online maps of the world that are posted on the FreshBooks site.
And the company has kept on trucking. The most recent trip took employees up America's west coast, hopping from event to event. Whenever they arrive in a new town, they send out word that users are welcome to join them for a drink or dinner - say, in the corner of a pub in Portland. Hundreds might come and go, and for the company it's a source of priceless feedback.
"For the price of buying people a beer or a soft drink, you get to hear what's on their mind." - Ivor Tossell
Takeaway
"We talk about social media like it's a web thing.
But social media is people talking to each other."

Pythian: Cut out the middleman
A company that depends on highly skilled employees is able to reach talented job seekers with creative uses of LinkedIn, blogging and networking.
For many firms, the talent search is an exercise in frustration that never abates, and it often involves hiring expensive headhunters. But Ottawa database services and consulting company Pythian has succeeded in using social-media channels to bring skilled people to its doors, cutting out the HR middlemen.
Founder Paul Vallee says Pythian was into social networking long before the term existed, embedding itself in the programmer world with a combination of e-mail lists and technology conferences.
In recent years, the company has aggressively beefed up its blog and its LinkedIn presence to make sure its name is planted on the lips of ambitious programmers. Every employee can contribute to Pythian's popular (and publicly accessible) tech blog - posting useful information about the database management sector is literally part of every job description. "We let people tell their genuine stories," says Vallee. "It's that genuine voice that...attracts them to work for us." According to director of human resources Heidi Hauver, applicants point out that they regularly read Pythian's blog, and many candidates come through the firm's referral program.
The company has further consolidated its reach into the global talent pool by actively using a range of LinkedIn features. Pythian encourages employees to keep their profiles current, and then monitors their professional contact lists for potential recruits through cross-referencing. The company's blog entries are also posted to its corporate LinkedIn page. And in 2009, Pythian launched two LinkedIn groups, which provide a forum for company-sponsored networking discussions geared toward database systems professionals. They now have about 6,000 participants.
Some members gather for beer and food at Pythian meet-and-greets during trade shows. "Both of these groups are rich, rich feeding grounds for finding candidates," says Vallee. - John Lorinc
Takeaway
Skip the recruitment firms and hire the best of the best on your own. Vallee says the key is authenticity.
"The power of social media comes from people connecting to people."

John Henry Bikes: The plural of client is "community"
Why use social media to generate sales when channels such as Twitter and Facebook can help retain clients and engage customers?
Willie Cromack, a principal with John Henry Bikes, a full-service bike shop in North Vancouver, admits he reluctantly launched a company Facebook page three years ago, and grappled with finding the right stance for the site.
Facebook, at the time, seemed "very juvenile" to him, and he thought his efforts would be a waste of time. He soon realized that if the voice of the page was "authentic" and true to the store's mission statement ("Live to ride"), it was valuable. "The business has to be like a person," he says.
Cromack has also succeeded in building a large follower base of about 12,000 on Twitter. From the beginning, he and his partners decided to take a highly disciplined approach to their feed so that their tweets would be relevant to the John Henry Bikes community. Cromack avoids bantering with customers - if there's a lot of back-and-forth, he'll tell someone to call the shop - and he tends not to post overt sales pitches.
He recalls how, as part of its charity work, the shop sent two mechanics to Uganda to help repair bikes. When they tweeted those experiences, "we got nothing but re-tweets. When we tweet a new product, it's like, 'who cares?'" For that kind of messaging, John Henry Bikes still relies heavily on conventional radio advertising.
Cromack points out that ever since the store opened in 1992, it has aimed to build a community by hosting events and running summer biking excursions and adventure camps for kids. The Twitter and Facebook presence, in turn, allows Cromack to reinforce those customer experiences by posting or tweeting their pictures.
"It's building a virtual club, if you will. That's how we want to treat it: 'Buy from us if you believe in us.'" - J.L.
Takeaway
Be relevant and consistent, and formulate a cohesive strategy that will attract a following to your social-media messaging.

Algonquin Outfitters: Everyone loves a prize
Contests are a major traffic driver for Algonquin Outfitters, encouraging customers to engage with its website all year long, not just during seasonal peaks.
When Randy Mitson first proposed running a photo contest at Algonquin Outfitters - the largest chain of outdoor equipment suppliers for people heading into Ontario's Algonquin Park - his bosses fretted that the idea was too rooted in the age of film cameras and newsletters.
"Oh, we did that and it kind of ran its course," Mitson's colleagues responded. "The last one got six pictures."
But the company's director of marketing persisted, and he posted details of a contest online, urging customers to send in their favourite vacation snaps. The best would be judged by a celebrity panel in exchange for outdoor goods. On cue, more than 100 entries materialized.
Today, Mitson has amassed thousands of submitted photos, which adorn the company website. For each contest, he pinpoints the location for each photo on a Google map of the park. "The map gets the most hits," he says. "It's not the winners, it's the map."
It's a win-win: Even entrants who lose get the satisfaction of having contributed to the site, while the company gets extra traffic driven to its page. Entrants are prompted to opt in to company newsletters, which are critical for future promotions, and contest winners become the next round's judges. Mitson uses a web service called Wildfire to manage the logistics of running contests, and that spares him from having to worry about uploading, storing and processing users' photos. Wildfire runs in a frame on the Algonquin Outfitters website and on Facebook.
Algonquin Outfitters has been running contests year-round since 1998: three photo competitions a year, an annual video contest, and frequent sweepstakes and giveaways, often using donated promotional goods. Contests might not be the first thing that springs to mind when you say "social media," but they can be a practical way to engage with customers, which is what social media is all about.
At seasonal peaks, Algonquin Outfitters employs upward of 100 people at 12 outlets scattered around the region. There's lots to photograph in Algonquin Park. And it can't do any harm to remind customers of prettier times ahead during the off-season.
Contest ideas can come from anywhere. Early this year, Mitson was busy reformatting the Facebook page for the new Timeline view, which required use of a large-format banner image. Where to find it? Through a contest, of course. - I.T.
Takeaway
Highlight your company's core appeal - in this case, a beautiful setting - and design a contest to showcase it. Everybody wins.

Martell Home Builders: Bang for your buck
YouTube videos that highlight the company's expertise, combined with other web-based brand-building and customer-service techniques, slashed Martell's sales cycle and improved the client experience.
When Pierre Martell, 30, started his Moncton-based home-building firm six years ago, he had no name recognition, brand awareness or even a track record. But the mechanic and part-time renovator understood the stress experienced by many new homebuyers: Their builders invariably finish late and over budget. Martell's goal was to build a brand around delivering projects on time and on budget.
Soon after establishing his fledging firm's website, Martell set up a log-in feature to allow buyers to track the progress of their homes and to place orders online for add-ons such as cabinets or flooring, enabling them to better manage the experience.
Martell also began using YouTube to build the brand, deliver useful information to customers, and substantially reduce the amount of time his salespeople spend with prospective customers. He actually stumbled on the strategy. Martell brought video equipment to the 2008 Greater Moncton Home Show, where he planned to get local VIPs to plug the firm. When none of those VIPs showed up, he asked other contractors, suppliers and even rival home builders whether they would like to be interviewed and have the clips posted on YouTube. They agreed to participate, and he ended up with a lot of chatty videos filled with endorsements. Martell distributed the clips to participants and shared the links with other players in the Moncton real-estate market. "That gave us a lot of local recognition."
Martell has since made a series of other videos featuring practical tips for homebuyers on ownership-related issues, including maintenance. When combined with the company's other social networking content, such as its Facebook page, they help deliver Martell's brand promise - delivering homes on time and on budget - to clients. New customers, he points out, often say they've been "watching and listening for months." He estimates that the time it takes to close a sale has fallen to just over two hours from 8 1/2 hours because the videos answer many obvious questions in advance. What's more, Martell has seen its referral business grow- - it accounts for more than a third of the company's volume - as its web content is passed around. - J.L.
Takeaway
Entrepreneurs should focus on the social media platform that "feels most natural." And, Martell says, "Always add value. Don't ever try to sell or people will un-follow you."

Stanfield's Underwear: Don't be afraid to stand out
If you're in the business of protecting the family jewels, you can afford to be a bit cheeky in your advertising campaign.
Stanfield's, a family-run business in Nova Scotia, has been turning out stolid, reliable undergarments for a long time (the company was incorporated in 1906). If it had a reputation for making "your grandfather's tighty whities," it's probably because it literally did.
Good underwear is timeless. But how can a brand connect with a new generation without a coast-to-coast ad buy?
Enter "The Guy at Home in His Underwear." The brainchild of John St., a Toronto-based creative firm, the Stanfield's campaign took the form of an online reality show stunt: For 25 days in late 2010, web-connected cameras watched as an actor named Mark McIntyre was confined to his apartment, wearing nothing all day but a fresh pair of the company's underwear.
It was a bachelor's dream come true: a month of Sundays. The key was McIntyre himself, who reflected what you might call the aggressive average-ness of middle Canada. "He didn't have chiselled abs," says Angus Tucker, a partner at John St. "He probably had an extra 20 pounds on him. He wasn't shy about it, or weird about it. He was just like, 'This is what I look like in my underwear.'"
The campaign had an extra edge. McIntyre is a testicular cancer survivor, and for every Facebook "like" that Stanfield's received, the company pledged $1 to the Canadian Cancer Society. As president Jon Stanfield notes, it was a natural fit for a company that's in the business of protecting its customers' family jewels.
The live feed was shown on a custom-built website (the now-departed guyathome.com), which encouraged viewers to "like" the campaign on Facebook, and the reaction was overwhelming. The media lapped up the stunt - CBC's George Stroumboulopoulos, for one, showed up at McIntyre's apartment one evening - and a new generation of consumers followed. Stanfield's racked up more than 50,000 "likes," and each one subscribed a user to receive future updates from the company. It created buzz within the sector, winning advertising awards; moreover, Stanfield says, it got people talking about the company's underwear in a way that would have been hard to conceive of a decade ago.
"It allows us to speak to people who like us, but it also allows the people who like us to speak to the people who are considering us. It's allowed us to differentiate ourselves." - I.T.
Takeaway
You can connect an old brand with a new generation - if you find the right angle.

Shutdown clears a path for Alcatraz North

Abstract: All of the Pen's history, good and bad, needs to be preserved somehow, Mr. [Tom Epp] said, and that could be by turning it into Canada's Alcatraz. "Whether people like prisons or not, or like the whole notion of crime and punishment, that's a historical fact and you don't deny that," he said. "We shouldn't be ashamed of our history."

Full text:   It's too soon to estimate how many tourists would visit a prison museum in Kingston, says economic development CEO Jeff Garrah
The shuttering of Canada's oldest prison has opened up the possibility of turning the Kingston institution into a tourist destination comparable to Alcatraz.
The federal government announced the cost-saving measure of closing the aging Kingston Penitentiary last week. The shutdown will begin next year and will be complete by 2014-15.
The maximum-security institution, on the shores of Lake Ontario, a short drive from downtown, has housed the likes of Paul Bernardo, Russell Williams and Clifford Olson. Notorious inmates, riots and daring escapes have dominated public attention throughout the Pen's 177-year history in Kingston - but it has also been a steady source of hundreds of jobs for the community.
Once the fortress closes, it could bring something else to Kingston, if there's support and funding to ensure it isn't left dormant.
"People have a fascination with the correctional system. ... people visit Kingston just to drive by the institutions, so I think there's a tremendous opportunity there," said.
Mr. Garrah has looked at public-private business plans of prisons turned museums, including Alcatraz, and thinks something similar is possible for Kingston Pen. Years ago, he visited the San Francisco island penitentiary, which had its own infamous inmates including Al Capone. Alcatraz opened as a tourist destination in 1973 and each years gets about 1.3 million visitors, who can tour cells while listening to recorded narration by former inmates and staff.
Mr. Garrah said he was struck by the similarities between the American institution and the one in his hometown, which sits between the Portsmouth Olympic Harbour and one of the city's most affluent neighbourhoods. "I think it could be a great draw for tourism," Mr. Garrah said, "but I also think it respects the history of the heritage that Kingston has with the correctional services."
He said it's too soon to estimate costs and how many tourists such a development could draw to Kingston. The existing, small museum that runs out of the old warden's residence that overlooks the Pen already gets upward of 25,000 visitors each year.
Kingston Mayor Mark Gerretsen, however, said he's focused not on the building itself but on the fate of 450 employees, who may be able to transfer to nearby prisons. He said he doesn't have an estimate of how much it would cost to buy the property from the federal government. Public Works and Government Services, which handles sales of federal property, did not respond to a request for an estimate.
But the property's value has been assessed at $20.76-million by the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation, said Martin Skolnick, associate broker and vice-president of real estate firm DTZ Barnicke for Eastern Ontario.
However, Mr. Skolnick, who has worked on government divestitures before, said the market value is likely lower - by somewhere between $5-million and $7-million - because of the cost attached to taking on the historic site. "The cost of doing something with these buildings can be huge," he said.
A spokeswoman for Public Safety Minister Vic Toews said no decisions have been made about future plans for the land and building, which is protected by its designation as a federal historic site.
Mr. Garrah said part of the vast property could potentially be used as office space. But whatever happens to the site, it likely won't happen for years after the inmates leave.
The nearby Prison for Women was sold four years ago to Queen's University to use for storage, a process that took close to seven years, he said. Local media reported it sold for about $2.9-million.
The challenge with the Pen will be coming up with the money to buy and maintain the aged property, which will be complicated by its designation as a heritage site, said Christian Leuprecht, a Queen's University politics professor. He said turning it into a public museum would probably need funding from all levels of government, something that's not likely during government cutbacks.
He wouldn't be surprised if it sits empty, he said, but there should be talks about how to avoid that. "We should have a national discussion about what happens with this type of a site," he said. "It's in the national interest to remember what happened here. In part because it sort of portrays the way justice has evolved over the last 177 years."
Peter Hennessy, author of Canada's Big House: The Dark History of the Kingston Penitentiary , spent most weekdays at the prison for a stretch of six years during the 1990s when he sat on the citizens' advisory committee. He said he considers Alcatraz a model of what could be done in Kingston.
"Imagine staying in the cell of Red Ryan, where he escaped from," Mr. Hennessy said, referring to the convicted bank robber who escaped in 1923 and wasn't found for three months.
When Tom Epp was warden of the prison, between 1989 and 1992, there were no major emergencies like riots, hostage takings or runaways. But when there were rumours about weapon smuggling or escapes, he had to quickly shut down the prison to search.
"Everybody knows this who works in the place, you can never really let your guard down because you never know when something will go wrong," he said. "But ... a lot of days, you're just in this sort of ... ritual of locking, unlocking, counting, searching."
While Mr. Epp was in charge, there was a major retrofit, which he said seemed odd because the prison was hopelessly outdated even then. Having opened in 1835 when prisoners lived under a rigid rule of silence, the Pen was set up for now obsolete practices including a version of water torture and feeding prisoners diets of bread and water.
But all of the Pen's history, good and bad, needs to be preserved somehow, Mr. Epp said, and that could be by turning it into Canada's Alcatraz. "Whether people like prisons or not, or like the whole notion of crime and punishment, that's a historical fact and you don't deny that," he said. "We shouldn't be ashamed of our history."

Mayor arrested after long battle over airport deal

Author: Perreaux, Les

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/mayor-arrested-after-long-battle-over-airport/docview/1008595874/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "I've had dozens of calls from friends and family saying, 'We thought of you' and 'Where's the party?' " said Mr. [Jean-Daniel Cossette], a 51-year-old father of two teenagers who said he has led the fight to save the airport at the cost of his marriage and thousands of dollars. "Yes, there is satisfaction. But is it really possible we will finally have some peace? I can't tell you the price we've paid."

Full text:   Few citizens stood up to the mayor at the height of his 21-year reign, and certainly no forest, ranch or field of hay stood a chance against progress in the village-wrapped-in-a-city named Mascouche.
In a suburb where three-quarters of the population had recently fled the crime and crowding of the big city, who would have stood up? These former Montrealers came looking for peace and quiet, the privacy of a big backyard and a coveted garage. As they faced their hour-long, one-way commutes, civic oversight was not a high priority for most new Mascouchois.
But Mayor Richard Marcotte ran into one 3,000-foot strip of asphalt he could not control. The tiny Mascouche airport looked like prime real estate to him, but to Jean-Daniel Cossette and a small group of pilots, it was a jewel in a rock garden of new car dealerships and big-box stores. They fought like mad to keep the planes flying.
His Worship was in a race to transform his sleepy village into a metropolis, but he also pocketed his own share of the spoils, police allege in the charges laid against him and 14 others this week. It's likely just a start. Cities like Terrebonne, Boisbriand and Laval grew even faster and have had their own scandals, from politicians alleged to have taken envelopes of cash to contracts for the summertime snow-clearing of fire hydrants to multimillion-dollar fraud allegations linked to spiffy new water-treatment plants. Police say 16 investigations are under way. (Construction company executives and a former mayor are among those already facing charges in Boisbriand.)
In 2001, Mr. Marcotte turned his eye to the airport with two million square feet of well-groomed land populated by a clutch of small aviation businesses. News of the plan broke to Mr. Cossette, an aerial photographer, about 18 months after the deal was already done. It was late 2002 and he had returned to his hangar after hours to find the mayor checking out the taxiways with the man who, he would eventually learn, was the buyer. The pilots didn't even know their airport was for sale.
"The mayor tried to pull a fast one and sell it to one of his buddies," Mr. Cossette recalls. "It was part of this Eldorado, this great gold rush."
Eleven years later, the Cessnas and Pipers still land every few minutes at one of Canada's busiest airports catering to private pilots. Mr. Marcotte has been charged with fraud, breach of trust, theft and corruption related to other real-estate deals and contracts around the city.
The Mascouche airport withstood the bulldozer because, for the past decade, the pilots and business owners lobbied the province, filed court injunctions, and won and lost in court to stall the selloff of land the province ceded to the city for public use.
Mr. Cossette was threatened with lawsuits for criticizing the mayor. In a city of new pavement, the handful of airport businesses have a pothole-riddled dirt road to welcome clients for flight lessons and private plane charters. Even a court injunction couldn't get city crews out with a load of gravel. "It became personal for the mayor," said Serge Hamelin, one of the few city councillors who opposed Mr. Marcotte.
The airport case now sits a tangled web before the Quebec Court of Appeal, but with the arrest of Mr. Marcotte early Friday morning, the pilots think their fight might finally be won.
"I've had dozens of calls from friends and family saying, 'We thought of you' and 'Where's the party?' " said Mr. Cossette, a 51-year-old father of two teenagers who said he has led the fight to save the airport at the cost of his marriage and thousands of dollars. "Yes, there is satisfaction. But is it really possible we will finally have some peace? I can't tell you the price we've paid."
Right into the 1980s, Mascouche was little more than a rural parish. Then francophone Montrealers decided in droves that they could no longer bear (or afford) the city. In a dozen small towns north of Montreal, hundreds of new crescents and cul-de-sacs went up at once. In the 1990s, Mascouche tripled its 8,000 people and then doubled again to a 2012 population of 45,000.
The growth has consequences beyond sprawl. In 2007, Charles Taylor, the eminent philosopher, completed a tour of Quebec including many cities of the 450 area code surrounding Montreal as he and sociologist Gerard Bouchard studied the integration of minorities.
Dr. Taylor found those distant Montreal suburbs were having a tougher time adapting to diversity than small towns and established cities. People living in those "atomistic, individualistic suburbs" are less active in their community and aren't drawn into civic institutions that promote the benefits of diversity, he said.
Another growing body of research shows that weak social investment and civic involvement also makes such communities easy targets for corruption, especially when combined with runaway development.
"It's so difficult to wake everybody up," said Gilles Patenaude, a local activist who has tried to chase the mayor from office for more than two years. "People are very individualistic, they have nice big yards that are of greater concern. People are revolted, but making them move is another story."
And then there's the fear factor. People in Mascouche hear about mob ties to the construction industry in Quebec, and they've seen the price paid by people like Mr. Cossette, who chose to fight.
"We know how we feel in our hearts, but it doesn't pay to be too up front. But I'll tell you, we have to clean this place up," said a restaurant owner who was desperate to keep his name unpublished.
The mayor of Mascouche clings to his title, but Mr. Patenaude, who runs a group home for troubled youth, said his city may finally be waking up.
Mr. Marcotte has ruled Mascouche with a combination of cold calculation and charm, Mr. Patenaude said, but little could stand in his way. "He was like a bulldozer," Mr. Patenaude said. "But I think we've seen enough bulldozers for now. It's time to start cleaning up."

Abstract: At both Melimoyu and Valle California, the helicopter transported me high above the trees and rivers to massive glaciers nearby. The contrast with the rain forest below couldn't be more pronounced than it is at Melimoyu's volcanic peak, but nothing prepared me for the sheer wonder of the glacier near Valle California - the perfect turquoise lake below and the amazing moonscape above, with the glacier's eerie crevices and giant folds of marshmallow ice.

Full text:   They buy ecosystems under threat of development. You explore lush rain forest, gallop across the pampas, and indulge in fresh-caught abalone and fine Chilean wines. That's a balance sheet we can appreciate. The Globe's Gordon Pitts reports
In the dark dense rain forest of Chilean Patagonia, I am retracing the steps of Charles Darwin, in a search for the freak of a frog that bears his name.
The charming quirk of Darwin's Frog is the male's proclivity for carrying tadpole eggs in his vocal sac before disgorging the tykes into the world. The frogs come in hues of brown to green, making the tiny creatures almost impossible to see in their swampy habitat.
But Diego Stock, my exuberant Chilean guide, insists that he has spotted one hopping around this squishy bog a stone's throw from the Pacific Ocean. It looks like a fluttering brown leaf, but as I bend closer, I catch the outline of one of the world's most endangered species.
Darwin, the 19th-century father of evolutionary theory, encountered the frog in his voyages around South America in the 1830s. Now, 180 years later, I have come to Patagonia to witness another evolution - not just in this embattled frog, but in the new concept of capitalist conservation.
We are tramping through the forests around Melimoyu, a remote speck on the map 1,200 kilometres south of Santiago, Chile's capital. It is a living laboratory of frogs, birds, trees, flowers, blue whales, penguins and a sea lion that plays hide and seek with our rafts and kayaks as we glide down the Marchant River.
Just as Darwin's voyage expanded the understanding of life, Patagonia, one of the last vast empty places, is a test site for grafting protection of natural lands on to profit-driven ecotourism and real estate.
Melimoyu lies about halfway down the narrow ribbon of Chilean Patagonia, a region 1,800 kilometres long and fewer than 200 kilometres wide - from the Pacific to the Argentine border. Much of the land around Melimoyu is owned by Patagonia Sur, a company founded by U.S. social-media millionaire Warren Adams.
It is one of his six Patagonian properties, comprising 25,000 hectares, spanning ocean rain forest, gaucho grasslands in deep Andean valleys, and majestic glaciers on the ragged edge of South America. So far, two of these properties, coastal Melimoyu and inland Valle California, contain small luxury resorts, and a third, Lago Espolon, has more Spartan hostel accommodation.
"We are buying ecosystems under threat by development," explains Adams, a Harvard MBA who sold his tech company to Amazon in 1998 for $100-million in shares. He was mesmerized by a trip to Patagonia with his wife, Megan, but he also observed a region that was in danger of a development landslide more transformative than any earthquake. It was poised to be overwhelmed by new roads, airstrips and potential transmission lines transporting power from planned hydro dams in the south.
He set out to save space for creatures like Darwin's Frog, whose numbers have been devastated by viruses. And on this day in early April, Stock, who oversees guiding at Melimoyu's eco-resort, is encouraged by the discovery of even a single specimen. He records the sighting on a clipboard - grist for a research foundation set up by Adams to study the region's flora and fauna.
But make no mistake: Patagonia Sur ( sur means south in Spanish) is a hard-nosed start-up in the tradition of the high-tech world where Adams earned his entrepreneurial stripes. It comprises a real-estate brokerage (catering to green-minded clientele), sustainable property development, carbon-offset trading and reforestation, as well as ecotourism targeted at affluent consumers who will spend $6,000 (U.S.) or more on a week that melds fly-fishing, sumptuous dining and a clear conscience.
Adams's idea is that ecologically based tourism and real estate are not just beneficiaries of conservation - they can be drivers of preservation. He aims to attract investors by the potential for healthy rates of return earned on Patagonia's still relatively inexpensive land. The funds will underwrite the acquisition of more and more property, to be protected by tough land-use covenants in perpetuity.
Adams could be building a model for saving other beautiful places - say, in rural Newfoundland, New Zealand or Africa. The old model was based on government-funded parks or non-profit groups wringing donations out of philanthropists. But Adams says there is only so much money available to non-profits - and governments are stretched.
There is, however, a vast supply of profit-seeking investors - and adventure-seeking tourists. He has enlisted about 50 such investors, who have injected $23-million so far in his $30-million fund. This is not raw capitalism masquerading as do-goodism, he asserts. "Our capitalism-conservation is absolutely protecting places that wouldn't be protected otherwise," he says.
At Melimoyu and its sister resort, Valle California, an Andean river-valley site about an hour by helicopter to the northeast, it's as if Charles Darwin conspired with Ralph Lauren to create a vacation spot.
After energetic walks through lush jungles and horseback rides along rugged buttes, we retire in tastefully appointed lodges with milk-washed walls and earth-toned decor accented with antique trunks and seashells. The iPod decks play Alison Krauss and Van Morrison as you indulge in a hot-tub soak and a constant stream of pisco sours, the tart South American libation.
Over at Valle California, guests stay in cozy circular yurts with a comfort level not found in Mongolia. The roof point of each yurt is topped by a transparent covering that permits guests to lie back and catch a piece of the spectacular star show - although it is much better to step outside to get the full glory.
The resorts, which at this point can each accommodate about a dozen people in total, also sport professional chefs and gourmet dining (think fresh-caught lightly seasoned abalone, platters of fresh fruit and vegetables, filet mignon, hearty caldo de congrio - the local eel soup delicacy, and, of course, fine Chilean wines), as well as helicopter rides to glaciers to drink scotch splashed over 3,000-year-old ice. I was looking around for the 3,000-year-old scotch, as well, but Johnny Walker filled the bill.
Earlier this month, when I visited, Patagonia Sur stood at a turning point in its evolution. In its first three years, the business focused on selling lifetime club memberships to perennial visitors. Next year, sensing where the big demand lies, it will tilt toward vacationers who plan perhaps one lifetime visit to Patagonia, and fly under the name Patagonia Sur Wilderness Lodges.
Though volatile weather is always a factor in these mountain and ocean settings, my voyage to Melimoyu was relatively easy - a two-hour flight from Santiago to Puerto Montt, a bustling salmon-fishing centre. I cooled my heels for a couple of hours before our pilot got the go-ahead for the final hour's flight into Melimoyu. The Cessna cleared the clouds, providing stunning glimpses of Patagonian inlets and islands before alighting at an airstrip near the resort.
After a couple of days of exploring the lush greenery in search of Darwin's Frog and various bird species, I was whisked by helicopter up to Valle California, where I grasped the full potential of Patagonia Sur to deliver diverse ecosystems. I was soon riding high astride Matungo, a placid brown horse with a disconcerting habit of gobbling clumps of grass at every stop in the action. On a short ride across the pampas, we stopped at a vacant gaucho cabin that looked frozen in time, with dusty saddles, narrow cots and spectacular mountain views.
At both Melimoyu and Valle California, the helicopter transported me high above the trees and rivers to massive glaciers nearby. The contrast with the rain forest below couldn't be more pronounced than it is at Melimoyu's volcanic peak, but nothing prepared me for the sheer wonder of the glacier near Valle California - the perfect turquoise lake below and the amazing moonscape above, with the glacier's eerie crevices and giant folds of marshmallow ice.
On the return trip from Valle California to Puerto Montt, there was a change of plans - related, I was told, to weather uncertainty. A journey that might have taken about three hours was expanded to almost six hours, including four hours by car. But even the hitches were interesting - in this case, a drive through the town of Chaiten, still rebuilding after being devastated by a volcano in 2008. The volcano, in fact, is still fuming on the horizon.
Patagonia Sur's challenge is to stand out in a crowded market where more accessible resorts are offering horseback riding and fly-fishing. At one point, someone asks why fly-fishing aficionados would come here instead of Western Canada or the U.S. Daniel Mesa, the Valle California land manager, who is also a crack fishing guide, ponders a moment and says: "Because you see no one else on the rivers."
That is what Warren Adams is offering - access to one of the last lonely wildernesses. If he has his way, it will become a little less lonely, but never so much to spoil the view.
*****
IF YOU GO
Getting there
Fly to Santiago, then take a local flight, typically two hours, to Puerto Montt. There, you board a plane chartered by Patagonia Sur for the hour flight - either to Melimoyu or Valle California. The package includes a helicopter or flight between the two locations, although it is possible to spend your holiday in one spot. But that would detract from the diversity of the experience.
Where to stay
Each resort offers six ensuite bedrooms. Melimoyu has a hot tub with a fine view. Valle California has cushy yurts. The central dining lodge looks out on a breathtaking view.
When to go
Patagonia Sur operates from early November to the end of April, with January to March as the peak time. That's the high summer period when the blue whales can usually be viewed around Melimoyu Bay. April is also a nice time, as the trees turn red and yellow on the foothills and plains at Valle California - although the nights can be long and cool. The weeklong vacation package costs $7,725 (U.S.) a person (double occupancy), and includes charter flights to and from (as well as between) both luxury properties out of Puerto Montt, an hour-long helicopter trip to your desired remote location, meals and lodging.

ENVIRO-VISIONS
A DIFFERENT APPROACH
The Warren Adams concept of capitalist conservation is not the only model of sustainability showcased in Patagonia.
Contrast the Adams approach with the vision of another U.S. entrepreneur Doug Tompkins, the founder of the North Face and Esprit clothing lines, and his wife, Kris, who once headed the outdoor apparel company called, yes, Patagonia.
Over the past two decades, they have leveraged their fortunes, and those of allies, to develop nature preserves in Argentina and Chile that reflect pure conservation and pure philanthropy.
"It is a different vision," says Hernan Mladinic Alonso, executive director of the Tompkins's Parque Pumalin foundation based in Puerto Varas, Chile. The Tompkins's holdings consists of about 850,000 hectares in Chile and Argentina, including the 300,000-hectare Pumalin Park, the largest private land reserve in the world, a short distance from various Patagonia Sur properties.
The virtue of the two models can be debated endlessly, but the winner is the traveller, who gets the choice of the purist Pumalin experience, with $3-a-night camping amid the Andes, and Patagonia Sur with its weeklong $7,725-a-person vacations that combine fine dining and nature walks.
While ecotourism and real estate lie at the heart of the Patagonia Sur model, capitalism is purely incidental to what the Tompkins are trying to do. They expect much of the business activity for their parks will reside in the towns around them. Instead, Alonso says, Pumalin is "an environmental activism project," with the goal of creating nature parks that will last forever.

Concrete looks to shed a bad rep

Author: John Bentley Mays

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/concrete-looks-shed-bad-rep/docview/1002815411/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: People (especially architects, but all gadget aficionados as well) who like to keep up with what's coming down the technological pipeline will find those product notes engaging. There is now concrete that bends, concrete that lights up and glows with words and images, concrete that can generate enough warmth to prevent ice build-up, super-strong concrete that can be sliced super-thin. There is ultra-lightweight concrete that can be worked with ordinary carpentry tools, and concrete that eats smog.

Full text:   Fans of the commonplace building material seek a greater appreciation of its versatility and understated beauty
jmays@globeandmail.com
Of all the materials that make the modern city possible, none is more despised than concrete. We tolerate it as long as it stays out of sight and out of mind - in the subway tunnels, beneath the streets. But buildings made of it are routinely described as cold, dehumanizing, prison-like; and the very idea of a single-family dwelling fashioned from concrete is, to most observers now, unthinkable.
Granted, most of the concrete we see in the course of a Toronto day is grey, massive, unlovely stuff. At least some of the widespread dislike for it, however, surely springs from a misunderstanding. When concrete expressways and desolate concrete residential towers and windswept malls rolled out in North American cities a half-century ago, after all, it was the design - the handiwork of architects and urban planners - and not the humble industrial substance that was deeply flawed. But concrete got a share of the blame anyway, once public and professional opinion about "urban renewal" and such swung from the indifference of the 1950s to the active hostility of the 1960s and beyond.
While concrete still has a bad popular reputation that hails from those old days, some perceptive architects, planners and scholars have recently been taking long second looks at things constructed from this commonest of all building materials, and finding much to appreciate, and even to admire. An early piece of local evidence for this new openness was the publication, five years ago, of Michael McClelland and Graeme Stewart's celebratory Concrete Toronto: a Guidebook to Concrete Architecture from the Fifties to the Seventies . This illustrated field manual, which features 52 projects in or near Hogtown, is a handy map of long-neglected cultural territory, hence a valuable contribution to Toronto's knowledge of itself and its modernist architectural heritage. The editors of Concrete Toronto set themselves the task of providing practical, informative guidance to lay folk new to the pursuit of local concrete architecture.
The second, more recent item of evidence for interest in concrete I'd like to mention is something considerably different. Concrete Ideas: Material To Shape A City (Oscar Riera Ojeda Publishers, $55.27), which appeared earlier this month, aims to excite professionals and savvy amateurs about Toronto's built legacy from yesteryear, but also about advances in concrete technology and formal manipulation. As we learn from this handsomely produced, interesting book, concrete architecture has come a long way since the 1950s, when Toronto political boss Fred Gardiner threw down the huge frames that undergird the expressway that bears his name.
Assembled and partially written by Pina Petricone, a professor at the University of Toronto's architecture school and a practising architect, Concrete Ideas is a richly illustrated compendium by several hands. There are brief texts by scholars (including a foreword by former U of T dean George Baird and an afterword by Harvard University landscape architect Charles Waldheim) and practitioners (Graeme Stewart, Mark West and others), imaginative projects by students in Ms. Petricone's U of T studios and notes on new concrete products. The book comes in a sturdy box with the look and heft of a chunk of concrete.
People (especially architects, but all gadget aficionados as well) who like to keep up with what's coming down the technological pipeline will find those product notes engaging. There is now concrete that bends, concrete that lights up and glows with words and images, concrete that can generate enough warmth to prevent ice build-up, super-strong concrete that can be sliced super-thin. There is ultra-lightweight concrete that can be worked with ordinary carpentry tools, and concrete that eats smog. Among the most beautiful substances depicted here is translucent concrete. While some citizens were reviling concrete and all its manifestations, we discover that scientists and technicians have been working through the night to reinvent this ancient building material and ready it for new artistic applications.
Ms. Petricone clearly means for her book to be a serious commentary on Toronto's older concrete architecture and a serious exploration of concrete's future possibilities. As Charles Waldheim suggests in his afterword, the work "is a timely and well-conceived generational rebuttal to the arguments against modernism and its aspiration to articulate public buildings in concrete. Concrete is a material, as is evident in this collection, of extraordinary range and invention. In the hands of a skilled architect, it transcends its mundane profile in favour of a supple and resilient expression."
But in making her plea, Ms. Petricone has avoided all solemnity and has generously shared with the reader the intellectual and sensuous delight that has accompanied her teaching and research. This publication is something that many people, until the quite recent past, would have thought impossible: a cheerful book about concrete.

DAYS ON THE MARKET
Four
LISTING AGENTS
Dianne Chaput and Colette Chaput-Villamizar, Royal LePage Estate Realty
The Action: On the edge of the Beaches community, just up the street from the lake and R.C. Harris Water Treatment Plant, this new stone residence was on the market for less than $1.8-million last winter and reduced to about $1.63-million without securing an offer.
This year, new agents - Dianne Chaput and Colette Chaput-Villamizar - relisted it for the same price and coincidentally caught the interest of two buyers who made rival bids.
What They Got: To utilize the size of a 50-by-122-foot lot, this two-storey house was constructed about five years ago with 3,198-square feet of living space, including five bedrooms, four bathrooms and several entertaining areas, plus a sixth bedroom in the 684-square-foot basement.
* On the main floor, there is a fireside living room and a separate dining area, both with hardwood floors and bay windows, as well as a rear kitchen and family room finished with a granite-topped island with storage and seating, high-end stainless steel appliances and two sets of sliding doors to a wide deck and hot tub.
* The largest bedroom upstairs features cathedral ceilings, a walk-in closet and a five-piece bathroom.
* Other luxury appointments include central vacuum and multizone sound systems and an attached garage.
The Agent's Take: "It was a custom-built house with five bedrooms and four bathrooms in the Beach where there aren't many of those ... so it checks all the boxes for the modem consumer," says Ms. Chaput-Villamizar, who cites three bedrooms and two bathrooms as more of the norm.
"It has a nice open concept cook's kitchen and family room, plus a double car garage, and you don't get double car garages very often."
Local amenities were also a high priority for some buyers. "The big thing about this location is the school district. It's in the Courcelette school district, which is quite desirable," says Ms. Chaput-Villamizar.

The Action: This detached bungalow is one of a rare few homes backing onto Catfish Pond Park. That park is just south of Lake Wilcox which has a trail system and beach along its edge. So, as soon as this house hit the market, there were over a dozen prospective buyers, including three who made an offer.
What They Got: This roughly 50-year-old bungalow has an idyllic setting on a third of an acre of maturely treed land fronting onto a quiet street to the north and backing onto a local park to the south.
The Agent's Take: "It's a nice sized lot - 75 by 200 - backing onto a conservation area," says agent Bill Thom, who believes this property will be redeveloped.

Full text:   David Radcliffe's job is to find urban spaces that can be turned into hip headquarters
Want to really boost innovation? Ditch telecommuting and create office spaces that spur serendipitous encounters.
That's what David Radcliffe, the Canadian-born executive tasked with scouring the planet for Google Inc. offices, advises.
His job is to find urban spaces that can be turned into hip headquarters and design them to spark creativity, play and collaboration.
"We call it Googliness - how do we create an environment that supports culture, transparency and collaboration?" he says in an interview. "How do we create facilities that allow people to excel?"
The world's largest search engine employs 31,000 people in more than 40 countries, a 13-fold increase in staff in the past eight years. Its brand has become synonymous with innovation (Fast Company, for example, puts it in third place in its global innovation rankings).
The stakes go far beyond a pretty workplace. In an industry locked in battle for creative, highly skilled workers, the ability to attract and retain staff is a key competitive edge. So too is innovation - enabling the spark of a great idea, and bringing it successfully it to market.
Mr. Radcliffe, vice-president of real estate and workplace services, has logged almost two million air miles crisscrossing the planet to scout and set up new Google offices aims to blend Google with local culture.
No two Google offices are the same. But there are common elements: murals reflecting the local culture; shared spaces - cubes, yurts, eggs and "huddles"; video games, pool tables and pianos; cafes and little kitchens stocked with healthy food; and white boards.
1. Coming in to work
We may have the technology to let people work in their pyjamas from home. That doesn't mean it should be used. Staff are equipped with laptops and smart phones so they can be mobile, but they're still encouraged to show up at the office for work.
2. Accidental encounters
At least half of space is dedicated to "collaborative environments" - casual meeting places with a couch or a kitchen so workers bump into each other and chat. White boards and plugs for laptops are sprinkled through the office for spontaneous brainstorming. Even lineups the famously free food are engineered so people wait for two to three minutes.
3. Health
Healthy, eco-friendly buildings are a point of pride. Good health helps drive productivity and innovation, so furniture is formaldehyde-free and building materials are free from toxins. It also realizes balance works better when the work stays local. "As much as we like to think someone in Toronto can work with someone in India, that usually means someone's staying up late. And that's not good for work-life balance."
4. Blend local with Google
Sydney, Australia's office looks like a jungle. Zurich's is bright (to counter the frequent rain outside). Montreal's has a music recording studio and Boulder, Colo., has a rock-climbing wall. Starting a new office means local staff get involved from beginning and using different architects.
5. Go urban
"We love urban cores." That means choosing pre-existing buildings "that have character to them" and retooling to make them Googley. They are typically in neighborhoods with strong amenities, like restaurants, public transit and housing. And they should be in spots where staff can walk, bike or use public transportation to get to work.

London eyes past failures in bid to avoid Olympic disaster

Abstract: The Olympics can no more lose money than a man can have a baby," Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau confidently declared in 1970, when his city won the 1976 Games. Those would prove to be edible words: Montrealers would end up paying extra taxes to cover the $1.6-billion debt for the construction of the "Big O" stadium (which wasn't finished in time for the Games) right through to 2006.

Full text:   The history of the Olympics is a history of failures. Every four years, one city is confronted with the world's largest sporting event, and usually at least one thing goes terribly wrong: Debt, crowding, security threats or bad public images have sent most Olympiads deep into the bronze.With 100 days to go until London lights the eternal flame on July 27 to kick off the 30th Olympic Games, the city has entered its panic phase. Thousands of workers are on the streets repairing Victorian water mains that could burst, installing discreet surveillance cameras and putting bright flower boxes in front of some of Britain's dingier public buildings. The goal, seven years in the making, is to avoid the pitfalls of previous Olympics. They have three months to avoid these traps, Doug Saunders reports
MONTREAL 1970 / DEBT LOAD
Olympics are preposterously expensive and rarely generate enough income to recoup their hefty public-sector investment. In some cases, the costs are ruinous. The Athens Games, many believe, triggered the beginnings of the Greek debt crisis. But when out-of-control Olympic debt comes up, the city most often mentioned is Montreal.
"The Olympics can no more lose money than a man can have a baby," Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau confidently declared in 1970, when his city won the 1976 Games. Those would prove to be edible words: Montrealers would end up paying extra taxes to cover the $1.6-billion debt for the construction of the "Big O" stadium (which wasn't finished in time for the Games) right through to 2006. In some ways they're still paying, as the crumbling stadium, which has not had a major sports team for the past eight years, remains a tax burden.
Londoners can ill afford such a burden. Britain is already in the midst of large-scale debt-crisis management, and Prime Minister David Cameron is in the midst of a major cost-cutting program. So his government had been careful to ensure that much of the £9.3-billion budget could be covered through the sale and future use of Olympic assets.
But there are signs that London won't be a rare Olympic-budget exception: Last month, Britain's Public Accounts Commissioner (similar to Canada's auditor-general) warned that the actual cost of the Games was approaching £12-billion and, with associated costs such as security taken into account, could reach £24-billion
Many of those costs are municipal. At the moment, Londoners pay an extra £20 on their annual property taxes to cover the Olympic Park costs. While that levy is set to expire in 2016, it now appears that there will still be a £231-million debt - an amount that, like Montreal's, could escalate. Mr. Johnson's officials insist that they will be able to pay it off by selling off land and buildings - but with a very weak British real-estate market, that could prove difficult.
ATLANTA 1996 / STUCK IN TRAFFIC
When people share memories of the Atlanta Games, they do not typically involve feats of speed, height or strength. Rather, they involve being stuck on immobile mini-buses for hours on end. Journalists missed major events entirely because of the paralyzed transportation links. Journeys that should have taken half an hour took several hours. "Atlanta was an unmitigated transport disaster," rail expert Christian Wolmar told reporters.
London, famous for its 19th-century Underground lines and double-decker buses, has made it a mission to do better - even though it's holding the Games in a corner of East London that is notoriously underserved by trains and subways.
"These are the public-transport Games," Olympic spokesman Godric Smith says. Britain has spent £6.5-billion improving transportation, including a major new station at Stratford, the Olympic venue, major improvements to the Underground and a fast new train line going to East London - a seven-minute "javelin service" along a dedicated bus lane between St. Pancras Station and the Games.
A particular weak point, although, is Heathrow Airport, the world's busiest, which is a grubby and chaotic place at the best of times. More than 80 per cent of athletes and visitors will pass through it. There won't be any extra flights during the Games - with only two runways, its schedules are already full - but will have 45 per cent more passengers on its busiest arrival day and 35 per cent more bags on its busiest departure day. Normally, only 65 per cent of its passengers are disembarking in London (the rest are changing flights to other cities), a proportion that will rise to almost 90 per cent during the Games. While every customs officer in the country will be expected to work during the Olympics, officials already warn that passport lineups could be more than an hour long.
SYDNEY 2000 / SELF-DEFEATING VICTORY
The 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, were generally considered a success at the time. But then the Australians discovered what many Olympic nations have found: The big tourism boost that most governments expect, and that is used to justify the steep cost of the Games, just doesn't happen. In fact, the Olympic coverage sometimes drives people away, as they decide your city is expensive and crowded.
The Australians expected 132,000 visitors for the 2000 Games, and then received only 97,000 tourists during the entire period. That was better than Athens, where organizers expected 105,000 tourists per night and received only 14,000.
But the real troubles in Sydney began after the Games. Australian officials had expected that the Olympics would boost the Sydney "brand," and overall tourism would nearly quadruple to eight or 10 million people per year in the years after the Olympics. In fact, there was no boost at all: Tourism in Sydney has stayed steady, at about 2.5 million visitors per year even as tourist numbers have risen sharply across the rest of the region.
"We are renowned for running a great gig but squandering an opportunity," Chris Brown, the head of Sydney's tourism association, told reporters on the 10th anniversary of their Games. Like many Olympic cities, Sydney discovered that hotel vacancies actually increase dramatically during the Games - because nobody dares visit the city for any reason other than the Olympics. In some cities, including Beijing, Athens and Sydney, those vacancies have remained high for a long time after the Games.
In response, London Mayor Boris Johnson has launched a publicity campaign to convince overseas visitors that it's still worth visiting London this summer even if you're not attending the Games. This includes a quiet mission to convince hotels here not to raise rates just because the Olympics are on. Nationally, the government has created a £1-billion marketing fund for the tourist agency VisitBritain to persuade international travellers that the country is "open for business" despite the Olympics.
Nevertheless, international tourism officials warn that Britain may be in for a disappointment: Lord Coe, chairman of the London Organizing Committee for the Olympics, has confidently predicted a million extra tourists coming to Britain during the Games - something that would be a first in recent Olympic history, and a sharp reversal of the usual trend.
ATHENS 2004 / INEDIBLE LEFTOVERS
Visitors to Athens these days can tour the city's famous ancient Greek ruins - or, if they wish, the much more recent but equally vacant ruins of the 2004 Olympics. In a fit of hubris, Greece hoped it could become the permanent home of the Games. At extraordinary cost, the Greeks built numerous large stadiums, many out of marble, and a dedicated monorail train line to connect them. Years later, much of this pricey infrastructure sits empty and useless - local farmers graze their pigs inside the vacant weightlifting stadium.
London officials have pledged from the beginning that the Games will be used to revitalize the city, and no buildings, Olympic Village facilities or transit lines will be wasted. It's a strategy of clever reuse that some have called the Lego Olympics. In part, this is because the International Olympic Committee has become dismayed by the site of lonely, abandoned former Olympic sites in places like Athens, Barcelona and Montreal.
"The IOC doesn't like it when there are giant things that don't have an alternate use," said Chris Jopson, the chief architect of the Games. When former London mayor Ken Livingstone pitched the Olympics in 2005, he described it as an urban-improvement bid, designed to turn a blighted, isolated section of East London into an attractive place with better housing and mass transportation.
"Legacy is really in the DNA of London 2012," says Olympic spokesman Godric Smith. "We didn't just want London 2012 to be remembered as a fantastic summer of sport, but that everything we did had legacy at its start. It will maximize the opportunity for lasting change."
In general, this plan appears better considered than those of earlier Olympics. But it's not without its hitches. It has taken years to find a post-Games tenant for the main Olympic stadium, with 80,000 seats; it now appears that it will become the home of the West Ham United soccer team, whose east-end fans are famously enthusiastic. But even their biggest games barely attract half that audience - meaning the stadium will need to be made much smaller.
BEIJING 2008 / SECURITY OVERDRIVE
As the largest sporting event in the world, the Olympics also tends to be the largest security threat in the world. As the Palestinian terror attacks at the 1972 Munich Games or the deadly bombing carried out by an anti-abortion activist at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics testify, there are important reasons why countries need to be on guard. But they can get carried away, and oppressive security can overshadow the sports.
That was notably the case four years ago in Beijing, where a "ring of steel" in the form of thousands of People's Liberation Army soldiers and security police packed the streets and ringed every venue. Visitors were frequently stopped and searched and spent their days passing through numerous security checkpoints. For many tourists, it cast a pall over an otherwise enjoyable Games.
London officials, in a bid to keep people happier, are vowing to make the security as light and inconspicuous as possible.
"This is not a security event that happens to have a little bit of sport thrown in," said a senior Home Office official responsible for the Olympics (as is British custom, securityofficials tend to speak off the record). "You will not see oppressive security."
There will not be military on the streets of London or any other city under any normal circumstances, officials said. Some soldiers will be employed to check ID of visitors as they enter venues, and the Royal Navy will be securing the waters around sailing venues. But otherwise, the official said, London hopes to make its name on its reputation for freedom, not its penchant for policing.
"People can generally do what they want on the streets, photograph anything, even hold peaceful protests, so long as they don't interfere with the movement of people," a senior London police official told a press briefing. "We don't want to tinge what should be an enjoyable sporting experience with heavy-handed policing."
There are signs, however, that the Brits might not be living up to their principles. This week, journalists discovered that anyone attempting to film or photograph buildings on the Olympic site will be intercepted and questioned by guards, and often have their images seized.

Full text:   Gambling giant has hired lobby group Sussex Strategy to make case at city hall for glitzy facility
CITY HALL BUREAU CHIEF
The company behind some of Las Vegas's best-known gambling destinations - including Bellagio, Luxor, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage - has begun lobbying to build its first Canadian casino in Toronto.
MGM Resorts International's development staff visited Toronto recently and the entertainment behemoth has hired a local firm, Sussex Strategy Group, to make its case at city hall. Two of its associates had informal conversations about a casino with Mayor Rob Ford's staff, a dozen councillors and political aides during last week's council meeting. MGM is exploring a $2 billion-to-$6 billion investment in the city, one that could go well beyond slot machines and roulette wheels to include hotels, restaurants, spas and convention facilities.
"It's an amazing market, it's an amazing city," Alan Feldman, MGM's senior vice-president of public affairs, said in an interview from Japan Monday. "We'd be prepared to invest an awful lot in the development of the concept."
MGM's inquiries are in the very early stages, Mr. Feldman said. The company isn't much interested in a small project, such as adding tables to the slots at the Woodbine racetrack.
But if the province and city are interested in a sprawling "integrated resort" where gambling facilities make up as little as 10 per cent of the space, then MGM is very interested in Toronto.
"This is really an issue of whether the government sees this (gambling) as a means to a larger end or an end unto itself," Mr. Feldman said. Sussex signed up to lobby on MGM's behalf April 4, according to records filed with Toronto's lobbyist registrar.
A pair of casino-related motions during last week's council meeting were dispatched to committees. Councillors are divided on whether to embrace a glitzy new gaming facility.
"We know the big boys are coming to town," Councillor Doug Ford, the mayor's brother, said Monday, when told MGM had quietly begun a campaign to sway councillors.
It was the first he'd heard of MGM's nascent lobbying efforts. The councillor predicted on the weekend radio show he co-hosts with the mayor that "major players," including MGM, Caesars and Wynn would soon be knocking on Toronto's door.
At the opening of the new Trump International Hotel & Tower, Mayor Rob Ford said he spoke with the celebrity real-estate developer about the possibility of future projects in the city, but would not say if a casino was part of that talk.
"We had a little bit of a conversation," the mayor said, before racing out a back door away from the press.
The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp. revealed last month that it plans to open a casino in the Greater Toronto Area as part of a sweeping overhaul of the province's gaming industry. A location hasn't been selected yet, and the Premier has made it clear his government won't force a gaming complex on an unwilling city.
But Finance Minister Dwight Duncan has warned that if Toronto says no, it risks losing 4,000 jobs and a "golden mile" of luxury shops and restaurants that would spring up around a provincially run gaming complex, especially if it were situated on the waterfront.
An MGM casino would fit neatly with Mr. Duncan's vision of a grand gambling destination on the lake. The company owns and operates 15 opulent hotel-casinos in Nevada, Mississippi and Michigan and has a 50 per cent stake in four other properties in Nevada, Illinois and Macau. MGM even has pop-culture resonance - three of its properties were robbed by George Clooney and Brad Pitt in the 2001 movie, Ocean's Eleven .
Ontario Place has been floated as an ideal location for the casino. "I think Ontario Place would make a superb site," Mr. Feldman said, adding his company is eyeing other sites as well.
One of Sussex's lobbyists spoke briefly to Mike Layton, the councillor whose ward includes the shuttered amusement park, at last week's council session and later reported the meeting to the registry.
"Am I surprised they're trying to get ahead of the game?" Mr. Layton said of MGM. "No. The casino is the only one who wins here. The house always wins."
Mr. Layton is dead set against a casino at Ontario Place. Concerned about a sea of parking lots, traffic tie-ups and the social ills that could accompany a casino, he moved a motion at last week's council meeting that would have barred a casino from the site.
That motion, along with another asking that no casino be approved without a referendum, was sent to committee.
Mr. Layton is far from the only councillor to express reservations about a Toronto casino.
Even Councillor Ford said his support is contingent on the project being done right.
"I'm not in favour of casinos," he said, "unless there's proper consultation, proper infrastructure, proper transit and proper planning."
Councillor Mark Grimes - the chair of Exhibition Place, another potential casino site - said council should at least hear out players like MGM before folding its hand and leaving the table.
"I think we'd be stupid to say no until we see what's coming forward," he said.

The Action: Ten parties took advantage of an open house at this two-storey residence in a quiet neighbourhood in Killarney, while four- to six-dozen shoppers opted for private showings to investigate it at their convenience.
What They Got: In 1977, this Vancouver Special was built on a 32-by-135-foot corner lot with 1,300 and 1,100-square-foot apartments on the main and lower levels respectively, plus two-car parking off a laneway.
* The house was well maintained with two bedrooms, a full bathroom, a recreation room and kitchen on the ground floor.
* The level above offers three bedrooms, two bathrooms and an eat-in kitchen, as well a dining room and a wide living room with vaulted ceilings, a gas fireplace and a walkout to a balcony.
The Agent's Take: "Many affluent Chinese buyers love the area," says agent Richard Morrison, who has heard of a small Chinatown developing in the area. "The main reason I think they like Killarney is because there is a strong sense of community there, and also because they have nice, big lots."
The home's architectural style is also a common one that many locals preferred. "Chinese [buyers] like this type of layout, especially on larger lots like this one, [which has] standard frontage but a deeper lot," Mr. Morrison adds.

Abstract: Now, I don't want to discourage anyone from buying a house, but when I read things about Canadians using home-equity money to leverage up 100 per cent to buy houses in Arizona - well, we've all seen the damage that leverage can do. They're not only putting the cash that they're bringing here at risk, they're borrowing money against their own houses in Canada. They're actually contributing to the inevitable collapse of the bubble in Canada.

Full text: But, Ben Jones warns complacent investors, it will - and violently
Speculation in cities such as Vancouver and Toronto is out of control. The real-estate bubble in Canada is overdue for a correction painfully similar to the one south of the border in 2008. And Canadian investors who are buying in the depressed U.S. market today are taking bigger gambles than they think.
That's the forecast according to Ben Jones, at least. Don't believe him? People have made that mistake before.
When the Arizona-based accountant launched the Housing Bubble Blog in December, 2004, he was a lone voice crying wolf about the vulnerability of the U.S. housing market.
Undeterred by naysayers - you try convincing folks back then that not only were home prices going to plummet, but the fall would bring with it a tsunami of financial pain - Mr. Jones kept posting daily roundups of news stories culled from every corner of the U.S., as well as Canada, Japan, Europe, Australia and China, with readers from around the world adding comments about what was happening in their local housing markets.
Almost eight years later, Mr. Jones is still uncovering signs that the real-estate mania is far from over, and news reports from Canada are making on to his blog with unsettling regularity. A self-styled professional skeptic, he maintains that the fallout from the housing bubble is far from over.
China probably has the largest bubble in the world, he says, "and when it blows, it's going to shake the globe. There have been housing bubbles before, but never all over the world. Every time I hear people talk about the housing bubble in the past tense, I cringe."
You've been posting a lot of stories recently about the Toronto and Vancouver real-estate markets. When you look at Canada right now, what parallels do you see between where we're at and where the U.S. was when its housing bubble burst?
From what I can tell, the condo markets in Toronto and Vancouver are even crazier. Prices are still going up and the participation of so many foreign investors is indicative of a more vulnerable market than in, for example, Miami in 2004. And that was a complete disaster.
Speculation isn't a sign of strength - it's a sign of weakness. I've read that in Toronto there are Chinese investors buying entire floors of condos. That's clearly speculative, and those people will be the first to walk when things fall apart.
Canadians like to think of themselves as cautious people. Why do we want to believe the same fallacies that inflated the American bubble: "it can't happen here," "all real estate is local," "they're not making any more land," "home prices always go up" ... ?
The short answer is, it's greed. People want to make money. And they are making money - there's always a tonne of cash floating around financial manias, whether they're a stock bubble or a housing bubble.
Is that why Canadians have been so eager to buy properties south of the border?
No one foresaw that Canadians would be crawling all over Arizona and, to a larger extent, California. I went down last summer to Maricopa County in Phoenix to watch a foreclosure sale on the courthouse steps. They had four auctioneers going at the same time, selling houses one after the other for six hours in 116-degree heat. There were 80 people there, buying houses, sight unseen, left and right.
Most of the buyers were professional bidders, talking on their cellphones to the people doing the buying. I could hear the conversations: "Oh, we can fix this up, we can rent it out, I think you'll get 7 per cent on resale." It was gambling on a mass scale, right in front of everybody.
But there's a perception here that it's low-hanging fruit and you'd be crazy not to put $400,000 down on a house in Phoenix, because four years ago, according to the people who owned it, it was worth $800,000.
We saw that logic at every level of the bubble. But the bigger issue is, $400,000 is still a lot of money - $200,000 is a lot of money. I would remind people that the reason retirees came to Arizona was because houses and land were cheap. If they want to know what the true values of these houses are, I would lean more toward mid-1990s prices.
What advice would you give Canadians buying American real estate?
Six months ago, I launched a new venture called the Joshua Tree Fund, which will invest in foreclosed houses. As of today, I don't have anything bought because I don't think the prices are low enough yet. I've got too many crazy Canadians bidding against me.
Now, I don't want to discourage anyone from buying a house, but when I read things about Canadians using home-equity money to leverage up 100 per cent to buy houses in Arizona - well, we've all seen the damage that leverage can do. They're not only putting the cash that they're bringing here at risk, they're borrowing money against their own houses in Canada. They're actually contributing to the inevitable collapse of the bubble in Canada.
So why aren't prices dropping?
Artificially low interest rates and lower mortgage standards have enabled your bubble to do a head fake and push even higher. The same thing happened in Australia and China. You guys should be further along the road to recovery than us and you're not. I would chalk that up to your government policy.
Any objective economist should be able to see what's going on in Toronto and see that it's a disaster in the making. In the United States, everybody knew that it couldn't go on forever, but at the root of a mania is the belief that the trees will grow to the sky. In Arizona, for instance, at every level and every step down, people kept saying it couldn't get any worse - but it did. It was like a bowling ball going down the stairs.
Is the U.S. market close to reaching bottom?
Every time I hear people talk about the housing bubble in the past tense, I cringe. A lot of experts originally said there was no housing bubble. Now, they'll mention a housing bubble, but those same experts have never really owned up to what it was and when it started. That enables them to say, "Well, we're back at 2003 prices."
It's a disingenuous shrugging-off of what we're really going through - the largest asset mania on a global scale in history.
What is the so-called shadow inventory?
The shadow inventory is hidden in plain sight: There are millions of empty houses or houses in foreclosure, but the banks and the government aren't putting them on the market. It's completely understandable what they're doing - they're limiting the supply so they can get a higher price for the stuff they do have on the market.
The end result is that you've got people paying more for houses than they're really worth. You combine that with government efforts to keep interest rates and down payments low, and people are buying into a manipulated market in which prices are artificially high. A lot of the houses that people are buying in 2012 will be in foreclosure in 2016.
So greed, from the top to the bottom, is the underlying theme?
Do you think the Canadians are coming down here because they really like Arizona? Some of them do, but they're not buying thousands of houses because they feel sorry for us or want to support our market. They're doing it to make money. There's nothing wrong with that - I'm a capitalist - but you have to own up to the risks that you're taking.
If you own a second home, you're speculating. It's a lot cheaper to come to Arizona and stay in a resort or a short-term rental than to own the property and come down here one or two months out of the year. It will be interesting to see if we start to hear sob stories about poor Canadians saying they were cheated by the banks and lost their investment properties and their Canadian properties.
What do you make of all the stories about the Chinese speculating with their money by buying Canadian real estate?
I posted the recent story about that Toronto house that sold for $400,000 over asking price. And it was just a bungalow. It really reminds me of 2004 when Californians were spreading across the whole country, buying property left and right, using their equity from the California bubble to create bubbles in other areas, like Las Vegas. We called them "equity nomads."
China probably has the largest bubble in the world and the fact that they're using their bubble wealth to drive up prices in Canada is the rolling-bubble phenomenon playing out on a massive scale. If the real-estate market collapses in China, are they going to close on all these condos they're buying in Toronto? I kind of doubt it.
It's even more complicated, because the Australians have a pretty big bubble and their resource-based economy is largely dependent upon China. It's a house of cards: China goes down, Australia goes down and they drag down the market in Vancouver and Toronto, which trickles down to the U.S. That's the danger people are willing to ignore when things are going up.
But everyone says it's different here.
Ask yourself, why are the Chinese buying all these properties in Toronto and Vancouver? To make money. Yes, they say they are really nice places, but they say that about every bubble market.
Florida is a really nice place. California has great weather. I don't think that justifies paying $400,000 over asking. Toronto was a really nice place 20 years ago, but nobody was paying half-a-million dollars for a condo.

Full text: Joe Fresh's flashy new flagship on Fifth Avenue is just the first step in its quest for international prominence, its founder tells Deirdre Kelly. In this second instalment in a series on retail innovators, Kelly examines the Canuck fast-fashion brand's impressively speedy rise, which started in the aisles of a supermarket chain
Lineups around the block to get into its newest store. A mention in New York magazine's recent "best of the city" issue. Gushing coverage by Style.com.By any commercial or buzz-measuring standard, Joe Fresh has taken Manhattan as much as Manhattan has taken to it.
"It's the greatest Canadian export since Justin Bieber," none other than New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg declared at the Toronto-based brand's splashy March 30 party to launch its Fifth Avenue flagship. Clearly, he's not the only New Yorker who thinks so.
In advance of the opening, about 100 shoppers had camped out overnight on the sidewalk to be among the first to walk through the emporium. Housed in a former bank, the 14,000-square-foot, two-storey glass box is located next door to the New York Public Library, a prime -and very prominent -slice of Big Apple real estate.
The hype had been building for days: Arresting images of Canadian model Heather Marks in the chic yet affordable clothing for which Joe Fresh is known dominated billboards in the Times Square subway station, while video clips featuring lithe models in colourful Joe Fresh garments played to captive audiences via monitors in the back seats of New York's famous yellow taxis. On the morning of the opening, a special colour insert covered the free morning newspaper AM New York and radio ads clogged the airwaves.
If the marketing blitz didn't grab people's attention, the brand's signature bright-orange shopping bags couldn't be missed. Other Joe Fresh locations -on lower Fifth, on 34th Street and on Madison Avenue -had already been open for months before the flagship's launch, their Day-Glo bags a bright and much-noticed new addition to the local retail scene.
"All the fashionable young women of the Upper East Side [are] carrying these bags," said Carole French, the owner of Magic Windows, an upscale children's-clothing store on Madison. "I don't know who this Joe Fresh is," she continued "but ... he's got everyone talking about him."
Joe Fresh (or the man behind him) is, of course, the well-known Canadian fashion wiz Joe Mimran, whom American fashion buffs may know as the founder of Club Monaco, the purveyor of preppie basics that Polo Ralph Lauren took over in 1999. Unlike Club Monaco, though, Joe Fresh has entered the U.S. market with such a bang that even New York's snootiest consumers are succumbing to its charms, giving its fast fashion the kind of international cachet that other retailers, from Sweden's H and M to Spain-based Zara, have worked for years to achieve. Within hours of the Fifth Avenue opening, for instance, a $19 black-and-white-striped mini pencil skirt with back zipper was flying off the shelves, poised to become the season's must-have item.
For such a red-hot brand, Joe Fresh's 2006 launch, among the grocery aisles of the Loblaws supermarket chain, was an inauspicious one, but it was all part of a well-considered plan, Mimran said the day after the New York party, to bring Joe Fresh to the world.
"It has taken time to get here, but nothing good ever happens overnight," he said from the floor of the Fifth Avenue store, which was designed by the award-winning firm Burdifilek and sparkles like a colour-speckled diamond on its busy Manhattan corner. "We still have a lot of work to do, but this is an international stage for us and, from here, the world will get to know about Joe Fresh. We're committed to seeing it through."
Already, the world is, much like those diehard shoppers who staked out a spot on the sidewalk, showing its enthusiasm. "We've already got calls from Spain, the Middle East and Asia," Mimran said. "You've got to be able to attract and amaze people."
If the notoriously tough New York market is any indication, that could very well happen, even if takes many more mini pencil skirts to get there.

Full text: The Listing
Asking price : $17-million
Taxes : $31,407 (2011)
Agent : Bernice Whelan (Bernice Whelan Realty Inc.)
The back story
The historic estate known as Woodlands is located just outside of Barrie, on the north shore of Lake Simcoe's Kempenfelt Bay.
Local folklore suggests that the area provided refuge for escaped slaves from the United States. Land title records show that the first owner of the swathe of land now called Woodlands was an African-American named William Davenport, though researchers were not able to determine whether he was a fugitive slave.
The notable red-brick Victorian house that still stands today has been an area landmark since it was built in 1867 by timber baron Richard Power on 57 acres carved from Mr. Davenport's holding.
An article published in the Saturday Globe on Dec. 14, 1895 described Woodlands as "one of the most attractive pictures of a rural home to be found outside of the estates of Great Britain or the Continent."
The third and most famous previous owner of Woodlands was Lt.-Col. Arthur Peuchen, who bought the property in 1907 and went on to survive the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. Lt.-Col. Peuchen, a military man and yachtsman, was rebuked afterwards for boarding a lifeboat full of women and children.
He defended his actions by saying that the lifeboat needed an experienced hand. Nevertheless, he suffered from the public condemnation throughout his life.
While Lt.-Col. Peuchen owned a large house on Jarvis Street in Toronto, Woodlands was his summer home, says real estate broker Bernice Whelan.
The house today
Mark and Cathy Porter have been gradually restoring the property since they purchased the property in the late 1990s.
Refurbishing a remarkable 14,000 square feet of finished space has taken years, the couple says. The house had 18 bedrooms and 13 bathrooms when the Porters took over. They enlarged some bedrooms to reduce the number to 14.
"I lived here for two years before I found the thirteenth bathroom," says Mr. Porter.
In the grand foyer, a wide staircase curves to the second floor. Mr. Porter says the sagging stairway needed to be dismantled and rebuilt with some added support from modern engineering hidden inside. More recently the couple lifted the worn wool carpet in the foyer to discover an untouched hardwood floor.
"I found this inlaid floor underneath it and it had never been sanded, let alone finished," says Mr. Porter.
In the principal rooms on the main floor, elaborate plaster mouldings and decorative elements adorn the walls and ceilings 12 feet high. When the couple moved in, old wallpaper was hanging from the ceiling in the living room.
Gradually, the Porters had the plaster repaired and painted and the rooms.
"We really took our time renovating," Ms. Porter says.
At one time the house had four galley kitchen and pantry areas.
Today a large kitchen has updated cabinets, built-in appliances and a granite-topped island. A former pantry was fitted long ago with reclaimed wooden cabinets from Toronto's Royal York Hotel. Today the space provides a bar and prep area beside the dining room.
A former greenhouse has been turned into a large summer room with walls of windows and French doors that lead to a terrace outside.
Outside, wraparound covered porches overlook the lawns and gardens which slope down to the water's edge. Today the property has 900 feet of shoreline and a two-hole golf course beside the bay. A renovated two-storey boathouse has slips at water level with living space above.
At the rear of the house, a nursery wing once devoted to the children and their governesses has been preserved. Today the bedrooms still have bars on the windows and Dutch doors, which can remain closed on the bottom half while the top half swings open. In days past, the parents and staff could look in on the little ones without entering the room.
"We've kept it all in the original state because it was such a unique era - your kids didn't live with you, they lived in the back of the house with their nannies," Mr. Porter says.
Throughout the house, many pieces of furniture have stayed in place through the tenure of various owners. In one locked drawer, Mr. Porter found sepia-toned photographs of the grounds and former residents. He had the images framed and hung on the walls.
The Porters also began collecting Titanic memorabilia once they learned about the former occupant's connection to the disaster. Over the years, friends and guests have added pieces to the collection as well.
Several years ago the Porters brought in some art students to render the Titanic and scenes from the estate's history in paint on a domed ceiling above the staircase.
The anniversary
On Saturday night, the Porters will mark the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the famous White Star liner by holding a dinner and costume party for 125 guests.
"I think it's going to be a celebration of all the people that lived," Mr. Porter says.
Guests will dine on the same dishes served to the first class passengers on the night of April 14, 1912. The menu includes poached salmon with mousseline sauce, sirloin of beef, roast duckling with apple sauce and Waldorf pudding.
The Porters have hired an orchestra to play the music that would have been heard aboard the Titanic that night. Actors will play the parts of crew members in a re-enactment of the events.
A little after 11 p.m., an actor will use a bull-horn to announce that the vessel has hit an iceberg.
"At 2:20 a.m. it will be lights out," Mr. Porter says.

High rollers rolling back into Oakville

Abstract: "When you buy a Gucci handbag for $2,000 or $4,000, that's not a necessity. That's a want. It's a feel-good moment," he says. "Luxury real estate is not driven by necessity. It's only driven by want."

Full text: Christopher Invidiata, real estate agent to the wealthy, sees a rebound in luxury properties
Christopher Invidiata is standing in an opulent centre hall. One floor above him, a gallery encircles the space. One floor higher than that, a glass cupola stands as the crown on this Oakville mansion.
The realtor is pointing out the elements that might tempt a buyer to pay the asking price of $6.998-million. Around him, workers are polishing floors and placing furniture for that weekend's big event: Mr. Invidiata will host an educational seminar for Chinese buyers of Canadian real estate. Interest is rising from overseas investors at the same time confidence is strengthening among local business titans and entrepreneurs, says Mr. Invidiata. He is seeing the first signs that people are ready to move after a very slow few years in high end real estate in this historic town on Lake Ontario.
"This will be the year the big inventory gets sold."
Mr. Invidiata's inventory includes a dozen or so listings with asking prices between $3-million and $19-million. Members of his team at Re/Max Aboutowne Realty Corp. handle another sheaf of listings in the $1-million to $2-million range.
Since 1987 he has made a career of real estate sales among the 278 properties on a slender strip of waterfront known as Oakville's Gold Coast, with occasional forays into Burlington and Mississauga.
On a recent drive along Lakeshore Road in his black Mercedes sedan, he explained Gold Coast dynamics. Anybody driving regularly along that road for the past few years has seen one 'for sale' sign after another, he explains. "That made you discouraged and worried."
Even very wealthy buyers need to feel that they're making a good investment on a principal residence, he adds. The cottage or country property is the family heirloom; the city property should increase in value.
With that, well-off buyers will wait for evidence that the market has turned.
"I'd rather pay a little bit more in a rising market than to rush in and buy in a declining market," he says of the mind-set.
Asking prices on some properties in the upper echelons have been cut by 10 or 20 per cent or more in a stagnant market, he says. When they dipped below replacement value in some cases, buyers stepped up.
Suddenly he points to one "sold" sign in front of a large spread on Lakeshore, then turns the corner onto Maple Grove Avenue and gestures to another.
"Look at that. Tell me that doesn't build confidence."
The house at 124 Maple Grove was built on spec by a local developer. Some of the five-star accoutrements in its 10,000 square feet include a library panelled in mahogany, a home theatre room and a kitchen by the English bespoke cabinet maker Clive Christian. The grey veins in each slab of white marble have been painstakingly matched.
"It becomes art," he says of the craft involved in laying polished marble floors. "They're so smooth."
The house provides a good backdrop for the seminar for Chinese buyers, says Mr. Invidiata, who will introduce them to an immigration lawyer and a banker. Of approximately 100,000 immigrants who arrive in the Greater Toronto Area annually, about 22,000 will go to Halton and Peel. About 2,000 of those are deemed high net worth. The largest groups are from China and India.
In many cases they're buying a second or third home and they are attracted to Oakville for its good private schools, two of which offer lessons in Mandarin, he adds. Other buyers in Oakville tend to come from neighbouring Mississauga and Burlington.
They are drawn to a historic centre where the 19th-century houses are preserved under heritage protection rules. The water's edge is lined with the former summer estates of Toronto's aristocracy.
"It's a very safe, predictable community experience," he says in comparing the town today to Toronto's mix of wealthy and gritty pockets. "It's got the character and the charm. It's got the true community atmosphere."
Marc Hewitt is an Oakville-based developer who is working with Sotheby's International Realty Canada and Mr. Invidiata to sell a condominium development called Edgemere Estates on Lakeshore Road.
Mr. Hewitt agrees that sales are picking up for carriage trade properties. Three units at Edgemere have sold in the past two months at prices between $3-million and $4-million dollars.
Potential buyers in the past have taken as long as 12 months to make up their minds, he says. In one recent transaction, a couple came on a Sunday to see the buildings under construction.
"Within 10 days they had purchased."
He brought in Mr. Invidiata because of his focus on that extremely narrow niche.
"He's made a specialty of the waterfront. It's more analytical than you get from most agents."
Mr. Invidiata likens investing in high-end real estate to dropping a few thousand on a designer bag.
"When you buy a Gucci handbag for $2,000 or $4,000, that's not a necessity. That's a want. It's a feel-good moment," he says. "Luxury real estate is not driven by necessity. It's only driven by want."
It's the same thing that sells boats, planes, clothes and cars. "It's about giving yourself pleasure. Buying gold stocks or bank stocks doesn't do it."
Buying the house on the waterfront fulfills a dream. But once people have achieved it, they don't mind cycling back down because they want a smaller house.
"Want, not need."
Mr. Invidiata says he has built his business by talking clients out of buying houses that he thinks will prove to be poor investments. In one case he sent an agent down to the Turks & Caicos to do reconnaissance on a property that a client had his eye on.
It turned out the house was on a gorgeous cove but it didn't have a private beach. The closest beach was a 10-minute drive away.
"I told him 'don't buy it. I wouldn't spend one dollar on it.' "
He figures that a house his client buys today is one that he'll end up listing a few years down the road and he doesn't want to be stuck with a property that's difficult to sell.
"Trust is the biggest thing. Once you've earned it, that's the glue."

CO-OP AGENT
Mara Bossio, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
The Action: Local waterfront residents wanting to buy a new two-bedroom-plus-den suite with unobstructed sight lines were given a dozen viable options by their agent Mara Bossio. Their favourite candidate was this corner unit in the second phase of the West Harbour City complex on the former Molson brewery site near Fort York.
What They Got: Situated on the 15th floor of a high-rise just registered last summer, this 1,385-square-foot suite has the luxury of nine-foot ceilings, hardwood floors and walls of windows throughout, plus three balconies facing the city and lake off one bedroom and the open living and dining areas off the U-shaped kitchen.
* Other conveniences include a master bedroom with a walk-in closet and one of two marble bathrooms, as well as stacked laundry machines, stainless steel kitchen appliances, a storage locker and underground parking.
* A monthly fee of $695 covers water, heat and amenities, from a gym, indoor pool and party room to 24-hour concierge, visitor suites and parking.
The Agent's Take: "When searching downtown for a [roughly] 1,600-square-foot, two-bedroom plus a den in a new development - with an interesting view and outdoor space - it was challenging," says Ms. Bossio. "Interestingly, Fleet Street and Lake Shore is one of the only new developments offering the larger suites and the view while keeping the price well below $1-million."

Full text: The spectacular Seaport Farmers' Market in Halifax is among upscale, permanent venues springing up with a focus on local food
Farmers' markets attract city dwellers the way clover fields draw bees. Every major Canadian city has at least one, and since colonial days they have been a favourite tool of city planners seeking to develop new communities or rejuvenate rundown parts of town.
Though farmers' markets traditionally have not been money-making commercial real estate ventures, a spate of new permanent structures suggests they have a new role as a popular anchor for urban redevelopment to lure both tourists and residents as the buy-local food movement gathers momentum across North America.
"They may make lots of money for the vendors and for businesses in the area around them, but the markets themselves don't usually make money," said Keith Tufts, lead architect for the Halifax Seaport Farmers' Market that opened in 2010.
Halifax's market history dates back to a royal proclamation in 1750 that approved the establishment of the first official farmers' market in North America. By contrast, Granville Island Market began operating in Vancouver on the south side of False Creek under the Granville Street Bridge in the 1970s.
New markets are usually built with property and financial aid from government. But they also rely on support from vendors, farmers, local residents and other interested parties, as the Fulton Street Farmers' Market in Grand Rapids, Mich., did when it sold personalized bricks to raise capital to build a new covered market and public square recently.
Other new market buildings have been erected in recent years in London, where a new market was built in a square that has held a farmers' market since 1853 and in Saskatoon, which opened its first covered market building in a prime redevelopment area known as River Landing on a bank of the South Saskatchewan River.
The Halifax Port Authority Development initiated the $13-million Seaport market, in part, to serve its growing cruise ship business. Almost a quarter of a million cruise passengers arrived in the harbour last year and one of the first things they saw from the towering multi-storey ships was Seaport's landscaped roof, Mr. Tufts said.
"My favourite part of the building is the green roof," he said. "The view from it is spectacular. And even though it's more expensive to put a deck over a roof, it protects the structure. Normally a roof has to be replaced every 15 to 20 years, but with the green roof protecting it, this one should last twice as long."
The ambitious market development was designed to meet and exceed the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) platinum standards and features state-of-the-art sustainability treatments such as wind-turbine-powered outdoor lighting, a combined geothermal-solar energy system, grey water recycling and interior ceilings and other furnishings made from wood recovered after Hurricane Juan toppled trees in 2003.
"I love walking through the market and hearing people talk about 'Juan wood,' " said Mr. Tufts, who arranged to use the wood after a local company salvaged Halifax's hurricane-felled trees. His firm, Lydon Lynch Architects, now has its office on the market's second floor.
"The great thing is that the farmers were 100 per cent behind sustainability because that's the world they live in," he said. "Out on their farms they waste nothing. Everything is valuable. They're dealing with a finite amount of resources and they understand the value of being in a green building that's energy-responsible."
Seaport, which is open six days a week year round, was built as the centrepiece of a port lands rejuvenation project.
The market is packed with locals on most Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays and ranks as one of the three most popular tourist sites in the city, Mr. Tufts said. Cruise passengers stream through the market but are so well fed on the ships they prefer arts and crafts to food.
The vendor board, which has a 40-year lease on the Port Authority building and operates the market, carries a larger mortgage than most other farmers' markets and is in talks now with creditors about refinancing options, said board president Chris de Waal, whose shop, Getaway Farms Classic Butcher, sells grass-fed beef from his family's farm.
"We've had lots of support but we really put our big boy pants on with this project and there's still lots of things we've got to learn," Mr. de Waal said. "We're figuring out how to give Halifax the market it wants."
To increase traffic flow during the week, the board is working with Project for Public Spaces, a New York City non-profit that specializes in creating and improving markets and other public spaces.
In Grand Rapids, the idea for a new version of the Fulton Street Market emerged during neighbourhood plan discussions. The existing market was founded in 1922 and now consists of a concrete pad on which 70 to 80 vendors sell from a makeshift setup using trucks and tarps, said Ted Lott, of Lott3Metz Architecture.
The new covered market and public plaza will cost about $3-million to build and is scheduled to open at a site about two and half kilometres from downtown Grand Rapids near residential neighbourhoods.
"Farmers are excited to have a permanent shed where they can operate year round," Mr. Lott said. "I think they'd all had enough of tarps full of rain collapsing on them."
"One of the unintended consequences was that farmers began thinking about the new building and they wanted to extend their season," he said. Vendors who normally stopped selling around the beginning of October began thinking about what they planted, how they stored produce and using greenhouses so they could sell longer.
"They were very ingenious and it will mean the city will have a better selection of fresh, local produce year round," said Mr. Lott.
"That focus on locally grown food has certainly benefited their [the farmers'] growth over the past few years and the project would have had a much tougher road had that ethic not risen up. It certainly helped with fund raising, too."
The market will open in May and it already has a waiting list of vendors eager to rent space.

Full text: Clybourne Park
Written by Bruce Norris
Directed by Joel Greenberg
Starring Michael Healey, Maria Ricossa, Sterling Jarvis
A Studio 180 production in association with Canadian Stage
At Berkeley Street Theatre, Toronto
***
From Willy Loman trying to pay that last instalment on his mortgage in Death of a Salesman to the unscrupulous hustlers attempting to unload worthless parcels of Florida land in Glengarry Glen Ross , so many of the best American plays have been about real estate, in one way or another.
Clybourne Park , a nasty and brilliant Pulitzer Prize-winning comedy by Chicago-based playwright Bruce Norris, tackles this North American obsession head on - but also digs into the politics of race and class buried beneath housing bubbles and bidding wars. Could it arrive in Canada at a better moment?
Audaciously, Norris's play tells the story of Lorraine Hansberry's 1959 classic A Raisin in the Sun from the perspective of its sole white character.
In Hansberry's famous drama, the first by an African-American woman to open on Broadway (where Norris's play also opens this month), the Younger family of inner-city Chicago is visited by Karl Lindner from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, who offers the black family money to not buy a house in his all-white neighbourhood.
Clybourne Park begins in the house in question, where Bev (Maria Ricossa) and her gloomy husband Russ (Michael Healey) are packing up for a move to the suburbs. They've sold their place to the Youngers for less than it's worth, the price being depressed - like Russ - due to a tragedy that took place within the house's walls.
Soon, Lindner (an awkward Mark McGrinder) shows up with his deaf wife Betsy (Kimwun Perehinec) in tow, to try to convince the couple to back out of the sale.
Russ and Bev refuse to back out of the sale, but Karl thinks he's right, that racial mixing will be bad for both blacks and whites. Indeed, he tries to convince Russ and Bev's African-American maid Francine (Audrey Dwyer) and her husband Albert (Sterling Jarvis) on this point in a discussion that eventually leads to an all-out explosion of tempers in the household, although it's perhaps not for the reasons you'd expect.
Flash forward from 1959 to 2009 and, as it turns out, Lindner was correct about part of his argument at least. The arrival of African-American families in the inner suburb of Clybourne Park led to "white flight" and the neighbourhood's property values went into decline in the 1960s.
Now, however, house prices are back on the rise as Clybourne Park gentrifies - and the local Property Owners' Association is meeting to discuss proposed plans to tear down the Youngers' old homestead and build a new house on the same spot.
This time, it's a white couple named Steve and Lindsey (played by McGrinder and Perehinec) whose real-estate dreams are being stymied by a black couple named Kevin and Lena (Dwyer and Jarvis). Since we're in 2009 and in the United States, naturally there are lawyers involved too, which allows Ricossa and Jeff Lillico to give a pair of hilarious supporting performances.
At first, the conversation is about frontage and height with digressions about holidays in Prague, but eventually the subject of race surfaces (even as the builders find something else buried in the back yard). As the initially friendly meeting devolves into a shouting match, the two couples unleash a barrage of racist and sexist jokes in an attempt to prove who is least easily offended. (If you want to know what the difference is between a white woman and a tampon, well, you'll have to buy a ticket.)
Norris is a satirist who's particularly adept at poking through the surface of white liberal guilt, but director Joel Greenberg's production only gets half of his play right.
In the section set in 1959, much of the politically incorrect humour surrounding the treatment of the minority characters falls flat. Greenberg runs away from the material, directing it in a broad style that makes it seem like a bad sitcom instead of delivering the perfectly pitched insensitivity of a cable drama like Mad Men .
Even the comedy that isn't politically charged, like the opening banter between Russ and Bev about Neapolitan ice cream, comes off as excruciatingly unfunny due to the mismatched tone.
Thanks to a deeply felt performance by Healey as the troubled Russ, however, at least the drama of this opening act lands somewhat effectively.
In the second act, however, Clybourne Park springs to life and the production soars. Director and actors clearly find skewering contemporary culture more comfortable, the exception being a huffing and puffing McGrinder, who misses the meat of some of his best angry-white-male lines like: "How can the majority be marginalized?"
In the end, Studio 180 may not be giving Toronto the ideal production of Clybourne Park , but for those who want to see what the international buzz over this play is about, it's cheaper than a flight to New York.
Clybourne Park runsat the Berkeley Street Theatre until April 28.

Full text: There's no evidence that federal budget cuts will turn Ottawa-Gatineau into 'ghost town,' says business school professor
Canada's government town is holding its breath.
The private and public sectors of Ottawa-Gatineau are united in a collective sense of unease as they wait to see whether billions in budget cuts will deliver economic pain the region has largely avoided.
While politicians on Parliament Hill spent the last three years obsessing over the recession, the local economy has hummed along, largely oblivious to the global financial gloom.
Housing prices rose steeply, unemployment stayed well below the national average and residents waited in long lines to snap up the latest high-end urban condos now peppering the city core. Even the once-struggling Ottawa Senators franchise had no trouble selling NHL tickets during what was supposed to be a rebuilding year.
But now large swaths of the Ottawa-Gatineau economy are on hold.
Home renovations contractor Moe Abbas said fear has cut into his business. Government employees he counts as clients are waiting to find out the fate of their jobs, leaving some to cancel or delay expensive projects.
"It's definitely had a massive impact, not only in people losing their jobs but in the fear mentality," said Mr. Abbas, the owner of Ottawa General Contractors. He believes the uncertainty will last another three months, and could cost him at least $250,000 in business.
"The big concern here is that nobody knows, so once they figure out 'I lost my job or I didn't lose my job,' then everything will be back to normal," he said. "It's just the time of uncertainty."
Canada's national unemployment rate for March inched downward to 7.2 per cent from 7.6 per cent in January, but the unemployment rate in Ottawa-Gatineau has essentially stayed constant over the first three months of 2012 at 6 per cent. During the recession, the unemployment rate peaked nationally at 8.7 per cent but never surpassed 7.3 per cent in Ottawa-Gatineau.
Whatever the job cuts, there will be a "ripple effect" because spending in other areas will also be reduced, meaning there will be less money for goods and services, said Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson.
"There's no question it's creating a lot of angst for people who are in the public service but also for the overall community," he said.
One website focused on local jobs reports that the number of people posting resumes is up about 30 per cent from last year.
"There's been quite an influx," said Geoff Dorken, a regional sales rep for Ottawajobshop.ca. Mr. Dorken said there is still plenty of work in Ottawa provided that job seekers are willing to make do with smaller paycheques. Polling suggests there will be little national sympathy. A pre-budget survey by Nanos Research found Canadians want to see even deeper government cuts than what the Conservatives delivered.
Ian Lee, a Carleton University professor with the Sprott School of Business, said job cuts are less extensive than those of the 1990s and, like last time, Ottawa's economy will stay afloat.
"I just don't believe that there's any evidence that plausibly, empirically suggests this is going to be an apocalyptic, devastating, moment when Ottawa - as some people have said - is going to be turned into a ghost town," said Prof. Lee, who has studied the local impact of the much deeper government cuts of the mid-1990s.
Job swapping will mean that most employees who leave government will go because they want to, whether they're young employees who want a new career or aging baby boomers ready to retire, he said.
Those workers will take pensions or at least compensation. "In fact, in '95 to '98, the exact opposite happened to the doom and gloom predictions," he said. "The car dealerships and RV dealerships and big ticket home renovation and appliances, they all shot up because people were going out the door with cheques of $50,000, $80,000, $100,000."
Still, there are concrete signs of a slowdown.
Michel Noreau, a Century 21 real estate agent in Gatineau, said there have been fewer people looking to upgrade by buying larger homes.
"Everybody was saying, 'I'm not going to buy a house, I'll wait for the budget,'" he said, adding that he understands the hesitation because his son lost his job at Statistics Canada. In a typical month, Mr. Noreau would sell between 15 and 20 homes, but last month he sold only 10, something he partially pegs on people bracing for the job cuts.
Cindy VanBuskirk, general manager of the Rideau Centre and vice chair of the Downtown Rideau Business Improvement Association, said it's difficult to predict whether businesses will be affected because information about the budget and job cuts is still being revealed.
"The economy in Ottawa did not come to a crashing halt the last time we experienced federal government cuts; I expect it will not come to a crashing halt this time around," she said. "But I think as business owners, we need to be watchful and mindful of what's happening."

The young and the eloquent: Dialling up a new call-centre capital

Author: Hoffman, Andy

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/young-eloquent-dialling-up-new-call-centre/docview/971519604/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: In a business venture that is rarely talked about publicly by its Canadian corporate parent, Telus International has placed a weighty bet on the Philippines, making it the cornerstone of its outsourcing operations. It acquired a local company named Ambergris Solutions Inc. back in 2005, slightly ahead of the industry's Philippine influx. It now operates three call centres in Manila that employ as many as 8,500 workers during the busiest parts of the year.

Full text: ASIA-PACIFIC REPORTER
You call them when you are angry. You call them when you're frustrated - when you can't find what you're looking for. You call them when you need something. And you call them when that thing that you "paid good money for" isn't working the way it's supposed to.
Every day, more than a million North Americans dial corporate customer service numbers to complain, to inquire, to activate accounts, to order products or to seek help. And every evening, hundreds of thousands of young workers pour into call centres more than 12,000 kilometres away in the Philippines, to be that friendly, patient voice on the other end of the line.
Endowed with a trove of young, well-educated workers who speak "American-style" English, the call centre industry in the Philippines is thriving. Last year, the southeast Asian country quietly overtook India to become the call centre capital of the world.
Manila's call centre industry works when the rest of the city sleeps. The busiest time begins at around midnight.
On a recent Monday evening in the Fort Bonafacio district, hundreds of call centre workers sit clustered together fielding calls from the United States. They are providing 411 information services for a telephone company.
"For what city?" says a young woman in clear, unaccented English. "Please hold," she says before a few clicks of a keyboard give her an address in a rural section of a northeastern state. Within seconds, she's on to the next call. Neither she, nor any of her colleagues look much older than 25.
Economically hobbled for decades by systemic political corruption, high unemployment and subpar GDP growth, the Philippines was long referred to as "the sick man of Asia." But the country, with a population close to 100 million scattered across more than 7,000 islands, is now capitalizing on a seismic shift in global business practices.
Labour pools in Asia are become increasingly transient as companies seek to reduce costs. Lured by competitive wages and an ability to maintain or even improve the quality of service, a portion of the call centre sector is shifting from India to the Philippines in much the same way that parts of the textile industry has relocated to Vietnam and Bangladesh in response to rising manufacturing costs in China.
At the same time, many Western companies are still facing a persistently uncertain economic outlook and remain reluctant to invest the capital needed to expand and hire new employees. Costs continue to be cut wherever they can.
Cashing in on outsourcing
Few industries have benefitted more from this prolonged corporate austerity than what is euphemistically called the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) sector. Western firms are now outsourcing everything from back office services to forms processing to customer care. Call centres, such as the ones now flourishing in the Philippines, are the front lines of the $130-billion global BPO industry that has grown by more than 10 per cent a year since 2005.
The industry is expanding even faster in the Philippines, growing by an average annual rate of 28 per cent for the past six years. In 2011, sector-wide revenues topped $11-billion (U.S.), accounting for about 4 per cent of the country's GDP. Almost 640,000 Filipinos work in the industry and 75 per cent of those are located in the capital region of Metro Manila.
Calls from North America are routed to places like Market! Market!, a cavernous mall in Fort Bonifacio. Teeming with shoppers and people looking for a respite from the city's oppressive temperatures during the day, the mall's top two floors continue to hum at night. They are home to about 3,000 workers at a massive call centre operated by Telus International, an arm of Canada's second largest telecommunications company, Vancouver-based Telus Corp.
In a business venture that is rarely talked about publicly by its Canadian corporate parent, Telus International has placed a weighty bet on the Philippines, making it the cornerstone of its outsourcing operations. It acquired a local company named Ambergris Solutions Inc. back in 2005, slightly ahead of the industry's Philippine influx. It now operates three call centres in Manila that employ as many as 8,500 workers during the busiest parts of the year. Telus' investment in the Philippines makes it a rare breed among Canadian companies. Canada and the Philippines share a deep and growing tie, as the Philippines has become the biggest country-source of immigrants to Canada. But few Canadian companies are active there.
Ahead of the 2005 deal, Telus briefly considered India as a destination for its first call centres outside Canada. It quickly zeroed in on the Philippines, however, which presented much better prospects, says Telus International president Jeffery Puritt.
India "was already a heated market and we would be a slow arrival there," Mr. Puritt says. "We weren't convinced the longer-term financial opportunity was really going to be in our best interest. The Philippines was just then coming into its own."
Seven years on, Telus International is now grappling with both its own success in the Philippines and the soaring growth of the local industry. From a base of 15 customers in 2005, Mr. Puritt says the company's Philippines operations now provide services to about 40 clients. At the same time, revenue and profitability in the Philippines have quadrupled.
The North American connection
Telus' clients include several North American telecom and cable firms. Call centre workers in the Philippines provide services such as 411, billing, and technical support to customers. Other clients include utilities and electronics firms, and the industry also handles support for one of the world's largest online video game makers.
Ironically, it is the Philippines' colonial past (it was a U.S. colony for much of the 20th century and before that endured more than 300 years of Spanish rule), that has helped foster the rise of the call centre. Young Filipinos are steeped in American pop culture, from music to movies to NBA basketball. Compared to their counterparts in India, they speak English with an accent that is more American and "more pleasing to North Americans," says Jeffery Uthoff, head of Telus' Philippines operations.
Attracting and retaining qualified workers remains Telus International's biggest challenge. Experienced call centre workers are in high demand in Manila and hopping from job to job in search of higher pay and better benefits is common. The industry's average annual attrition rate is a staggering 61 per cent. Telus says it has an attrition rate of less than 50 per cent, but the company is now going to extraordinary lengths to keep employees happy.
Telus staff can, for example, work part-time toward a university degree at the office. Partnering with local schools, the company heavily subsidizes tuition costs and brings professors to its call centres during the evenings to deliver lectures and lessons to employees before they start their shift. The company calls the program Telus International University.
Boosting the national economy
Almost all of the global outsourcing industry heavyweights - firms such as Infosys Ltd., Convergys Corp. and even a unit of the Indian multinational conglomerate Tata Group - have now launched operations in the Philippines. While India remains the dominant player in software and information technology (IT) support, the Philippines is now the preferred destination for voice-based customer service.
It's an economic advance that is helping reshape a country that has endured decades of weak growth, corruption and persistent poverty. Common among industry executives and many government officials is a belief that call centres are contributing to the creation of a new middle class that could help propel the Philippines to join the economic ascent of its neighbours, including Thailand and Vietnam.
The starting salary for a call centre worker in the Philippines is between 12,000 and 15,000 pesos per month ($278 - $348). It may not sound like much but it's more than a bank teller makes in Manila and is often enough to support a family in a country where the annual GDP per capita is about $2,000.
Opportunities for call centre workers come quickly. Many earn a promotion after six months, advancing from agent to trainer and, eventually, to a supervisor or management role.
Increasingly, these jobs offer young Filipinos an alternative to having to travel overseas to find well-paying jobs. The economy remains heavily dependent on money sent home by citizens working in foreign countries. At about $20-billion per year, (about $2-billion sent from Canada) remittances account for between 10 per cent and 11 per cent of the Philippines' annual GDP. While entry-level call centre workers do not make as much as overseas workers, the lower cost of living in the Philippines makes a big difference, and call centre jobs allow families to stay together.
Manila transformed
The knock-on effects of the fast-growing industry are transforming parts of the capital. In business districts such as Makati City and Ortigas, there is a severe shortage of commercial real estate suitable for call centre operations. More than 90 per cent of the new office space being built in Manila is slated to become call centres.
To service the wave of nocturnal workers, the city now runs around the clock. Convenience stores such as 7/11 are mushrooming and many bars and restaurants are now open at 6 a.m., catering to the call centre crowd coming off shift.
Questions remain, however, about whether the Philippines can leverage its call centre success to attract more valuable contracts providing higher-end services to the health care, financial and IT sectors, as Indian companies have done. Moving up the value chain will be a critical step if the industry hopes to continue driving economic growth.
India dominates in IT and engineering outsourcing work because of its plentiful supply of engineers and computer science university graduates. The Philippines churns out more than 300,000 new college graduates a year and the outsourcing industry could provide them with much-needed jobs if international companies conclude the country's work force is skilled enough to produce service higher up the value chain.
Despite its economic benefits, the call centre industry has come under fire from those who criticize the gruelling lifestyle and health risks it imposes on a workforce whose average age is about 25.
Call centres are being been blamed for everything from a rise in the rate of sexually transmitted disease among young Filipinos to rising debt loads taken on by workers abusing the credit cards their new jobs have qualified them for.
The picture that many Filipinos have of call centre workers is groups of young people huddling outside office buildings smoking in the middle of the night or drinking in nightclubs at 7 a.m. That image is at odds with the contribution the industry has made toward creating a new middle class.
Count Regine Gargollo among Manila's new call centre middle class. The 24-year-old has worked for Telus for six years and now trains other call centre agents.
Her wages have allowed her to rent her own apartment in Fort Bonifacio. Five nights a week, she hops on a Jeepney for a short ride to the office at the Market! Market! mall. Her shift runs from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. but three nights a week she arrives a few hours early to attend class at Telus International University. She's studying the humanities and her favourite subject is literature.
"So far, I haven't found another company that is willing to put me through school," she says.
Ms. Gargollo's family complains that they don't see her often enough because of her unusual work hours.
She says much of her social life revolves around work. Telus provides its workers with access to a fitness centre and, not unlike a high school, has encouraged employees to form clubs and interest groups that include drama, art and photography.
"It's the atmosphere. We have a really close-knit relationship," Ms. Gargollo explains. "It's almost like you are a family. Maybe it's because we all work at night and the rest of our friends and family are all asleep at that time. We compensate by having our own little community here."

Don't fight over St. Clair West. Survey it

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/dont-fight-over-st-clair-west-survey/docview/971519519/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: As with Mr. [William Whyte]'s work, Mr. [Jan Gehl]'s meticulous surveys focus not just on quantity but also quality - for example, not just the raw volume of pedestrians walking on a given street, but also the time they spend on a park bench, in front of store windows or at a cafe. "The real indicator is the stationary activities," Ms. van Deurs said, noting that pausing pedestrians not only indicate amenable public spaces, they also generate more retail activity in those areas.

Full text: Global cities including Copenhagen and Melbourne have employed sophisticated strategies to quantify the success of public spaces
How does a city know if a significant change to its public spaces - for example, the construction of major new surface transit lines, such as those planned for Eglinton and Sheppard East - has succeeded?
It's a surprisingly elusive question, as the ongoing fight over the St. Clair West right-of-way demonstrates. Fully two years after the project's completion, critics continue to insist that the dedicated streetcar line has led to shuttered stores and traffic jams. Proponents, in turn, point to the arrival of new businesses and rising real-estate prices. But both sides tend to rely on anecdotes and examples.
According to city data obtained by The Globe and Mail, St. Clair West has seen a decline in vehicle traffic, an uptick in transit usage, and fewer accidents since the line was completed in 2009. Planning department figures also show a growth in recent years in construction and development activity from Yonge to Keele Street.
Councillor Joe Mihevc (Ward 21 St. Paul's West) last week asked the Toronto Transit Commission to hire an outside consultant to conduct an analysis on the impact of the changes along the St. Clair West corridor, looking at trends in ridership, operating costs, accident rates, storefront rentals, patio licences and parking. The TTC will report back on how it plans to proceed in May.
But some other cities, including Copenhagen and Melbourne, have gone one large step further in determining the effect of such changes, by systematically measuring a wide range of fine-grain public-space indicators - everything from the number of cafes and street benches to the demographics of local park users and the way people window-shop. What's more, these cities have repeated such surveys every decade or so, using the resulting trend data to correct planning mistakes and undertake additional improvements.
Seattle, in 2009, became one of the first U.S. cities to commission a so-called "Public Life/Public Space" study as part of a broad strategy to boost pedestrian activity in its downtown, deploy new streetcar lines and improve connections to the waterfront. "We wanted to be much more data-driven, in terms of outcomes," said Barbara Gray, who served as project manager for Seattle's pedestrian master plan.
Such surveys - typically conducted by teams of clipboard-wielding students - are the brainchild of the Danish architect and planner Jan Gehl, who developed the car-free zone and bike-path network in central Copenhagen in the late 1960s.
At the time, the city's historic core was highly congested, and Mr. Gehl - who now runs a planning consultancy - realized that the way to make a case for removing cars was to use hard data to show municipal politicians and local businesses that the shift led to better pedestrian experiences.
Camilla van Deurs, an associate at Gehl Architects, said the approach is based on techniques traffic engineers use to measure and model car volumes in order to make a case for more investment. "Once you've counted something, it matters."
Mr. Gehl's methodology also evokes the classic 1980 documentary, The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces , by urbanist William Whyte. Using time-lapse footage of several New York plazas, Mr. Whyte showed why some attracted pedestrians and others didn't, and what could be done to draw a crowd (e.g., putting out tables).
As with Mr. Whyte's work, Mr. Gehl's meticulous surveys focus not just on quantity but also quality - for example, not just the raw volume of pedestrians walking on a given street, but also the time they spend on a park bench, in front of store windows or at a cafe. "The real indicator is the stationary activities," Ms. van Deurs said, noting that pausing pedestrians not only indicate amenable public spaces, they also generate more retail activity in those areas.
Over time, the accumulated data reveals interesting trends when compared to the so-called "base line" conditions captured in an initial survey. In Copenhagen, she said, successive studies by Mr. Gehl showed that for each street parking spot the city removed, four more people came into the car-free zone.
In New York, Mr. Gehl's team scrutinized traffic at Times Square in 2007-2008 and found that 400,000 pedestrians passed through the area each day, but only 65,000 vehicles. That conclusion motivated New York transportation officials in 2009 to convert a swath of road space to a plaza with tables and chairs. A follow-up survey six months later revealed an 84-per-cent increase in the number of pedestrians who chose to hang out in the square.
The city of Melbourne, for its part, has been relying on Mr. Gehl's public-space surveys since the early 1980s, using successive results to restrict traffic, widen downtown sidewalks, plant street trees and convert once dingy alleys into a lively laneway network with small-scale retail. The result: The number of downtown cafes has jumped from 2 to 617 in three decades, said Gil Penalosa, executive director of 8 to 80 Cities, who has worked with Mr. Gehl in Melbourne.
Those data-intensive public space upgrades appear to have produced more than just cafes, he added: Once Australia's perennial second city, Melbourne now sits atop The Economist's urban livability rankings.

Real estate to die for

Author: Jennifer Van Evra

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/real-estate-die/docview/971519367/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "When we were closed, we used to say you could be born in Vancouver, live your whole life in Vancouver, but when you died, if you didn't have a space here you got kicked out of Vancouver," says Mountain View manager Glen Hodges, who moved from Saskatchewan to Vancouver in 2002 to begin the process of reopening the cemetery and turning it into a more viable business. "And I think being laid to rest where you spent a significant part of your life is a natural tendency."

Full text: Vancouver's only cemetery is open again, but costs an arm and a leg to spend eternity with B.C. royalty
It's some of the hottest real estate in one of Vancouver's most in-demand neighbourhoods, and it's up for sale for the first time in nearly a quarter century.
Located in the heart of Mount Pleasant, it features winding walkways, mature trees and tasteful gardens, quiet neighbours and heritage charm, and offers a veritable oasis from the non-stop din of the city.
But before you pull out your chequebook, be aware that the property does have its downsides. The view from inside is terrible, the price isn't cheap - at $703 a square foot, it's steeper than many of the area's more luxurious homes - and it comes with one decidedly unfortunate residency requirement: You must be dead.
Ever since 1986, when the city's only cemetery, Mountain View, reached its maximum capacity and cut off sales, anyone wanting to buy a burial plot in Vancouver came up cold. Their only option was to head for the suburbs and secure a spot in Burnaby, New Westminster, Coquitlam, North Vancouver or beyond - places they may never have even visited in life, let alone chosen as locales to rest in peace.
But a section of B.C.'s Cremation, Interment and Funeral Services Act allows cemeteries to "reclaim" graves and sell them to new buyers - and Mountain View saw it as an opportunity to get business back up and running.
So as of this year, those wanting to stay in Vancouver even after taking their last breath of salty sea air can once again secure a plot in the picturesque 106-acre locale, for a price.
"When we were closed, we used to say you could be born in Vancouver, live your whole life in Vancouver, but when you died, if you didn't have a space here you got kicked out of Vancouver," says Mountain View manager Glen Hodges, who moved from Saskatchewan to Vancouver in 2002 to begin the process of reopening the cemetery and turning it into a more viable business. "And I think being laid to rest where you spent a significant part of your life is a natural tendency."
In order to be reclaimed, a casket plot must first meet several conditions. First and foremost, it needs to be vacant. ("That's the first thing people always want to know, no matter how clearly it's stated," Mr. Hodges says.) The act also stipulates that the graves must have been purchased more than 50 years ago - although Mountain View opted to only resell plots that were bought prior to 1940.
"In the late 1800s and early 1900s, it wasn't uncommon for families to buy four, eight, or even 16 graves at a time. So they would buy a family plot, bury a couple of people, then move away," says Mr. Hodges, who explains that family members would often leave for work, for love, or after a loss, then put down roots elsewhere, leaving extra burial plots behind.
Before it can put the sites up for sale, the cemetery must try to contact the previous owners - a tall order given that they often only have pre-1940s street addresses, many of which have long since been replaced by condos and businesses. The cemetery has also placed ads in newspapers in an attempt to reach early buyers or their families. (And if someone comes forward after a plot is resold, the cemetery must offer them another of equal or greater value.) The process so far has netted more than 150 casket plots; but like any piece of terra firma in Vancouver, it'll cost you.
A single four-foot-by-eight-foot plot, which allows for up to two caskets to be placed one on top of the other and as many as eight cremation urns, is $22,500 plus HST.
"It's partly based on market pricing," says Mr. Hodges, who looked at nearby cemeteries such as Forest Lawn and Ocean View in Burnaby, where prices range from $10,000 to $30,000 - and don't allow for the same number of cremation urns. "But they are land-locked as well, and running out of space."
Nilo Rey was among the first to pay the considerable sum to secure his long-term resting place at Mountain View. Having lived across the street from the cemetery since immigrating from the Philippines in 1994, he has always felt a strong affinity to the grounds, even teaching his kids how to ride bikes - and his wife how to drive a car - on its dead-quiet roadways.
He jokes that if he'd bought space in Burnaby or Surrey, his wife likely wouldn't visit, ironically because she doesn't like to drive. He also chose a plot near a tree and a fountain so "when people sit there, they won't get bored."
Since he still rents his home on Fraser Street, Mr. Rey - who works in a local dental office - is just happy to have a small piece of land to call his own. "I tell my friends that I now own property in Vancouver," he says with a laugh, admitting that his wife wasn't as keen on the purchase. "But the economy, jobs, they can go any time. Death is the only thing that is for sure."
The other thing that is almost as sure is that space in Vancouver - both for the living and deceased - is running out. Mr. Hodges expects that the current reclamation process, which is slated to continue for many months, will yield anywhere between 700 and 1,000 casket graves - not many when you consider the city's population is well over half a million.
"If you want to be in Vancouver, which a lot of people do, we're the only option," says Mr. Hodges, adding that casket space is increasingly rare - especially in densely-populated areas where developers would never dream of buying land to build a cemetery. Also, many religious and cultural groups prefer, or even require, casket burial, which further ups demand.
For now, however, people can choose plots in the historic Masonic area of the cemetery, where long-term neighbours include former premiers, mayors, early pioneers, business tycoons, an RCMP commissioner and at least one lieutenant-governor. In the coming months, sites in the Old and Horne areas closer to 33rd Avenue will also become available.
Since they first went on sale to the public at the end of January, more than a dozen of the casket plots have been sold, as have many of the much smaller - and, at $2,500-$3,200, much less expensive - in-ground cremation spaces that were created by narrowing roadways and removing trees and shrubs.
People with bigger families and deeper pockets also have the option of purchasing one of eight custom family columbaria that can house up to 20 urns and overlook a serene new water feature - but it will set them back $40,000.
For Mr. Hodges, the main aim is to not only recoup the $14-million in cemetery upgrades that allowed for many of the new spaces; he hopes the 126-year-old cemetery will once again become a self-sustaining business - one that will no longer need the $800,000 annual subsidy it receives from the city.
Still, the cemetery manager says he won't be among those lining up to purchase one of Mountain View's 32-square-foot plots. "There is definitely a big part of me in this place," he says, overlooking the newly opened Masonic area as a chilly wind blows through. "But I say that every day I get to go home from the cemetery is a good day."

Full text: The Breakers at Sunset Point on Georgian Bay has been rebuilt with an exacting eye to detail and a taste for opulence
The listing
Asking price: $4.495-million
Taxes: $12,721.76 (2011)
Agent: Andy Taylor and
James Burtnick (Sotheby's International Realty Canada)
The back story
For 100 years or so, seasoned locals in Collingwood, Ont. knew the Breakers as a ramshackle wooden bungalow and local landmark sitting across the road from Georgian Bay and the beach at Sunset Point.
Built in the late 1800s as a private cottage, the Breakers served as a hotel for a time. Local rumours hint at a nefarious past.
When the current owners purchased the property a few years ago, they intended to restore the old structure, which had fallen into disrepair. They learned, however, that a renovation was going to be too costly.
"It was an old house, beautiful in its day, but rickety, with a creaking floor," says the owner. "Of course, I thought I was going to do great things with it and then we had to tear it down," he says.
Neighbours and heritage aficionados objected to the plans to raze the old dwelling and build something new, the homeowner acknowledges.
"When we had to tear it down, it was a big thing."
But the owners received approval from the local authorities and, in 2009, construction began on a 7,000-square-foot house.
"We built it to last a very long time," says the homeowner.
Real estate agent Andy Taylor of Sotheby's International Realty Canada says that by keeping the Breakers name, the owners have maintained a link to its past.
"If it had just been left as derelict, it would have faded in history," he says.
The owner adds that the new building still attracts lots of attention from passers-by and visitors to Sunset Point Park across the street.
"People stop by and photograph it, just like they did the old house."
The house today
The new house has expanded to three distinct wings with five bedrooms and eight full bathrooms.
Visitors arrive to gates of black wrought-iron. Inside the gates, large stone terraces face Georgian Bay.
Inside, a large foyer features a fireplace and a curving staircase to the second floor where a balcony overlooks the room below.
Next to the foyer, a grand living room comprises most of the second wing and has a ceiling height that soars to more than 30 feet. Three sets of French doors open to the terrace and 11 dormer windows bring in additional light.
The wood-burning Rumford fireplace has a limestone mantel six feet from the ground. "Every room has one magnificent architectural feature," says Mr. Taylor, pointing out the staircase in the foyer and the cathedral ceiling in the living room.
The three wings are built around an internal courtyard that shelters the inground swimming pool and also provides sunbathers with privacy and protection from the wind. The courtyard also has a stone fireplace, barbecue and areas for dining and lounging.
The west wing, accessed from the foyer, provides rooms and ensuite bathrooms for visitors. A ground-floor guest bedroom has doors leading to the pool so night owls can head out for a late-night swim without disturbing others in the house.
A potting room with a large marble sink also serves as a guest bathroom with two water closets.
In the east wing, a large kitchen, a dining room, and a theatre can accommodate guests, but there is also a private area for the owners.
Behind closed doors, they can relax in a sitting room or the upstairs bedroom with ensuite spa bath.
In the master bedroom, doors lead to three Juliette balconies overlooking Georgian Bay.
"They call it Sunset Point because we get lovely sunsets," says the homeowner.
The best feature
"We have a big family and sometimes we're all in the kitchen cooking," says the homeowner.
The centrepiece of the room is a Lacanche range, which was crafted by hand in France.
The floor of black and white marble tiles is heated.
In a room with lots of marble and granite, the owner had a large wood-topped island installed to give an appearance of warmth.
"I wanted the island to look like furniture," he says of the white-oak top and painted base.
A separate sitting area has a fireplace and offers a cozy place to watch the changing views of the bay. At times, wild storms whip up the water.
"The water changes colours all the time," says the homeowner. "We get a lot of whitecaps."

Nicaragua holds out new promise for foreign investors

Author: Johnson, Nicolas

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/nicaragua-holds-out-new-promise-foreign-investors/docview/964154757/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "There's tremendous opportunity here," said Claudio Marcel, the Nicaragua manager for Bank of Nova Scotia, which operates a leasing business in the country. But "you have to make sure you do your homework," he cautioned. "The country is in the early stages of development."

Full text: Complications remain - notably the lack of a reliable land registry - but there is tremendous opportunity. And Canada leads the way
The business world has never been so optimistic about Nicaragua. Foreign investment jumped to a record last year, and the surge over the past five years far exceeds the gains in other countries of Central America.
Such measures, along with recent studies showing Nicaragua has the region's lowest rates of robbery and assault, indicate how much the country has changed since its violent upheaval in the 1980s, and even since elections in 2006. Before then, the government and its heavy bureaucracy made business difficult, according to executives who have worked in the country.
Yet Nicaragua's six million people face challenges that weigh on daily life and investment. Poverty is widespread, and the lack of a valid system to register property has led to confusion, court battles and confiscations of land and property. While that's keeping some businesses away, others are going in and finding ways to succeed.
Canadian companies were the biggest foreign investors in Nicaragua last year, and B2Gold Corp. is their poster child. The Vancouver-based gold miner is among the biggest single overseas investors and taxpayers in the country, the largest exporter and, with more than 2,000 local workers, the third-biggest private employer.
"We've just had a very positive experience in Nicaragua," Clive Johnson, the company's president and chief executive officer, said in an interview. Mr. Johnson spoke on a panel with the Nicaraguan mining minister and ambassador to promote the country at a mining conference in Toronto last month.
It is trying to change perceptions of a nation ravaged by poverty and violence. Nicaragua last dominated headlines in the 1980s during the Iran-Contra scandal over the United States using profits from secret arms sales to Iran to fund guerrillas opposed to Nicaragua's Marxist government, the Sandinistas.
Today's Sandinista government under President Daniel Ortega took office in January, 2007, and was re-elected last November. Its efforts to improve business conditions helped foreign investment more than triple over the past five years to a record $968-million (U.S.).
"There's tremendous opportunity here," said Claudio Marcel, the Nicaragua manager for Bank of Nova Scotia, which operates a leasing business in the country. But "you have to make sure you do your homework," he cautioned. "The country is in the early stages of development."
Nicaragua's greatest business risk is the lack of a reliable land registry, leading to disputes over who owns potentially lucrative oil and mineral deposits and beachfront properties. B2Gold employs six lawyers who keep track of litigation as well as properties and registrations.
In February, the government sent in police to confiscate the $2-million Hotel Punta Teonoste resort from a Swiss man who said he bought the property 13 years ago, according to news reports.
"I've seen a lot of people in real estate get into difficulties," said Tom Ogryzlo, who was president and chief executive officer of Toronto-based Polaris Geothermal Inc. before the energy producer was acquired by a U.S. company in 2009.
The challenges aren't stopping Polaris and B2Gold from pushing ahead with investments that exceed $400-million and $200-million, respectively. Those are significant sums in a country whose economic activity totalled $6.9-billion last year, less than 1/20th that of Toronto's. Total Canadian investment in Nicaragua surged more than fivefold last year from 2010, to $255.5-million.
Mr. Ogryzlo, who began doing projects in the country 15 years ago, and B2Gold's Mr. Johnson both cite their relations with President Ortega as key to their success in business.
Mr. Ogryzlo said he used to meet with the President's close staff every two weeks or so, and Mr. Johnson fondly told of his first meeting with the politician a few years ago to discuss B2Gold's mine at La Libertad, Mr. Ortega's home town.
"Our 20-minute meeting turned into 2½ hours because he wanted to know what we were going to build and how it would be different," Mr. Johnson said.
"We've been able to sit down rationally with government officials at very many levels," he added. "We've been able to have meetings and solve problems. It's a stable democracy. They want foreign investment."
Although official numbers aren't available, estimates put the number of Canadian companies in Nicaragua at a couple of dozen. Export Development Canada says it gets more requests from companies operating in Costa Rica and Panama than Nicaragua. And while neither Canada nor Nicaragua has a full embassy in the other's country, they have been discussing a free-trade agreement for years.
Canadian exports to Nicaragua fell 7 per cent last year from 2010 to $37.3-million (Canadian), while imports surged by more than 55 per cent to $333.7-million.
"We feel that with a free-trade agreement, we could increase exports to Canada and increase exports from Canada to Nicaragua," Francisco Campbell, Nicaragua's ambassador to both the U.S. and Canada, said in an interview in Toronto last month. He was accompanying Minister of Energy and Mines Emilio Rappaccioli on meetings with investors.
"I think the government needs to show to other potential investors that people can invest down here and succeed," Dale Craig, B2Gold's Nicaragua manager, said in an interview from the capital of Managua. "And we're a good example of that."

Full text: They were a Rorschach blot that reached 110 storeys into the sky. To some, the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center were a bold statement about the free and open future of global capitalism; to others, they were a tribute to hubris, an epic failure of speculative real estate. Conceived by David Rockefeller to put Lower Manhattan back on the map, built over the angry objections of preservationists and social theorists, the project wiped out 13 ramshackle city blocks of local businesses. Seven years into construction, the buildings were still incomplete and only partly occupied, so the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey held a dedication ceremony in hopes of igniting rental interest. The towers did finally become an acknowledged icon of world trade - which, in the end, was their undoing.

Dynasty slipping away from Redford

Abstract: Ms. [Alison Redford] is playing "survival politics" and has to campaign in every riding in a race that continues to shift quickly, said David Taras, a political analyst and professor at Calgary's Mount Royal University.

Full text: Progressive Conservative Leader plays 'survival politics' with campaign stops in the heart of Wildrose country
This was always Tory country - the southeastern Alberta city of Medicine Hat and the nearby farms and ranches where Progressive Conservative campaigns have long been little more than a formality, with turnout only around 30 per cent and PC victory assured.
Those times are gone.
Former premier Ed Stelmach's government dragged its heels in responding to flooding here in 2010. Outcry over new provincial land-use laws took hold, the PC cabinet gave itself a raise during the recession, and one of the two local MLAs, Len Mitzel, was among those to collect $1,000 a month from a now-notorious committee that didn't meet for more than three years. The other, Rob Renner, lost his cabinet seat last year and won't run again.
All this helped give the right-wing Wildrose Party a foothold, from which it has grown - opening a 13-point lead on the PCs among decided voters, according to a CTV poll released Tuesday. That is comfortably in majority territory - an outcome that would end four decades of Tory rule at a time when the fast-growing, energy-rich province has emerged as a leader in Confederation. And southern Alberta, particularly rural ridings, now forms the heart of Wildrose support.
But on Tuesday, here was PC Leader Alison Redford, spending Day 9 of her campaign in Medicine Hat with Mr. Mitzel, whose riding is in the surrounding rural area, and first-time PC candidate Darren Hirsch, whose riding is in the city of about 60,000 people. Ms. Redford then went to Taber to a rally for a new candidate there - the outgoing MLA also sat on the no-work committee.
It's either stubborn or ambitious, but the PC Leader continues to chase all 87 ridings, even if it means campaigning in Wildrose's backyard.
"I don't see Medicine Hat as being any different than any other part of the province," Ms. Redford said when asked why she was there. "As leader of the PC party, as premier of the province, I'm going to make sure that I'm travelling the entire province talking about the issues that matter to Albertans."
Ms. Redford always planned to campaign on her budget, passed last month, and did so Tuesday in Medicine Hat, emphasizing: a new overpass, highway repaving, a $200-million hospital expansion, a new school and 90 new "affordable supported living spaces" in the city. In short, she was telling voters her party has already delivered.
"It is not an idea, it is not a pie-in-the-sky thought, it is not something that we stand in front of a podium and say because it's an election - we put a plan in place, we stood by that plan, we passed that budget and we're going to talk to Albertans about what that means for their future," Ms. Redford said.
Medicine Hat is a bellwether riding for many reasons - it's rural (with little Liberal or New Democrat support, the PC-Wildrose battle is most acute here) and it's home to many seniors, a demographic with high voter turnout who polls show prefer Wildrose. Ms. Redford and Wildrose Leader Danielle Smith have different visions for seniors, with the former preferring to spend on health care and the latter preferring tax-free energy rebates that will put money in seniors' pockets.
"Whether it's property taxes or power bills, the Alberta Energy Dividend will help seniors make ends meet and make life more affordable for them," Ms. Smith said in a statement Tuesday, when she was in Leduc for a campaign event.
Wildrose would slow and cap spending growth, defer infrastructure projects, save half of all surpluses and send another 20 per cent of surpluses to a fund to pay energy dividends to Albertans. The energy dividend pledge, made Tuesday, dominated the news cycle with mixed reviews from economists and columnists.
The Wildrose candidates around and within Medicine Hat are Drew Barnes, a real-estate agent, and Blake Pedersen, a small-business owner. "You know, [the support] is definitely there," Mr. Pedersen said Tuesday. "I'm certainly not going to make a prediction, but doing the door-knocking it's definitely positive."
His opponent, Mr. Hirsch, said the Wildrose plan to defer infrastructure spending will hurt Medicine Hat, sometimes called the "forgotten corner" of Alberta. "It's PC country, actually," Mr. Hirsch insisted.
Ms. Redford is playing "survival politics" and has to campaign in every riding in a race that continues to shift quickly, said David Taras, a political analyst and professor at Calgary's Mount Royal University. "I think you have to go everywhere," he said. "I think the situation is very much in flux. I think this is a moving target. I think the ballot question is about to change - just as the [Progressive] Conservatives can't take anything for granted, I think Wildrose can't take anything for granted. So, if you're Redford, you have to be everywhere."
She stopped at a Medicine Hat food court to speak to PC supporters, most of them elderly. Many wore Redford buttons, but at a nearby table sat Harley Lehr, 75, who lives in Mr. Mitzel's riding. He'll be voting Wildrose, saying it's time for a change.
"Oh, absolutely," Mr. Lehr said. "And again I don't blame Alison. From what I've seen of her, she's a nice lady - but, oh God, does she realize what she's got herself into?"

Getting the goods on Target

Author: Strauss, Marina

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/getting-goods-on-target/docview/963478426/se-2?accountid=14656

Full text: As the U.S. discount titan prepares to invade Canada, Marina Strauss finds suppliers are paying big bucks to learn about the retailer's tastes and tactics
Call it a boot camp for Canadian retail suppliers.
On a grey winter morning, dozens of vendors headed to a hotel on the outskirts of Toronto to learn the hard facts about dealing with U.S. discount titan Target Corp.
They saw charts and graphs showing how the retailer can dominate product categories, making it critical for suppliers to nab a piece of its business in time for its Canadian launch in early 2013. They received dire warnings about how tough Target can be in negotiating for the best products at the lowest cost.
"They treat everybody badly," David Marcotte, senior vice-president at consultancy Kantar Retail in Cambridge, Mass., told the group jokingly as he described the retailer's painstaking purchasing process. "They're very even about that."
But Mr. Marcotte's presentation was no joking matter. Target's arrival next year will be the biggest change to hit the Canadian retailing scene since Wal-Mart Stores Inc. set up shop in this country in 1994. Nearly everyone connected with the retailing industry is rushing to prepare. A cottage industry has sprung up in teaching Canadians about Target - and vice versa.
Consultants are charging as much as $1,000 a day to instruct retailers and their suppliers on how to brace for Target's impact. Meanwhile, the U.S. chain has Canadian advisers to brief it on matters ranging from store design to the possible impact of higher municipal taxes that could result if its stores' presence boosts property values.
The ripple effect of Target's entry will be huge. Along with its $1.8-billion initial investment to acquire most Zellers leases last year, Target expects to pour another $2-billion to $3-billion into Canada in the next three years, spokeswoman Lisa Gibson said.
The amount includes hiring consultants, marketing agencies, contractors and 25,000 employees. The retailer intends to spend $10- to $11-million remodelling each store, with plans to launch up to 135 outlets starting next year and 200 longer term.
Target's arrival spells enormous opportunity for landlords. Among other benefits, the retailer's presence is expected to boost traffic at nearby locations, just as tech giant Apple Inc. helps bolster overall business at malls that house its stores.
RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust, Target's largest Canadian landlord with 24 of its stores, is now building an outlet from scratch for the U.S. retailer in a new Toronto shopping centre at St. Clair Avenue and Weston Road. Already about 85 per cent of the site is preleased, chief executive officer Edward Sonshine said in February. "I expect by the time the building starts coming out of the ground, we'll be well into the 90 per cent preleased at pretty good rents."
Suppliers and vendors, though, are discovering that Target is a demanding customer. While the retailer says it is looking for local suppliers, those who attended the recent $300-a-person boot camp learned that it's difficult to satisfy the giant.
Benoît Monderie, national director at RDTS, a Laval, Que.-based company that develops store displays and would like to count Target as a client, said he came away in awe of Target's determination to do things its own way. "I don't think it's going to be easy for any Canadian supplier to get into that business."
For its part, Target doesn't appreciate for-profit consultants advising others on its business.
Michael McLarney, founder of Hardlines, the trade magazine publisher and consulting firm that organized the suppliers' boot camp, said he received a lawyer's letter from Target warning him to stop using its signature bull's-eye logo in its marketing and touting the session as a must-attend event. Mr. McLarney, flattered that Target paid so much attention to his material, made the fixes.
Consultant Jeff Doucette, who charges $1,000 for his day-long Winning with Target seminars, got a similar letter from Target and promptly dropped the bull's-eye logo and ran a disclaimer on his website stipulating the sessions are run by a third party.
His Calgary-based Sales Is Not Simple firm hired Skip Stoelzing, a former Target executive, to speak to suppliers. He urges them to find a way to help the retailer stand out.
He cites Procter & Gamble Inc.'s recent initiative to supply Target with Swiffer cleaners in red, which is the retailer's trademark colour. "It's a good example of how a company can come in and differentiate itself," Mr. Stoelzing said.
One way Target keeps its edge is by focusing on its private labels. Like other retailers, it often competes with its own vendors by quickly recreating a version of products for its own lines, Mr. Marcotte said.
"If you have a product that they're interested in, at least four or five weeks later there will be a private-label equivalent," he told the Hardlines boot camp. "Sorry."

Full text: Telus has sold out the first condo development it has ever built, before a planned formal launch in mid-April, making it the second large Vancouver project to sell out almost instantly in the past month.
"We were tremendously surprised by the interest. It's been really gratifying for us," said Andrea Goertz, senior vice-president for strategic initiatives at the telecommunications company. "I think it speaks to the building's technology features, sustainability features and public plaza."
But industry experts say that doesn't necessarily mean the condo or general real-estate boom is back. Instead, they say, it is projects that are close to transit that are winning out.
"Transportation is the new green," said Tracie McTavish, president of Rennie Marketing, which sold the PCI Marine Gateway project's 415 units in a public launch in mid-March.
That's why projects like Marine Gateway, a tower that will be part of an office and entertainment complex at the foot of Cambie next to a Canada Line station, and Telus Garden, with 428 units in a 53-storey tower a block from Vancouver's key downtown intersection, are being gobbled up at a rate not matched elsewhere.
"Some of the more outlying developments aren't seeing that kind of interest," said Don Forsgren, president of the Urban Development Institute, which represents large builders in the region.
"The single-family suburban house market is pretty flat."
Also flat are sales in Surrey and the northeast Tri-Cities area and lower-rise wood-frame buildings, said development consultant Bob Ransford.
"It's all geographic who's doing well."
Recent figures from the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver compiled by various real-estate analysts indicate higher numbers for unsold inventory than past years at the same time.
Local sellers all say that it's not foreign investors driving the market for the successful projects, but local investors and people planning to live in the condos themselves.
Ms. Goertz said Telus offered its employees priority in sales at Telus Gardens and 150 of them bought, even though the price discount was a modest one per cent.
The project's developers, Telus and Westbank Projects, also didn't allow anyone to buy more than two units.
Mr. Forsgren, whose company Intracorp sold out a tower instantly at Metrotown in May of last year, said the company has to track buyers closely because of requirements from FINTRAC, the agency that monitors money laundering and criminal organizations.
The personal information that had to be submitted for those units showed there were only four offshore buyers.
He said he expects Intracorp's newest tower, Silver, to get about 50 to 60 per cent investors among the 3,000 buyers lined up for it. That's similar to what Mr. McTavish said was the ratio for Marine Gateway.
But those investors tend to be local investors, people who are buying something for their children to move into some day and renting it in the meantime, or people who are looking for an investment that's more stable than the stock market appears to be right now.
Affordability doesn't seem to be necessarily at the top of the list for buyers, either. Mr. McTavish said that half of the 40 high-end units in Canada House West, at the former Olympic village in Vancouver, have already sold in the first two and a half weeks at "very attractive rates" of more than $1,000 a square foot.
That may push the city of Vancouver, which took over the project from the private developer in late 2010, into putting the other 20 units in Canada House East onto the market.

Abstract: Starting in 2006, the CBC began to re-invent itself and re-connect with Canadians. It overhauled all its shows. The results were startling. By 2010, it was clear that the CBC had been re-born. This year it is possible to say the CBC has never been stronger.

Full text: Former honcho Richard Stursberg on what the corporation did right - and what it needs to survive a $115-million budget cut
Last Thursday's federal budget cut the CBC by $115-million. To put this in context, here are three things about the corporation most people do not know. First, it is more successful now than it has ever been. Second, the federal budget cut is only the beginning of its woes. Third, there is a way forward, but nobody is talking about it. The CBC is at the most challenging point in its history.
The CBC's Golden Age
Nearly every year since the 1970s, CBC's TV audiences declined. By 2004, its ratings were the lowest in its history. Almost nobody was watching. The mighty news department commanded only 12 per cent of the audience for Canadian news. The entertainment department took only 30 per cent of the audience for Canadian comedy and drama. Polls showed that Canadians found CBC television essentially irrelevant to their lives.
Starting in 2006, the CBC began to re-invent itself and re-connect with Canadians. It overhauled all its shows. The results were startling. By 2010, it was clear that the CBC had been re-born. This year it is possible to say the CBC has never been stronger.
Radio is enjoying the highest ratings in its 75-year history. The great shows - Quirks and Quarks , The Sunday Edition , As It Happens , The Current and the local shows - have never been more popular. The 10 a.m. national morning slot, once hosted by Peter Gzowski, is now home to Gian Gomeshi and Q, with even bigger audiences than Gzowski. Television is in some ways doing even better. For the first time in history, the CBC has proven that Canadians can make entertainment shows that can compete with the programs made in the United States. For the last four years, CBC's overwhelmingly Canadian prime-time schedule has beaten Global's overwhelmingly American one.
And the shows are not pale copies of U.S. fare. They are completely and unapologetically Canadian in their stories, style and sensibility. The Rick Mercer Report , Heartland , Dragon's Den , Arctic Air , Republic of Doyle , The Border , Little Mosque on the Prairie and Battle of the Blades were watched by millions.
News and Current Affairs are also stronger. Marketplace often reaches a million viewers, as does The Fifth Estate . The News Network clobbers CNN and every other all-day news channel in Canada.
As the ratings have risen, Canadians attitudes toward the corporation have improved markedly. They see it now as higher quality and more distinctively Canadian.
The budget cuts are only the beginning
And yet, in the full sunshine of its success, shadows are appearing everywhere.
The federal budget cut the CBC by $115-million. This is roughly 12 per cent of the approximately $1-billion that it receives annually from the federal government. It is a very significant reduction to a public broadcaster that was already the one of the worst financed in the industrialized world. This could be made even more painful if the government decides to reduce its commitment to the Canadian Media Fund or the television production tax credits, both of which are essential to the financing of CBC docs, dramas and comedies.
Other possible horrors wait in the wings. It may lose another $40-million if the Local Program Improvement Fund is cancelled by the CRTC. The conventional advertising markets have been weak for years. If, as seems likely, the CBC loses Hockey Night in Canada , half of its advertising revenues will vanish and it will have to figure out how to replace more than 400 hours of prime-time Canadian programming.
If this were not enough, its great rivals at Global and CTV now have rich new parents as a result of their recent acquisitions by Shaw and Bell, respectively. They are flush with cash, and as a result of various CRTC decisions are obligated to spend a great deal more than they did in the past in the program areas that are CBC's priorities: Canadian entertainment and news. They were formidable competitors in the past and will be even more formidable now.
The forces arrayed against the CBC profoundly threaten the gains that have been made. There is a real danger that the corporation may be forced backward into the irrelevance that characterized it a decade ago. Unless care is taken, CBC may be so badly damaged that it will be unrecognizable in the future.
The way forward
And yet, there is no discussion, no serious debate about the future of Canada's largest and most important cultural institution. There seems to be no real understanding of the problems that lie ahead. There is no public debate on what to do about the future of the corporation. Certainly there is no plan that lays out the challenges that must be faced, let alone one that proposes how to navigate them.
The way forward will be difficult. The CBC needs to transform itself from being a public broadcaster to being a public content company. It needs to abandon the notion that it is a TV or radio company and understand that in the new world of social media and on-demand programming, its focus must be exclusively on content. It needs to radically modernize its governance and financing arrangements to accomplish this. This requires a new relationship with the federal government, the capital markets and the rest of the Canadian media world.
At the end of the first chapter of Lament for a Nation , Canadian philosopher George Grant cautioned against losing those things we value and love through inadvertence or inattention. It is important that we talk about what we need and want from the CBC, so that at the very least, "Posterity may know that we have not loosely through silence permitted things to pass away as in a dream."
Not to pass away as in a dream... It is time to talk now about the future of the CBC, before it is too late.
Richard Stursberg was executive vice-president of CBC English Services from 2004 to 2010. His book, The Tower of Babble: Sins, Secrets and Successes Inside the CBC, will be in stores in early April.

Killing echoes an uglier time in America

Author: Yakabuski, Konrad

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/killing-echoes-uglier-time-america/docview/962494696/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: For President Barack Obama, the incident is an uncomfortable reminder of his unfulfilled promise to address "the racial stalemate" that has long plagued the nation. He made the pledge as a candidate in 2008 in a passionate rejoinder to his black pastor's dystopian diatribe on race-based America. Jeremiah Wright's early 2008 complaint that "we lift up the Liberty Bell, but we're defined by the hangman's noose" threatened to derail Mr. Obama's presidential bid.

Full text: Shooting of innocent black teen Trayvon Martin has turned a Florida town into a crucible of racial anger
kyakabuski@globeandmail.com
With its quaint cobblestone streets and painstaking efforts to preserve the remnants of its 19th-century start, this central Florida city offers a sharp contrast to the endless freeways and big-box stores that have paved over "history" in most of Orlando's rambling suburbs.
That past has not always been glorious. Whites in Sanford once ran Jackie Robinson out of town rather than watch him train here with the Brooklyn Dodgers.
Now, the killing of Trayvon Martin has turned Sanford into a crucible of racial anger, rippling across the United States and defying the nation's first black President to make good on his almost forgotten promise of post-racial reconciliation.
The volatile alchemy that provoked such national outrage over the death of an innocent black teen in a hoodie has many elements. They include Sanford's seemingly Keystone cops, Florida's permissive guns laws and the state's controversial "Stand Your Ground" legislation that its critics call a licence to kill.
Yet, none of those ingredients alone might have produced the distemper that has gripped black America had Trayvon's shooting not occurred amid pent up racial tension worsened by a recession that inflicted its pain unequally according to colour.
The specific event that has drawn thousands of black protesters to Sanford, and hundreds of thousands more to marches across the country, was the decision by local police to let Trayvon's shooter go free after he claimed to have been acting in self-defence. A 2005 law that allows people to use deadly force if they feel threatened underpinned that move.
The symbolic freight of that decision galvanized the black community nationwide even as it seems to take everyday racism in the criminal-justice system or job market for granted.
"For African-Americans, this incident seemed to fit a pattern that was disturbingly similar to an earlier time when, in the South in particular, white men were largely exempt from prosecution for crimes against black men," explains Scot French, a professor of public history at the University of Central Florida.
For President Barack Obama, the incident is an uncomfortable reminder of his unfulfilled promise to address "the racial stalemate" that has long plagued the nation. He made the pledge as a candidate in 2008 in a passionate rejoinder to his black pastor's dystopian diatribe on race-based America. Jeremiah Wright's early 2008 complaint that "we lift up the Liberty Bell, but we're defined by the hangman's noose" threatened to derail Mr. Obama's presidential bid. Four years and a recession later, the stalemate has thickened.
No one expected, as Mr. Obama put it, that the country "could get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle." But the wound, ripped open by Trayvon's Feb. 26 death at the hands a neighbourhood-watch volunteer, shows how little it has even tried.
In that respect, Sanford (pop. 53,500) is no worse than the rest of the country.
Whites here express mostly disbelief at the sudden portrayal of their town as a redoubt of racial discord, while blacks speak of enduring grievances and systemic discrimination.
"Until this latest incident, race didn't seem to be a huge issue in Sanford," insists Rachel Delinski, the 26-year-old editor of The Sanford Herald, who is white. "Even now, after it's happened, I still think Sanford is a non-racist town."
"I understand white folks saying that," counters Turner Clayton, 59, head of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. "But there are blacks in this community who have lived through [racism] a long time."
Mr. Clayton points to blacks' distrust of the Sanford Police Department, which predates by far last month's tragedy. Indeed, the last police chief left after an officer at first failed to prosecute the white attacker of a black homeless man.
The racial division extends, literally, to Sanford's neighbourhoods.
"Wherever there is an ungated white community and blacks move in, the whites move out," Mr. Clayton says. "They actually build these gated communities and price them so that blacks cannot live there."
The Retreat at Twin Lakes, the gated community where Trayvon was gunned down, is home to a few black families and peace mostly reigned over the collection of modest town homes that, since the real-estate crash of 2008, go for about $100,000 each.
"It was a really good little neighbourhood before this," insists resident Gina Kroger, 32. "I do think [the shooting] was an isolated incident."
Trayvon was staying at the home of his father's fiancee. He was on a 10-day suspension from his Miami high school, the result of traces of marijuana being found in his book bag. On Feb. 26, he had just returned to Twin Lakes with Skittles he bought at a 7-Eleven.
It is now up to a special prosecutor appointed by Florida Governor Rick Scott to sort through the evidence and conflicting narratives of the clash that occurred that night between Trayvon and George Zimmerman, 28, the neighbourhood-watch volunteer.
A grand jury has been scheduled for April 10 to determine whether to charge Mr. Zimmerman, the son of a white father and a mother of Peruvian descent, although state attorney Angela Corey said this week she could proceed on her own in the case.
The federal Department of Justice has also opened an investigation to determine whether Trayvon's civil rights were violated.
All this is not good or fast enough for black leaders such as Rev. Al Sharpton, who was in Sanford last week to demand seeing Mr. Zimmerman "in court with handcuffs behind his back."
Black members in Congress have been just as trenchant. Florida congresswoman Frederica Wilson said Trayvon was "hunted down like a rabid dog." Georgia's Hank Johnson said he was "executed for walking while black in a gated community."
They are denounced by right-wing bloggers as "race baiters" seeking to exploit Trayvon's death for political gain.
Mr. Obama dipped his toe in this cauldron of recrimination with his brief, but powerful, Mar. 23 assertion that if he had a son, "he'd look like Trayvon." It marked a rare occasion when the President sought to make a point of his race before a national audience.
Since taking the Oval Office, Mr. Obama has pointedly avoided drawing attention to his race and repeatedly spurned calls from black leaders for policies directed specifically at blacks, who have experienced unemployment at twice the rate of whites since 2008.
But as the "I am Trayvon" movement mobilizes blacks nationally, Mr. Obama must decide whether his call for "some soul searching to figure out how something like this happens" is enough or whether he must lead a national conversation on race.
Chris Raines thinks Mr. Obama has done enough - for now. The 40-year-old railroad conductor from Ohio stopped by a memorial for Trayvon outside the gates of Twin Lakes, where empty Skittles packages poignantly underscore the senselessness of this tragedy.
"I actually think he got the ball rolling by addressing it," Mr. Raines, who is black, says of Mr. Obama. "He's letting the world know: 'Hey, I've got my eye on this.' "
Indeed, Sanford feels his gaze - and much of the world's - seemingly resigned to its name being henceforth consigned to the company of Selma and Birmingham in the annals of racial disharmony.
"This has changed the town for a long time," laments Kathryn Cabral, 61, a white paralegal. "People everywhere are going to have a bad taste in their mouth just at the mention of Sanford."

Burnac Holdings Inc.'s bold move to convert and expand a former Toronto Hydro building into raw lofts with 10- to 14-foot ceilings, exposed duct work and pillars found ready buyers. With that project sold out, the developer has unveiled plans for a seven-storey sister structure composed of smaller, refined suites with nine-foot ceilings, high-end appointments and a secluded setting further north of the nearby railway tracks.
"It's important to note it's not a high-rise, glass enclosure with every unit being the same," says president Ted Burnett. "There are 159 units here, so people will be able to know their neighbours.
"So it's more of a nice neighbourhood building that's got a bit of intimacy to it and a lovely area with tree-lined streets throughout. A lot of buildings we have built are like that."
Previews are under way for this mid-rise project, which was named South Hill on Madison to highlight its locale at 377 Madison Ave., just east of Spadina Road between Davenport Road and Dupont Street.
"It's at the foot of Casa Loma in a wonderful location," Mr. Burnett says. "It was an area that was underdeveloped for many years. It was a little diamond in the rough, which we've hopefully made into a diamond."
The infill site is close to many urban attractions, from upscale restaurants, such as Mistura and Sotto Sotto, to essential amenities, such as Dupont and Spadina subway stations.
"You get a lot of bang for your buck because you're in a nice, edgy area of Dupont," Mr. Burnett says.
"If you head west of Dupont, there are a lot of funky shops along there and along Davenport, and Bloor [Street West] is another 10 minutes away, so you're really centrally located."
Similar to the first building, Northgrave Architects designed this Art Deco-inspired residence to complement local landmarks in the low-rise community, such as the historic castle and high-end homes on Austin Terrace and the distinguished Castle Hill townhouse development.
Inside, there will be several one- to two-bedroom-plus-den models between 440 and 1,300 square feet, plus 10 two-storey townhouses on a private road at the north end of the site with up to three bedrooms, separate entrances and garages.
Prices will average $600 per square feet.
"What's happened over the years is that people want to move south into the core of the city or to the south part of midtown," Mr. Burnett says.
"The size of the place used to be very important, but now people just want to fit within their price range, so units have gotten smaller over the years."
However, many units will have French balconies, patios or rooftop terraces.
"As units got smaller - we're down to 800 square feet on average - people want a little more space to spread out to," Mr. Burnett says.
When residents need more space, there will be a lobby with 24-hour concierge and a party room with a kitchen, seating and outdoor amenity space with Wi-Fi access, plus a screening room, gym, yoga studio, pet spa and courtyard.
In consultation with Boychuk + Fuller, suite interiors will be contemporary with engineered wood laminate, quartz, porcelain and ceramic tile finishes, as well as master suites with private bathrooms and walk-in closets with built-in organizers, and kitchens with European-style cabinetry and optional islands with open shelving, storage and seating.
Monthly fees will be in the range of 50 to 60 cents a square foot.
A parking spot can be had for $30,000, while a locker will go for $5,000.
Occupancy will be ready in spring 2015.

Full text: A gabled roof was non-negotiable in this barn-channeling weekend home, but in the end, its inclusion was a triumph
Rob Kastelic and Kelly Buffey built a barn. Generally this wouldn't be very exciting news, but for architects attuned to the latest thinking in contemporary design, as the two partners of Atelier Kastelic Buffey are, it's a different question. Borrow a shape from traditional buildings, and they run the risk of being called retrograde. Gabled roofs, especially, have been "the pariah of modern architecture," as Mr. Kastelic says, for almost a century.
But Mr. Kastelic and Ms. Buffey want to ask: Why is that? An exquisite house they've designed in Ontario ski country takes the argument further, with a design that is pure and simple in form and yet country-comfortable. And it doesn't have a flat roof in sight.
The owners, a Toronto family of six, wanted a weekend getaway and a gathering point for their ski-club neighbours. Their site is located right at the base of a slope at Alpine Ski Club - so they'd be able literally to ski back to the house. The clients "wanted to make it a place for play," says Ms. Buffey. And among their other requests was a barn door.
The finished house does have a barn door, and the house is barn-like in form, with 4,650 square feet of floor space and an expansive two-storey living room that stretches all the way up to the roof. But by hiring Ms. Buffey and Mr. Kastelic, the clients knew they would get a very sophisticated elaboration of those ideas. They did. This barn has windows with crisp steel frames, and a roof made of copper that shimmers in the sunlight. The house's exterior is absolutely free of unnecessary detail and ornament. "Our buildings bare all," Ms. Buffey says. "Being candid presents more challenges and it also happens to be more contemporary."
As you approach the house, you encounter walls covered in siding of raw cedar, free of knots and arranged horizontally into a tight, clear skin. At the ground, the foundation is wrapped with a layer of limestone. To one side, the cedar boards stand on end to define a garage wall; to the other side, they cascade down to define a deck and a privacy screen of knot-free boards and precisely poured concrete.
Striding into the house, Ms. Buffey explains a principle of their design approach, developed since the couple set out from their previous jobs at KPMB Architects a decade ago: "We have one big move per building" - that is, one major design decision - "and then we detail it very carefully."
That is an understatement. Take the living-dining area. At the centre is a tall feature fireplace, its hearth and its chute made of Indiana limestone. This element is perfect at a small scale: the stone is mitered - cut on a 45-degree angle - for seamless joints. And it is also remarkable on a grand scale, when you try and figure out what's holding it up. The massive column of stone comes from the ceiling right to the fire itself, and then veers to one side before it reaches the floor. Thanks to some complex engineering, the fire burns freely with nothing to contain it on three sides.
Such precision finds a counterpoint in rustic textures, like the barn door (on one side of the living room) and the kitchen table, both made of reclaimed hemlock from a Collingwood warehouse. Above the table, Ms. Buffey designed custom light fixtures that employ steel beams for an industrial flavour. And the massive kitchen, where the house's hostess likes to cook for 20, has both the scale and the no-nonsense steel backsplash of a restaurant kitchen. "Because it's a casual house," Ms. Buffey says, "everything is exposed, everything is easy to access."
Upstairs, the family's two girls and two boys each have their own room. Each pair shares a bathroom with colourful patterned tiles; stripes for the boys, dots for the girls. And in the basement is a rec room of any tween's dreams, with table tennis table, a big TV for gaming, and a Ligne Roset sofa. Everything here is well-designed, but also comfortable.
That includes the house's most elaborate architectural showpiece, the basement spa. Sitting down in the sauna, Ms. Buffey points out the careful geometry of the cedar benches, their linear patterns arranged to intersect and flip from floor to wall to ceiling without a jagged edge.
Back outside, where that cedar finds its echo on the house's decking and siding, it's interesting to note how much more sober and contemporary in appearance the house is than the others on the street, which are a mishmash of middlebrow design ideas. That's in spite of the fact that they all have gabled roofs. Yes, the one thing that most defines the house's concept and appearance, its barnlike form, is the greatest thing it has in common with its less pedigreed neighbours.
"The gabled roof was not a stylistic choice on our part," Mr. Kastelic explains. In fact it was required by restrictions that the developer placed on the land. And yet, Mr. Kastelic adds, "We came to appreciate that it is a responsible roof form given the site and climate conditions we are confronted with in northern Ontario." On a practical level, it makes sense; a flat roof is possible here, but it needs to be strong enough to hold a lot of snow. And on an aesthetic level, "we felt it was more honest to reference the local barn buildings than to reference the pseudo-suburban developments that have sprung up around the ski hills in more recent years," he says.
There are some examples, in the past few years, of neo-modernist architects turning back to the gabled roof. Toronto's award-winning Superkül Architects are doing so in their current work. The Swiss architects Herzog and de Meuron, most famous for the Tate Modern, recently designed a tower that resembles a stack of Monopoly houses. And their compatriot Peter Zumthor, who usually works close to his home in the Swiss Alps, has embraced traditional local house forms in his work. Mr. Kastelic is a fan of Mr. Zumthor, and the Alpine house owes him a conceptual debt - its mix of pure form and relatively humble materials; the proudly ordinary and the transcendent.
In an architectural culture like ours, which is struggling to find a language that suits 21st-century life, this is an important question. And Mr. Kastelic and Ms. Buffey are eager to expand the bounds of approved good taste. "We believe that architecture has a deep and evolving vocabulary," Mr. Kastelic says. "And ultimately, we wanted to create a contemporary home with the characteristic of timelessness rather than timeliness."

A condo takes a cue from its neighbours

Full text: Sixty Colborne's grids of glass strips tinted rusty orange are meant to 'reinterpret' the ruddy colour of a nearby E.J. Lennox original
jmays@globeandmail.com
Four years ago, I had a conversation about contextualism with Peter Clewes, the Toronto tall-building designer. (He was doing a sleek residential high-rise in the Distillery District that strongly differed, in style and materials, from the rusty Victorian industrial fabric round about.)
Why shouldn't contemporary architects play the contextualist game, I wondered aloud, and make new structures that bow politely to their elderly neighbours?
"Because they're wrong," Mr. Clewes replied. "We need to create buildings of our time. Architecture is a record of where a city and a culture was at a particular time. ... The exceptions in the urban framework articulate the city." Referring to some recent Distillery District towers that had tried hard to fit in, he remarked: "They speak of a time in Toronto when people said, 'Let's be apologetic, let's say we're not inserting additional density in this precinct.' This isn't what we should do now."
I don't want to suggest that architects should never vary their approaches to creative problems as they go along. Sometimes they have to change up, simply because the residential developers who employ them bend to the pro-contextualist breezes that occasionally blow in from the market, neighbourhood groups, or the planners and urban designers at city hall.
Still, I was a little surprised recently to find just how context-conscious the formerly militant Mr. Clewes has become - at least when drawing off plans for the new downtown Toronto condominium proposal that he and developer Peter Freed will soon bring before the local community and the city.
Called Sixty Colborne, and slated to fill up a parking lot at that address near the intersection of Church Street and King Street East, the 25-storey, 281-unit complex will rise (if approved) alongside two warehouse and commercial blocks, both finished in 1889. One of them was designed by E. J. Lennox, the eclectic architect of Old City Hall, Casa Loma and other Toronto landmarks.
These buildings should surely be cherished as what they are - attractive traces of the short-lived Victorian vogue for Romanesque styling - but not as anything more important than that. Ponderous, expensive and super-serious, the Romanesque manner would seem to be an unlikely basis for architectural thinking in the 21st century. For Mr. Clewes, however, the fusty old façades next door to his site have become sources of inspiration for a new structure that will occupy a conspicuous spot in Toronto's downtown landscape.
The buxom, boxy podium of Sixty Colborne, Mr. Clewes told me, will "reinterpret" its neighbours' ruddy colour and deep openings. The faces it shows the city will be grids of glass strips tinted rusty orange. Like the glazing in the antique structures, the windows of Sixty Colborne's base will be set sharply back from the outer edge of their frames.
In yet another studious reference to the Romanesque, the architect will have cars enter the project through a broad, ceremonious rainbow arch. The result of these design moves, if renderings are to be believed, will be something that's formally prim and dull, decked out in a strange and glittering skin - like a post-modern Christmas tree ornament, though not a really delightful one.
So much for the orange podium. Above it sits a flat, oblong, multi-storey glass attic. Then, suddenly, improbably, from one end of this shiny composition sprouts a tower that is as avant-garde as anything Mr. Clewes has ever done. Neat, compact, completely free of allusions to any defunct architectural style, it's a loose stack of light and dark slabs, some pulled back, some thrusting outward - a well-proportioned tall building (or at least the upper body of one) with distinctive rhythm, flair and swing.
But what's an interesting modern tower like this doing on top of a Christmas tree ornament?
"It's a matter of reinventing yourself," Mr. Clewes said of Sixty Colborne. "I could have done a 40-storey green glass building, something generic. But I am not trying just to be different. I'm trying to make a contextual response." When I asked Peter Freed to describe his most recent assignment to Mr. Clewes, he said, citing two widely admired modernist high-rises by the architect: Not another 18 Yorkville, not another Spire.
Mr. Freed is one of Toronto's most active young developers and, we know from his extensive residential revitalization of the old blue-collar district around Victoria Memorial Square, a thoroughgoing modernist at heart. Mr. Clewes is a prolific, talented modernist architect who has fashioned several of the most handsome condo towers to go up in Toronto since the start of the current real-estate boom. For the sake of the city, I hope that both men quickly get over their stylish romance with "context" and get back to doing what they have shown they do best: brightening the city with modern buildings.

Full text:   Group pages for Toronto addresses let former and present residents share memories and photos of their old and favourite haunts
A red carpet had been rolled out the night Bridget MacIntosh drove past her childhood home on Dupont Street a few years back.
It was a drag queen pageant, with residents and friends competing for the title, right there in the home Ms. MacIntosh's Irish Catholic great-great-grandfather had bought after touching down in Toronto in the early 1900s.
"Oh my god, how fitting," said Ms. MacIntosh, 33, noting that the house had always served as a meeting place for the family, until they sold in 1996. "Countless nights were spent cramming as many people into the kitchen as it would hold. A few traditional Irish wakes even took place in the living room for family members that had departed."
Several months later, she and her sister would get a detailed tour of their first house, thanks to a Facebook group page devoted to the address. Past and current residents flocked here, posting stories and images - a digital scrapbook of their home's life through the decades.
The page now boasts 82 members and 131 photographs, including black-and-whites of Ms. MacIntosh's ancestors posing on the front lawn dressed in their Sunday best and sepia-toned shots loaded with bellbottoms and gnarly wallpaper from the seventies and eighties.
Odes to family homes and other local relics are multiplying on Facebook, where Torontonians are congregating to archive their city and connect with others who share their memories.
On Vintage Toronto, a Facebook group that's garnered nearly 10,000 "likes" after launching in January, droves of locals have posted their recollections, photos, advertisements and old postcards purchased off eBay. Kingston resident Bill Stevenson runs the page; he got the idea after seeing a similar one for Los Angeles.
"I have a lot of photographs in my mind. Unfortunately they can't be transferred to the computer," said Mr. Stevenson, who used to take long walks down Yonge Street to Sam the Record Man from his house in Bedford Park in the 1970s.
Members of the group, which began in January, ask others for archival information and wax nostalgic about long-gone places: "One of the cashiers had a huge mole with a hair growing out of it. Saw The Appaloosa with Marlon Brando here," one writes about the demolished Willow Theatre near Yonge and Sheppard.
More recently, the Four Seasons Hotel Toronto launched a "memory book" on Facebook. The chain's 35-year-old location at 21 Avenue Rd. is set to close this week to make way for the new hotel on Yorkville Avenue.
"Everyone's gotten into it," said Halla Rafati, director of public relations at the hotel.
Guests, regulars, employees, brides, grooms, wedding planners and charity-ball organizers are posting their recollections in the online memory book, from gate crashers hoping to catch a glimpse of the Biebs to Terry Fox stopping in during his Marathon of Hope in 1980.
Ms. Rafati said the goal was to "harness all those memories into one controllable area and immortalize them."
"We were thinking scrapbook, sign wall," she said. "We decided to marry all of the aspects together on our fan page."
Smaller in scale, Facebook fan pages also have gone up for decommissioned schools ("So Long to Silverthorn School" in the Eglinton West neighbourhood of Keelesdale) and demolished local projects, such as Don Mount Court. The east-end public housing development went up in 1968, and was the first in Canada to be rebuilt as a mixed-income community, Rivertowne.
Past tenants mostly look for neighbours, but also memorialize dead ones. The wall reflects a portrait of community: Members reminisce about street dances, a local arcade outfitted with a checkerboard floor, summer jams on the basketball court, shenanigans at the local corner store and "drunk Harry - there's something about a man that drinks Aqua Velva!"
Online groups are also cropping up for condo developments. "Normally it's the owners using it as their forum to discuss issues with the building and connect with the board of directors," said Brad Sage, vice president of operations at Sage Real Estate. He said realtors are increasingly turning to social media, including Twitter and YouTube, to sell their properties.
As for older homes in Toronto's urban heritage districts, "People are so voracious. They want information," said Phyllis Keller, a realtor with Sage who is now offering her clients historical newsletters called "My House Remembers."
Sourced from information she's collected from neighbours, the Toronto Archives and her own memory (Ms. Keller has sold properties in the Annex for four decades - "I know these houses, I've seen the furniture, I've met the gardener"), the online newsletters trace the homes' pasts, from a lineage of owners to renovations to periods of temporary abandonment.
Ms. Keller, a former librarian, has done extensive research into about 10 properties; clients also send her photographs and reference materials. She'll soon be posting her newsletters to Facebook.
"It's mainly the sellers, who, once they're in the property, really, really want to know," Ms. Keller said. "They're not presenting it to prospective buyers at all. It's generally for themselves."
Back on Dupont, where Ms. MacIntosh's family held court for decades, Joël Robichaud wishes "the current tenants would post more" content. It was Mr. Robichaud, a 33-year-old filmmaker, who started the Facebook group page for the home in 2007, as one of "three French guys from New Brunswick" occupying the house for six years.
Ailish Steele, another tenant who moved out last month after four years said, "Our landlord told us about the group on Day 1. By Day 2 we were a part of it."
"It's interesting to see how the house used to be laid out," said Ms. Steele, a 27-year-old communications manager. "It's a reminder that it was a family home, one that's carried so much love for years."

Pianosi Development Corp. has designed an Etobicoke high rise residence that seeks to combine the luxuries of a maintenance-free condominium with the space of a single-family home.
The two-tower community will be composed of one- and two-bedroom units of between 606 and 1,200 square feet.
The project is aimed at empty-nesters who are still looking for a "good, practical layout," says developer Ian Pianosi. "We've had a very strong response from ... people that are going to be owner/occupiers from the neighbourhood that are in homes but are looking to downsize."
These suites will not only offer spacious entertaining areas, private balconies and terraces, but also rare creature comforts, such as laundry rooms with full-sized washers, dryers and sinks, and dens placed by the entry foyer or along the windows.
"If they're enclosed dens, we've done them with glass sliding doors, so you can see through to the natural light and you can convert it to a bedroom," says Mr. Pianosi. "That was another popular feature because some people like second bedrooms, but want they want the second bedroom to be more than just a bedroom."
The varied size and scope of the suites have helped sell half of the 200 units in the first phase of the project, called Perspective, which will house 297 suites between 19 and 12-storey glass towers linked by a five-storey podium at Scarlett Road and Eglinton Avenue, across from Scarlett Mills Park, Scarlett Woods Golf Course and the Humber River.
"What has sold mostly are our bigger floor plans, which we do have an abundance of - like 900 to 1,000 square feet - that's attracted local buyers and move-down empty-nesters," says Mr. Pianosi.
"But another phenomenon that existed is that those people have kids who have moved out, but want to move back into the area, and they're buying our smaller 600 to 700 square foot units."
Some major local attractions include James Gardens, Lambton golf club and popular shops in Bloor West Village, Humbertown Plaza and Sherway Gardens.
The site is also close to Pearson airport, highways 401 and 427 and public transit routes, which will improve with the completion of the Eglinton Crosstown Light Rail Transit system on Eglinton Avenue.
"We have very easy access to the city if you want to go downtown, and you're within a large green space area," says Mr. Pianosi. "We have an extensive park system around us, which is very nice with bike trails and pedestrian trails that connect down to the waterfront and west towards the Niagara region and east into downtown Toronto."
An old plaza on site will be replaced with a new pharmacy, bank and upscale grocer at the building's base, along with a private pool, gym, golf simulator and theatre, and a party room with a bar and billiards table for residents.
On the 6th floor, a rooftop terrace will feature cabanas, dining areas, barbecues and a fireside lounge.
Standard suite finishes will include nine and ten foot ceilings, laminate floors and European kitchen with stainless steel appliances, ceramic tile backsplashes, traditional or contemporary cabinetry and granite or quartz counters.
Units will come with parking and locker, plus monthly fees of about 50 cents per square feet.
Occupancy will be in summer 2014.

Abstract: Even so, policy makers have been taking action to boost the country's slowing economy. They reduced reserve ratio requirements for China's big banks twice since November, reversing a tightening policy that pervaded through 2010 and much of 2011 because of persistent inflation. Mr. [Liu] is expecting another cut in April to reserve requirements, which currently stand at 20.5 per cent of deposits for the country's largest banks.

Full text:   Government expected to loosen policy reins as industrial activity falls for five consecutive months
ASIA-PACIFIC REPORTER
China is poised to loosen lending requirements further in hopes of stimulating its slowing economy after industrial activity declined for the fifth month in a row.
The HSBC Flash China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, which measures industrial sector conditions, fell again in March, hitting 48.1, its lowest level since November.
The reading, which compares with 49.6 in February, is stoking fears of a sharper-than-expected slowdown for the world's second-largest economy and top exporter. China's strong economic growth drove the recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis, but its ability to pace an international economic rise during the present cycle is in doubt.
A so-called hard landing, however, remains unlikely according to experts and economists who said that policy makers still have plenty of options to boost China's economy.
Housing sales in China's once-overheated real estate market have slowed significantly in response to government tightening measures. Sales fell 14 per cent year-over-year in January and February. Car sales in the world's largest auto market have also slowed and new loans and retail sales data have come in weaker than expected.
"If you put all the signals together you begin to feel that the Chinese government is concerned about the economy," Na Liu, the founder and head of CNC Asset Management Ltd., and China adviser to Scotia Capital, said in an interview.
The Chinese government is targeting economic growth of 7.5 per cent in 2012, the first time it has aimed at less than 8-per-cent growth since 2005.
Even so, policy makers have been taking action to boost the country's slowing economy. They reduced reserve ratio requirements for China's big banks twice since November, reversing a tightening policy that pervaded through 2010 and much of 2011 because of persistent inflation. Mr. Liu is expecting another cut in April to reserve requirements, which currently stand at 20.5 per cent of deposits for the country's largest banks.
In recent weeks, China has quietly relaxed mortgage requirements for first-time home buyers and has also reduced some capital controls on foreign money flowing into local equity markets. The Chinese yuan has been flat against the U.S. dollar so far this year after appreciating almost 5 per cent last year.
If China's official purchasing managers' index, which is based on data compiled by the government, also disappoints, Mr. Liu expects more easing measures from the government and a possible correction in commodity prices.
Even so, he doesn't expect China's central bank to cut interest rates any time soon because bank deposits have been weak and so-called real interest rates, which factor in inflation, have only recently turned positive.
Cutting the benchmark lending rate would "send a bad message" to Chinese consumers who are already cautious about the economy, Mr. Liu said.
Qinwei Wang, China economist at Capital Economics in London, said the flash PMI results show China's manufacturing conditions remain soft but aren't cause for panic yet.
"Fears about a hard landing also seem overdone, given monetary conditions have only started easing significantly in the last few weeks," Mr. Wang said in a note to clients that predicted bank reserve ratio requirements will be cut again in coming weeks.
Commenting on the PMI survey, HSBC's chief China economist, Qu Hongbin, said weak domestic and external demand were responsible for a slowdown in factory orders. "Growth momentum could slow down further amid a combination of sluggish export new orders and softening domestic demand. This calls for further easing steps from the Beijing authority," Mr. Qu said in a statement.

Our decision to ditch the Drake

Author: Ireland, Carolyn

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/our-decision-ditch-drake/docview/934107446/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "We're banking on it," says Mr. [Carl Swanston]. "We're banking that this formula of ours will become more popular."

Full text:   They owned what many consider the pinnacle of Toronto real estate - a large home a block from trendy Queen Street. So why are they moving to Port Hope?
It didn't take long for Carl Swanston and Sarah Cashman to realize what they were getting themselves into in Port Hope, Ont.
The Toronto-based couple had just struck a deal to buy a handsome red brick house perched high on a hill overlooking the town centre when Mr. Swanston paid his first visit to Heritage Port Hope.
That's when he found out that only two houses in the historic town have been designated as worthy of heritage protection on the interior as well as exterior. The mansion at the corner of King and Dorset streets - circa 1858 in Regency Villa style - is one of them.
"We thought, let's just forfeit our deposit and walk away," said Mr. Swanston of the couple's initial panicked reaction.
But their trepidation quickly dissipated.
The couple learned that the elements worthy of conservation - the graceful oak staircase, panelled doors and marble fireplace mantels - are the details they admired most at Helm House, as the mansion is known.
On a recent Saturday, Mr. Swanston conferred with Heritage Port Hope chairman Rick Brooks while carpenters and cabinet makers measured walls and inspected woodwork.
"We're in line with the heritage people and what they want us to do," said Mr. Swanston as Mr. Brooks jotted down notes on his clipboard.
"They just want you to be smart about it," added Ms. Cashman.
At the same time, the couple learned that the hard-charging habits formed by life in Toronto - Mr. Swanston is in the news department at CBC while Ms. Cashman has a career in communications - required adjustment to the mores of this genteel port town on the north shore of Lake Ontario.
And then they reminded themselves that that's one of the reasons they decided to move there in the first place.
"Right off the bat, I had to change my approach," said Mr. Swanston, who first fired off an impatient email to the heritage officials. After that "I suggested meeting them in person. And then it was fine."
The couple is having little trouble easing into this more civilized pace. Already they have met welcoming neighbours and folks in the town. In downtown Toronto, where they've lived for 10 years, they know few of their neighbours.
Still, Mr. Swanston wondered if his friends would think him insane. They are giving up a house Mr. Swanston calls "the perfect urban dwelling," on fashionable Beaconsfield Avenue, just a short stroll north of the Drake Hotel.
But while their Queen Street West neighbourhood has been transformed into a fashionable area, as parents of a four-year-old, they often stay in.
The thought of seeking a calmer existence began to percolate in Mr. Swanston's mind as he walked home from work past trendy bars and restaurants that the couple rarely visited. He enjoyed the walk but he was less keen on seeing neighbours pack up their vans with bicycles and kids to head off to calmer trails for a bike ride.
"What's wrong with this picture - that you can't bike on the street as a kid," he said.
The couple began searching online for a community on a GO Train line so that they could commute to their jobs in Toronto. They wanted a French language school for their daughter, Neala. And they were looking for a house with stunning architecture.
"That was the formula," said Mr. Swanston. "But the formula didn't work anywhere."
After ruling out Georgetown, Stouffville and Newmarket, they found Port Hope, which seemed to have an abundance of lovely houses for sale. It offers VIA Rail service to Toronto. The school is not entirely French language but it does offer French immersion.
In early January, they set off for a tour of houses they saw listed for sale online. They were surprised that every house they saw was so large and impressive; only later did they realize that the more modest houses were less than $500,000. Mr. Swanston says he was so used to Toronto prices he didn't enter anything less than half a million into the search parameters.
When they visited King Street, they learned that it was once lined with the mansions of the prominent and the powerful. From that height, industrialists of the 19th century could survey the town, the Ganaraska River and the ships arriving at port.
The couple learned that the first owner of number 61 was the lumber dealer and businessman Robert Charles Smith, who was descended from United Empire Loyalists. Then John Henry Helm took over and his descendants held onto the property until 1968. The same family had owned it since.
The house, set on one acre of land, has six bedrooms and a wrap-around porch. A steep wooden ladder in the attic leads to the widow's walk, with views out to Lake Ontario.
The carriage house held special appeal for Ms. Cashman, who grew up in England.
"That was the selling point for the whole house for me," she said. "It just reminded me of houses there. You drive up and there's a lovely big coach house."
Still, with 4,400 square feet in the main house and another 1,500 in the carriage house, the restoration project seemed daunting.
"The first time we saw it, we completely dismissed it. It was so overwhelming," said Mr. Swanston.
They also wondered about the scare a few years back about uranium contamination in the area. But their research put them at ease. Soil clean-up in the area has been extensive and Health Canada has said that fears about increased sickness from the low level radiation were baseless.
The family's explorations of the downtown persuaded them that there was plenty of life, with good restaurants and pubs, bakeries, antiques shops, the theatre and a marina.
"The community feels right. I see myself living here," says Ms. Cashman.
Along the way, the couple met a knowledgeable local who surmised that the house with an asking price of more than $800,000 could probably be had for $650,000. They decided to put in an offer and eventually negotiated a price of $653,000.
And it turned out, none of their friends questioned their sanity. They are hoping that more people from Toronto will make the move so that the town remains busy and VIA might even add more trains.
"We're banking on it," says Mr. Swanston. "We're banking that this formula of ours will become more popular."
They figure their strategy of buying a substantial property and improving it is sound because they will keep their investment in real estate at roughly the same level. They received multiple offers on their Toronto house and sold it for just under $900,000. They plan to funnel the difference into renovations.
The house is large enough to accommodate a live-in nanny who can look after their daughter before and after school.
And the couple was very happy to learn that the community offers camps and activities during school breaks - without the lengthy waiting lists or jostling for spots that Toronto parents know so well.
"That was a revelation to me," said Mr. Swanston. "The community is taking care of your child when she's not in school."
With lots of work to accomplish before moving day, the family hopes to move in by the middle of May.
On the main floor, the walls will be painted in heritage colours and newly-built cabinets and countertops will replace a 1970s-era kitchen installed by the previous owner.
Upstairs, the pine floor, made of wide planks, will be sanded. A small bedroom will become an ensuite bathroom for the master bedroom.
Throughout, period details such as windows and doors will be retained.
The pink tiles and carpets of a previous facelift will be stripped out of the spacious main bathroom. They hope that the antique pedestal sink and bathtub, which were made in Port Hope, can be refurbished.
As the work continues, Mr. Swanston called to report a discovery: The builder has torn out the acoustic ceiling tiles and drywall installed in a previous owner's long-ago attempt at modernizing.
The demolition exposed the elaborate plaster mouldings of a Victorian-era craftsman.
"I feel like the house is thanking us," Mr. Swanston said.

LISTING AGENT
Elli Davis, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
The Action: In a new luxury high-rise on Bloor Street, just across from Varsity Stadium by the Royal Ontario Museum, this two-bedroom plus den suite was initially listed for $1,795,000 and later reduced to $1,750,000. Nine serious buyers had private tours before one signed a deal.
What They Got: On the 21st floor of One Bedford, this 2,091-square-foot corner suite has unobstructed views down to the CN Tower with nine-foot tall windows in each room, including the den, an open entertaining space and a dining area, which has a balcony, as well as an eat-in kitchen with a granite-topped island.
* The master was outfitted with broadloom carpeting rather than hardwood floors like the rest of the suite, access to a second outdoor space and the larger of two full bathrooms.
* Additional luxuries include a powder room and high-end Sub-Zero and Miele appliances, along with a locker and parking spot.
* Heat and hydro are not covered by the monthly fee of $1,290, which pays for 24-hour concierge and operating of a gym, indoor pool, hot tub and party room.
* Local amenities also surround the building, which is literally steps from St. George subway station, designer boutiques on Bloor Street and esteemed restaurants in Yorkville, not to mention fine art galleries and museums.
The Agent's Take: "The location in this building was key really ... because it's right on Bloor," says agent Elli Davis. "The view was spectacular south and east on the 21st floor, so it had a very spacious, open feeling."
The suite also provided less work and more space than other options, she says.

An upwardly mobile answer to affordable housing

Author: Quinn, Stephen

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/upwardly-mobile-answer-affordable-housing/docview/928638415/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The concept is simple: Two people, working at opposite times of the day, share the same living space. Person A leaves for work at 7:30 a.m., while person B returns home from work at 8 a.m. Person B is free to sleep, prepare meals and "live" in the space until 6 p.m., at which time he leaves for work, with person A arriving home at 6:30 p.m., and so on.

Full text:   Squeezed out of Vancouver's real estate market? Turf out the kids and call their tree house home
From: Mayor's Task Force on Housing Affordability.
Subject: Recommendations not yet approved by task force for inclusion in its interim report but which are subject to further discussion. (We're not ruling them out.)
Mandatory Grow-ops in All New Construction
This is not to say that all homeowners will choose to grow marijuana, but amendments could be made to the building code to require all newly constructed single-family homes to have a grow-op "roughed in." This would include extra plumbing and drainage, ventilation and commercial-grade 240-volt outlets capable of accommodating an operation of six to eight mercury vapour or HID lights. This would eliminate the need for illegal and unsafe electrical meter bypasses and ensure the safe cultivation of marijuana (if homeowners wish to do so.)
Advantages
* Significant mortgage helper with earnings of up to $100,000 per year making Vancouver real estate slightly more affordable.
* Reduces household debt as recommended by Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney.
* Excess income is kept in the local convenience-store economy.
* Gardening is a proven stress reducer.
Disadvantages
* Bill C-10, which was given royal assent this week, includes mandatory minimum sentences for marijuana cultivation.
* Distribution of product traditionally the domain of organized criminals.
* Grow-rips.
Shift-Living
While this has been depicted in popular culture (especially in the films of Deepa Mehta) as a rather depressing lifestyle, it need not be so. Our research shows that some married couples have practised shift-living for decades with successful outcomes.
The concept is simple: Two people, working at opposite times of the day, share the same living space. Person A leaves for work at 7:30 a.m., while person B returns home from work at 8 a.m. Person B is free to sleep, prepare meals and "live" in the space until 6 p.m., at which time he leaves for work, with person A arriving home at 6:30 p.m., and so on. Weekends may be alternated in whole or in part but depend largely on both "shifters" developing moderately successful romantic relationships with other "shifting" pairs.
Advantages
* Immediately reduces rent and utility charges by 50 per cent for both participants.
* Well-suited to Vancouver-sized condominium homes.
* Effectively doubles number of small rental units, and increases vacancy rates.
Disadvantages
* Inflexible arrangement does not allow for unforeseen circumstances i.e. illness, sleeping in late.
* Not suitable for singles with children unless children can maintain same schedule as shifting parent.
Garage Homes
These are distinct from the current crop of laneway homes, many of which are attractive and architecturally innovative structures.
Typically these are pre-existing standard-sized single-car garages, approximately 12 feet x 24 feet or 288 square feet in size. (Slightly smaller than the smallest allowable, non-SRO rental units.) The addition of baseboard or oscillating-fan heaters will make these spaces livable to the more "bohemian" renters who value open-plan living. This concept takes advantage of the ample on-street parking opportunities in many of the city's RS-1 zoned neighbourhoods.
Advantages
* Provides much-needed affordable rental housing stock for baristas and other food-service workers in neighbourhoods where their services are most needed, i.e. Kerrisdale, Dunbar, Kitsilano, Commercial Drive area.
* Provides homeowners with much-needed mortgage helpers.
* Utilizes "dead space" formerly taken up by automobiles.
* Repeated incidents of vandalism to cars parked on street may prompt car owners to switch to bicycles, thus filling some of the city's empty bike lanes.
Disadvantages
* Running water and toilet facilities not available in most cases.
* Since many garages are poorly insulated and weather-proofed, tenants must have high tolerance for spiders and condensation.
Tree Houses
Vancouver has many mature trees located on private property. Constructing small houses within the trees can be accomplished with minimum input from the city's planning department and minimal skill, while maintaining the permeability of most residential lots. The city would enforce a requirement that all tree houses be constructed of recycled material, i.e. repurposed construction hoarding, election signs and scrap wood. As well, the city would amend the current building code to allow for electrical connection via single indoor-outdoor extension cord.
Advantages
* Makes use of underutilized tree space while providing homeowners with legal mortgage helper.
* Recycled material requirement will mean less construction waste in local landfills and subsequent reduction in greenhouse gases.
* Brings the city closer to its Greenest City goal.
Disadvantages
* Neighbours of adjacent properties may have privacy concerns.
* Liability issues that come with living in a tree.
* Studies show lifestyle is most attractive to males 10 to 14 years of age and therefore may not benefit renters most in need.

On the Coast on CBC Radio One 690 AM and 88.1 FM in Vancouver.

Charmed by a community vibe

Author: Kelly, Deirdre

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/charmed-community-vibe/docview/928373773/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: A home stager by profession, Ms. [Nigel Dickson] helped design and decorate the house in which she raised her children, now ages 21 and 22. Ms. Dickson is also the reason why the couple moved to Cottingham in the first place after living together in Mr. Dickson's Parkdale studio when first married 23 years ago. She grew up nearby and attended a local school. Her childhood memories were strong and rich and she bought, she said, largely as a result of nostalgia.

Full text:   Red-brick Cottingham Street semi gave current owners a neighbourly feel
The listing
Asking: $1.689-million
Taxes : $7,929.29
Agent: Doug Heighington (Royal Lepage/ Johnson and Daniel Division)
The owners
This lustrous red-brick semi, located steps from Avenue Road, just north of Davenport Road, has obvious curb appeal. It is also home to a couple steeped in the visual arts. He is Nigel Dickson, an award-winning English-born photographer whose portraits and commercial work have for decades been published in Canadian and international magazines, from Toronto Life to Esquire and Rolling Stone. Two years ago, the Institute of Contemporary Culture presented a retrospective of his work at the Royal Ontario Museum as part of the acclaimed exhibition, Vanity Fair Portraits: Photographs 1913-2008 . Mr. Dickson's images of such luminaries as Oscar Peterson, Pierre Trudeau and David Cronenberg (a former Cottingham Street neighbour) were incubated in this house where he has lived for the last 22 years. He has shared it with two children and his wife, Diana, an artist in her own right. A board member and associate of Toronto's Gallery 1313, Ms. Dickson is a painter of moody portraits and electrifying abstracts, examples of which line the walls of this elegant three-storey Victorian. Her eye for colour and visual detail is also apparent in her choice of eclectic and colourful furnishings, art work, carpets and accessories.
Why they bought
A home stager by profession, Ms. Dickson helped design and decorate the house in which she raised her children, now ages 21 and 22. Ms. Dickson is also the reason why the couple moved to Cottingham in the first place after living together in Mr. Dickson's Parkdale studio when first married 23 years ago. She grew up nearby and attended a local school. Her childhood memories were strong and rich and she bought, she said, largely as a result of nostalgia. But it was the house itself which ultimately drew her in. "It had character," she says. "But I loved that it was part of a neighbourhood. We bought a house but also a community."
What they did
Built circa 1883-84, the house has retained some of its original detail. "You can still see bits of the original trim on the outside eaves and around the windows and doors on the second floor," says agent Doug Heighington. But for the most part, 188 Cottingham St. is a new house in an old shell, completely remodelled on the inside to create a contemporary family home. The finished basement is a fully inhabitable unit with bedroom, bathroom and sitting area, in addition to storage space. The former attic is now a breezy master bedroom with an ensuite laid with white mosaic tile, the result of a major renovation that included the introduction of a rear addition, which took place 10 years ago. The couple also added a new contemporary-style Aya kitchen with a mini family room and walk-out to the rear garden whose ivy-covered walls compel Mr. Dickson to call it his favourite place.
Why they are moving
Mr. Dickson will miss the garden as well as the neighbourhood, but at age 62 he is feeling the need for a change of pace. He and his wife recently purchased a home in Florida and plan to spend the bulk of their time there, now that their children have grown and left the house. They are still uncertain as to what to do with all the art and furniture and might, along with the house, sell it off. The exception will be the black Steinway in the living room with fireplace, a gift to Ms. Dickson from her father when she graduated in piano from the nearby Conservatory of Music. "We're downsizing but the Steinway comes with us, it's got a lot of meaning for me," she says.

Abstract: Two million Double Downs. Canadians have eaten almost that many of KFC's new item (which, replacing deep-fried chicken pieces for a bun, resembles a novelty gag more than an actual sandwich) in two limited-time runs since 2010. This week, parent Yum Brands Inc. brought it back for a third go. It also added a spicy version just in case patrons weren't getting the heartburn kick they were hoping for from the original, with its 30 grams of fat and 1,740 milligrams of sodium.

Full text:   1. What's more greasy than a Double Down? Two million Double Downs. Canadians have eaten almost that many of KFC's new item (which, replacing deep-fried chicken pieces for a bun, resembles a novelty gag more than an actual sandwich) in two limited-time runs since 2010. This week, parent Yum Brands Inc. brought it back for a third go. It also added a spicy version just in case patrons weren't getting the heartburn kick they were hoping for from the original, with its 30 grams of fat and 1,740 milligrams of sodium. Clearly stating its target demographic, this week Yum also launched a campaign encouraging fans to "Make Time for Man Time," including a Facebook contest with "manly prizes" such as night-vision goggles. In good news for digestive tracts everywhere, there is still no plan to make the Double Down a permanent menu item.
2. Canada has a new independent advertising startup. Toronto agency Giants & Gentlemen, which launched with a staff of four, will be led by two former employees of agency Taxi 2, Alanna Nathanson and Natalie Armata; as well as Gino Cantalini, former vice-president at Publicis Canada. Managing director Mr. Cantalini has also worked on the client side, and is known for being part of the team that developed the "Bud Light Institute" while a brand director at Labatt. Taxi 2 has two clients for now: Edmonton-based real-estate developer Beaverbrook and not-for-profit Canopy, which pushes eco-friendly paper alternatives for companies.
3. Ah, spring. Fresh air, the warmth of the sun, the wrenching jolt of your tires hitting a crater in the road. Ad agency Taxi Montreal is helping Canadians avoid those pavement pitfalls, and report them. This week it launched an iPhone application called Pothole Season, allowing users to tag, on a Google map, potholes they spot. The app collects those reports and every night at midnight, e-mails the appropriate local office in charge of fixing them. The app can also be set to voice alerts so a driver receives a warning when approaching a tagged pothole. The app, which is free to download, is also an ad campaign for Taxi Montreal. The agency is showcasing its talent for utility to prospective clients, and says it may also seek sponsorship for the app from existing clients if it proves fitting for their brand.
4. Those who have pursued a buy-and-hold strategy for their loyalty cards, racking up points and handing over personal information in exchange for the potential of future value, may want to take note. A class-action lawsuit against Shoppers Drug Mart has been authorized by Quebec Superior Court, a case that will raise questions about the value to consumers of loyalty programs, and their management by companies that use them as a marketing tool. Quebec members in the Optimum program under Shopper's Pharmaprix banner found that the value of the points they had collected dropped after the company made changes to the program in 2010.

Restoring dignity, one piece of art at a time

Abstract: "I think it's going to be awesome," says [Randy Spark], who's been kitchen manager for nine years. "I don't know what exactly the pictures are that they're going to do or anything, but I have full confidence that they're gonna be great."

Full text:   A student project comes to an Eastside mission - with a little help from one of Vancouver's biggest collectors
The dining hall at the Union Gospel Mission's new facility in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside is a model of efficiency. With its cafeteria set-up, family-style seating and huge food-storage area, it's a vast improvement over the cheek-by-jowl communal-table arrangement that preceded the new $29-million building, which opened last April. But it's fairly obvious that the immense room, with its big, blank, mustard-and-grey walls, could use a little something. Like some art.
"I think it would be nice to have something to look at, to just kind of brighten the room and make a real nice atmosphere," says Randy Spark, UGM's kitchen manager, who oversees hundreds of hot meals that are served each day. More than half his staff members have been through UGM's recovery program.
When you talk to the people who operate the mission, you hear the word "dignity" a lot. This is a prime concern: restoring dignity to difficult lives. There is dignity, the mission believes, in having a comfortable - and beautiful - space in which to eat, catch up with friends, or just pause from the hardships of the day.
"We often see people living up to the space they are in," offers UGM's Keela Keeping. "If it's dirty and chaotic, people are less likely to care for their surroundings, including other people in it. ... It is my feeling that art in the dining room will help remove any lingering feelings of an institutional setting and subtly make it more home-like and inviting."
Across town on breezy, picturesque Granville Island, a group of students is working on it. They've enrolled in a course at Emily Carr University of Art + Design designed specifically this semester to realize the UGM project. Forget final exams: This course will wrap up in April with the real-world test of large-scale art installation in the mission's dining room (with professional help).
"This interaction that the guests at UGM are going to be having with our pieces that we create is huge," says student Lindsay Block-Glass. "It will change the space completely."
The idea was sparked on a Monday night last summer when Richard Deacon, a long-time UGM donor and volunteer, was working a shift in the kitchen. "I was looking at the walls in this gorgeous building and thought, boy, they're just missing something," says Deacon (who happens to work for The Globe and Mail). "There are all these beautiful orange-coloured chairs, and the walls are yellow, but there's zero art. I don't have a ton of money, but we have some pieces of art in our home, and they inspire me. And I just thought ... that people who use this facility deserved to have the same kind of visual stimulation, if you will, and the chance to enhance their lives like anyone else."
The mission believes in the power of art and runs several art-related programs, but it certainly has no budget to be buying it. So the following weekend, Deacon called up Bob Rennie, a local real-estate marketing machine and prolific art collector who has opened an exhibition space, the Rennie Collection at Wing Sang. Would Rennie (also a UGM supporter) consider getting involved? By Monday morning, Rennie was firing off e-mails with ideas.
"This is our community," says Wendy Chang, director of the Rennie Collection, which is located a few blocks from the mission. "Everyone was gung-ho right away."
What wasn't clear was whether lending art from the collection would work. With a mandate to focus on identity, social injustice and appropriation, the Rennie Collection work can be challenging and political, and UGM was looking for something more pleasant and inspirational (although not religious, despite the mission's Christian basis). Anything that could upset UGM's users in any way, that could provoke unpleasant memories, would not be appropriate.
Rennie sits on the board at Emily Carr, and it didn't take long for the idea of having students create work for the space to form. The university was also enthusiastic.
"I thought a course that is project-based would be a great opportunity for the students," says Yunhee Min, who teaches the Vicinity of Painting course. "It's the first time for a lot of people - including myself - teaching a class that is actually going to realize a work on-site."
Min has divided the class into four teams, each taking on a different area of the 2,917 square-foot dining hall. This week they presented their ideas to the UGM and Rennie Collection honchos for the first time, in a school studio.
The proposals include a 50-colour, 320-tile piece created with input from UGM's users, who will choose a colour "that prompts positive memories" and also suggest a word - such as "hope" or "faith" - to go on the tile (or the word may be extracted from interviews the team will conduct with the clients).
"We want to create something positive and beautiful and hopeful for the space," says Block-Glass, presenting her group's piece We are All Colours .
"I'm really impressed," says Chang after watching the presentations. "Each group has taken a very interesting approach."
But with real-life applications come real-life considerations. Neither of the two women presenting a proposal for a ceiling mobile has built a mobile before - would the non-concrete ceilings be able to support it? Carey Fouks, the Rennie collection's director, art services, suggests a change in direction. "If you do paper lanterns, then you don't have an issue," he says.
Another group's proposal for a "vertical garden" installation for one large wall is an aesthetically pleasing assemblage of pieces created from different materials, all in varying shades of green. But Fouks zeroes in on the pieces created with egg-crate foam: not very durable, he says. Worse, the material might evoke unpleasant feelings. "The foam is maybe not a happy thing for these people," says Fouks, pointing out that many of UGM's clients may have spent uncomfortable nights on a foam mattress.
A fourth group, proposing installations for the pillars, suggests using historic train-hopper symbols, used historically to communicate information about important matters such as whether a place had work to offer, or a dog, or would serve a meal. One symbol, indicating good food, seems a particularly good fit for the project: I8.
The discussions in the classroom range beyond the art and its creation, extending to the space and the users.
"School's not always something that we can apply, to be honest, to real life," says Block-Glass. "So to have something that is impactful as well as being educational for us and make a difference is really exciting and inspiring."
Back at the mission, Spark, who is about to serve up a lunch of sausage patties, rice, mashed potatoes and veggies, is looking forward to seeing something on those big empty walls.
"I think it's going to be awesome," says Spark, who's been kitchen manager for nine years. "I don't know what exactly the pictures are that they're going to do or anything, but I have full confidence that they're gonna be great."

Port Lands to get 'enormous' cleanup

Author: Lorinc, John

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/port-lands-get-enormous-cleanup/docview/927548655/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The potential environmental impact is significant. According to Mr. [John Campbell], a study done for the agency found that if waterfront construction crews relied exclusively on the "dig and dump" approach to disposing of contaminated soil excavated from the Port Lands, they will generate 50 million kilometres of truck traffic on GTA highways. The estimated cost: $65-million for road wear and tear, accidents, fuel and tipping fees. A typical dump truck costs $125 an hour to operate.

Full text: The numbers are staggering. Over the next decade, Waterfront Toronto expects to excavate two million cubic metres of contaminated soil and bring in another million of clean fill as the agency and its developers begin to revitalize the Port Lands. It's a process that will continue for decades, according to newly released real estate studies commissioned by the city.
That's enough to cover everything from Yonge to Spadina and the waterfront north to Queen in a metre of dirt. "The scale," said WT chief executive John Campbell, "is enormous."
To deal with all that dirty dirt in a sustainable way, the agency has awarded Green Soils, a North York firm, with a contract to set up a large-scale soil cleaning facility on the Port Lands, so those mountains of contaminated dirt don't need to be shipped off to dump sites up to 50 kilometres away. The decision follows a two-year WT pilot project on Unwin Avenue, and a tendering process that attracted four bidding groups.
Environmental groups and some GTA municipalities have stepped up pressure on Queen's Park to clamp down on firms that dump huge quantities of untreated, and possibly contaminated, construction soil in quarries north of the city. Last week, Toronto council also voted 34-3 to ask city staff to look at ways of tightening soil-testing rules for local developers.
Under the terms of its agreement with Green Soils, WT and its partners will send contaminated Port Lands soil to the new facility, provided the company offers rates competitive with the tipping fees charged by GTA landfills and other firms that offer soil remediation, including Direct Line Environmental in Pickering. Direct Line Environmental is owned by GFL, which last fall won Toronto's curbside waste outsourcing contract.
Green Soils CEO Ashley Herman said the company plans to test various emerging soil cleaning technologies licensed from other firms. "For the first little while, it's going to be a bit of a world's fair."
The potential environmental impact is significant. According to Mr. Campbell, a study done for the agency found that if waterfront construction crews relied exclusively on the "dig and dump" approach to disposing of contaminated soil excavated from the Port Lands, they will generate 50 million kilometres of truck traffic on GTA highways. The estimated cost: $65-million for road wear and tear, accidents, fuel and tipping fees. A typical dump truck costs $125 an hour to operate. According to Mr. Herman, there are two major categories of soil contaminants: oil and gas residue, often from leaking fuel tanks; and heavy metal residue, which often shows up beneath old factories and downtown development sites that have been built on landfill that includes long-buried deposits of coal ash.
Green Soil's North York facility currently cleans soil contaminated with fuels using a "bioremediation" technique that involves spraying dirt with bacterial compounds that can digest hydrocarbons.

Full text: Husband, father, grandfather, rugby trailblazer, mentor, loyal friend. Born Aug. 24, 1929, in Bangor, Wales. Died Oct. 22, 2011, in Victoria of lung cancer, aged 82.
David Roberts used to say that he came from a line of teachers and preachers. His mother, Olwen Reese, was a teacher and the first woman to graduate in Wales with a masters degree in science. His father, Rev. Frederick Roberts, was a high-profile Baptist preacher.
The youngest of three children, David followed in his parents' footsteps, first in the classroom as a teacher, then as a rugby coach. His passion for the game often included sermons that taught players life lessons lasting long after they'd hung up their cleats.
After his father's death, nine-year-old David was sent to an all-boys British boarding school where he learned English and discovered his love for rugby. He spent time in the Royal Air Force and teachers college before finding himself at Carlton-Le-Willows Grammar School teaching geography, religion and phys ed. It was during this time in Nottingham that the 38-year-old bachelor met his partner for life, Joan Townsend, a Yorkshire lass. They married in 1967 and welcomed one girl, Glain, and three boys, Gareth, Elwyn and Gwynfor, into their lives.
In 1966, David used his persuasive powers and Welsh charm to become the first official rugby coach appointed by an English club when he joined Nottingham RFC. He was credited with revolutionizing the club and took them to the top of the league.
In 1977, the Canadian Rugby Union came calling and David, always up for an adventure, moved his family to Ottawa. He built a foundation for the Canadian national rugby team and coached the local Ottawa Irish to many a winning season.
A man big on formality, David was never without a suit and tie, never owned a pair of jeans and made sure - when on a rugby tour of Japan - that all his players wore clean socks. After retiring from the CRU in 1985, he took a course in real estate. He moved the family back to Nottingham in 1987 and found a new career as a partner in a real-estate firm, while continuing to play an active role in local rugby as president and later secretary of the Nottingham club.
In 2005, David retired at 76 and he and Joan moved to Victoria. There, David found a new passion for lawn bowling. Great friendships were made, tournaments won and lost and many a barstool warmed after a match. It was common for him to show up at the bowling club with a bag of vegetables from his beloved garden.
When an aggressive form of lung cancer was discovered in April, 2011, he faced it with his trademark optimism and good spirits. He saw the four- to 12-week sentence as an opportunity to say goodbye and to help wrap things up for Joan. A lifelong mentor to many of his rugby "boys," David was loyal to his family and friends. You always knew he was in your corner rooting for you to win.
By Glain Roberts-McCabe, David's daughter.

First, James Dyson reinvented the vacuum cleaner / Now he wants to remake the economy

Author: Saunders, Doug

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/first-james-dyson-reinvented-vacuum-cleaner-now/docview/927001578/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "We're traders and exploiters, we're the City of London, that's our culture," he says. "So you have a greater status if you go into banking than you do if you go to a manufacturing firm in Birmingham and make something real and export it, and create wealth that way.

Full text: You have to drive far out into the West Country, through forested hills and ancient villages, if you want to find the last of the mad British inventors. His wide glass desk perches amid a clutter of aluminium tubes, DC-pulse motors, lithium-polymer batteries and whirring prototypes in a distant corner of a sleek, silver building that contains 1,450 engineers, accountants, marketing people, managers and lawyers, and not a single labourer.
Behind that desk sits the silver-haired man who has become the only living British inventor every school kid here can name, a guy known for building actual things. Five years ago, that status would have been almost quaint. Today, it puts him in the political vanguard, both at home and, increasingly, across the Atlantic.
James Dyson's surname adorns an expanding array of bag-less vacuum cleaners, blade-less fans and washroom hand dryers that actually dry your hands. His private company claimed more than a billion pounds in worldwide sales last year, growing right through the recession.
Now, though, Mr. Dyson, 64, is even better known as the leading proponent of the suddenly popular idea that Western nations ought to return to manufacturing and exporting physical goods, after decades of shifting the roots of their economies to services, property and finance.
His call for an assembly-line renaissance has echoed far beyond Britain, where he was appointed a senior adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron's coalition government and has spawned a raft of policies.
In the United States, his argument has become a key front in the current electoral battle: Reindustrialization is a byword in many Republican primaries, such as this week's showdown in the Rust Belt state of Ohio. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama's lines on "green" manufacturing, innovation and education closely track with those of Mr. Dyson, who took to the U.S. airwaves last month, arguing that the school system should be far more oriented to science and engineering, especially in poor neighbourhoods.
The problem, he explains in his crisp middle-class English, is that countries such as Britain, which was known two generations ago as "the workshop of the world," have had the factory stripped from their DNA.
"We're traders and exploiters, we're the City of London, that's our culture," he says. "So you have a greater status if you go into banking than you do if you go to a manufacturing firm in Birmingham and make something real and export it, and create wealth that way. That's the problem - it's historical. It's in our schools, it's in our culture and it's in our government."
In fact, Mr. Dyson, Britain's most famous manufacturer, doesn't actually manufacture anything in Britain. He hasn't done so for 10 years, since he was refused local permission to expand his Wiltshire factory and came to the realization, as thousands of other manufacturers have, that hardly any of the components of his machines were made in Britain any more. So why not move everything to Asia, where it's simply easier to build things?
"There ought to be huge advantages to manufacturing in England," he says with an indignation that hasn't dulled over the decade. "This is where our headquarters are, it's where our managers are, our engineers. We've got two bigger offices in Singapore and Malaysia, and we don't want to do that - it's a logistical nightmare - but we're forced to do it."
It's not the labour, he says. Few companies shift their manufacturing overseas because of lower wages; in fact, many of the factory jobs for companies like his require some postsecondary education.
"Wages are a tiny percentage of our manufacturing cost," he says. "We'd happily pay British labour costs rather than Southeast Asian labour costs and not have to manufacture 8,000 miles away. The reason we went there is that we weren't allowed to expand, and all of our suppliers were in the Far East. Why buy a British plug cable made in Taiwan, ship that all the way back to England to install it, then ship that all over the world? The problem we face now is that China and the Far East are manufacturing economies, and shortly probably India and South America. And we can't compete with that. ... It's the cost of our whole infrastructure, our employment laws and our skills ... the management skills in particular. And we're a very expensive place to make things."
Before 2008, this was simply the complaint of one businessman, railing against an economic system that was designed around services, software and real estate, and seemed to be running very smoothly indeed. But the global economic downturn has given his message a new universality. After all, it was the financial-services and property sectors that collapsed; industry-driven economies such as Germany and Singapore experienced record-breaking export booms and avoided the crisis.
Countries such as Canada and Britain have a weakness: Having abandoned manufacturing almost completely, they are vulnerable to the uncontrollable destinies of natural resources and the financial industry. But Mr. Dyson describes it as only one symptom of a larger problem: a Western world, especially the former branches of the British Empire such as Britain and Canada, that has lost its will to invent and make things.
"The trouble with Britain is that it built its success on the riches of its empire, rather than building its success on a manufacturing economy - we went out to the empire and flogged them what products we had, and took their resources, and made money off it. There was no need to be the best."
Canada followed a similar path, shifting its economy away from manufacturing and into a greater reliance on natural resources and financial services (although not as much as Britain - Canada still maintains some export leaders, such as Bombardier and Research in Motion). This, Mr. Dyson says, is a recipe for vulnerability, as it has made his country, and ours, dependent on the shifting fates of resource pricing and market activity. The solid employment and export earnings of an industrial would provide more stability, he says.
Can we compete with Asia and South America?
But he fears it may be too late. "The problem now is that China is rising rapidly, the Southeast Asian countries, the United States is very strong on technology, Japan, Korea and now South America - so what on Earth is [Britain's] future going to be? No empire any longer, the North Sea oil drying up and we're not a cheap manufacturing nation; we've even lost our ability to manufacture."
The Dyson solution involves shifting the education system, the tax system and the government's priorities to making industrial manufacturing something that is once again desired, supported and rewarded.
For example, Mr. Obama, buoyed by the success of George W. Bush's Detroit auto-industry bailout and the strong uptick in exports with the cheaper dollar, is pushing for a U.S. industrial policy designed to make goods exports easier. As he points out, manufacturing made up 25 per cent of the U.S. economy in 1980; it has now fallen to less than 10 per cent. A study last month by the Washington-based Brookings Institution makes the case for a reindustrialization of America, finding that manufacturing jobs boost average salaries and productivity, provides the research and development investments that are the main source of innovation for the service industry and, perhaps most importantly, provides a large-scale rise in foreign-exchange earnings that would reduce the U.S. balance-of-payments deficit - the fundamental cause of the economic crisis.
"Economists agree that the United States must rebalance growth, away from consumption and imports financed by foreign borrowing, toward exports," says Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the economist who chaired Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. "The only way the United States can ... make a significant dent in its trade deficit for the foreseeable future is by increasing exports of manufactured goods."
In a tip of the hat to Mr. Dyson, George Osborne, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, tabled "a budget for making things" last year and loaded it with tax relief for small business, laws to reduce planning and bureaucratic barriers, grants to entrepreneurs and plans to double the number of technical colleges and apprenticeship programs.
Indeed, Mr. Dyson played a large part in the election of Mr. Cameron's government: He wrote a report, "Innovative Britain," calling for tax and education systems designed to move people into design and manufacturing; it was a major subject of the 2010 election, and almost all of its recommendations have been implemented.
Now, he is pushing particularly hard to reinvigorate the inventing trades in Britain: He points out that only 6 per cent of British graduates study engineering, compared with 13 per cent in Germany and 40 per cent in Singapore.
It could be a good moment to bring manufacturing back home: Overseas wages and employment costs are rising, as are long-distance shipping costs, and political instability and natural disasters have shown the weaknesses in long, complex, multinational supply chains. Perhaps it is easier, some companies now say, to have all your suppliers within driving distance, even if that costs more. That's what auto manufacturers have long done.
What is a job? What's a factory?
But this is not a simple or uncontroversial matter.
A big reason why manufacturing jobs and factories moved to the Far East was because Asia and the rest of the developing world have a very different definition of "job" and "factory." Western manufacturing, by the end of the Second World War, had come to be based around what some economists called a Fordist model: After the innovations of Henry Ford and his industrial comrades, factory jobs became lifelong, secure relationships between employer and employee, and factories permanent features on the landscape.
When Mr. Dyson complains about the 25-year leases he is expected to sign on British factory land, or the employment laws that make it a big burden to hire an additional worker (in large part because it's so expensive to fire them), he is complaining about the legacies of Fordism.
Asian manufacturers work in a "post-Fordist" economy in which labour and capital are flexible and fast-moving. If he sets up a vacuum-cleaner factory in Malaysia, he can ask his aluminium-tube supplier to set up a parts factory down the road, and within a year it can be built, staffed and operational. If his sales fall, he can cut staffing levels quickly.
Millions of Westerners, perhaps the majority, live the post-Fordist life: the call-centre workers, the piecework food processors. But our governments and unions have spent generations making full-time industrial jobs secure and permanent. Changing that will be controversial and jarring. It's what the Detroit auto workers effectively did: In exchange for the Washington bailout, they and their unions agreed to sharp reductions in job security and benefits.
Some labour and political leaders argue that the sort of policies proposed by the Dysons of the world amount to the beginning of a levelling-down of Western standards to developing-world levels, when the opposite should be occurring.
Other economists argue that it isn't really about manufacturing: There is no reason, on paper, why a good is more valuable to the economy, more export-worthy or more productivity-enhancing than a service. Most employment takes place in services, and in many countries the lion's share of exports are services such as software, banking, consulting and things like waste collection. And the barrier between the two is breaking down: Is Amazon's Kindle operation really retailing goods, or are the readers themselves merely the physical front end for the much larger downloading service?
When people talk about using government to boost manufacturing, what exactly are they talking about subsidizing, and to what end? As Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden, told a reporter after Mr. Obama proposed his industrial policy: "Every barbershop is now going to claim that they manufacture haircuts."
Mr. Dyson and his allies dismiss such arguments. "It's a false view that services are just as good," he says. "Services are very hard to export, and even if you do export them, they're very easy to copy. And manufacturing does provide a better living. The average salary at Rolls-Royce is £41,000 [$65,000] per year; the average salary at Lloyds Bank [Britain's largest service employer] is £17,500 [$28,000] per year. There's a very high standard of living in Switzerland and Singapore, and they're both manufacturing economies - the average salary in Singapore is $57,000 a year."
He sees the source of salvation in Britain, Canada and similar countries in their universities - "our last remaining source of innovation and industrial leadership," he says.
"It's always said about the British," this quintessential Englishman says, "that we invent things and everybody else exploits them. And it's true. But I don't think it has to be that way, and now we have a grand opportunity to change it."
It is perhaps fitting that this idea is being promoted by the man best known for reinventing the vacuum cleaner. This time, after all, what he is trying to fix is nothing less than a political and economic vacuum.

LISTING AGENT
Bill Mohan, Sutton Group Realty Systems Inc.
The Action: On a one-way street just east of High Park, this three-storey, investment property sat on the market last year likely due to buyers' inability to view all the tenanted units.
Another local agent, Bill Mohan, promised to sell the property within a week - and for a similar price - provided that all the tenants vacated the premises for one hour at two different times to permit private showings. The strategy not only brought out 70 interested parties, but five shoppers that submitted competing offers.
What They Got: This century-old, brick building has four levels of finished living space set up with four one-bedroom apartments and a bachelor suite, each with a living area, a kitchen with a fridge and stove, and a remodeled three-piece bathroom.
* Some distinguishing features include decks off the main and third floor units and a fireplace in the second-floor bachelor suite.
* Additional assets consist of updated carpeting in common areas, coin-operated laundry machines in the basement and 30-by-130-foot grounds with a south-facing backyard, detached garage and mutual driveway.
The Agent's Take: "It's a great location and the rents are good, so it makes for a solid, long-term investment," Mr. Mohan said.
"It's been well maintained over the years, but it was well built to begin with, so that makes it easy."

China's wine connoisseurs flock to France

Author: Douet, Marion

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/chinas-wine-connoisseurs-flock-france/docview/926500540/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Although interested in the Bordeaux's famous name, Chinese buyers have so far shied away from purchasing properties labelled "grand crus" - the designation for classified vintage wines of the finest quality. Chinese investors aim to buy intermediate wine qualities mostly for cost reasons. Such properties cost an average of EUR5-million ($6.5-million), against 20 times more for a "grand cru," analysts say.

Full text: With its wineries and historical chateaux, the Bordeaux region is attracting property buyers and tourists
You could hardly do better than Château du Grand Moueys if you were looking for a metaphor to demonstrate Chinese interests in European wines, luxury goods and travel.
It has a history that includes a Templar legend, vineyards in the heart of France's famed Bordeaux region and a new Chinese owner with plans to export the wine home and turn its palatial 18th-century house into a luxury hotel for tourists from China.
The French estate's new owner, Jin Shan Zhang, is part of a wave of Chinese interests across Europe seeking to satisfy domestic demand for the finer things in life: French wines, luxury travel, foreign cars and fashionable clothes.
In France, Britain, Italy, Germany and elsewhere across Europe, Chinese tourists are being catered to in high-end shops selling them top labels in everything from couture to cutlery. Hotels, department stores and luxury boutiques have taken on Chinese-speaking staff and most of Europe's luxury firms have an Asian business strategy they are actively pursuing.
China has become the biggest importer of Bordeaux wines, and consumption in the middle kingdom soared by 110 per cent in 2011 alone, with no sign of quenching a seemingly insatiable thirst.
About 15 Chinese individuals or businesses have purchased wine-growing properties in Bordeaux and Chinese investors also want to develop luxury tourism in the region, which they think will be the next fad as Chinese wealth pours into Europe.
"For Chinese people, the Bordeaux region is a paradise of wine, for the drink but also for the image of France, the landscapes and the châteaux," said Li Lijuan, the 28-year-old Chinese woman in charge of managing the Grand Moueys property.
Mr. Zhang made his fortune manufacturing fruit alcohol, owns several businesses including a travel agency and has an intimate understanding of the wine supply network back home.
"We will export at least 80 per cent of our production to China. We will increase our output of white wine," Ms. Lijuan added.
"Chinese people love it because it's sugary."
She lives alone in the estate's massive neo-Gothic chateau, which sits prominently in the midst of the vineyard and which, in the summer of 2013, will be turned into a luxury hotel with French gardens, tennis courts, a golf course and a high-end Chinese restaurant.
Mr. Zhang told Decanter magazine last month that he hopes to welcome about 10,000 Chinese visitors a year to Grand Moueys from 2013, but will keep it open for other tourists as well.
"We will retain the luxury French feel of the wine and the estate, and hope to marry this with Chinese culture," he was quoted by Decanter as saying.
Out of the 11,000 chateaux sitting along the Garonne river in Bordeaux, between 15 and 20 have been sold to Chinese investors since 2008 and another 30 properties could soon change hands.
While this figure may still sound marginal, analysts in the sector say this trend will intensify, despite China being among the world's 10 largest domestic wine producers.
"They come and supply themselves directly because their internal market is enormous," said Philippe Hermant, in charge of wine at Transcapital, a business that specializes in mergers and acquisitions in the food sector.
Although interested in the Bordeaux's famous name, Chinese buyers have so far shied away from purchasing properties labelled "grand crus" - the designation for classified vintage wines of the finest quality. Chinese investors aim to buy intermediate wine qualities mostly for cost reasons. Such properties cost an average of EUR5-million ($6.5-million), against 20 times more for a "grand cru," analysts say.
"Grand crus cost around EUR800,000 per hectare. They don't understand that price, it's unthinkable for them," said a wine grower who has just sold his property near Libourne.
But while Chinese investors do not target the absolute top wine producers, they do want to buy impressive and beautiful buildings.
Among the thousands of wine properties for sale, many do not match this criteria.
The Latour Laguens chateau in the Entre-Deux-Mers area, which sits on top of a hill between the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers, was the first chateau sold to a Chinese firm in 2008. Jean-Baptiste Soula, oenologist at Château Latour-Laguens, said the medieval-style dungeon of the 18th-century chateau was a key feature that made the purchase possible.
While wine properties are called chateaux, the buildings nestled amongst the vineyards are often not real castles, much to the dismay of those buyers less familiar with the landscape of the French wine industry.
"Without those beautiful buildings, investments would have never happened here," Mr. Soula said. "In this type of domain the building makes up around 50 per cent of the price," he said.
Behind the thick layers of stones, wine storehouses made of stainless steel are brand new and the casks made out of the best quality oak wood bought from local craftsmen.
One resident of the Capian village, close to a chateau that was recently sold to a Chinese group, said she welcomed the investment in the vineyards and the cultural heritage, which would fall into neglect otherwise.
"People were gossiping because we weren't seeing anyone visiting," the resident said. "In the end we all learnt about it [the sale] in the local daily," she added.
Chinese investors, such as the new owner of Château Grand Moueys, often want to tap into the surge of Chinese tourism and develop a high-end oenology tourism in the Bordeaux region. "We are at the start of a flow, which is going to massively increase," said Pierre Goguet, head of the Bordeaux Industry and Commerce Chamber. Tourism from Asia to the Bordeaux region has jumped by 40 per cent in 2011.
"There is a real infrastructure issue," Mr. Goguet said. "The most beautiful hotel in Bordeaux, which faces the Opera, is not luxurious enough, they don't like it at all," he said.
But investors are also trying to replicate that elegant French feeling for consumers at home who would like the wine, the food and the atmosphere without the long flight to Europe.
Close to the large seaside resort of Dalian in northern China, investors are constructing a village inspired by the home of the famous Saint-émilion wine.
In this theme park, expected to open its doors in 2012, 20 million wine bottles will tingle taste buds and villas sold for about EUR1-million will overlook green slopes, covered in vines.

CRIME FICTION

Author: Cannon, Margaret

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/crime-fiction/docview/925924083/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: It is 1868, and MIT's first class of 15 is about to graduate. In the background, angry unions insist that machines will destroy workers' livelihoods, creationists see technology as the handmaid of Satan, and the bluebloods of Harvard don't want upstart "collegies" as competition.

Full text: Hanging Hill
By Mo Hayder, HarperCollins,
429 pages, $22.99
Mo Hayder is emerging as one of the best crime writers in Britain. She consistently delivers original plots, with solid characters and fascinating, eccentric premises. Hanging Hill is another great Hayder book, this time using the simple idea of something being too good to be true.
Sally Benedict had the great life: the handsome husband and the great daughter, the nice house, the fine friends and the leisure to enjoy it all. Then her husband left her for another wife and a new child, and Sally is the poor mum at the rich kids' school, living on loans and trying to pay the bills by working for a cleaning service.
When a rich client offers her extra work at four times her pay, she jumps at the chance, and that jump takes her into a world she never thought existed in her comfortable suburban life.
While Sally founders, her sister Zoe, a highly placed police detective in Bath, is called out on the most grisly of crimes. One call takes her to the corpse of a girl who was a classmate of Sally's daughter. The sisters haven't spoken for years, but the murder forces them into confronting their pasts.
The plot with the exotic setting with a terrible history (Hanging Hill is the location of a huge country estate) is classic Hayder. That history forms a kind of ghost in the background of this tale of very modern evils, as Sally and Zoe are confronted with horrible dilemmas and terrible choices.
The Technologists
By Matthew Pearl, Random House, 480 pages, $31
Who knew that a mystery formed around the founding of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology could be so good? I confess to a complete ignorance of the subject matter - mechanical engineering, chemistry, physics, natural science - but Matthew Pearl's extensive research and lively characters kept me engrossed.
It is 1868, and MIT's first class of 15 is about to graduate. In the background, angry unions insist that machines will destroy workers' livelihoods, creationists see technology as the handmaid of Satan, and the bluebloods of Harvard don't want upstart "collegies" as competition.
In the midst of all this comes a cataclysmic event: The ships in Boston Harbor find their instruments going awry, and death and destruction ensue. The city has hardly a moment to recover when another attack comes in the financial district. Someone wants to destroy Boston. The baffled police turn to the scientific genius of the age, Louis Agassiz of Harvard. But it's the technologists of Tech who will uncover the plot.
This is a terrific historical mystery in the fine old Arthur Conan Doyle style. The young men (and one woman) of MIT deduce facts and conduct arcane experiments. There are cliffhanger endings and fortuitous escapes; strange machines are invented, à la The Wild Wild West.
There are even a couple of very sweet romances.
Defending Jacob
By William Landay, Delacorte,
422 pages, $30
The premise of this sizzling courtroom thriller, reminiscent of Scott Turow's Presumed Innocent, could be snatched from this week's headlines. A teenager is murdered on his way to school. The accused is a classmate. Both boys are 14, nice kids from good families.
Andy Barber is the assistant district attorney for the privileged town of Newton, Mass. He has a solid marriage and a career he is devoted to. When his son Jacob is accused of murder on flimsy and circumstantial evidence, he mounts an aggressive defence.
But old secrets come back to poison their case and they discover that there are many things that not even the most loving people can really know about themselves, each other and their children. The writing is a bit contrived, but the characters more than make up for it.
Those Who Love Night
By Wessel Ebersohn, Minotaur,
327 pages, $28.99
This superb sequel to last year's The October Killings takes the reader into the heart of the failed state of Zimbabwe in ways that no documentary could. Once again, Ebersohn combines fine writing, great characters and intimate knowledge of the recent history of southern Africa.
Abigail Bukula, the brilliant young lawyer in the South African Justice Department, returns with another personal tragedy. This time it's the lost son of her dead aunt, killed in a massacre. He is accused of crimes against the state and is being held in Zimbabwe's most brutal prison. If the state doesn't kill him, incarceration will.
Abigail enlists her old ally, psychologist Yudel Gordon, in a trip to save her cousin and to expose the real truth of her aunt's death..
A Room Full of Bones
By Elly Griffiths, McClelland
& Stewart, 346 pages, $22.99
Those who haven't discovered the excellent series featuring forensic archeologist Ruth Galloway can start here, but they'll want the earlier three novels to uncover the interesting history of Prof. Galloway and Detective Inspector Harry Nelson.
Neil Topham, curator for a private museum of oddities owned by a local aristocrat, has been murdered.
The only clue seems to point to the museum's failure to hand back a large collection of bones belonging to Australian aboriginal people who believe their ancestors will not rest until they are restored to their original burial places.
Lord Smith, the museum's owner, is adamant that he won't return them. But Galloway thinks there's much more to the tale than the violation of graves. This is a skillful and engaging mystery, with great characters and a solid backstory.

Investors give Yelp sterling reviews in stock market debut

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/investors-give-yelp-sterling-reviews-stock-market/docview/925924014/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Yelp's IPO is the latest in a series of Internet stock offerings that are serving as a prelude to Facebook's coming out party on Wall Street this spring. Facebook's IPO is expected to raise at least $5-billion and anoint the owner of the Internet's largest social network with a market value ranging from $75-billion to $100-billion.

Full text: Yelp Inc.'s stock opened to five-star reviews from investors on Friday, soaring 63 per cent even though the company has yet to prove it can make money from its online recommendations.
After Yelp's initial public offering priced at $15 (U.S.), the shares gained $9.52 to close at $24.52 in their trading debut. In an indication of the strong investor interest in the 8-year-old reviews site, the IPO sold above its targeted range of $12 to $14 per share.
It's the biggest first-day gain for an Internet IPO since online real estate service Zillow Inc. surged 79 per cent last July. Yelp's gain wasn't the biggest for an IPO so far this year, though. Those bragging rights still belong to Proto Labs Inc., a provider of customized parts. Proto Labs' shares soared 81 per cent in their first day of trading a week ago.
Yelp's IPO is the latest in a series of Internet stock offerings that are serving as a prelude to Facebook's coming out party on Wall Street this spring. Facebook's IPO is expected to raise at least $5-billion and anoint the owner of the Internet's largest social network with a market value ranging from $75-billion to $100-billion.
After expenses, Yelp estimates it will get about $96-million from its IPO. The company sold 7.1 million shares and its charitable foundation another 50,000. Investment bankers also have an option to sell an additional 1.07 million shares, depending on investor demand. If those shares are sold, Yelp expects net proceeds of $111.2-million.
With Friday's stock price jump, the San Francisco company has a market value of $1.47-billion. Such a big first-day jump is common, especially for high-profile Internet companies such as Yelp. LinkedIn Corp., the professional networking service, saw its stock nearly triple on its first trading day last May, reaching $122.70 after pricing at $45.
The biggest individual winners in Yelp's IPO are its chairman, Max Levchin, and its CEO and co-founder, Jeremy Stoppelman. Mr. Levchin, 36, owns 7.1 million shares now worth $175-million and Mr. Stoppelman, 34, owns 5.9 million shares now worth $145 million. Both Mr. Levchin and Mr. Stoppelman made $15-million by selling some of their stock before the IPO.
The IPO also will enrich many of Yelp's 900 employees who received stock incentives as part of their compensation packages.
Though it's best known for restaurant reviews, Yelp's users have reviewed churches, strip clubs, hospitals, hotels and high schools. The company makes money from advertising. Most of the ads come from the local businesses that its users review. In 2011, it booked revenue of $83.3-million, up 74 per cent from 2010. It had a loss of $16.7-million last year and $9.6-million the year before. Yelp's losses since its inception total $41-million.
"Yelp's active community of users writing reviews of local businesses is difficult to replicate," said Morningstar analyst Rick Summer. "Unfortunately, the company faces challenges translating the small advertising budgets of local businesses into profitability, as about 70 per cent of ad revenues are eaten up by sales and marketing expenses."

Full text: One of Toronto's premier architecture shops takes the city's most expensive luxury home as a starting point for future growth
jmays@globeandmail.com
Fresh from last year's twenty-fifth birthday celebration - an important milestone for any creative firm working in today's risky business environment - Quadrangle Architects has been sprucing up its large operation on Toronto's Wellington Street West.
The company has hired the inventive architect Richard Witt, a former Quadrangle employee who went off to direct RAW Design in 2007 and now returns as a principal. Caroline Robbie, a talented interior designer, has been boosted into the nine-member management circle that includes founders Les Klein and Brian L. Curtner. These and other personnel changes, coming not long after the completion of Quadrangle's first comprehensive strategic plan, are all about grafting new branches onto the firm's sturdy trunk - and making sure the tree still stands tall after the current leadership retires.
"We're pretty excited about what's been going on at Quadrangle," Mr. Curtner told me last week. "Entrepreneurs have a hard time planning what they're doing and where they're going. But we had the catalyst of needing a succession plan, so we spent the time to do a strategic plan and branding exercise."
(The architect and I talked in the oak-panelled library of the modernist penthouse at 130 Bloor St. W., a 50-year-old tower that Quadrangle has recently reshaped.)
"We itemized what we were really good at, what we were striving to do, who were our key clients and constituents," Mr. Curtner said.
"Then we boiled it all down to one phrase: 'Inspiration realized'." With this corporate motto, Quadrangle "is saying we're innovative, and we want to be more innovative. We wanted to think about ourselves as a group that could come up with something unique and inspirational for the city and our clients, but do it in a way that is business-minded, appropriate to the site, contextual - i.e., that could be realized."
The recipe Mr. Curtner has in mind to insure Quadrangle's continuing success is not complicated: You mix the new ideas of young designers with the senior staff's technical and business expertise. Out of the Cuisinart will come, or should come, architectural dishes that suit the Quadrangle clientele's staid tastes, but that also contribute something aesthetically attractive to the cityscape.
This, in any case, is how Richard Witt's upcoming career at Quadrangle is supposed to work. "Richard is fantastic at looking at a project in a way others can't," Mr. Curtner said.
"Then we'll be able to help him figure out how to actually get it done."
When I asked the architect to name the jobs he would enjoy seeing his newly energized office tackle, he had an instant reply: "two or three more like this one," meaning the 21-storey, mixed-use Bloor Street structure we were sitting in.
It's not hard to understand why. The redoing and new construction at 130 Bloor St. W., which was completed in 2009, supplied plenty of the inspirational aggravation that some designers, including Brian Curtner, appear to thrive on.
At the heart of the scheme is a 14-storey modernist block crafted by the Toronto-based architectural firm of Bregman + Hamann (B+H) and finished in 1960. The task taken on by Mr. Curtner entailed dropping seven new storeys of top-end condominium housing on the original 14 levels without making the whole edifice collapse.
And in addition to the technical challenge, there was an important artistic and cultural one: the preservation of the10,263-square-foot, two-storey penthouse apartment fashioned in the 1960s by B+H co-founder Sidney Bregman for Toronto businessman Noah Torno.
The majestic suite has long been sacred to local fans of high modernist power-style architecture, and some of us worried that the developer (KingSett Capital Inc.) might ask Quadrangle to dice up the great space into little condos.
The story of 130 Bloor St. W., however, has a happy ending. The seven new residential levels sit securely on their base (most of it given over to offices), which has been masterfully re-engineered to carry the load. Fourteen new, very spacious luxury units - the area of the largest is over 6,000 square feet - have been added to downtown Toronto's housing stock.
And the Torno penthouse (now called the Cumberland Apartment and sandwiched between the old and new fabric) has been restored and brought up to date by interior designer J. F. Brennan. Fortunately, the classic (and classy) original layout has survived basically intact. The asking price for the suite, Mr. Curtner told me, is upwards of $30-million.
"We want more projects like this, where we have a team that pushes the envelope to make something unique," the architect said.
"You take an old building, put stuff on top, get it all to work, while maintaining the fabric of the city. We want to do works that stand out in the city, that are well-known as Quadrangle projects."

Full text: Local design firm has helped navigate residential re-thinks without sacrificing historical significance or view-planes
The Vic Suites has emerged in Halifax, its red balconies lending the downtown a splash of colour and, according to its designers, a spirit of optimism.
"I call the Vic a threshold building. I think it really does bridge where Halifax has been and where it could go," says Glen McMinn, creative director and partner at Breakhouse, the funky local design and architecture company.
"In the landscape of our city, it shows optimism, it shows forward thinking, and to me, it also shows respect to the places around it. It does its best to respect the two streets it's on, it talks to the water, it talks to the street, it talks to the people who come to visit. It could be just a building with red balconies or it could be a building that is a landmark as we move forward."
Breakhouse worked with Dexel Developments Ltd. and Michael Napier Architecture on the 10-storey Vic Suites, which replaced a run-down but distinctive 19th-century apartment building at the corner of Hollis and Morris streets.
The firm came on board to help navigate a contentious development: As is frequently the case with new buildings in downtown Halifax, heritage advocates were worried about the loss of view-planes and significant historical buildings - Charles Morris, Halifax's first surveyor general, once ran a business at the site - to make way for the $15-million mixed residential and commercial development.
Breakhouse came up with a concept for the 82-unit building that was artistic yet functional, featuring aluminum panels, natural stone, glass and open balconies with red glass railings.
"We were collectively able to create, and I'm sincere when I say this, what I think is a remarkable building," says Mr. McMinn, 45.
While the company, co-founded in the late 1990s by Mr. McMinn and Peter Wünsch, designs everything from retail stores to brands to public engagement initiatives, they expect to handle more residential projects with the installation of a third partner, architect Vincent Van Den Brink.
Before joining the firm last April, Mr. Van Den Brink, 36, received the Lieutenant Governor Award of Merit for a home in Mineville, N.S. He may have come from a traditional architecture background, but he's embraced Breakhouse's stable of graphic designers, art directors, industrial designers, project managers and communications specialists.
"When I came to Breakhouse and saw that there was a lot more that the built realm can offer, and all the layers that enrich the experience of that built environment, it fundamentally changed the way I look at architecture," he says.
"I think it elevates the work. It's about addressing all of a client's needs, whether that's designing a house they can truly feel at home in, or improving a company's culture and bottom line."
The firm was born when Mr. McMinn and Mr. Wünsch started working on small projects outside of their regular jobs in the film industry, where they met and became friends.
Their retail designs soon put them on the map: sophisticated but gritty nightclub Tribeca (in the space that housed Mr. Wünsch's one-time bar Cafe Mokka); trendy restos Fid and Jane's on the Common; the vibrant FRED (Free Ride Everywhere Downtown), a gallery, cafe and salon; and the solid but welcoming Uncommon Grounds cafe.
As a recent story in Canadian Architect magazine noted, Breakhouse has been changing Halifax "one thousand square feet at a time."
The firm's multidimensional approach evolved quite naturally, says Mr. McMinn, who went through architecture school but had no desire to work as an architect, instead plying his trade as an art director and production designer for several years.
"We realized we were a branding company because we take care of everything, not just the experience, but the strategy around the experience, from designing everything from the packaging to the space itself," he says. "The multidimensional aspect, the multi-services we provide, it's what gets us up in the morning."
Mr. Wünsch, a graduate of NSCAD University, agrees: "I was a kid who went to art school but who quickly realized I wasn't really an artist. But I loved exploring design and sculpture and painting and drawing... and architectural history," muses the 47-year-old.
"I feel at home in the environment we've created. Roles are interesting around here. We have this mentality of the best idea wins and we include lots of different skill sets and lots of different ways of looking at things."
And while looking at every project like "an ecosystem" wasn't a conscious decision, it loaned Breakhouse an edge to survive in, and branch out from, the smallish market of Halifax.
Most of their work - and about 90 per cent comes via referrals - is now regional or national, including clients such as Bell Canada, Wind Mobile, Aliant, Lawtons, Vogue Optical and Wicker Emporium, giving birth to more than 500 actual stores across the country. Where employee numbers have hovered around 10 for several years, Breakhouse now employs 15.
And they're turning their minds to what Mr. McMinn calls "residential re-thinks," including a gem of an apartment building on Tower Road.
"The cornerstone is you. It's your story - all we do is help you enhance it," he says. "All houses have a roof, yes, but design comes from a conversation with the end user: who you are, how you like to live, how you plan to grow."
The company also nurtures discussion about design in Halifax, through a lunch-and-learn series known as Poodle Club held at their office in an old CN Rail diesel plant across from Pier 21, and a larger ongoing event, 4 Days Better City Lab, that aims to create sustainable transformation in the city and province.
"At the same time that it's completely bleak [here], it's also completely exciting," says Mr. Wünsch. "It's great being a voice and a party to the conversations that are happening. Halifax is in a transitional time and the world is in a transitional time... People in Halifax are hungry for the opportunity to be more engaged with their city - how to fix it, how to make it more liveable.
"Our tagline is 'Design Makes Everything Better' and we have a real heartfelt belief in that," he continues. "We're super excited about transitional times. It keeps our company fresh, because we are always transitioning ourselves - we are organic, we are chaotic, and all the stuff creatives have to be."
The three partners - all Ontario-born transplants to Nova Scotia - see the situation in Halifax as a microcosm for what's happening elsewhere.
"There are a lot of cities in our country that are going through the same things we are. And there are probably a lot of design firms that are fighting the fight. It's a broad discussion," says Mr. Van Den Brink.

Full text:   The Third Reich
By Roberto Bolaño
Translated by Natasha Wimmer
Hamish Hamilton Canada, 352 pages, $30
On he goes, Roberto Bolaño, on and on and on. Dead these eight years now, the Chilean novelist continues to publish new work at a pace that makes Stieg Larsson look like the worst kind of posthumous slacker. The Third Reich is - let's see - the 17th book of Bolaño's to be published in English since 2003, with more to come.
I'll confess up front to having started in on Bolaño's opus, 2666, when it came out in 2008, and having wandered away about halfway through, with no hard feelings and every intention of getting back to it ... at some point. As Patti Smith was saying about a beautiful little book of Cesar Aira's, reading Bolaño can be like dreaming the most complex and intensely cinematic dream only to find that when you wake up, it's utterly gone. It leaves you gladdened and refreshed and just a little bit befuddled.
The Third Reich is that kind of book. It's the entirely beguiling story of Udo Berger, who's young and German and has a job with the power company in Stuttgart. He has a new girlfriend, the beautiful Ingeborg, and together they've come on holiday to Spain, the Costa Brava, a hotel on the beach where Udo came as a boy with his family. The weather is wonderful, the beach is wide: What could be better? Udo is delighted to find that the same German woman, Frau Else (also beautiful), is still running the place with her husband.
Although Udo is, it has to be said, a little preoccupied. He has work to do. Back home, he's a prodigy of war-gaming, the German national champ. Omaha Beachhead, Anzio, World in Flames: He plays all the long-running, deep-strategy Second World War board games, though his favourite is The Third Reich. It's not just that he's good, either, Udo is a maverick, a true original poised to overthrow all the old norms and remake the gaming world in his own image. So he says, anyway. To start off, he has an article to write for a big American magazine.
It's hard to focus, though. With all the swimming, the tanning, the drinking, the dancing, it's a busy time for Udo and Ingeborg. There's a lot of love to be made. Bolaño is not one of the great poets of fornication, unless it's Udo who is so clinically matter-of-fact. Then, just when he's ready to settle in and work, the lovers befriended another German couple, Hanna and Charly. See what I did there, changing the tense from present to past? Bolaño does that - did that - throughout the novel. It's either very irksome or very modern. I was trying to decide, and still am.
Hanna is great. Charly, no. He drinks hard, laughs loud, swears, leers, is permanently on the verge of punching something or someone. I myself knew he was trouble from a mile off. Udo isn't far behind me, though the problem for him is that this is a novel where menaces and menacers lurk at every turn.
The Catalan sky, so red - that can't be good. The sea looks innocent enough - definitely some malignancy there, biding its time, don't you think? And then there are all the locals: Frau Else's mysterious sick husband; the strange burn victim who lives within a fortress of stacked paddleboats on the beach; the two guys nicknamed the Wolf and the Lamb, who seem friendly enough except why are they always hanging around, watching? Bolaño is a master of sowing doubt and impending disaster: Ten pages in, you'll be gnawing on your bookmark without knowing quite why.
I was pretty sure Charly was going to kill somebody. I knew he was due to disappear, from the flap, but was almost certain there would be a murder or a rape before that. I'm probably not supposed to say whether there is or isn't, so I'll go on to this: Even without any of the explicit violence that may or may not occur, The Third Reich is as unsettling a book as I've read for a long time, and as unwanderawayable. It's not the characters so much, more the mood: Bolaño wraps you up in a bond that doesn't break.
The Third Reich is a cabinet of curiosities, quandaries, puzzling riddles, not all of which you should expect to see resolved, or make even imperfect sense. For instance, all the vanishing that goes on. It's a major plot point, a pivotal one, even, when Charly disappears on his surfboard, but it also something that recurs over and over. Udo looks in a mirror and can't see himself. A character shows up looking "like a figure rubbed out with an eraser."
Everything's upended when Charly goes missing. For Udo, already, things haven't been going well with Ingeborg. His article is a bit of a mess too. On the other hand, he does have a series of powerful and ambiguous encounters with Frau Else, some of which involve frenzied furtive kissing. And he starts in on an epic game of The Third Reich with El Quemado, the man with the burns. Who is he, anyway, and what's he up to, being so good at a game he's never played before?
I'm not sure what to call The Third Reich. Existential thriller? Historical novel noir? Diary of descent into Mediterranean madness? How-not-to-holiday guidebook? It could be a skillful roman à clef portraying Bolaño's adopted home in beach-resort Catalunya. It's not quite a whodunit, though - maybe more of a whatjusthappened. Whatever it is, it's compelling in a way that brings to mind W.G. Sebald and, yes, the aforementioned Cesar Aira, who, if you haven't read him, is a craftsman of short, intense exquisitely absorbing literary artifacts that feel utterly authentic even as they mess with your expectations.
Is it constructively useful for a reader to tell characters how to live their lives? I've tried it before, with Emma Bovary and José Arcadio Buendía, and it never really seems to do any good, but still. Udo? Hey. I get the lure of the war gaming, the chess of it, the fun and the power of toying with history, rerouting it. I don't think, as some do around the beach, that you're a Nazi. What I would suggest, if I could, just to make things easier on yourself and the reader - it might help if you could work on developing a sense of humour, maybe, even just a small one.
That's all. As you were. Back to your game. Be careful. While I can't be sure whether the burned man wants to kill you or just attack your forces via Dieppe and Calais, watch out, danger's near.
Stephen Smith is Toronto writer and critic.
***********
BOLAÑO 101
Stephen Smith
From Chile to Spain
Born in Chile, Roberto Bolaño ended up, like Udo, on Spain's Costa Brava, in the town of Blanes, north of Barcelona. That's where he died, of cirrhosis of the liver in 2003 at age 50.
Sweet literary hereafter
While he was celebrated during his lifetime in the Spanish-speaking world for books like Nazi Literature in the Americas (1996) and The Savage Detectives (1998), most of his work only started to appear in English after his death. The translation delay is part of the explanation behind Bolaño's incredibly productive afterlife. There's also the fact that his estate has American super-agent Andrew Wylie overseeing the operation. Success has come critically as well as commercially.
More to come
Bolaño left behind a brimming desk in Blanes. He wrote The Third Reich in the 1980s, longhand, in notebooks. Before his death, he'd corrected and started to transcribe the book to computer, according to Madrid's El Mundo. Next up, in Spanish, another never-seen novel called The Troubles of the Real Policeman.
War and war games
Bolaño knew his Second World War, apparently, and he was himself a devoted war-gamer; his collection, which includes The Third Reich, is still at the house in Blanes. He could lose himself in battles for days, friends recall. Also, he drank a lot of tea with honey while he worked. An altogether great guy is what friends say, and very, very funny.

Lawrence Park luxury, minus the stairs

Author: Yu, Sydnia

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/lawrence-park-luxury-minus-stairs/docview/923179749/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: All models still available will offer open entertaining areas, outdoor space and two ensuite bathrooms, plus some will have the additional comfort of enclosed studies, laundry rooms with sinks and casual family rooms. "It's much like what you'd get in a house, but the big difference is that everything is on one floor," says Mr. [Jim Ritchie]. "We don't have staircases, so it makes it much more efficient."

Full text:   Builders/developers: Tridel Corp. and Concert Properties
Size: 1,121 square feet and 2,879 square feet
Price: $795,000 to $2,610,000
Sales centre: 1900 Bayview Ave., north of Eglinton Avenue. Open Monday to Thursday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.; weekends and holidays from noon to 6 p.m.

Tridel Corp. and Concert Properties have launched a new condominium project in one of Toronto's most affluent neighbourhoods, with luxury residences designed to mimic the million-dollar estates that surround it in Lawrence Park.
Each suite in the nine-storey building, called Blythwood at Huntington, will have two-bedroom plans ranging between 1,000 and 3,000 square feet.
"For someone to move from a large home to a condominium ... maybe they need less bedrooms, hallways and stairways, but still want their formal living area, dining area and large master ensuite," says Jim Ritchie, senior vice-president of sales and marketing at Tridel. "At Huntington, we're trying to provide a condominium lifestyle without sacrificing what they've been accustomed to in terms of size."
The lush ravine setting of the 118-unit mid-rise - off Bayview Avenue and across from the Canadian National Institute for the Blind - may also account for the swift sale of nearly 70 per cent of the project, which is currently under construction and slated for completion by next spring
"I can't think many other communities that are actually nestled into a ravine such as we have here," says Mr. Ritchie. "In terms of brand new condominium product, we're really the only one in Lawrence Park."
All models still available will offer open entertaining areas, outdoor space and two ensuite bathrooms, plus some will have the additional comfort of enclosed studies, laundry rooms with sinks and casual family rooms. "It's much like what you'd get in a house, but the big difference is that everything is on one floor," says Mr. Ritchie. "We don't have staircases, so it makes it much more efficient."
Irpinia kitchens will have open, galley-style or U-shaped configurations with extended cabinetry, granite or quartz counters and stainless steel Energy Star appliances, plus pantries in some models.
Standard appointments will be upscale, such as nine-foot ceilings, cornice mouldings, engineered hardwood floors, porcelain tiles and broadloom carpeting. Upgraded versions of these finishes will appear in the penthouses.
Like the individual suites, Chapman Design Group will select high-calibre decor for common areas, from the pool, fitness, weight and yoga studios to the boardroom, dining room and party space with a kitchen, bar and terrace.
Nature-inspired motifs, such as leaves, branches and green hues, will be subtle reminder of the commitment to utilizing eco-friendly materials and construction practices to meet the standards set out by the Canada Green Building Council.
Local attractions include the esteemed Rosedale Golf Club, the Granite Club and Edwards Gardens, along with a mix of trendy and established boutiques, cafes and restaurants on Bayview Avenue, Eglinton Avenue and Yonge Street.
Each unit will have designated parking and a monthly fee of 56 cents per square foot.

Hemmed in by heritage

Abstract: I don't hate Toronto's proletarian architecture, by the way, or the rugged old low-rise and mid-rise industrial buildings that have survived from the past into the present - even if few are as interesting as those in, let's say, the Distillery District. It's good that developers have saved many of these elderly structures - or at least some of the better ones - from destruction by transforming them into handsome apartment and office blocks.

Full text:   A Garment District condo falls in line with its neighbours, missing the opportunity to shout
jmays@globeandmail.com
Long-time readers of this column know how I think downtown Toronto's new condominium projects should look (and too seldom do): sleek (but not entirely glassy), urbane and formally imaginative, and free of allusions to comfy, antique high styles.
In fact, they are best without references to any kind of pre-modernist styling, including that of the Victorian and Edwardian factories and warehouses standing thick on the ground in the core's former blue-collar districts.
I don't hate Toronto's proletarian architecture, by the way, or the rugged old low-rise and mid-rise industrial buildings that have survived from the past into the present - even if few are as interesting as those in, let's say, the Distillery District. It's good that developers have saved many of these elderly structures - or at least some of the better ones - from destruction by transforming them into handsome apartment and office blocks. And it's surely not entirely bad that the city's planning and urban design bureaucracy, by its insistence on "contextualism," is continuing to remind local developers and architects of what their forerunners got right a hundred years ago.
My problem with contextualism comes out of a belief that contemporary Toronto architects, while they ought to be good students of the things that have historically made cities work well, should be able to design mid-rises and high-rises without having to worry about forcing their new buildings to curtsey to old ones. Under the city's current planning regime (and also, of course, due to the conservatism of many Toronto developers), that's exactly what the architects of downtown residential stacks do worry about. The designs that result are sometimes sober and serious, but even the good ones usually lack the high visual voltage our inner-city neighbourhoods need badly.
For an example of the phenomenon I'm talking about, take the new residential project known as Fabrik Condos.
Fashioned for Menkes Developments by architect Ralph Giannone, a founding partner in the Toronto firm of Giannone Petricone Associates, in association with Giovanni A. Tassone Architects, this 16-storey, 169-unit building is slated to rise near the garment-district intersection of Spadina Avenue and Richmond Street West. The available suites range in area from 424 square feet (for a studio) up to 1,388 square feet (for three bedrooms.) Prices start under $300,000.
The Fabrik site is located in a gritty, former workshop and warehousing patch of central Toronto that the city has targeted for redevelopment since the 1990s. This encouragement of property-owners to gentrify, however, has come with a proviso: that new construction in the district sing in harmony with the old brick-and-beam structures round about. (It hasn't always done so, by the way: Residential developers have recently gotten away with multi-unit designs varying across the stylistic spectrum from a kind of awful baroque to Art Deco and some quite decent modernism.)
Menkes Developments, at least in the case of Fabrik, has tried to honour the city's architectural intentions for the zone, and Mr. Giannone has designed accordingly. The grid-like face of the building's 11-storey podium, which is framed with embossed precast concrete, is a respectful nod to all the century-old warehouse facades in the neighbourhood.
The futuristic five-storey glass box Mr. Giannone has dropped atop this podium might mitigate the factory-like plainness of the base it rests on, if it were larger or the whole building were taller. (The box, the architect told me, is meant to terminate the view from west-bound cars coming along Richmond Street.) And the polka-dot patterning of the concrete, an interesting touch that creates an appearance of what the architect calls "tough lace," might offset the machine-age solemnity of the podium, if its improbable delicacy and playfulness were allowed to infect the form.
As we have it, however, Fabrik is a studious, unsmiling work that bows in all the right directions, doesn't get above itself, and certainly doesn't shout. It promises to stay nestled down well among the older items of garment-district architecture that it imitates.
I can appreciate Mr. Giannone's energetic effort to bring Fabrik into line with the historical character of the area. It's harder for me to appreciate the politeness of the outcome.
Not every new residential building has to make a great fuss about itself, of course. But just because Toronto's main streets are dowdy and tired, and the downtown's former industrial strips are dull, developers should take every new condo-block commission as a fresh opportunity to make something terrific and freely contemporary. I am under no illusion that the development community will take my suggestion seriously. But even now, some members of it appear to have arrived at the same conclusion I've come to: that, in a city where the historical context is so pedestrian, contextualism really doesn't make a lot of sense.

Drew Skuce finds good karma in old stuff

"I like owning this business," says Drew Skuce after showing off his tidy workshop, Paradigm Shift Customs, where pieces of architectural heritage - windows, mostly - are brought back to life. "I want to have a business that's karmically sound; it should be a labour-based business versus selling products."
Located where Paris, Ont., ends and the endless checkerboard of southwestern Ontario farmers' fields begin, a great deal of good karma is generated in this 2,000-square-foot space. And the main product: expertise.
Despite his laid-back surfer's demeanour (the expression "cool beans" comes up a lot), ever-present baseball cap, and a birth certificate issued only 30 years ago, Mr. Skuce is quietly making a name for himself in heritage circles. After taking the leap into full-time restoration a little over two years ago, he's already won an award from the City of Hamilton for the Art Moderne Hambly residence (featured here in April, 2011), and he's added a few national historic sites to his growing portfolio.
Just as there are "soul surfers" who can achieve a Zen-like state on their boards while surrounded by the ocean's roar, Mr. Skuce's workshop has a meditative quality even when the power tools are screaming. Perhaps that's because the work that goes on here is of a healing nature. And despite the mortising machine, planer, joiner, router, table saw and scroll saws (one a vintage Canadian beauty from 1948), much of the time the sonic assault takes the form of the gentle tap-tap-tapping of old putty being removed from muntin bars, the sscccccc-craping of ancient paint layers, or the quiet caress of imported Swedish linseed-based paint being applied to century-old handiwork.
It's slow, methodical work that demands patience, and a respect for what came before.
Mr. Skuce learned those traits a quarter-century ago working with his grandfather, a self-employed contractor who had been building houses since the 1930s. He remembers also working alongside his mother - "she's totally into this stuff, too" - on window repair, as well as learning old house terminology by daily osmosis in an 1879 home his parents still enjoy today. "I was always jealous of my friends who had all these new houses that were awesome, while I was living in this old beat-up thing," he laughs.
That jealousy didn't last long. After studying woodworking technology at Conestoga College, he got a job installing home theatre systems in new subdivisions and quickly had a revelation: "Modern construction scares the crap out of me!" he says with a laugh. "Yes, I'm sure it's probably to code, but I've seen two-by-four walls fall over on some sites, and then there are these old homes where you'd swear you could let off a small nuclear weapon and you'd just scratch the paint."
By 2005, while working as manager of a big box hardware/automotive store, he started Paradigm Shift Customs part-time. "No one was taking care of this stuff," he says, his voice rising just a little. "The whole idea is just 'rip it out, replace it, new is better, old is garbage,' but then I realized if old is garbage, how come it lasts 130 years, and the new stuff, you're lucky if it lasts 10 or 20?"
It's not uncommon to find a window that's well over 130 years at the shop. Currently, a large 1840s residential window rescued from a local demolition site sits at the back of the finishing room. Because of the handmade manganese cylinder glass and delicate muntin bars, it will be donated to the Paris museum after being fully restored.
Recently completed cylinder glass windows for a client's 1850 home in Waterdown await delivery in another room. Since cylinder glass isn't manufactured in North America any longer, Mr. Skuce had it shipped over from France. It costs more, he says, but purists want the imperfections - blemishes, rake-marks, waves and air bubbles - that never appear in modern float glass. "I love cylinder glass because the house sparkles when you drive by it," he offers.
Speaking of drive-bys, tall racks house an ever-changing 'parts bin' of items picked up on garbage nights by Mr. Skuce and employee Barry McClelland, including doors (which they repair also), crumbling wooden window frames, dusty panes of glass, wonky 1950s aluminum storms and bits of metal hardware.
Of course, always in house at PSC is passionate conversation. Topics this day include: this is a "never gets boring" business because it combines "arts and design, chemistry and water management;" that restoration-types feel trapped in a race against the "vinyl pirates;" and that some people still don't realize a restored wooden window and storm [windows] is "just as energy efficient as anything on the market now."
Hopefully, Mr. Skuce's next endeavour, a series of workshops for handy homeowners and contractors (check his website, paradigmshiftcustoms.com, in the spring) will debunk a few myths while spreading the passion.
In the meantime, his profile will rise, one house at a time. "I would love to be able to show my grandkids some really cool stuff someday; I don't want it all shredded apart by the guys doing renovations, the guys doing window replacements," says Mr. Skuce.
"I want to be proud of it, I want to show where we came from."

The question My husband and I like a warm destination with a good beach, but what we really want is good food. Where can we skip the buffet line?
THE ANSWER
We've all done our time in Caribbean all-inclusive buffet queues where somehow everything tastes the same. So let's forgo the all-you-can-eat and sample what's simmering under the corrugated tin roofs.
You can find these sidewalk kitchens across the islands - just ask a reputable taxi driver to take you to a local favourite, says Anne Brobyn, a real-estate tourism expert with Hibiscus International, who has travelled extensively and worked throughout the region.
Jamaica, she says, combines both your craving for good beaches and authentic cuisine. Dining at local stands is cheap to boot - often for as little as $5 a meal.
"Expect sides of roasted breadfruit or corn, some ackee and sweet treats, such as tamarind balls and raw sugar cane," says Brobyn. "Wash it all down with a local beer, Irish moss [a seaweed drink] or a soursop."
Eating at these slow-cooking stands will both satiate your appetite and offer time with locals and island culture. And a note on food fears: "I've never gotten sick from roadside eating so my experiences have all been very positive," Brobyn says. Here are her picks for five memorable roadside eateries across Jamaica:
Port Antonio: To the north of Boston Beach, there is an alley known for its jerk stands. "Also located at the end of this alley is Great Huts (greathuts.com), a unique village resort with Rock's Café," she says. "Great food."
Southwest Jamaica: Here, find Billy's Grassy Park, one of the most famous roadside eateries near Middle Quarters, St. Elizabeth. "Known for his shrimp - curried, peppered, fried and in one of the most delicious soups I've ever tasted."
Negril: Track down Ras Rody's (rasrody.com) for his excellent vegetarian and organic food sold under a thatched roof.
Ocho Rios: Settle into Miss T's Kitchen (misstskitchen.com) in the heart of the city. "It's a rustic restaurant located in a pretty garden setting," Brobyn says. "It features colourful decor and amazing food."
Falmouth: Plantations are another way to experience the island's cuisine, such as at Good Hope Country House (goodhopejamaica.com), which overlooks the Martha Brae River and the Cockpit Mountains. You can stay at this restored sugar plantation that features a beautiful 18th-century home, orchards of exotic fruit trees, trails, horse riding and, of course, Jamaican cuisine. If you just want a sample, Chukka Caribbean Adventures (chukkacaribbean.com) offers tours and gourmet lunches here, Brobyn says.

Hip spots and doughnuts in the Downtown Eastside

Author: Bailey, Ian

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/hip-spots-doughnuts-downtown-eastside/docview/922027406/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "I don't think it's scary like it was," said Ian Tostenson, president of the BC Restaurant and Foodservices Association. "If you go there, you will find it's charming. It really is - good food. And it's safe. I mean, I'm not saying you go down the back alleys, but I wouldn't go down the back alleys of Granville Street for God's sake."

Full text:   To Jordan Cash, it isn't crazy to sell $3 doughnuts in the Downtown Eastside, one of Canada's poorest, most chaotic neighbourhoods.
They're cheaper by the dozen - $27 - and inspired by the cutting-edge products of such U.S. innovators as Top Pot Doughnuts in Seattle and Voodoo Doughnuts in Portland. The concept of Mr. Cash's Cartems Donuterie, which opened this week at Hastings and Carrall, came in a dream, but there has been nothing dreamy about his Downtown Eastside commitment.
"I like the location. There's a lot of visibility here," said the 33-year-old University of British Columbia MBA grad, who has developed a doughnut line that includes products topped with white chocolate glaze, organic coconut shavings, shaved parmesan and fresh pepper. "We think you can do pulled pork on a doughnut if you want," said Mr. Cash, who did his product development in his Mount Pleasant kitchen.
By about 2:30 p.m. on Day 2 of business this week, he was sold out of doughnuts snatched up by a tide of customers, many of whom did not appear to be Eastside residents. "The changes in this neighbourhood - stunning," said one.
Cartems is the latest example of an improbable evolution in Eastside history that's seen low rents in historic buildings draw cutting-edge eateries into the troubled neighbourhood, home to thousands of intravenous drug users.
One customer put the point succinctly. "Hipsters don't have the money to move into those really nice areas," said Frank Halpern, a 28-year-old from Miami, visiting Vancouver for the fourth time.
Mr. Halpern works in real estate, fixing and flipping distressed assets. He found the Eastside mild compared with the blighted U.S neighbourhoods he is used to, but said there is a cross-border dynamic at play.
"Down where I am from in the areas that would be considered shady, there are new eateries, kind of organic places. Younger people are moving in there because they are the only places they will have the opportunity to even start a business," he said.
In Vancouver, around the corner from Cartems, there's Sean Heather's slick new pub, Bitter, which pays tribute to the city's beer culture. Mr. Cash's neighbour is Calabash Bistro, serving Caribbean cuisine. Nearby, there's the rejuvenated Save-On Meats diner and Acme Cafe. In all, there are at least half a dozen such spots in the new community of cool.
While work continues on dealing with its social challenges, the Downtown Eastside is facing the prospect of a kind of creeping gentrification on the food front. It has been fuelled by forces that include new residents of the Woodward's development, and the growing sense that the area is freshly appealing to some in the Lower Mainland who might previously have avoided it.
"I don't think it's scary like it was," said Ian Tostenson, president of the BC Restaurant and Foodservices Association. "If you go there, you will find it's charming. It really is - good food. And it's safe. I mean, I'm not saying you go down the back alleys, but I wouldn't go down the back alleys of Granville Street for God's sake."
One of the owners of Calabash, which opened in 2010, says some "definitely scared" customers come in and leave by cab to avoid too much Eastside exposure, but they do make the effort.
"I think everyone is quite nicely surprised once they start coming here more often," said Sam Willocks. He opened Calabash in the area with his partners, partly because the PHS Community Service Society - which runs the neighbourhood's safe-injection site, among other social programs - was offering a good deal on a main floor and basement in a 1904-era building, enough room for a 70-seat restaurant.
"The local neighbourhood and area is inviting," he said. "Maybe at first glance it's not, but people are nice."
Mr. Cash seemed taken aback by a question about whether customers from outside the area might be averse to checking his place out. "I've never felt really afraid in this area. Anybody I have talked to has said it's just a matter of everybody co-existing," he said.
Asked about trouble in the neighbourhood, he said he hasn't yet had any problems aside from some customers, smelling of alcohol, who came in for doughnuts, but paid and left.
His peers in the area are largely giving back to the community in some way. Options for Mr. Cash include handing out free doughnuts at the end of the day.
Tsur Somerville, director of the UBC Centre for Urban Economics and Real Estate, is surprised the shift has taken so long because the Downtown Eastside has access to downtown Vancouver and historic buildings that are appealing for redevelopment. He said it's part of a developing "true urban culture - the willingness to rub shoulders with grittiness. Cities change without policy releases from the director of planning."
Yet cities have to manage that change. Vision Vancouver Councillor Andrea Reimer, who has lived and worked in the area, said the renewed vibrancy is consistent with her memories of a more varied mix of businesses there. The city, she notes, is early on in a Downtown Eastside planning process to deal with the issues arising from change.
"Economic activity is good for jobs," she said. "It's good for keeping streetscapes alive and allows more low-margin businesses like the lower-end eateries the opportunity to survive because it's drawing enough people in that they can do the volume they need to survive. ..."
Mr. Cash has big plans. He eventually hopes to deliver his doughnuts by bike. "I want to be on the bike every day," he said.
Whether or not his company survives, he expects the dynamic that accommodated Cartem will stick. "You're always going to see, in this area, hip sorts of restaurants and things of that nature popping up."

Prior to the recent grand opening of a new luxury residence in downtown Aurora, the Kaitlin Group was well aware if its imminent popularity given the interest buyers showed once preview sales began last year.
"Sixty per cent of the building was sold in three days basically, so that demonstrated a huge demand for these units," says vice-president Gary Daniell. "There's really no other condo like it in the area."
Only 74 units will be constructed in the six-storey development, which was dubbed Centro to underscore the importance of its location at Yonge and Centre streets, just a block north of Wellington Street.
"We have a Yonge Street address, so you can walk to the GO train [station] and walk to all the coffee shops, various shops and boutiques on Yonge Street," says Mr. Daniell. "So our location is very important to the site."
Locals in particular gravitate to the project that is surrounded by community centres, parks, walking trails and golf courses. Those seeking big city amenities can also reach Toronto is less than 30 minutes via Highway 404 nearby or commute to Union Station in 40 minutes by train.
Or without exiting the modern, classic pre-cast, stone and glass building, residents will have easy access to retail and dining ventures at street level, a private lobby with concierge, a pet mudroom, second-floor party room, boardroom and fully-equipped gym.
"We're a very upscale, boutique-style condominium with executive concierge," adds Mr. Daniell.
On the floors above, units will have one- or two-bedroom plans with or without dens, and large outdoor space up to 200 square feet.
"Being on Yonge Street, we wanted to make sure the building is stepped back from Yonge, so architecturally, it looks spectacular," Mr. Daniell explains. "We also felt that it was important today to enjoy the outdoors and have outdoor space, and it's very unique to have these great outdoors on a Yonge Street location."
Another rarity in conventional buildings will be 10-foot ceilings and eight-foot doors on the second, third and sixth floors, and nine-foot ceilings and seven-foot doors on remaining levels.
"All the units have massive windows and high ceilings, which make these units very open and spacious feeling," says Mr. Daniell. "The finishes are as high-end as you can go."
Bryon Patton and Associates steered the styling direction, selecting a variety of lavish materials such as hardwood flooring, marble bathroom tiles and frameless glass shower stalls, as well as granite and quartz kitchen counters and under-cabinet lighting and valances.
To ensure a healthy and cost-effective environment, green features will range from energy-efficient windows, Energy Star appliances and individually metered utilities in each suite to a bike storage area and tri-sorter chute system for waste, recycling and organics in the building.
Suites larger than 885-square-feet will get underground rather than surface parking, and monthly fees will be 40 cents per square foot.
Occupancy is slated for December, 2013.

A 'hood on the rise

Author: Ireland, Carolyn

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/hood-on-rise/docview/921710519/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: There is a real Dovercourt Park at the centre of this 'hood north of Bloor, south of Dupont and loosely between Dufferin and Ossington - depending on who's sketching the boundaries. On some real estate maps it's also known as Dovercourt-Wallace Emerson.

Full text:   With cool new shops opening virtually every week, the former village of Dovercourt has a lot going for it
Among Toronto neighbourhoods, Dovercourt Park is something of an unsung hero.
Neither seedy enough to attract rising chefs with cult followings, nor gentrified enough to send real estate values out of sight, it's long been a stalwart area where immigrants find a community, twentysomethings are able to rent a decent apartment, and first-time buyers can purchase a semi and fix it up.
Mention the name in passing, and many Torontonians have trouble picturing it on a map.
But there is a real Dovercourt Park at the centre of this 'hood north of Bloor, south of Dupont and loosely between Dufferin and Ossington - depending on who's sketching the boundaries. On some real estate maps it's also known as Dovercourt-Wallace Emerson.
In years past, the neighbourhood developed a stolid, lunch-bucket character as industrial plants set up close to the Canadian Pacific Railway line just north of Dupont and Portuguese and Italian immigrant workers moved onto the side streets to the south.
Today a few automotive businesses linger, but most of the heavy industry is gone.
The stretch of Bloor Street known as Bloorcourt hasn't become as cool as the more westerly strip heading towards Lansdowne, and a former draw - the Paradise Cinema - has closed its doors. As of yet, no corner bank building has reopened as a Starbucks on this bit of Bloor to signal a neighbourhood on the rise. But cool new places seem to be opening virtually every week: The transformation of Dovercourt Park is happening at a fast clip.
High marks
* Genuine village provenance: Today's residential streets were farmers fields when the village of Dovercourt was founded in 1870. The notable Toronto family the Denisons were the landed gentry who rented out plots to tenant farmers and the area was named after their clan's estate, Dover Court. In the early 1900s, the area was annexed by York and then the City of Toronto in turn.
* Bloor/Gladstone library: "It's always jam-packed," says one regular patron of this branch of the Toronto Public Library. The original portion is a designated heritage building built in 1913. A highly-lauded 9,000 square-foot addition has such 21st century elements as a glass curtain wall and green roof.
* Transit: It's an easy stroll along the side streets to the Bloor subway line, which whisks passengers between the Ossington and Yonge stations in about 10 minutes. The Dufferin bus route also runs right along the west border.
* Dovercourt Boys and Girls Club: The club situated along one edge of the park provides after-school programs for kids. Since this is an area with lower-than-average incomes, it's a good community resource.
Room for improvement
* Streetscape: The houses of Dovercourt Park have never really been known for their architectural details. First it was tar paper that covered the shacks of recent arrivals from England. Then Portuguese immigrants introduced angel brick. There's a fair amount of siding. You get the idea. On the upside for apartment-hunters, many of the larger dwellings have been divided up.
* Schools: Dovercourt Junior Public School has recently leapt ahead in the standardized tests of elementary schools. Since many parents choose a neighbourhood by the quality of its schools, this improvement is good for real estate values. St. Anthony Catholic School has some catching up to do in the rankings. Bloor Collegiate Institute and St. Mary's Catholic Separate School also lag the top contenders.
* Restaurants: There could be an opportunity here for adventurous chefs. Members of the Ethiopian community have opened several restaurants and they tend to get the crowds in, but denizens of the area say there's room for broader choice. For years now, Universal Grill has made a destination of Dupont and Shaw.
Harbingers of change
The Rustic Owl is a new spot for coffee and treats with friendly people behind the counter and a gallery in the back.
People rave about the ice cream sandwiches at Bakerbots, where they bake their own cookies and fill them with delectable flavours from Ed's Real Scoop.
John's El Cafecito appears to be a virtual office for many of its regulars. They also sell artisanal crafts.
Drift is the place for hangover poutine around noon, beer, liquor and board games into the evening.
Freedom Clothing Collective is a favourite boutique for anyone who needs an original gift or has a bit of spare time to peruse the garments and jewelry from local designers.
Hollow Ground Barber Shop is an old school barber shop refitted into a retro building by a young crew.
Market values
In the current hot market, eye-popping asking prices above $900,000 are appearing on the large, fully renovated houses. More typical dwellings are semi-detached, with some row houses and condos added to the mix. In the recent past, a lot of the housing stock has changed hands in the more affordable $350,000 to $500,000 range, which makes the area a draw for first-time buyers. Church-to-loft conversions have been popular with buyers and builders continue to buy up every old pile of bricks they can get their hands on.

Bringing the farm back to the city

Author: Ireland, Carolyn

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/bringing-farm-back-city/docview/921710478/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: In the fascinating Ravine City concept, designers Chris Hardwicke and Hai Ho envision a plan that connects food-producing gardens to Toronto's ravines and rivers. The plan proposes to restore some of the natural ravines that have been destroyed or subsumed over the years. Toronto projects include the Artscape Wychwood Barns, Evergreen Brick Works and the Carrot Green Roof garden at Carrot Common.

Full text:   Authors offer some creative strategies for urban agriculture that will delight locavore movement
Carrot City
Creating Places for Urban Agriculture
By Mark Gorgolewski, June Komisar and Joe Nasr.
The Monacelli Press
240 pages
$60
How can we make cities into better places for growing food?
That's the central question of Carrot City , and the authors present some very creative strategies for bringing agriculture back to urban settings.
Mark Gorgolewski and June Komisar are architects who also teach at Toronto's Ryerson University. Joe Nasr is a lecturer on urban food security and author of Urban Agriculture: Food, Jobs and Sustainable Cities .
While activists and grass-roots food movements currently command a lot of attention, the authors point out that architects and academics - LeCorbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright among them - have spent years pondering the potential of urban agriculture.
Carrot City is a learned book, which offers readers a mix of seemingly utopian visions and real-life case studies. It includes work by professionals in architecture, industrial design, sculpture, landscape architecture and urban planning.
Planning at the neighbourhood scale can facilitate the introduction of agriculture into high-density, high-rise urban areas, the authors argue.
Because the book had its genesis at Ryerson's Department of Architectural Science, Toronto is well represented here. But there are also projects from Vancouver, Montreal, New York and Chicago. There are lessons to be learned in The Netherlands, Britain and China. One case study takes readers inside a community greenhouse in Inuvik and discusses not only the food production, but how it creates social bonds.
In the fascinating Ravine City concept, designers Chris Hardwicke and Hai Ho envision a plan that connects food-producing gardens to Toronto's ravines and rivers. The plan proposes to restore some of the natural ravines that have been destroyed or subsumed over the years. Toronto projects include the Artscape Wychwood Barns, Evergreen Brick Works and the Carrot Green Roof garden at Carrot Common. One of the most interesting case studies documents artist Fritz Haeg's series of gardens that replace "water-hungry, pesticide-dependent" lawns with an edible landscape.
"The gardens are purposely located in places calculated to serve as a vivid contrast to their surroundings - surprise and shock are anticipated reactions and are intended to generate interest and curiosity about the transformations."
In Manhattan, the Vinegar Factory has a greenhouse on the rooftop for growing the greens, berries and figs that are sold in the marketplace below.
Gorgolewski, Komisar and Nasr say many of the architectural students they have encountered in recent years have grown up thinking about the environment and sustainability.
Gardeners, local food advocates, planners, architects and other readers of Carrot City are sure to find inspiration for even more creative ideas.
The book leaves little doubt that the locavore movement is much more than just a short-lived foodie trend.

LISTING AGENTS
Julie Kinnear and Holly Chandler, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
The Action: A busy open house and bookings for about 40 private showings were early indications that this two-bedroom corner suite would sell quickly in the East Lofts residence just a few blocks east of the St. Lawrence Market. A bully bid submitted prior to the offer date was thwarted by another offering $38,100 more than the list price.
What They Got: On the fourth floor of a relatively new building designed by architect Peter Clewes, this 900 square-foot suite features two balconies and two bedrooms separated by a central living and dining area and an open, galley kitchen.
* Stainless steel appliances, Caesarstone quartz counters and hardwood floors give the interior a luxurious feel, while exposed ductwork, concrete walls and ceilings and sandblasted glass bedroom doors provided a loft-like look.
* The unit comes with two full bathrooms, including a master ensuite off the dressing area, stacked laundry facilities, an extra-large locker and underground parking.
* Each month, $417 covers an assortment of costs, from heating and water to upkeep of a party room. Local attractions include restaurants, theatres and galleries on Front Street and in the Distillery District.
The Agent's Take: "It had a great layout with a split bedroom plan," says agent Holly Chandler. "It was a really stylish, updated suite and it had a double locker made into one."
The suite was also a popular hot spot in several ways. "Being able to have the doors open to the two balconies, you get this amazing cross breeze in the summer," Ms. Chandler adds. "It's accessible to everything and there is a cool neighbourhood vibe around that area."

Full text: To some churches are prime real estate, but to me they are an essential part of a caring community
A new sign has recently gone up on the outside wall of a local church: "Sales office now open."
"What a great idea," my neighbour said. "Condos in place of empty pews. And who really still goes to church any more?" The tone of her voice implied: "Who believes in all that stuff and wants to sit through boring sermons when sleep or shops beckon?"
"Wait a minute," I wanted to say. "Not all church services put you to sleep - some wake you up." But I said nothing. I hesitated in my timid convictions, my beliefs whirling around and unable to land in a simple sentence.
Maybe churches are following in the path of one-room schoolhouses - the structures still there but the reason for their existence changed. It's almost quaint now to go to church, and those of us who do attend are mainly seniors like me, or young parents with their children.
My husband and I met each other at a United Church young people's group. In our day, no further description was needed. But where are the young people today?
I remember going to our church in Toronto 30 years ago when every seat was taken. Often churches held two services. In our neighbourhood, we all went to church; it was what everybody did, just as we all ate roast beef and mashed potatoes for Sunday dinner. Our four children joined their friends at Sunday school and heard the ancient stories.
When we retired and moved to Vancouver, we lived in False Creek. At the time, it was known to have the lowest church attendance in the country. In lotus land, we revelled in our seawall strolls beside the pounding ocean with its changing light, the North Shore Mountains beyond often shrouded in mist like a painting from the Sung Dynasty. Our habit of going to church changed to a habit of sleeping in and reading the Sunday papers.
A year later, tragedy struck when we lost two beloved family members. After their memorial service, our need for comfort and understanding brought us through the church doors again.
The main Sunday service was referred to as the worship service. For some reason, this description never seemed right to me. I wanted to be there not to worship but to sit in a place of serenity where I could listen and respond to what seemed important in my life. During the sermons I often found myself studying the light patterns on the ceiling of the sanctuary, or planning my dinner.
But slowly, tiny seeds began to grow with feelings that I wanted to believe in something greater than myself; I wanted my life to matter. This Vancouver church held a Thursday morning breakfast group, about 20 of us if we could all attend. We discussed ideas, books, current events and our own beliefs and doubts in an atmosphere of fun, encouragement and community. This group was a stepping point on my continuous path toward understanding. Those special needs of "belonging" and "becoming" were nurtured.
Now we are living again in Toronto, in the Beaches area, for once you have lived by the water, it is hard to live anywhere else. We are surrounded by pleasant parks and a distant vista of the city skyline, often outlined by the setting sun.
While walking along the boardwalk one day, I realized I missed being part of a caring community - forgotten in the moving and excitement of new beginnings. We decided to try a church again.
Now, every Sunday morning, we drive along the Lake Shore, passing our chameleon lake - silver, charcoal, blue. We turn north, passing century-old brick buildings, once the centre of commercial activity. We weave our way past mansions with living rooms that now host banks or convenience stores. The streets are usually deserted except for the homeless huddling around a shelter's doors, or pushing their life's belongings in shopping carts.
It is hard not to feel that this drive is a prelude, an overture to church. I carry the city scene with me, its beauty, history, sorrows and struggles.
You might see our new church as an island, comfortable and aloof from Toronto's cares. But here is a church of connection, compassion, learning and action, a place for community, acceptance and service. On a recent morning our minister hoped we might find peace and rest and wonderment there.
In our family we have a sister who is a Carmelite nun, and among our grown children, one who converted to Judaism, one who is a member of the Toronto Meditation group, one who is agnostic and one who is a Christmas-and-Easter church attendee. Just as we can choose many different roads to arrive at our church, there are so many routes we can choose to arrive at the same place of inner peace. We feel lucky to live in this multicultural city of diversity and choices.
Church buildings may be changing but church services are changing, too. We still learn from the ancient texts but also from the wisdom of modern writers and poets and musicians. We ask questions and sometimes have no answers.
Our church competes with the malls, arenas and rinks, but it offers stillness, a place apart where we can try to discover our best selves and leave a little lighter for the week ahead.
There is still an old sign on the wall of our church, but its message is renewed each week: "Welcome!"

Full text: It's the end of an era as the iconic nightlife hub makes way for a condo
The Toronto nightlife scene is losing a legend: Bistro 990, one of Yorkville's longest-standing institutions, is set to close. General manager Victor Magalhaes confirmed yesterday that "the building has been bought, but the business has not." The new owner of 990, 994 and 1000 Bay St. is Cresford Development, a local company that will soon break ground on a 400-unit condo complex in that space. "At this point we have no indication of exactly when we will be closing," says Mr. Magalhaes, but for the party people who once clamored for a table at Bistro, it's safe to say this marks the end of an era.
Opened in 1986 by Tom Kristenbrun, Bistro 990 (so named for its enviable address) quickly became a clubhouse for the rich and famous (along with the currently incarcerated - Conrad Black was a regular, so was Garth Drabinsky). It is often hard to pinpoint exactly why some restaurants work while others fail, but in the case of Bistro 990, that old real-estate standard held spectacularly true: location, location, location.
At that time, The Sutton Place Hotel (which also announced its sale and soon-to-be-condos status this week) was TIFF ground zero and Bistro was just a hop, skip and a stumble across the street, making it a natural habitat for the likes of Denzel Washington, Sean Connery, Sharon Stone and just about every other celebrity ever to set a Manolo-clad foot in our fair city.
"It was the place," says Jeanne Beker. The Fashion Television host and institution in her own right has fond memories of martini-drenched lunch dates ("the kind that went well into the afternoon") stretching back to the nineties. That, and Bistro's popular salad niçoise, which, at the time, was a menu revelation.
"You have to remember that, back when Bistro 990 opened, Toronto had yet to undergo its bistro-ization," says John Macfarlane, who was the editor in chief at Toronto Life for most of the nineties and remembers when eating steak frites came with a certain cachet: "There were hardly any French restaurants in the city when they opened - if there was a better one, I can't think of it."
Starting in the late nineties and continuing to 2006, Toronto Life launched its annual Fiction Issue in Bistro's upstairs party space.
In the early nineties, after TIFF had become a major A-list draw, but before luxury hotels and high-end restaurants were commonplace, Bistro 990 offered one-stop shopping for star-gazers. "It made my job a lot easier," says celebrity photographer George Pimentel, who nowadays has to send staffers north, south and west on the festival's bigger nights.
Mr. Pimentel recalls how the strict "no cameras" policy (one of the things that made Bistro such a draw for the famous and flashbulb-weary) could mean logging serious hours in the adjacent alleyway. On one particular night in 1995 he waited five hours, hoping to catch a rising "it" boy named Quentin Tarantino, fresh off the mega success of Pulp Fiction .
During the same TIFF visit, the fast-talking Mr. Tarantino, seated at one of Bistro 990's best tables, became besotted with a doe-eyed blonde named Mira Sorvino, who would be his girlfriend for the next three years. Quite a few passions were sparked under Bistro's golden (and oh-so-flattering) lights: Jeanne Beker had a first date there that led to an eight-year relationship; Goldie Hawn famously stormed out following a lovers' quarrel with Kurt Russell.
As recently as 2006, Bistro was still very much the place. A fête for All The Kings' Men drew cast members Sean Penn, Jude Law, Kate Winslet and James Gandolfini as well as other boldfaces such as Nicole Kidman and the now defunct Demi and Ashton, many of whom had to escape out of the back entrance to avoid a frenzied mob.
But of course, all glam things must come to an end. When the Sutton Place ceased acting as temporary headquarters for the film festival during those 10 days in September, the hotel was no longer the default hot spot to stay. As celebs began to spread out in Yorkville, staying at the Four Seasons and the Park Hyatt instead, Bistro's pre-eminent status faded. Now with its home base on King Street, the festival's "it" spots have moved southward; last year, a pop-up restaurant, Soho House on Duncan Street, was the place to be and be seen.
From a culinary standpoint, Bistro 990 had long fallen off the city's best restaurant lists - some critics say the food had faltered, but it was also a simple case of supply-and-demand. "We used to joke that Toronto had a bank on every corner. Now you could almost say the same thing about bistros," jokes Mr. Macfarlane.
That may be true, but you can bet that this Bistro will go out with a bang.
Mr. Magalhaes says the staff have already started planning what is sure to be one hell of a goodbye bash. "We started in 1986, so that's the era that we're going to go back to," he says. Eighties party!

Abstract: "One thing that's typical of this building is that unit sizes are quite large, and this is reflective of many older buildings," agent [Christopher Bibby] said. "The den was large enough to be a second bedroom, and in most cases, it's the size of a master suite in most one-plus-one [units] that you find on the market these days."

The Action: More than two dozen buyers were allowed private access to this one-bedroom-plus-den suite in The Morgan in the Fashion District.
What They Got: On the fifth floor of a nearly decade-old residence, this more-than-800-square-foot suite was stylishly dressed with ceramic flooring in the galley-like kitchen, broadloom in the bedroom and laminate in the enclosed den and combined living and dining room, which has a balcony.
* Modern appointments include a nine-foot ceiling, stainless steel kitchen appliances and laundry machines, plus a four-piece bathroom.
* There is a monthly fee of $457, plus heat and hydro. A gym, theatre and party room are on site, as well as a rooftop deck with a barbecue, visitor parking and 24-hour concierge.
* Local amenities include popular shops, eateries and clubs in the Entertainment District and Chinatown, as well as public transit and new Loblaws on Portland Street.
The Agent's Take: "One thing that's typical of this building is that unit sizes are quite large, and this is reflective of many older buildings," agent Christopher Bibby said. "The den was large enough to be a second bedroom, and in most cases, it's the size of a master suite in most one-plus-one [units] that you find on the market these days."
Attractions in and around the building also puts it highly in demand. "It was far ahead of its time when it was built ... first of all, it has one of the most interesting lobbies with a spiral staircase that leads up to the amenities," Mr. Bibby said. "It's a great little hub trapped within so many different neighbourhoods."

A modest Modernism wins out over faux Victorian

Author: John Bentley Mays

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/modest-modernism-wins-out-over-faux-victorian/docview/920783000/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The three palettes of materials and colours were created by the Toronto-based international design firm of Cecconi Simone. One is white, sleek, shimmering. Another (showcased at Block's sales centre) is very dark with a few light accents - a dramatic, sharp scheme that's pitched to more design-savvy homeowners. Purchasers with tamer inclinations may find the third version to their liking: It's mainly taupe, but it still has flair rarely seen in Hogtown's housing salesrooms.

Full text: New townhouse project opens up fresh space for thoroughly citified couples
jmays@globeandmail.com
Of all the posh houses by Toronto architects I have reviewed in this column and elsewhere, the ones I have been meanest about are by Richard Wengle. I don't like the stuffy pastiches of defunct historical languages he has set down in Forest Hill.
But recently - long after deciding that nothing good would ever come out of his office - I discovered that Mr. Wengle has devised something considerably better than the single-family fare he usually gives to his clientele. It's a townhouse complex in downtown Toronto called Block. This project is hardly stunning, but its modest modernism is likable, sincere and urbane. Not for the first time, I've been surprised by an architect I thought I had all figured out.
Designed for Treasure Hill Developments and slated to go up in Little Italy, Block will contain 37 freehold townhouses priced at between $900,000 and $1.7-million, with most for sale around $1-million. The units range in area from 2,647 square feet to about 3,700 square feet, and feature three to five bedrooms. At only 14 feet wide, the townhouses are narrow, but ceiling heights are generous: 10 feet on the main floor, nine on the floors above.
Taking into account Block's upmarket prices, ample sizes, and modernist credentials, it's easy to guess the profiles of the homebuyers Block will probably attract.
Some will surely be empty-nesters. But more than a few, I suspect, will be high-earning young professionals who have learned to love big-city living and style in the new condominium towers at the urban core.
These people will be at the stage in life when they want families, but they won't want to give up the efficiency and convenience they've enjoyed in high-density contemporary circumstances. The best thing about Block is the fresh space it opens up for thoroughly citified couples - at least those with lots of money - ready to start and raise families near Toronto's cultural heart.
Mr. Wengle's exterior treatments have been crafted with such customers in mind. Composed of glass, black manganese brick, limestone, light stucco and pre-cast concrete, the street-side fronts of the three-level, flat-roofed buildings have been inspired by the squared-off angularity and clean visual rhythm of European multi-unit modernism. But they also say "home" in ways that Torontonians will immediately recognize - with little gardens and short flights of steps and shallow porches. (Each house also has a 30-foot back yard.)
I was interested to learn from developer Nick Fidei, head of Treasure Hill, that the earliest version of Block, by another architect, was quite different from what Mr. Wengle came up with. Mr. Fidei had originally planned to bring us yet another clump of townhouses in a faux-Victorian style - surely the most trite, tired architectural tendency at work on the low-rise end of Toronto's housing boom. He was persuaded by serious market research to abandon visiting this blight on the city, and he accordingly commissioned Richard Wengle's much fresher exterior design.
The developer's new-found commitment to up-tempo modernist styling is also apparent in Block's open-plan interiors. While some local suppliers of new residential units give consumers choices (all bland) about the look of their suites, Mr. Fidei is laying before his potential clients a range of finishes that are simply cooler than usual.
The three palettes of materials and colours were created by the Toronto-based international design firm of Cecconi Simone. One is white, sleek, shimmering. Another (showcased at Block's sales centre) is very dark with a few light accents - a dramatic, sharp scheme that's pitched to more design-savvy homeowners. Purchasers with tamer inclinations may find the third version to their liking: It's mainly taupe, but it still has flair rarely seen in Hogtown's housing salesrooms.
The market for new low-rise residences, of course, will be the ultimate judge of Toronto's readiness to embrace Block and the kind of unshowy modernism it represents. Anna Simone, principal in Cecconi Simone, believes the judgment will be favourable to what she and Mr. Wengle have done here. "The condo market has created a taste for modern design," she told me recently, apropos Block - a taste other low-rise developers will have to reckon with and serve.
I hope Ms. Simone is right. But, at least for now, the choice facing a young Torontonian ready to graduate from high-rise loft to family-sized dwelling is unfortunately simple. It's either go to suburbia, or stay downtown and buy an old house, or get one of those fake-old jobs that have sprung up across the city in recent years. I hope downtown developers will follow Mr. Fidei's lead and give design-conscious, family-minded couples the modern housing options they don't have now.

In last week's column, I incorrectly reported that Richard Witt is joining Quadrangle Architects as a partner. Mr. Witt will be a principal in the firm.

Full text: WINDSOR / Onetime heart of Canada's manufacturing sector felt recession deeper and earlier than rest of country - and many are giving up on Windsor with its shrinking population, rising unemployment and falling fortunes
In the year that Annie Picotte, 38, has lived in Windsor, she's figured out the routes from her subsidized townhouse to two places: the grocery store and the unemployment office.
Come July, she will take her 12-year-old son and abandon those well-worn paths for a construction job in Alberta. Like many others, she has found a solution to her local unemployment problem: leaving Windsor.
Census data released on Wednesday showed Windsor is one of Canada's only major cities with a shrinking population. It fell by 1.3 per cent, a major tumble considering the population grew by 5 per cent in the previous census period.
The city that was once the heart of Canada's manufacturing sector felt the strain of the recession deeper and earlier than the rest of the country did. As thousands of manufacturing jobs dried up - especially on automobile-assembly lines - the city's unemployed ranks swelled.
Windsor's mayor and chamber of commerce say the city has rebuilt with a burgeoning renewable energy industry, new public-infrastructure projects and a campaign to become a retirement destination, but the unemployment rate (at 10.3 per cent in January, the highest in the country) tells a different story. The new jobs are not meeting the demands of residents, so some have taken their searches to other cities.
In the past month, Chris Johnson has made three trips to the city recruiting for his agency, Oilfield Job Connections. He sees Windsorites, some of whom had long careers in manufacturing, as labourers who could handle the grind of an Albertan oil rig.
"We're not looking for the person who can type 100 words per minute," Mr. Johnson said. "We're looking for heavy labour."
The project has already sent about 40 people from London, Ont., out west. Workers pay a $2,975 fee to cover training, airfare to Alberta and accommodation until their first paycheque, and a full-time job is guaranteed.
Alberta's construction boom has drawn Ms. Picotte. The single mother, who is trained as a forklift operator, headed to Windsor in late 2010 when she heard a public infrastructure project - the Windsor-Essex Parkway - would create many jobs. Because she did not have her driver's licence or her high-school diploma, she said, she couldn't get a job on the project - or anywhere else in the city.
She hopes she'll make enough money in her first years doing construction in Alberta to take on her true passion - fashion design - full time. She tried to pursue it in Windsor, but never scrounged up the funds to establish a business.
In her eyes, nothing has changed since the recession's peak in 2009.
"There's no jobs here. I don't even have the motivation to get a job here," she said.
That is not how Mayor Eddie Francis sees things. First elected in 2003, he has led the city through the roughest years in its history, and he believes it has emerged on the other side.
"The unemployment rate, which may be viewed as an unemployment rate to some, is viewed by investors as a ready-made work force that is employable today," he said during a walk through Windsor's downtown core. He points to the convention centre, built after manufacturing took a hit, as a sign of this change. (Only a few blocks away, many businesses have "for sale" or "for lease" signs in their windows.) The Windsor-Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce has poured resources into marketing the city as a retirement destination. Their pitch? Selling a house in Toronto could generate enough money to buy a large property in Windsor with plenty left over to allow for an early retirement. And it is just a short drive to Detroit, where flights to Florida are at a heavy discount.
The Windsor-Essex Active Retirement Community Initiative says new residents aged 50 and older bought $147-million worth of real estate between September, 2008, and October, 2011.
Matthew Tedesco is only 23, but cannot imagine spending another year in Windsor - let alone retiring there. After six jobs and as many layoffs in 2011, he decided it was time to uproot himself from Windsor and search for more lucrative pastures elsewhere. He spent months searching for work and maxed out his employment insurance benefits.
He and his girlfriend, Abbi-Lynn Wise, are hitting the road in a U-Haul next Tuesday. Destination: Barrie, Ont., where Mr. Tedesco has landed a factory job assembling brakes. The Ontario town is hardly booming, but may be Alberta-lite for the young couple compared to their experience in Windsor.
"It starts at $12 an hour when everybody here makes minimum wage," Mr. Tedesco scoffed. "And after three months, it's $16 an hour.
"This is kind of like, if it works out - we'll stay."

Abstract: "With the globalization of businesses and shortages of people with needed skills in many specialties there's a growing likelihood that you'll be given an opportunity to take a temporary assignment for up to three years or a even a permanent relocation," said Stephen Cryne, president and chief executive officer of the Canadian Employee Relocation Council, a Toronto-based human resources advisory group that commissioned the survey.

Full text: Half of global workers are open to working abroad but most Canadians would rather stick close to home, new study finds
For Karen Adams, regularly packing up the household and moving to another country became an essential path to career growth.
She joined HSBC Bank Canada 17 years ago in Vancouver and learned about the bank's international manager program, which offers the chance to transfer to operations in any of the 87 countries where HSBC operates.
"I thought long and hard about it and talked to a lot of people who were doing it already," and they encouraged her to leap at the opportunity, she said. Since then, she has been posted to Dubai, India, Hong Kong, South Korea, China, Jordan and England for stints of as long as two to three years each.
"I know it has helped my career," said Ms. Adams, who reached the rank of senior vice-president and national head of business banking years before she expected to and recently moved to Toronto for her executive role.
"Particularly for young people just starting out in their careers, I advise being open to opportunities and not closing any doors geographically. This is a big country and it's a big wide world out there. If you say you aren't mobile, it immediately limits you."
But a new study says that most Canadians are likely to say No to a job that requires them to move to a foreign position.
Only thirty-nine per cent of Canadians said they would be either likely, or somewhat likely, to consider a move to another country for between two and three years - if it brought a minimum 10-per-cent increase in pay and they were guaranteed they had a job waiting when they returned home.
That compares with 49 per cent of respondents in other countries, according to the survey by Ipsos Reid, which interviewed more than 18,000 people in 24 countries, including about 1,000 in Canada.
In Brazil, 71 per cent of respondents said they would be likely to consider an international move. Two-thirds of employees in India and Saudi Arabia and nearly that percentage in Mexico and Russia would switch countries as well.
But Canadians turned out to be more adventurous than Australian, British or American employees, who were all slightly less willing to make a career move across borders, according to the study reported at the Human Resources Professionals Association meeting in Toronto last week.
"With the globalization of businesses and shortages of people with needed skills in many specialties there's a growing likelihood that you'll be given an opportunity to take a temporary assignment for up to three years or a even a permanent relocation," said Stephen Cryne, president and chief executive officer of the Canadian Employee Relocation Council, a Toronto-based human resources advisory group that commissioned the survey.
Even though unemployment remains historically high, sheer demographics are making talent shortages a growing problem.
"A wave of older employees are reaching retirement age. We're also in a global economy and competing with the United States, Europe and Australia for talent," Mr. Cryne noted.
"The key challenges we find are that people don't want to leave family and friends. That's becoming a more pronounced issue among younger workers ... They like staying close to their parents and their friends. Even though the technology lets them stay in touch from anywhere, they place a lot of emphasis on their personal life and relationships," Mr. Cryne said.
But unemployment can be a big motivator. A second study of 7,000 U.S. workers who were laid off last year found that 20 per cent had to move to a new city or state to find work. Of those, the vast majority - 77 per cent - reported they were happy with the move and didn't regret their decision, the survey by job site CareerBuilder.com found.
That survey also queried 3,000 U.S. employers, 32 per cent of whom said they would cover all moving costs to attract professionals with the skills the companies need, and 19 per cent said they would pay a signing bonus to get the right people.
For Ms. Adams, there have been downsides to a nomadic career. "It has been challenging as a family of four," she said. She married her husband while in India and had her children while living overseas, a son who is now 11 and daughter now nine.
"If you have children, uprooting them and moving to another country and another set of friends is a big deal. Also I find it's difficult after building a local network of friends and colleagues to suddenly have to leave those relationships behind and start again," Ms. Adams said.
But the opportunity to experience new cultures not as a tourist but as a local has been extraordinary, she said.
"I know it has helped my career and helped broaden my horizons. Looking back, there were many more positives than I'd even hoped for."
*****
WHY PEOPLE STAY PUT
Family issues
The typical job move is undertaken by a married person between the ages of 26 and 40. But their spouses tend to also have a career they would rather keep, and children are often reluctant to leave their school and friends.
Housing costs
Canadians are concerned about moving to a city where they have to buy in an overheated real estate market.
Potential equity loss
An increasingly difficult challenge for Canadian employers is persuading Americans to move to the buoyant Canadian housing market from cities in the U.S. where real estate values have collapsed.

Douglas and Trevor Freeman, Freeman Real Estate Ltd.
The Action: A meticulous renovation and luxurious finishes lured a crowd of locals and house hunters to this three-storey, semi-detached Victorian in Little Italy.
What They Got: This roughly 3,000-square-foot house was gutted and restored, maintaining original details from 1889, such as its red brick façade, 10.5-foot ceilings, exposed brick walls and an oak fireplace mantle in the living room.
* The main floor now features a modern, open plan with pot lights, white ash hardwood floors and a floating staircase off the dining area, as well as a custom, granite-topped kitchen island, stainless steel appliances and double doors to the deck, private landscaped yard and new double garage.
* Two of the five bathrooms are for the exclusive use of two bedrooms on the second floor.
* Two smaller bedrooms are found on the third floor, which also has a rooftop deck.
* An extra bedroom and carpeted family room round out in the basement, which has a separate entrance.
The Agent's Take: "There are a lot of people looking for that location because they want to be close to the city, but they don't want to be put into an older house that needs work," says agent Trevor Freeman.
"These buyers were able to identify the amount of quality, time and effort that went into transforming this Victorian house into a home that offers original details of the Victorian era, like fireplaces, stained glass windows and high ceilings, but provides them with the renovations and conveniences they want from today's properties, like a main floor bathroom, en suites and heated floors."

No wand, but still fighting the dark side

Author: Lacey, Liam

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/no-wand-still-fighting-dark-side/docview/919629657/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Between terrified reactions (after a decade of playing the terrified [Harry Potter], [Daniel Radcliffe] is good at this), [Arthur Kipps] reads the letters of a woman who was diagnosed as mentally ill and separated from her son, who subsequently died. Now her ghost's desire for revenge is focused on bringing harm to other people's children. The threat becomes more pressing with the imminent arrival of Arthur's son, accompanied by his nanny, in a couple of days.

Full text: The Woman in Black
Directed by James Watkins
Written by Jane Goldman
Starring Daniel Radcliffe and Ciaran Hinds
Classification: 14A
**½
Daniel Radcliffe trades in his Harry Potter elder wand for a Victorian lawyer's solicitor's pen in The Woman in Black , an old-fashioned, Victorian haunted-house tale that marks a safe career transition for the young star. Though Radcliffe occasionally seems too stiffly callow to be completely convincing in this grown-up role, the movie is a proficient thriller with a potential appeal beyond the star's fan-girl audience.
Susan Hill's 1983 Victorian-inspired novel has already proved its popularity in radio and television adaptations and a theatrical play that has run since 1989 in London, second in endurance only to The Mouse Trap . For this adaptation, screenwriter Jane Goldman ( X-Men: First Class, Kick-Ass ) and director James Watkins ( Eden Lake ) up the body count, and pay homage to vintage horror movies, particularly in the overstuffed haunted-house tradition of Hammer Pictures (the movie is produced under the revived Hammer shingle). Their version is also supplemented with some modern Japanese chilly effects from such films as Ringu and The Grudge .
Bestubbled and glasses-free, Radcliffe plays Arthur Kipps, a young widower whose spouse (as we learn in a flashback) died in childbirth, leaving him with a young son. The still-grieving Arthur lives with the now three-year-old Joseph (Misha Handley) and a nanny, but is risking his career because of his preoccupation with the loss of his wife. To keep his job, he's required to take an out-of-town assignment, taking care of overdue paperwork for the estate of a Mrs. Dablow, in the remote village of Crythin Gifford.
From the outset, all indications are dire. The scowling innkeeper seems to have lost his reservation and Arthur is compelled to sleep in a cobwebby attic. The frightened townspeople urge him to avoid the old lady's house, a mist-enshrouded mansion, invitingly called Eel Marsh, stuck at the end of a causeway, cut off from land at high tide. Arthur finds some support from a local landowner and doughty skeptic of the local folklore, though his wife (Janet McTeer) is deranged by grief.
The house (designed by Kave Quinn) is the real star here, a ramshackle network of hallways and secret rooms, full of self-rocking chairs, banging doors, creepy wind-up toys. Arthur spends several terrifying nights there, reacting to jolting off-screen sounds and strange visions (some of which we see when he doesn't, negating the possibility that he's insane). Creepiest of all is the ghostly, black-clad, white-faced woman (Liz White) who appears, gliding rapidly, in the garden or moving about the rooms of the house.
Between terrified reactions (after a decade of playing the terrified Harry, Radcliffe is good at this), Arthur reads the letters of a woman who was diagnosed as mentally ill and separated from her son, who subsequently died. Now her ghost's desire for revenge is focused on bringing harm to other people's children. The threat becomes more pressing with the imminent arrival of Arthur's son, accompanied by his nanny, in a couple of days.
The special effects become repetitive in the film's second half, though the filmmakers show their own kind of courage by allowing long stretches of the film to unfold without any dialogue. The effect is refreshing, and almost compensates for the film's occasional longueurs and the eye-rolling, treacly conclusion.
All in all, The Woman in Black is a film that serves its purpose. It proves that, although Harry Potter is finished, Daniel Radcliffe may still have a future on the dark side.

In RIM's hometown, angst and optimism

Author: Waldie, Paul

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/rims-hometown-angst-optimism/docview/919629158/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "I'm a Waterloo girl," said Ms. [Wendi Campbell], executive director of the Food Bank of Waterloo Region, which receives donations from many RIM employees. "I'm a BlackBerry-toting executive director who is quite confident in [RIM's] ability to get through whatever it is they need to get through. They are a big part of the work I do every day. I wouldn't survive without my BlackBerry and I think they'll figure it out."

Colin Plant still remembers the time he briefly met Jim Balsillie. It was at an event three years ago in Waterloo, Ont., just before Mr. Plant's life unravelled and he ended up homeless.
"He probably wouldn't remember me," said Mr. Plant, who once worked at Research In Motion Ltd.
Today, Mr. Plant is rebuilding after he was knocked down by divorce and a spell of unemployment. And once again, RIM and Mr. Balsillie have had an impact on him: Mr. Plant now lives in a new social housing project that was built in part with donations from RIM's former co-CEO.
The housing has helped him put his life back together and he is grateful for Mr. Balsillie's support. Assessing RIM's recent misfortunes, Mr. Plant says: "It's sad. They have contributed a lot to this community."
It's hard to find anyone in Waterloo who hasn't been touched in some way by RIM, Mr. Balsillie or Mike Lazaridis, the firm's other former co-CEO - Mr. Lazaridis and Mr. Balsillie stepped down in a management shakeup Jan. 22. They dominate the city in a way probably unmatched by any business people anywhere in Canada.
RIM is the city's largest private sector employer with about 8,000 people, the largest office owner, the largest benefactors, the largest sponsor of just about everything in town and the very reason Waterloo has gained international fame as a high-tech hub.
But with RIM on the ropes, its share price tanking, and Mr. Balsillie and Mr. Lazaridis no longer running it, people across Waterloo are struggling to come to grips with a radical possibility - life without a prosperous RIM.
"It's a touchy subject," said John Lind, who works for ColliersInternational in Waterloo and specializes in commercial properties. "I think it's something we need to talk about. But they are just so dear to our region on so many levels."
Mr. Lind said people talk about RIM and its future in "hushed tones," afraid to be seen speaking ill of such an important player in the community. Last week, he gave a presentation on the outlook for commercial real estate in the city and joked that RIM was "the elephant in the room." Few people wanted to discuss what could happen to the local economy if things get worse for RIM, which owns or leases nearly one-third of the city's office space.
"We're all hopeful and we want to have hope and it's very dear to this region, but let's be frank. If you talk to someone from Silicon Valley or just as far away as Toronto, RIM's in trouble," Mr. Lind said. "They have the two most ferocious competitors the world has ever known," he said, referring to Apple and Google.
But many others around town simply don't accept that RIM's future is in question. "The outside world is jumping all over them, but we know here within the community that they are doing very well," said Waterloo's Mayor Brenda Halloran. "Here within the community we are very supportive, very secure in the knowledge that RIM is going to be fine."
When asked if she had any doubts about RIM's future, Ms. Halloran tersely replied: "No. That isn't even something we worry about."
That feeling is shared by many. "Maybe it's a bit of an unfair advantage," said Iain Klugman, CEO of Communitech, a local industry organization that represents about 500 high-tech companies including RIM. "I live here and I live next door to people who work at RIM and we have a much more sort of intimate understanding of the company. For us we're very excited about this next chapter for RIM."
When pressed, Mr. Klugman conceded the departure of Mr. Balsillie and Mr. Lazaridis as RIM's top executives (both will remain directors) has affected the city. "For people who live here it's a little hard to kind of get their heads around the fact that Mike and Jim aren't running the company because they always have. They've always been there. And it's kind of like, 'Oh, wow.'"
Waterloo has been through something like this before.
The city was founded in 1816 by Germans, Mennonites and British, who arrived with a multitude of skills and a spirit of entrepreneurship. Joseph Seagram was among them. He founded a distilling company in Waterloo in 1857 that eventually became one of the largest liquor businesses in the world. Much like RIM, Seagram dominated the city, sponsoring civic events and employing much of the community. But the business was eventually sold by its owners, the Bronfman family, and the local distillery shut down along with a museum dedicated to the company's exploits.
The same thing happened next door in Kitchener with Electrohome Ltd. Once a multinational maker of stereos, Electrohome employed 4,500 people in the region. But that business too faded away. Electrohome "got done in by changes in technology which is kind of foreboding when you see the concerns about RIM and changes in technology," said Ken McLaughlin, a local historian.
Mr. McLaughlin believes things are different this time and that Waterloo has diversified sufficiently to withstand any serious downturn at RIM. Companies such as Open Text Corp., Google and Sybase have expanded their operations in the city and would likely snap up laid-off RIM workers. And that is already happening. "We just hired a couple of people from RIM," said Dave Kroetsch, a former RIM employee who runs Aeryon Labs Inc., a small Waterloo-based robotics company. RIM "has generated a huge influx of talent to Waterloo."
But for now, Waterloo is full of RIM boosters like Wendi Campbell, who can't see it fading away.
"I'm a Waterloo girl," said Ms. Campbell, executive director of the Food Bank of Waterloo Region, which receives donations from many RIM employees. "I'm a BlackBerry-toting executive director who is quite confident in [RIM's] ability to get through whatever it is they need to get through. They are a big part of the work I do every day. I wouldn't survive without my BlackBerry and I think they'll figure it out."

Abstract: "People worry about losing the fishmongers and the fruit sellers that make Kensington what it is," said Shamez Amlani, a restaurateur and community organizer. "Kensington is in this position where it has to redefine itself and you hope it doesn't change too much."

Full text: European Quality Meat and Sausages owner finds the hot real estate market too tempting not to test
For more than five decades, European Quality Meat and Sausages has been a Kensington Market mainstay, drawing customers from across the city with hearty steaks, spicy kielbasa and tangy cured ham.
But now, septuagenarian founder Morris Leider is contemplating closing the business, the latest sign of a slow shift in the retail makeup of the colourful enclave.
Mr. Leider has put the building - a two-storey, 823-square-metre storefront at the head of Kensington Avenue - up for sale, with a $1.8-million asking price. If he can get a good deal, he will look at closing the shop; if not, he will keep it open, said Mr. Leider's son, Larry. European's other outlet, in Etobicoke, will stay in business no matter what happens.
The younger Mr. Leider said the decision to sell was motivated purely by real estate calculations.
"The market's just strong - we're testing the waters at this point," he said. Morris Leider declined an interview request.
A Ukrainian immigrant, he got his start in Kensington working at a cheese business. He launched the butcher shop in November, 1959. On its 50th anniversary, Mr. Leider told CITY-TV that he had no knowledge of the meat industry when he started. To make matters worse, his partner pulled out of the venture within six weeks, leaving the young businessman working from early morning to late evening to keep the place afloat.
He ultimately excelled, expanding to the second store and a processing plant in Brampton, where the company is now headquartered. But the place never lost its mom-and-pop feel, with some employees remaining at the company for decades. Business also stayed brisk: On Wednesday afternoon, dozens of customers buzzed about as staff in white aprons navigated around strings of sausages and filled orders. Down the block at menswear store Tom's Place, the proprietor credited European Meat with helping attract customers to the market.
"Morris Leider is a leader. I hope he changes his mind - what are the small stores going to do without the draw?" said Tom Mihalik, whose father founded his business the year before Mr. Leider's.
Back then, he recalled, retail was less cutthroat and it was easier to compete in the face of big chain stores.
Since that time, area stalwarts, including the Augusta Avenue egg market and some bakeries, have closed. But others have remained, with produce stands and bulk stores peering out beneath the neighbourhood's old-school awnings. In recent years, they've been joined by a new wave of independent businesses, ranging from bohemian cafes to vegetarian restaurants to bike repair shops.
Change has been driven by everything from shifting demographics to changing tastes to rising rents. Residents fear the situation will allow big box stores or other corporate businesses to worm their way into the market. Three years ago, for instance, realtor Phil Pick talked about enticing a Starbucks or Lululemon to the area, earning a backlash from neighbours.
"People worry about losing the fishmongers and the fruit sellers that make Kensington what it is," said Shamez Amlani, a restaurateur and community organizer. "Kensington is in this position where it has to redefine itself and you hope it doesn't change too much."
When old businesses depart, the trick is to find new ones that will preserve the market's history even as they modernize, he said. For instance, when butcher Slolly Stern sold his shop in 2009, former chef Peter Sanagan re-opened it as Sanagan's Meat Locker. He added his own twist, selling Ontario-produced meat and capturing the burgeoning market for local food.
Mr. Sanagan hopes that, if European ends up leaving, the new tenant will follow in its footsteps. "I hope the new business that comes in keeps the old spirit alive, in terms of the market being a place for food."

Full text:   Builders/developers: CentreCourt Developments and Lifetime Developments
Size: 277 to 819 square feet
Price: $200,000s to low $600,000s
Sales Centre: By appointment only
Contact: To register, phone 416-551-2744 or visit karmacondos.com.
Keeping up to date on the progress of the latest high-rise development by CentreCourt Developments and Lifetime Developments won't cost potential buyers a penny. But their actions will buy a great deal of good fortune for others in the popular downtown community.
For each person who registers for updates on Karma Condos, the developers donate $5 towards local causes. More than $10,000 was raised in just two weeks last month. "We believe everything we do has a strong impact on the neighbourhood where we build, and it's our responsibility as developers to work with the community to design something that will positively affect the neighbourhood and positively affect change in the neighbourhood," says Brian Brown, vice-president with Lifetime Developments.
"It's a condo that cares."
Registered buyers can even chose to allocate their donation towards either Ronald McDonald House, which provides lodging near hospitals for families with sick children; Wellsprings, which is a network of community-based cancer support centres; or Sketch, which engages youth at risk through art.
"We came up with three charities ... we felt had very strong causes and very strong benefits to the neighbourhood," says Mr. Brown, who adds that his staff also volunteers for these organization's special events. "So we're doing different things to build on this good karma notion."
For many buyers, the area is the main selling feature for the 50-storey glass tower, which will be conveniently located at 21 Grenville Street, near restaurants and shops along Yonge and College streets, a 24-hour supermarket at College Park and both Ryerson and the University of Toronto campuses.
"As far as the Yonge and College area, this is one of the hottest neighbourhoods and most desirable to live in," says Mr. Brown. "But also, given how close this site is to the subway, it's a location that can provide access to every single amenity, resource and location that anybody wants."
This building, which was designed by architectsAlliance, will also become a destination of its own with new shops facing Grenville Street and an adjacent laneway that many pedestrians currently utilize.
Private recreational amenities will consist of a large party room with a projection screen and dining room, a pub-like bar with poker, billiards and tennis tables, and a rooftop terrace with seating and barbecue facilities. In addition, there will be rooms for screenings, gaming and music and a fitness centre with weights, cardio equipment, yoga area and saunas.
The rest of the tower will contain 495 suites, ranging from studios to two bedroom plus den plans, including 50 units on the top five floors that were released this week.
Units facing north and south will have balconies, however, each suite will have floor-to-ceiling windows, nine-foot ceilings and engineered wood floors, plus Energy Star appliances and energy efficient heating and cooling systems.
Kitchens and bathrooms will feature contemporary, custom Cecconi Simone cabinetry and stone or quartz counters.
Monthly fees will be 53 cents per square foot.
Parking will be purchased with select suites for $50,000. However, there will be auto share vehicles on site.
Occupancy is slated for September, 2015.

He's b-a-a-a-ck! Just when you thought it safe to download a Canadian Olympic photo, there he was. King of the Red Mittens. That trademark big grin, mitten thrust high - the pose that launched a thousand pics during the run-up to the Vancouver Winter Olympics. Was it really only two years ago?
These days, Gordon Campbell combs his distinguished, silvery hair at Trafalgar Square, presiding over what could be the best chunk of real estate in central London as Canadian High Commissioner to the United - don't mention Scotland - Kingdom.
But that didn't stop Mr. Campbell's Pavlovian tendencies when COC president Marcel Aubut came calling this month to see how Canada House was preparing for the summer's Olympics north of the Thames.
Mittens were donned and photos snapped before you could say Ben Johnson.
This throwback to a sunnier, pre-riot time in Vancouver brought a song to my lips.
To the tune of that grand frontier hymn, The Ballad of Davy Crockett .
Born in a hospital in fab B.C.
Greenest prov in the land of the free
Brought in a tax called the HST
That cost him all his popularity.
Gordie, Gordie Campbell.
King of the Red Mittens.
Burns Lake explosion cuts deep into a 40-year legacy
As many have pointed out, the tragedy that wiped out the Babine Forest Products sawmill in Burns Lake - quite apart from the deaths and injuries - was more than just an economic loss to the town. It was a calamity for the local aboriginal community as well.
The mill employed about 100 native workers, and the Burns Lake Native Development Corporation holds an 11-per-cent stake in the operation.
Less well known is the fact that first nation involvement in the region's forest industry goes back nearly 40 years, one of those many legacies left behind by the wild and woolly NDP government of Dave Barrett. Things like ICBC, the agricultural land reserve, the B.C. ambulance service, a women's ministry ... okay, not the last one.
The person who signed the documents establishing the BLNDC, fuelled by an injection of government cash, was none other than Bob Williams, as powerful and controversial a cabinet minister as this good old province has ever had.
When I talked to him last year, Mr. Williams was still emotional about a project he considers among his proudest achievements during those three turbulent years of NDP rule in the 1970s.
And it has stood the test of time. Until, sadly, perhaps now.
Oh, what's her name - the blonde one?
There was the classic Hollywood musical romp, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers . And now, live on the stage of the Tax Court of Canada in Vancouver this week, we've had Twenty-One Brides and Winston Blackmore.
"We don't usually see the media," Judge Diane Campbell observed wryly, as proceedings began on Mr. Blackmore's contention that he of the many families is being treated unfairly by the tax system.
And it's a safe bet that the judge had never before heard a tax witness struggle, as the prominent member of the polygamous community of Bountiful did, to name all of his one score and one wives.
As recounted by The Globe's Wendy Stueck, Mr. Blackmore gave Department of Justice lawyer Lynn Burch an emphatic "thank you" for providing him with a list, after he bogged down on the name of Wife 14.
Ms. Burch subsequently asked him how many children he had, adding she would not hold him to a number.
"Please don't," responded Mr. Blackmore, who eventually gave his assent to an estimate of "at least 67."
The next day, it turned out that one wife had been forgotten. The count was now 22. Could happen to anyone.
The hearing continues in Vancouver.
Extra! Extra!
There aren't many relics still in this crazy business who, like your cranky correspondent, started out during the Precambrian era of typewriters and copy runners.
But they were exciting times, when papers hired colourful characters who hadn't been processed in journalism schools and before computers took most of the fun out of big city newsrooms.
Hollywood used to love making movies about reporters and newspapers. So much Damon Runyon material to put up there on the big screen. Many of the films were good.
Starting Friday, the VanCity theatre, with the help of reporters James Keller of The Canadian Press, Sunny Dhillon, Ian Bailey and me, and the sponsorship of The Globe and Mail, is staging a week-long festival of some of the best newspaper movies ever made. Some are even in colour. One ( Why Rock the Boat? ) is actually Canadian.
You won't regret seeing them all.

Full text:   Builder/developer: Pemberton Group
Size: 580 to 1,120 square feet
Price: Mid-$200,000s to $449,990
Sales centre: Michael Power Place at Dundas Street West, between Islington and Kipling avenues. Open Monday to Thursday, noon to 7 p.m.; weekends, noon to 6 p.m.
Grand opening: Feb. 4.
Contact: Phone 416-239-8200 or visit www.vividcondos.com
Often in new developments, the residential suites are ready for occupancy long before any of the recreational attractions are finished in and around the building. But that won't be the case for a 20-storey residence Pemberton Group will complete by fall 2013.
"When people move into Vivid, all the amenities will be in place," says sales representative, Sylvia Valente. "They don't have to wait on them, like so often when people move into a new building; they've got to wait months for the amenities to be completed."
For instance, residents will have immediate access to a theatre, billiards room and party room with a kitchen, bar, dining and lounge areas, as well as a pool and fully equipped gym.
Even a neighbourhood park with a playground, splash pad and gazebo is within steps of the 250-unit tower, which will be the eighth building in a master-planned condominium community just south of Dundas Street, near Bloor Street and Islington Avenue.
"Vivid is the last building going up at Port Royal Place, so people are anxious to buy in because it's their last opportunity," Ms. Valente says.
"It's perfectly situated, just a short walk to Islington subway station, a five-minute drive to the 427 or Gardiner, has easy access to the QEW and is a 15-minute drive to the airport."
Other local establishments include shops and restaurants in Islington Village, Bloor West Village and Sherway Gardens, in addition to a golf course, recreational facilities and walking trails along Mimico Creek.
Interested buyers can register to preview the collection of suites, which will have 580 to 1,120 square feet of living space with one or two bedrooms, open principal rooms and walkouts to balconies and terraces.
"We've got some of our old favourites at Port Royal, but we also have a lot of new and exciting floor plans," says Ms. Valente, who cites the popularity of a one-bedroom plus den model with over 900 square feet. "Many suites now are tiny, so people are finding it refreshing that there's something they can actually live in and be comfortable in."
Interior appointments will be contemporary with laminate flooring throughout, custom-designed kitchen cabinetry, granite counters, ceramic tile backsplashes and stainless steel appliances, as well as stacked washers and dryers.
"We've got excellent value with a locker and parking included with every suite and really high quality finishes," Ms. Valente adds. "There's no upgrades needed in them."
Monthly fees will be 53 cents a square feet, plus hydro.

Full text:   Who knew 20 years ago that Ottawa would turn out to be such a success story
rmacgregor@globeandmail.com
'Maybe Rome Was Built in a Day!"
Twenty years on, Ottawa Senators president Cyril Leeder is still chuckling over that legendary Ottawa Citizen headline that greeted his team's first game back in the NHL - a 5-3 victory over the Montreal Canadiens, who went on to win the 1992-93 Stanley Cup.
"Then we go off to Quebec City and get bombed 9-2."
It took the reborn Senators to the end of the month to earn their next point, and to the end of the next month to get their next win, eventually ending up with 24 points and an all-time NHL record for futility on the road: a single victory in 42 attempts.
Leeder was there from the very beginning, was one of the original three - Bruce Firestone and Randy Sexton the others - popping a few beer in the dressing room after a game of shinny and deciding they could somehow convince the NHL to grant a franchise to Ottawa.
Their scheme seemed preposterous. Firestone had this notion that there is "a natural relationship between hockey and real estate," Leeder put together their leather-bound, 600-page application, Sexton did the contacts and much of the selling. Not only would they build a new rink, they would establish a new town of close to 10,000 people.
The Canadian franchise should likely have gone to Hamilton, but the Hamilton people balked at paying the $50-million expansion fee at once while the Ottawa pitch offered cash on the barrel, even though they didn't have it. Same with Tampa Bay, which also got a franchise that should have gone to deeper pockets. But no matter, both were in and both, miraculously, are still in 20 years later.
Leeder was there through all the madness - the Alexandre Daigle and Alexei Yashin years, the change of ownership as financier Rod Bryden became majority owner, the bankruptcy that eventually put the franchise in the hands of multimillionaire Eugene Melnyk.
Leeder was there for the battles to build a rink in a distant corn field on the western fringes. They dug a hole and couldn't finish. The Coast Guard came in to determine if the trickling Carp River was going to be affected. Workers found bones that some thought were evidence of a sacrificial lamb. They even had to build their own exit off Highway 417 when the Ontario government refused.
But 16 years have passed since that new rink finally opened on a cold January day in 1996 and this week the NHL's all-star game will be played in that rink that took so long to get built. And while no one would ever mistake Kanata for Rome, the changes are remarkably as Firestone first envisioned.
"Bruce was right on the money," Leeder says. "He's always been about 10 years ahead of the curve."
Where once there were only fields and scrub bush, there is housing as far as the eye can see. The rink is surrounded by office buildings and car dealerships, with a massive outlet mall tagged to go in across the highway.
"When we first moved to Kanata in 1992," Leeder says, "you had to go elsewhere to shop or go to a restaurant." No longer, though. As for those NHL people arriving in 2012 not having seen the rink in years, they'd be "shocked - the growth has been phenomenal."
The team also changed dramatically over those years, reaching the Stanley Cup final in 2007 before going into a tailspin a year ago in which multiple veterans and its coaching staff were dumped. Much to the surprise of everyone from management to local media to the players themselves, the Senators of today are a playoff contender again under new coach Paul MacLean. Four players - captain Daniel Alfredsson, Erik Karlsson, Milan Michalek and Jason Spezza - were voted to the all-star team, rather more than should be the team's due but an example of what this team that never should have been has come to mean to Ottawa.
For years the Senators fought to get the all-star game to this facility, but the hitch was always lack of enough convention space to hold the other events of the weekend. That was solved this past year with the opening of the new Ottawa Convention Centre on the banks of the Rideau Canal.
The one unavoidable complaint that has stuck fast since the rink first opened on another January night in 1996 is traffic. But even that is going to change, with two new lanes to open over the next couple of years.
It may hurt the ratings for the postgame radio shows, but Ottawa fans will cheer the changes as loudly as, these days, they cheer the team itself.

The next generation semi-detached

Abstract: It's not hard to figure out why he did so. Living in two-family dwellings is a tradition with especially deep roots here. Indeed, no residential form is more abundant in Hogtown's old blue-collar and middle-class neighbourhoods. Enormously popular with local developers and builders from the Victorian era through the 1930s, semi-detached houses were cast in every style that enjoyed a moment in the sun.

Full text:   Architect Rudy Bortolamiol's interpretation of an iconic Toronto residential form show just how versatile it can be
jmays@globeandmail.com
A generation ago, U.S. architect Steven Holl (not yet the celebrated designer he would later become) compiled a handy field guide to North American building types. He had every city on this continent from which to pick examples of the structures people live, play and work in. But when it came to illustrating what he calls the "double house," Mr. Holl decided to feature specimens of the type from only one place: Toronto.
It's not hard to figure out why he did so. Living in two-family dwellings is a tradition with especially deep roots here. Indeed, no residential form is more abundant in Hogtown's old blue-collar and middle-class neighbourhoods. Enormously popular with local developers and builders from the Victorian era through the 1930s, semi-detached houses were cast in every style that enjoyed a moment in the sun. Architectural scouts, rambling along Toronto's prewar streets, can find Second Empire double-ups; steeply gabled Gothic semis, plump and be-columned Edwardian duals; neat Art Deco boxes joined at the hip.
Not all double houses in the downtown area are so chic, of course. But the vogue for putting down roots in the T.O. core - now some 40 years along, and showing no signs of slackening - has made even the frumpiest doubles desirable. As a result, many a homeowner has ended up in a semi-detached house with great urban location but a homely exterior and not-so-great interior layout.
If you're not inclined just to gut the place and slap up some white paint on the inside - surely the least interesting solution to the problem - what can be done to turn an unpromising semi into a home you can be proud of?
This was the question that recently faced a Toronto professional pair - he's a doctor, she's a lawyer - after they bought half a dowdy double house in northern Deer Park for $550,000, only to discover it would cost at least $300,000 to make the 1,600-square-foot residence livable.
Mere livability, however, wasn't good enough for the couple. They wanted a beautiful, ample home in which to start and raise a family, a refuge to come back to at the end of their busy days at hospital and office. And they wanted to enjoy these things, not in some far-flung Toronto suburb, but in Deer Park, near the heart of the city.
So they decided to tear down the semi, and put up something entirely new. Designed by Rudy Bortolamiol, the handsome, 2,400-square-foot result, which cost the couple another $550,000 to construct, plays the old tune of the semi-detached house in a modern key.
The exterior styling has a contemporary air, but the house's three-storey front introduces little discord into the staid, conventional visual music of the surrounding Edwardian streetscape. The dark brown stucco and wheat-coloured brick match the colours and materials to be found elsewhere in the vicinity, and the sloping roof and projecting attic do not really interrupt the rhythm of rooflines and dormers along the street.
Even external features that seem, at first glance, to be quite up-to-date can turn out to be more traditional than they look. The square, wood-framed window at the front of the main level, for example, is certainly much wider and taller than anything a local builder a hundred years ago would have allowed. Yet it's still just another typical bay window overlooking the front yard and sidewalk, inserted into this new house's street side façade exactly where you will find a bay window in any Toronto semi from yesteryear.
Inside, Mr. Bortolamiol's architectural moves are bolder, while remaining respectful of the intimacy and ordinariness that are among the attractive features of the double-house form. The designer has carved out a large void at the centre of the three-bedroom structure, opening up the ground floor to light falling from above. But despite the broadness of this light-well and the height of the ceiling over the engineered-wood floors at this point - more than 17 feet - the open-plan space at the bottom feels hospitable, inviting.
This effect is due, at least in part, to the small, carefully thought-out scale of the appointments - a scale that is appropriate to a semi-detached house. The travertine fireplace in the stepped-down living room area, for instance, is the right size, neither massive nor trivial. The marble wall near the dining table, similarly, is just formal and elegant enough; any larger, and it might become overbearing. Also, the dropped ceiling over the kitchen and dining area slightly compresses these spaces, lending them an atmosphere of comfortable containment.
Mr. Bortolamiol's engaging modernist interpretation of the semi-detached house reminds us that the creative possibilities of this elderly Toronto building type have not been exhausted - not by a long shot.

Full text: Canada's real estate market is growing at a snail's pace, reinforcing hopes the housing sector will glide to a soft landing instead of crashing.
Worries over the economy have dampened demand in some resale housing markets, but the prospect of low interest rates for at least another year is luring buyers and helping create an equilibrium in most parts of the country.
Numbers released by the Canadian Real Estate Association on Monday show that sales volume was up 2.2 per cent in all of 2011 compared to 2010, and the average price for a house inched 0.9 per cent higher over the course of the year - to $347,801 in December.
The association said buyers were getting increasingly cautious toward the end of the year, but low borrowing rates should help keep properties moving through 2012.
Doug Porter, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the modest increases "suggest that the market can achieve a soft landing," instead of a crash that could rock the foundations of the Canadian economy - as the real estate meltdown did in the United States.
Overall, "the December sales and price figures ... are incredibly well behaved and there is nothing unusual going on," he said, an indication this moderate scenario will continue.
Concerns about a bubble were spurred by the steady rise in home prices over the past decade, with only a brief interruption in 2008, he said. Prices are now roughly double where they were a decade ago, far outpacing gains in income.
CREA's chief economist Gregory Klump said the moderating sales numbers "don't point to signs of an imminent collapse."
To get a housing market bubble to pop "you need a trigger - a massive oversupply, or a massive decline in demand - and those triggers are not in the cards when you look at the prevailing economic forecast."
CREA has projected that the number of house sales will grow by about half a per cent in 2012, and that average prices will be flat.
Still, there are two key concerns hanging over the housing market: the level of real estate prices in Vancouver and the condominium construction boom.
Neither of those markets has shown signs of a catastrophic decline, even though some people have been predicting it for years.
In Vancouver, sales volume grew 5.8 per cent in 2011 compared with 2010, although activity slowed considerably at the end of the year.
Prices in December were about 2 per cent lower than in the same month of 2010.
Mr. Klump said the moderation of prices in Vancouver - after a big runup late in 2010 and early in 2011 - is a good sign that a bubble can be avoided.
As for condominiums, he acknowledged that speculative investment by foreign buyers is helping push up prices, but he noted that the number of unoccupied condo units "is not at worrisome levels."
In most markets across Canada, local conditions usually determine house prices and the volume of house sales, and swings tend to be more moderate than in Vancouver or Toronto.
In Calgary, for instance, the number of sales has been relatively flat in recent years, and prices have not increased significantly since they fell after a big jump in 2007, real estate agent Jim Sparrow said.
He expects solid price increases going forward, but nothing that would resemble a bubble.
While the oil patch is doing well, "people are uneasy about what is going on in Europe, and they are uneasy about what is going on in the United States," he said.
"While there is a lot of money here, people aren't taking their wallets out."
One key indicator in the Calgary housing market is a drop in rental vacancy rates, Mr. Sparrow said.
People who are moving to Alberta to work in the oil patch tend to rent apartments for a while, then buy a house.
He's hoping many of those renters will soon become buyers.

Full text: Rennies buy Ted Harris Paints building for artist studios while Bruno Wall plans three-tower condo project close by
Ted Harris Paints has been a neighbourhood institution for the last 91 years, and it's about to become a neighbourhood game-changer.
The downtrodden strip of Hastings east of Main Street is undergoing transformation. At the heart of the area, which is on the fringe of Strathcona, is the paint store, which has been closed since owner Bob Harris retired almost a year ago. He sold the building at 757 E. Hastings to Kris Rennie, who works with his father, high-profile marketer and art collector, Bob Rennie. Mr. Rennie and son will oversee its conversion into artist studio rental spaces - if the city gives them the go-ahead.
Mr. Rennie says that he and his son have no intention of developing any kind of residential space at 757 E. Hastings. That will be developer Bruno Wall's job. Mr. Rennie's long-time collaborator, Mr. Wall is proposing the area's first condo development two blocks away at 955 East Hastings - another game-changer.
"We have the Waldorf, Bob has bought that little building; I think it's ripe for change," says Mr. Wall.
Mr. Wall is aware that there might be community residents who will oppose his proposal for market housing, but he hopes they will recognize that he would also be supplying affordable housing and job opportunities.
Mr. Wall aims to build an unusual complex that fulfills the city's mandate to provide housing, while maintaining light industrial space and artist studio space. The area was originally zoned for light industrial but back in the mid 90s, it was given the green light to be rezoned for residential as well.
Mr. Wall's plan is to provide housing in combination with ground level workspaces for manufacturing industries and retailers, along with artist studios. He has applied for rezoning, and community consultation should happen soon. If the project is approved, he expects pre-sales to launch either late 2012 or early 2013.
"Our objective is to make it attractive enough from a price point of view... and the views on the north side are just spectacular. There's nothing in front of you."
Mr. Wall envisions three mid-rise buildings with a large podium, comprising 280 condo units and 70 units of city-managed affordable housing, which fits with the city's policy for affordable housing in the area.
The target buyer who will be in keeping with the current demographic. The area is home to the annual arts event, the Eastside Culture Crawl, and Mr. Wall sees his new project as the perfect space for that use.
"The key objective is to create employment-generating space, to employ people in the neighbourhood. For example, someone who makes plumbing fixtures, they could have a small showroom. That would be on the ground floor on Hastings."
City planning director Brent Toderian says Mr. Wall's idea is in keeping with the city's policies for that part of Hastings.
"We are seeing gradual transformation or transition of the area," says Mr. Toderian. "There is certainly an interest that rather than replacing the industrial, gritty, edgy feel to it, that other uses could be brought in while retaining that edgy feel. Given that it's been let go for industrial uses as of the mid 90s, we anticipate housing, but we would like to see it mixed with other uses."
Signs of revitalization are already under way in an area where prostitution and drug use have long been an issue. Close to Ted Harris Paints store is fine cheese shop Les Amis du Fromage, and its wine bar Au Petit Chavignol. Near Heatley and Hastings, the area's first full-service community library with social housing on the upper floors is expected to be built by 2014. West of Clark Drive, the Waldorf venue and hotel has proven a destination, even though surrounded by commercial properties.
Mr. Harris, whose grandfather founded Ted Harris Paints, says that he welcomes the change. He attended Strathcona Elementary School, grew up at the back of the store and worked there all his life, starting with his job packaging paint dye when he was "between five- and 10-years old."
The store opened the year he was born, 1947.
Mr. Harris says the drug trade and prostitution ebbed and flowed over the years, depending on the businesses that moved in.
"I think the area will benefit by just having regular people move in and living there, and also regular shops of one sort or another opening up there," says Mr. Harris. "These things all make a difference."
For his part, Mr. Rennie wants to keep the famous signage and turn the legendary paint store into needed studio space in an area already populated with many artists. He has not yet approached the city with his plan.
Mr. Rennie has said previously that the city can now develop in only one direction: Eastward, along the Hastings Street corridor.
"I've been saying since 2002 that the city will grow east... I only have three stories I tell all the time, and that's one of them."
**********
A COLOURFUL LIFE
Ted Harris started his paint store at 757 E. Hastings in 1947, but the building had already been in the family since 1920, when it was first a second- hand store and then a bicycle store.
When bicycle parts became scarce during the war, the family switched to the paint business. Bob Harris was raised as a single child in his family's apartment at the back of the building, where he lived with his parents and grandparents.
Back then, painters would mix dye colours into white paint, and Mr. Harris's first job as a little boy was to package the dyes into one-pound bags. He attended Strathcona Elementary School, where he got the strap for running through the girls' play area. By Grade 3 his family moved out of the neighbourhood, but he continued to work at the shop. Later, he'd obtain his chemistry degree at the University of British Columbia. and take over the store full-time, selling paint throughout B.C.
"It made a profit right through to the end," he says.
He insists that, contrary to popular thinking, prostitution and drug use has long been an issue in the neighbourhood.
"Most people don't have 60 years of living or working experience there, and they think it's new. But from what I recall, it was a problem back then as well. "The street activity would wane, then up and down. There'd be prostitution, then not much, this sort of thing. It's always seemed to me it changed with the people who were operating most of the businesses in the neighbourhood."
When it came time to retire last year, Mr. Harris decided to sell the building off once and for all. But he wanted to find a buyer who'd keep the neon sign, and that was Kris and Bob Rennie. He said he had offers on the sign from a neon collector in Winnipeg and a famous local artist, but the Rennie offer meant the sign would stay with the building.
"I feel good about them buying it. If I could pick a purchaser, which we don't usually get to do, I don't think you could find a better person to buy the building and run it as part of the neighbourhood."

Full text: lrochon@globeandmail.com
Let's say you decide to host a dinner party with some of the world's most powerful and eloquent urban thinkers and designers. On the table for discussion: urban poverty, sustainability and exploding populations, along with questions like what provokes the architectural magic that can zap a city, and what qualities make people reject public space or stay to luxuriate for hours in it.
Organizing an epic dinner party is how New York filmmaker Gary Hustwit first conceived of his enlightening and sumptuous film Urbanized , which premiered last fall at the Toronto International Film Festival, and which returns (in a newly re-edited version) to the TIFF Bell Lightbox this weekend along with the other films in Hustwit's trilogy of design documentaries, Helvetica (2007) and Objectified (2009). Naturally, every politician in Canada should attend, especially Rob Ford, who runs the nation's largest city as if it were a dollar store.
Urbanized is an intellectual breaking of bread that takes place in dozens of cities, in which more than 30 experts reveal their inner, mostly optimistic thoughts about the state of 21st-century urbanity, their voices providing the narrative for gorgeous visuals of London's skyline, the veil of smog obscuring Beijing and Rio de Janeiro's clearing house of urban data with more screens than Nasdaq. Even Toronto is captured in the film's opening sequence, with a helicopter buzzing a path in front of the dense mass of waterfront condominiums.
Unlike a raucous dinner party with its soundtrack of competing voices, Urbanized allows us to tune into carefully articulated declarations and some fighting words. Among the speakers, there are the likely suspects, such as British starchitect Norman Foster (the brains behind the gherkin-shaped Swiss Re tower in London and the University of Toronto's Leslie Dan Pharmacy Building), who clearly enjoys his mellifluous voice though he doesn't really manage to say much, and Copenhagen's Jan Gehl, the gentle knight crusading for a softer, more sensory public space that embraces pedestrians and bicycles. Dutch superstar architect Rem Koolhaas blows off steam about the energy-draining scourge of design competitions. And there's also comic relief about actor Brad Pitt's attempts at healing New Orleans, dismissed by a local architect as design that resembles his best friend's mother's place in Malibu.
Shooting some 300 hours of urban footage and interviews with the help of director of photography, Luke Geissbühler, Hustwit lands some shimmering views of the epic city. He ignores lots that shapes cities, such as the Bilbao effect - named for Frank Gehry's 1990s design of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao that launched a global reinvention of cultural and academic institutions in cities that could afford it. But it's a pleasure to see the great Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer being interviewed, still lucid at 103: "I think architecture is invention. In architecture, it isn't enough to just have a building that functions. It can be beautiful. It can create surprise."
Hustwit skips over the really bad architecture that does just the opposite, oppressing the human spirit in most cities around the world. Instead, Urbanized bounces often to happy instances of citizen engagement: the designers in Brighton, England, who sweetly chart the energy usage of residents on a little street, or the architects in Khayelitsha, South Africa, who design bold red buildings as safe havens for locals walking home late at night. Citizens can make a difference. But, sadly, their opinions matter not nearly as much as the real-estate developers and meddlesome politicians in, say, Toronto, where the bargain-basement vision of Mayor Rob Ford and his store-clerk minions is capable of undoing years of hard-fought citizen triumphs.
In the end, Urbanized soars when it allows people on the street and in their polished offices to speak simple truths about humanity and the urban condition. Ricky Burdett, director of LSE Cities, points out that, for better or worse, the 21st century is inextricably defined by cities: "By the 20th century, 20 per cent of the world's population was living in cities. Only two years ago, it was 50 per cent. If we continue at this pace, it'll be 75 per cent in 40 years time." People are arriving in droves to city states with economic promise: Mexico City, Mumbai, Lagos and Sao Paulo. The Greater Toronto area can expect to absorb about one million newcomers within the next 30 years. That's daunting enough to imagine, but consider that many cities around the world are labouring under the weight of informal settlements containing hundreds of thousands of people. In fact, much of the important footage in Urbanized scans the flimsy makeshift shacks of the favelas in South America and India. "Thirty-three per cent of new urban dwellers today live in slums," adds Burdett. "That's a third of the world's population without sewers, without water, without sanitation."
"In Mumbai," says Sheela Patel, an advocate for that city's pavement dwellers and chair of Shack/Slum Dwellers International, "what you have in the city are real-estate developers and slum dwellers who are carving out the design of the city. The poor people are doing it because the plan has no space for them." Meanwhile, the sad reality is that there are 600 people for every toilet seat. It makes the woes of Canadian cities seen trivial.
There was a time highways looping like noodles around cities like Los Angeles, Montreal and Cairo were applauded as emblems of postwar progress. It seems unthinkable now but planners were paid to sever the workplace from housing. "We've been getting more and more of these massive developments by large home builders where every house is cookie-cutter and all of the big-box stores look exactly the same," says Ellen Dunham-Jones, a professor of architecture at Georgia Tech. "More and more cars are required to drive much longer distances. This is now sprawl. This is not just suburbia."
So we've come full circle, and what matters now is creating intimacy and exquisite detail within the city. "The eye can't command an area more than about 100 metres by 100 metres," notes the erudite observer of public space Jan Gehl. That's why Amanda Burden, chair of New York's Planning Commission, obsessed along with activist citizens to create the High Line public park on a historic elevated rail line above Manhattan's West End. That's why she speaks about the magic of the movable chair as a tool to engage people, whether they be in the Jardin du Luxembourg in Paris or a newly pedestrianized section of NYC's Broadway Avenue.
Urbanized reminds politicians they must use fresh thinking. Subways, for example, may be only part of the solution for expanding public transit, especially as they're expensive and their construction can lag badly behind newly erupting city centres. The charismatic Enrique Penalosa, former mayor of Bogota, describes his approach: "The only way to restrict traffic jams is to restrict car use and the most obvious way to restrict car use is to restrict parking. ... In our constitution, there's the right to housing, the right to education, the right to health - but I don't see the right to park. When I was elected mayor, we started investing in people. We started investing in sidewalks and schools and great parks and libraries. And ... we started to create a bus-based public transport system called the TransMilenio. ... For the same cost as a 25-kilometre subway, it's possible to build 400 kilometres of TransMilenio."
Urbanized makes city building a thrilling, if daunting project. It takes knowledge and guts, which is why seeing this doc is not only cool for urbanites, it's a necessary primer for any leaders who dare to call themselves urban.
Gary Hustwit's Design Trilogy screens at TIFF Bell Lightbox Saturday through Tuesday (with the filmmaker introducing some screenings): Helvetica, Saturday, 12:30 p.m.; Objectified Saturday, 3 p.m.; Urbanized, Sunday, 8:30 p.m.; Tuesday, 6:30 p.m., 9 p.m.;
Urbanized also screens in Ottawa Jan. 25 and Calgary Feb. 1.

Full text: U.S. presidential hopeful's ties here include family cottage on Lake Huron and many business investments through Bain Capital
Early last spring, Mitt Romney dropped by Toronto's tony Granite Club to promote his new book to a group of about 800 at a private dinner.
It wasn't the first time the American presidential hopeful had courted a group of Canadians. From the summers of his childhood, when he holidayed on the Ontario side of Lake Huron and water-skied with the locals, to the days the firm he co-founded invested in major companies north of the border, Mr. Romney's ties here are many.
One guest at the Granite Club dinner was Larry Stevenson, founder of iconic Canadian book chain Chapters Inc. For him and Mr. Romney, the evening was a reunion of sorts. Before Chapters, Mr. Stevenson worked in the Canadian office of consulting firm Bain & Co., which was loosely tied to Mr. Romney's private equity firm, Bain Capital.
In the early 1990s, he was among a group of partners who tapped Mr. Romney to turn the flailing consulting company around.
"I have tremendous respect for Mitt. He was honestly probably the finest boss I ever had the chance to work with," Mr. Stevenson said in an interview. "If Mitt told you something, you didn't need it in a contract."
Mr. Romney's Canadian connection began in the early 1950s, when his father, George, built a modest cottage at Beach O' Pines near Grand Bend, Ont. The elder Mr. Romney, who worked as president of American Motors Corp. before he was elected governor of Michigan, brought his family there every July, celebrating American Independence Day, ironically, on Canadian shores.
Around town, the Romneys had a reputation as "down-to-earth people," recalled Bob Sharen, a local real-estate agent who served as reeve back then.
"They kept to themselves a bit, but they were never standoffish," he said. "People said if you happened to meet them on the beach, they were very nice."
Jennifer Winder, who lived down the street as a child, told a local newspaper in 2008 that young Mitt was an energetic boy who liked dreaming up ideas to make money.
"He had a great sense of humour," she told the Observer. "I always had a good time with the Romneys."
George Romney once quipped, in a speech to Toronto's Empire Club, that he was a "summer Canadian." In an unguarded moment, Mitt remarked during one of his father's political campaigns that he first spent July 4 in the United States at age 15.
Bain Capital, meanwhile, has made several business forays into Canada. As a buyout shop, Bain purchases companies and restructures them in hopes of selling the businesses years later at a profit. Although almost all of Bain's Canadian purchases were inked after Mr. Romney stepped down from the firm in 1999, a profit-sharing agreement he signed with Bain ties him to later deals.
Under this agreement, Mr. Romney is connected to Bain Capital's buyouts of Sleep Country Canada, Bombardier Recreational Products, Advertising Directory Solutions (Telus's old phone directory) and Dollarama. Bain was also a second-tier co-investor when Shoppers Drug Mart was purchased from IMASCO in 1999.
Business, however, is not the only thing that kept Mr. Romney coming back. Once he had a family of his own, he brought them to Grand Bend. On one holiday that gained some notoriety during his previous presidential campaign, the family car was so packed that he bundled the family dog into a box strapped to the roof for the day-long drive from Boston.
Mr. Romney and his siblings - brother George Scott and sisters Lynn and Jane - still own the cottage.
They're even listed in the local phonebook.

CO-OP AGENT
Anil Khera, Royal LePage West Realty Group Ltd.
The Action: The price of this two-storey house in East York was dropped twice, so when it was lowered to $529,900, agent Anil Khera negotiated further so it was in line with the budget of a local renter wanting a detached house with a garage.
What They Got: On a 20-by-127-foot lot in a popular low-rise neighbourhood near Danforth Avenue, this 1940s bungalow was expanded to create two bedrooms and a second bathroom upstairs.
* Finishes range from ceramic flooring in the foyer and kitchen to hardwood floors cover a living room with vaulted, beamed ceilings, a separate dining room and bedrooms, plus carpeting in a lower-level bedroom and recreation area with pot lights.
* Outdoors, there is a fenced backyard with open green space, a deck of the kitchen and another deck beside the garage.
The Agent's Take: "It's detached in a great location where there are houses going for over $1-million on this street, and it's got a garage off the lane," says Mr. Khera. "It's a nice condo alternative since it's not a large space."

Full text: Canadian businesses remain skeptical of tech tools, partly because the consumerization of IT means they must give up some control
When it comes to using technology to change how his employees work, Sheldon Dyck has led by example. In 2007, as part of its effort to foster more flexible working conditions, his company, Edmonton-based ATB Financial, made a major investment in high-definition video-conferencing equipment.
The $26.5-billion Crown corporation began by enabling video-conferencing in boardrooms and executives' offices. Then Mr. Dyck, president of ATB's investor services division, installed it at his properties in Kelowna, B.C., and Scottsdale, Ariz.
He also outfitted his Calgary home office so he could avoid rush hour by video-commuting to meetings early and late in the day. "A few other folks within the executive team and the management team started doing the same," Mr. Dyck recalls. "And we then had kind of a critical mass, so that for the people I was interacting with, 60 or 70 per cent of the time we were all doing that on a regular basis."
ATB was an early adopter of consumer technology for so-called telework, which can boost productivity and make workers feel more engaged. But other Canadian businesses remain skeptical of such tools, partly because the consumerization of IT means they must give up some control.
Thanks to the advent of cheaper and more portable installations, about two-thirds of the 350 employees in the three ATB wealth-management companies that Mr. Dyck leads now use video-conferencing. In addition, staff also have mobile devices, mostly iPhones and iPads. ATB has also embraced social media by using LinkedIn to communicate within the business and create specialty groups, Mr. Dyck says.
These technologies are just one element of ATB's Workplace 2.0 program, which aims to attract and retain talent by letting employees tailor work arrangements to their strengths and preferences.
ATB has partnered with the U.S. creators of the Results-Only Work Environment human resources strategy, says Sherri Wright-Schwietz, head of talent for investor services. It also joined forces with Calgary-based software provider Teletrips Inc. to assess, train, survey and track employees.
Workplace 2.0 has shown results. On average, participants use ATB office space just one day a week - a change that will reduce real estate costs. The program is also having the desired effect on employees, Ms. Wright-Schwietz says. "Based on all of the interim surveys that we've done, productivity has increased and engagement has increased."
As employers compete for young talent, they can't afford to ignore the opportunity presented by telework. A 2011 survey of some 3,000 students and young professionals by San Francisco-based computer networking giant Cisco Systems Inc. reveals why. Two out of five respondents said they would take a lower-paying job if it gave them more leeway with respect to mobility, choice of devices and social media access.
But telework has an image problem. "People assume the word 'telework' means that you go home and you work in your bunny slippers five days a week and nobody sees you any more," says Robyn Bews, project manager of WORKshift, a Calgary Economic Development initiative that helps local companies introduce telecommuting programs. At Cisco, employees use technology such as its TelePresence HD video-conferencing platform and Directory, its own version of Facebook, to ensure they have flexible working options, says Nitin Kawale, president of Cisco Systems Canada.
"Our folks have access to these tools every minute of every day," Mr. Kawale notes. "On top of that ... everyone's enabled on their devices and everyone's enabled at home. So what happens is 48 per cent of our work is done off-hours and off-premise."
Mr. Kawale believes the Canadian business community has been reluctant to follow suit - despite the fact that more than 70 per cent of Canadians use social media. He finds it ironic that in the workplace, many people don't have access to such powerful tools from their consumer lives.
"This is one of the things that is hamstringing Canadian businesses, and I think it's slowing down our innovation and productivity," Mr. Kawale says.
Bruce Matthews, a Vancouver-based business development director in the enterprise division of Telus Corp., flags the consumerization of IT as a trend that will transform the world of work. "Video could be the next killer app, so to speak, in the sense that it's been talked about for years and it's never really taken off in the enterprise world," Mr. Matthews contends. "But I think what's happening is because of the quality of access now and the quality of devices, video is becoming point-and-click."
Many organizations are struggling with the bring-your-own-device phenomenon as employees bring their tablets and other gadgets to work, Mr. Matthews says. "People are showing up [with them] because they're personal productivity tools, and they're saying, 'Well, I want to use this.'"
If employers remain wary of those devices, they do have legitimate worries, especially given the rise of data storage in the cloud. "Someone loses their iPad, which happens all the time, and a company's intellectual property is on display at Starbucks."
*****
FLEXWORK TIPS
Advice from Nitin Kawale of Cisco Systems Canada.
Don't wait
"Some companies, both large and small, public sector and private sector, are actually doing this and doing it well. But as a whole - I speak to Canada as a whole - I think we're behind."
Embrace social media
"IT departments are worrying about what access [they] should give employees. Should I limit some websites? How much should I track it? That kind of thinking really slows down the proliferation of these solutions. If you have a good code-of-conduct policy, then let the tools proliferate."

Full text: Court orders phone records seized in case of entrepreneur who provided 'shariah-compliant' loans
Omar Kalair is known as Toronto's trailblazing Islamic financier, an entrepreneur whose life's calling is to give loans to Muslims.
His creditors, however, want to know who he's been calling, and who's been calling him. On Friday an Ontario Superior Court judge ordered that he release his phone records to the creditors, hoping the information might help pinpoint what happened to 27 gold bars Mr. Kalair bought just as his mortgages-for-Muslims business crumbled.
Nearly $2-million in gold, stakes in more than 160 homes, and perhaps the reputation of Canada's emerging "shariah-compliant" loan industry are on the line in a sensational Toronto court case. At the crux of the issue is the emergence of Islamic financing in Canada.
A small percentage of the country's one-million-strong Muslim population believes the Koran forbids them taking part in any kind of interest-bearing deal. Since big banks are off-limits, they turn to lenders who specialize in workarounds.
Mississauga-born Omar Kalair started selling "shariah-compliant" loans in 2004 and painstakingly built his brand, UM Financial Inc. The company used what's been dubbed as a "declining-balance co-ownership program" where it teamed up with clients to buy homes, something like a lease-to-own plan where it charged them monthly "utility fees," but not interest.
But behind the company's public face were some unconventional private transactions, one of which is said to have gone down right before UM Financial failed last fall.
According to court documents, on Oct. 4., Mr. Kalair says he was in a parking lot in Toronto's west end at night, handing over nearly $2-million worth of recently purchased gold bars to a Muslim shopkeeper he didn't know very well.
Mr. Kalair later told his creditors that a "shariah-ethics board" had suddenly called in a massive debt resulting from years of advice about whether his business complied with Islamic law.
"It was the professional fees that were outstanding from the local scholars," he explained, according to a transcript of a court-ordered deposition.
"Make payment towards that in precious metals," Mr. Kalair says his scholars had told him, as they set up the parking-lot handover.
The religious scholars weren't the only ones calling in debts. Three days after the gold bars changed hands, he lost control of the company and its assets. For a year, his long-standing silent partner had been petitioning judges to put the entire loan business into the hands of a third party, so that it could sell everything off and recover loans made to UM Financial.
That silent partner was the Central 1 Credit Union of Vancouver - a conventional lender that had been bankrolling millions of dollars that Mr. Kalair's company turned into "shariah-compliant" loans. UM Financial Inc. was, essentially, a religiously blessed buffer between Mr. Kalair's interest-averse Muslim clientele and the credit union.
While fighting to retain control, Mr. Kalair filed sworn affidavits where understandings of religious edicts and secular laws blur. "The [shariah] board has released a fatwa," he told the Ontario Superior Court, arguing a religious ruling kept his clients from making mortgage payments to any secular entity.
Once they got to look at the ledgers, creditors grew far more worried about the gold. They discovered Mr. Kalair began buying bullion in the weeks before he lost control of the company. Several judges have since ordered that the creditors be given the gold. The problem is that the creditors can't find it.
In court-ordered depositions, Mr. Kalair and one of his religious advisers, named Mufti Yusuf Panchbaya, have insisted they have no longer know where the gold is.
The creditors have been told that a middleman, a Toronto shopkeeper named Joseph Adam, took off with it to Egypt and gave it to certain theologians. Mr. Adam is scheduled to attend a deposition in Toronto on Tuesday.
On Friday, the creditors got a new judicial order - one allowing them to seize the phone records of the three men, who are all said to have been calling one another as the gold changed hands. The hope is the call logs might help creditors finally pinpoint the whereabouts of the gold bars.
Declining interview requests, Mr. Kalair sent e-mails to The Globe saying that he has never broken any laws and that he'll divulge the "true, full story" of UM Financial Inc. once court proceedings end.
In the meantime, he is still in the loan business, continuing to operate under the auspices of distinct corporations called the UM Financial Group Corporation and UM Real Estate Investment.

Full text: After famous megaproject, Toronto architect was on verge of bankruptcy and made public pitch for work on school projects
Tottering on the edge of bankruptcy in the early 1990s, late in his long creative career, Toronto architect Rod Robbie remarked to a reporter that "doing schools is the thing I really get off on." The message was clearly intended to reach potential clients inclined to think of Robbie only as the famous lead designer of the huge sports and entertainment complex, now known as the Rogers Centre, at the foot of Toronto's CN Tower.
"You fall off people's calling lists," he said, "because they figure you don't have any time, you're so tied up doing these big stadiums all over the world that you wouldn't want to fiddle with their elementary schools."
Despite his tone of hard-times advertising, there can be no doubt about Robbie's professional enthusiasm for executing the bread-and-butter institutional projects that more artistically high-flying architects might turn up their noses at. His very large portfolio included numerous schools, along with child-care facilities, university laboratories, pharmaceutical and food-processing plants, a new town in the Arctic, a dairy and a hangar at Toronto's Pearson airport.
Robbie's preparation for these unromantic tasks had itself been as unromantic as any career path you can imagine. Born in 1928 in the English Channel port town of Poole, he was just 15 and knew nothing at all about the building art when his ambitious mother, a barmaid, prompted him to take a scholarship exam in architecture, simply because that was what was on offer. He passed the test and went on to study this subject (and, later, town planning) at the Regent Street Polytechnic School in London (now known as the University of Westminster). In 1956, after a stint with British Rail, Robbie immigrated to Canada, where, he later said, his "peasant" accent wouldn't be held against him.
He soon found a position in the Ottawa office of the prolific and charismatic English-born architect Peter Dickinson. Recognition in the world outside architectural and engineering circles - in which his talent and energy were greatly admired - eluded Robbie until 1967, just after he moved permanently to Toronto. It was then that his name briefly surfaced in connection with the Montreal Expo's official Canadian pavilion, which he designed in collaboration with Toronto colleagues Dick Williams and Colin Vaughan. This large, architecturally adventurous structure, crowned by an inverted pyramid, was an instant hit with the fair-going public. And the building effectively symbolized the social modernity and forward-looking political maturity that Canada had attained during its first century as an independent country.
Had he not landed the SkyDome commission in 1985, when he was 57, Robbie would be remembered today for the Expo 67 pavilion, and little else. But the fact that he and the consortium of engineers and construction companies he led got the immense job - and saw the technologically complicated project to a successful finish in 1989 - changed everything.
He and Michael Allen, the Ottawa structural engineer who crafted the stadium's retractable roof, were catapulted from obscurity into the local and international spotlight. Overnight, they became the go-to guys for anyone, anywhere in the world, who was thinking about putting up a similarly gargantuan facility - investors and politicians in several places were thinking about doing exactly that - and just as quickly became targets for criticism.
As soon as the stadium corporation announced that Robbie's bid had won the day, the barbs began to fly. The three other teams that took part in the limited competition - all massive, established hard-hitters in the Canadian design and construction industry - were aghast that the nod had gone to a small office: Robbie had six employees at the time, no skyscraper or shopping mall or convention centre to his office's credit, or much of anything else that demanded advanced expertise in handling mammoth amounts of concrete and steel.
Nor, the doomsayers argued, could a group led by such an inexperienced architect fashion a sliding, 3.25-hectare roof that worked properly. And the Robbie partnership certainly couldn't be counted on to bring in the stadium on its $225-million budget.
The critics were wrong about Allen's elaborate steel roof system, which has continued to open and shut on cue throughout its 23-year history. But they were right about the budget. The final construction cost of SkyDome, as the building was called until 2005, has been estimated at $650-million (including interest charges), with most of that staggering sum coming from the taxpayers.
Assessing Robbie's accomplishment from an aesthetic angle, architectural and urban-design commentators have long found the SkyDome to be a problematic proposition. Immediately after the public unveiling of Robbie's scheme, the city's head of planning said flatly: "It's too tall, too wide and too ugly."
And Toronto architect A. J. Diamond, weighing in soon thereafter in Canadian Architect magazine, also took Robbie's design to task on artistic grounds: "The governing idea of the domed stadium's façade," he wrote, "is only a systematized set of openings, within a masonry framework. ... This is too simplistic and featureless for a building of such monumental size and public importance."
Some early foes relented, however, once the SkyDome was up and running. Writing in 1989, Globe and Mail architecture critic Adele Freedman said that "the SkyDome, as it looks, as it feels is on the way to fulfilling architect Rod Robbie's hopes of designing 'a pleasure palace for the people.' All round, this is a building to be lived up to. The dome isn't sculpture. It's a place of public assembly that, with luck, will generate new forms of social interaction and public life."
For my own part, I have never really liked the place. I see no evidence that the Rogers Centre has spawned the "new forms of social interaction" that Ms. Freedman hoped for. And Mr. Diamond's portrayal of the building as "simplistic and featureless" seems as apt today as it was more than 20 years ago.
But since the day the SkyDome's ponderous roof rolled smoothly away for the first time, downtown Toronto has changed, and so has the building's place in our imagination of the city.
The stadium is now surrounded by a forest of shiny towers, for example, so it doesn't stand out on the skyline as conspicuously as it once did. If the SkyDome once seemed imposing and looming, the Rogers Centre now appears to be just another big, galumphing piece of urban fabric in the crazy-quilt downtown that the recent real-estate boom has produced. It may be ugly; but it has become our ugly - a living part of the Toronto story, a memory of something Toronto wanted to be, and a dream about the sprawling, hard-driving, hard-playing North American metropolis that, rightly or wrongly, we still want to be.
Rod Robbie had strong ideas about the roles he desired his super-stadium to play in the life of Toronto.
"In the initial phases of its construction," he said soon after receiving the go-ahead, "the dome will look a little like a ruin, like a coliseum if you will." But when it's finished, it will be "a secular cathedral. ... And that's not really far-fetched. In Gothic times cathedrals were used for markets and a wide variety of public uses."
What he looked forward to most of all, however, was the time when the building operated so perfectly that the architecture would simply disappear. It would happen, he said, "the day they close the roof and everyone is concentrating so much on the game being played [that] nobody notices the roof closing. That will be a great day."
Mr. Robbie died Wednesday. He was 83.

Abstract: In the meantime, some communities have found inventive ways to cover their parishes' everyday expenses. In Pictou, on the eastern mainland, a few members of Stella Maris Parish's congregation solicit parishioners outside of the church for donations for specific projects: new cemetery gates, patching up the roof, balcony repairs.

Full text: Settlement brokered by disgraced bishop forcing churchgoers to solicit donations from each other just to keep the lights on
Churches in eastern Nova Scotia are no strangers to hard times. Attendance is dwindling. The population is declining. And they inhabit one of the most economically disadvantaged regions of the country.
This year, however, their plight has reached a point of crisis - and parishioners have had enough.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Antigonish is selling 250 properties and liquidating its assets to pay a $15-million settlement for sexual abuse involving clergy.
Churchgoers were dealt another blow this week with the sentencing of Rev. Raymond Lahey - the bishop who brokered the multimillion-dollar deal.
Father Lahey, who was charged with possession of child pornography a month after negotiating the sex-abuse settlement, was sentenced to 15 months in custody and released on probation after getting double credit for eight months already served.
"It was very hard, and then to come through all these years and our parishes now have had to pay for the claims. There isn't resentment toward paying [the victims], it's just that it shouldn't be put upon the people," said Phyllis MacDonald, a member of St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church in Port Hood.
"Now we have to raise money to keep above ground, to keep our parishes going, to pay for heat in the church."
Ms. MacDonald said the settlement, which has forced cash-strapped parishes to give nearly all their reserves to the diocese, should be paid by the top level of the church hierarchy: the Vatican.
It's a thought shared by Marie Louise Samson, who was once a Catholic nun and an active member of her parish in Arichat, on Isle Madame, south of Cape Breton. The sex-abuse scandal prompted her to stop donating to the church, and later, attending altogether.
Ms. Samson said parishes' modest reserves and the sale of their properties - many of them willed to churches by parishioners - are the wrong sources of money.
"They came like thieves in the night to take our money and they took it away without even blinking an eye," Ms. Samson said. "It's a shame. It's our parents that worked to place [the churches] there and our grandparents, and they don't care. They just have to sell them."
But the church said there is no alternative source.
"We have no indication that the Vatican sees or is able to do something," said Rev. Paul Abbass, a spokesman for the Diocese of Antigonish based in New Glasgow, on the eastern mainland.
"We just had to keep saying to people, 'We're not just taking your money. It's not a money grab. It really is to right a wrong.'"
Charles MacDonald, a theology scholar from Sydney, N.S., who studied for his doctorate under Joseph Ratzinger, who is now the Pope, said the fact that Father Lahey brokered the settlement, more than anything else, has been the cause of unease among parishioners.
"How much of it is a reaction to the settlement and how much of it is a reaction to the sense of betrayal associated with the former bishop?" he said.
Daniel Doucet, a retired priest who lives in Sydney, questions whether church leaders are the right people to be handling finances.
"It's not so much about where the money's coming from, but it's about the clericalism of the church," Mr. Doucet said. He added that laypeople with business expertise should be hired to handle the enormous task of brokering real-estate deals to pay off the settlement.
"It's not clear to me that [the bishop and top priests are] following the best business practices and that they're competent in that area," he said.
Father Abbass said the five-member committee of priests responsible for selling church property has been overwhelmed by the task. He said he did not have a full list of all the properties that would be sold and that an account of how much each parish was required to contribute to the settlement would be released only at the end of the process. Each parish, he said, was required to turn over all its reserves (ranging from $1,000 for some to hundreds of thousands for others) save for $10,000 for operational costs and any extra funds needed to cover outstanding bills.
The first $4.6-million instalment of the settlement was paid last May and was funded by liquid assets individual parishes and the diocese held. Another $4-million paid in November came from sales of land and non-core church properties, such as unused church halls and rectories. Parish halls were to be sold as well, but resistance from parishioners prompted the church to take them off the block, Father Abbass said.
The balance of the settlement will be paid in November, also from anticipated sales of church property. So far, all properties have been sold at fair market value, he said.
Father Abbass said he did not know the cost of legal fees to the diocese when the settlement was brokered.
"When this whole process is completed, we will be giving to our people a breakdown of every single cost," he said.
In the meantime, some communities have found inventive ways to cover their parishes' everyday expenses. In Pictou, on the eastern mainland, a few members of Stella Maris Parish's congregation solicit parishioners outside of the church for donations for specific projects: new cemetery gates, patching up the roof, balcony repairs. Instead of sending funds directly to the parish, donors write a cheque to "Friends of Stella Maris," cash is deposited in the group's bank account and donors receive a tax receipt. When they're ready to pay for services, funds are withdrawn from that account. The diocese can't touch the money.
In November, the group raised $36,000 to pay outstanding bills, insurance and salaries.
"We decided we would give the parish a boost this year. We started off the year debt-free," explained Eric LeBlanc, one of the group's co-founders.
He's not vocal about his views on the settlement - he's a parishioner who, despite a short history of major tests of faith, still believes that local priests will sort it out.
"I know what should be done and what will be done are two different things, but I don't worry about it."

Full text: Cambodian residents of a complex in Phnom Penh carry their belongings a day after being evicted and their homes demolished on Wednesday. Riot police and residents were injured in a faceoff on Tuesday when authorities evicted families from their homes in the Borei Keila complex in a long-running dispute with a local real estate firm connected with the government. The firm, Phanimex, plans to convert the residential area into a commercial one.

Full text:   National organization helps distressed homeowners renegotiate their loans and avoid foreclosure
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
When Vonciel Offord walked into a Jacksonville, Fla., conference centre to renegotiate her mortgage, she felt her entire life depended on the outcome of her brief meeting with bank representatives.
Without a deal, the Orlando-based salesperson would lose the four-bedroom house she'd been living in for six years. She'd be forced to rent a place for herself and a disabled sister, and deal with the stigma that comes with having the bank foreclose on your dream.
So with papers in hand, she drove to Jacksonville to meet her lender at a three-day event put on by the Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America (NACA), an organization that helps Americans in danger of losing their homes refinance their mortgages.
Although the U.S. economy has been slowly rebuilding since the recession, at least 2.7 million homeowners who took out mortgages between 2004 and 2008 have faced foreclosure.
Another four million are expected to run into trouble over the next two years, prompting U.S. President Barack Obama to create a program intended to help millions of middle-class homeowners refinance at lower rates, even if they owe more than the house is worth.
The stakes are high - banks are carrying billions of dollars on their books in risky mortgages, and each time one of those mortgages fails, they are stuck with a house to sell. The government - through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - insures more than a trillion dollars in loans, providing it with incentive to help solve the housing crisis by whatever means necessary.
But the Obama program is limited - it only helps homeowners who are current on their payments, and their loans must be guaranteed by the government. This excludes a wide swath of the most vulnerable, NACA says, and does little to keep those people in their homes.
"We're doing something different here," says NACA representative Darren Duarte from the floor of the Jacksonville convention centre. "We think these good people here deserve a chance to talk to their banks, too."
There are plenty of reasons to keep these people in their houses.
While many of them obtained loans under less-than-ideal circumstances as U.S. banks rushed to issue credit during the boom years leading up to the recession, they still want to pay their loans.
But with interest rates as high as 10 per cent at a time when mortgage rates are at all-time lows, they are being forced out when a simple rate reduction can keep them in place and save the trouble and expense of foreclosure.
It would also help the broader economy - Karl E. Case, a professor of economics at Wellesley College, said in a recent paper that the decline in house prices from 2005 to 2009 lowered consumer spending by some $240-billion (U.S.) - equal to about 1.7 per cent of all of the country's economic activity.
NACA was founded in the backroom of a Boston union hall in 1988, as the Hotel Workers Local 26 created the organization to help it negotiate a housing trust fund with management that would help workers make down payments on houses.
Under president Bruce Marks, it evolved over the years into an aggressive defender of homeowner rights. Frequently referred to in the U.S. press as a "bank terrorist," Mr. Marks has led the fight against "predatory lending," appearing before congressional hearings and actually getting arrested as he protested at a Senate committee appearance by Chase Home Lending chief executive officer David Lowman.
In 2007, it created the "Home Save Program" to help homeowners renegotiate their loans with their lenders. It criss-crosses the country holding huge seminars in which homeowners are taught how to fill out forms and express their situation in a way that will appeal to their lenders.
Then, they whisk them into another room where dozens of bank representatives are waiting to hear their cases.
In some instances, those who attend the events walk out with a modification the same day.
Others are sent back to do more work on their budget, while more yet are told there's no help to be found.
NACA receives government funding for each person it sees, which has led some to criticize the organization's motives for holding large events that often run 24-hours-a-day and could provide false hope to many homeowners who are destined for foreclosure regardless of their interest rate.
But Ms. Offord isn't likely to pay much heed to the critics. She walked into the converted rail station in Jacksonville - along with about 1,000 distressed homeowners - with a mortgage rate of 5.5 per cent. She walked out hours later locked in at 3 per cent - a savings of $380 a month.
"I thought maybe a temporary solution, I didn't realize I could get a permanent one," she says afterward, in shock that she'll be able to keep her house. "I've been losing sleep, but I won't be losing sleep now. I can make this payment."

Abstract: Ford opponents cheered when the mayor and his brother were forced to drop their plan to seize the Port Lands from Waterfront Toronto and sell parts of it off for development. But as clumsy as it was, the Fords' waterfront foray got people talking about the Port Lands and woke up the city to their enormous potential. Waterfront Toronto's review is a rare chance to shake things up and reimagine what could happen down there.

The new year promises to be a busy one for Waterfront Toronto. The agency is in the midst of reappraising its plans for the Port Lands, the tract of underused land on the east flank of Toronto harbour that Doug Ford made famous earlier this year with his musings about Ferris wheels and monorails. "The handcuffs are off," Waterfront's chief executive, John Campbell, told reporters in November.
The agency is conducting a sweeping public consultation. It has set up "technical working groups" to look at everything from the real-estate potential of the area to development financing. It is hiring expert consultants to help out. A report will go to city council in June.
"Our intent is to take a fresh and wide-ranging look at the challenges and opportunities of developing the Port Lands," Mr. Campbell says on the agency's website. It is only fair to take him at his word, but what will actually come from all this is far from clear.
At the Dec. 12 consultation, many speakers seemed to want simply to stop any accelerated development and make sure the city sticks with the original plan for the Port Lands, which envisions parkland and mixed low-rise development with a renaturalized Don River mouth running through it. That would be a mistake.
The existing plan is uninspired. It makes poor use of the best chunk of real estate in the city, a prime development site with spectacular views of the downtown skyline and a doorstep right on the harbour. Digging a new channel for the Don through the middle of it would squander that opportunity and wipe out a fortune in commercial value. The plan is unaffordable to boot. No one has a notion of where to find the $634-million that it would cost for a massive engineering project like creating a new river mouth.
What is called for is a really open-minded approach to the future of the Port Lands. Why not put a top-rank hotel down there, as Doug Ford suggested? Why not a high-end shopping area? How about some kind of tourist attraction - if not a Ferris wheel then some other draw for out-of-towners?
As Mr. Campbell himself suggests, there are all sorts of possibilities. The area could potentially become a hub for research-and-development like the MaRS Centre near Queen's Park. Or it could become a new office district like London's Canary Wharf. It goes without saying that whatever shape development takes, plenty of public space would be included, from parks to boardwalks. Think of Hong Kong's Kowloon waterfront, with a broad promenade overlooking the glittering skyline across the harbour.
As for the Don, there may be alternatives to the costly renaturalization plan. An environmental assessment studied several options for controlling the river's floods. Officials are scrutinizing them again.
One idea, promoted by community activist Brian Graff, is to run the river straight south to the Ship Channel, a broad water course with cement walls, and use that as a flood spillway. That would cut down on earth-moving costs. Because the river would not curve west into the harbour, as laid out in the existing plan, it would leave far more of the best Port Lands property intact.
It would be a shame to see the Port Lands push get talked to death in a series of pro forma consultations and technical reports, as so often happens with a postconflict compromise such as this. It would be equally unfortunate if opponents of Mayor Rob Ford fought all change there just to score points.
Ford opponents cheered when the mayor and his brother were forced to drop their plan to seize the Port Lands from Waterfront Toronto and sell parts of it off for development. But as clumsy as it was, the Fords' waterfront foray got people talking about the Port Lands and woke up the city to their enormous potential. Waterfront Toronto's review is a rare chance to shake things up and reimagine what could happen down there. Let's not allow it to slip away in a quicksand of politics and process.

Full text:   University of Alberta's international design competition calls for creative re-imaginings of the often unloved urban fixture
Imagine a strip mall that allows pedestrians to walk up a ramp onto a grassy rooftop to play soccer in the summer and toboggan in the winter.
Picture these mundane suburban retail spaces transformed into greenhouses, outdoor movie theatres or the meeting places for a caravan of food trucks.
Or envision a strip mall that has been stripped to the ground and a new tiny neighbourhood of homes has risen up from the inventory of leftover parts.
These are some of the creative re-imaginings of the ubiquitous and often unloved strip mall. Twenty concepts have made the shortlist in an international design competition dubbed "Strip Appeal," now under way at the University of Alberta.
Architects, designers, academics, students and regular folks from 11 countries - places as far-flung as Australia, Brazil, Egypt, Germany and Iran - contributed more than 100 ideas for 21st century strip malls. They may be the postwar model of suburban retailing, but in many cases the concept is long past its best-before date.
"It's functional, but there's so much lacking," said Rob Shields, the University of Alberta professor who spearheaded the competition. "It isn't something that actually contributes in more than the most minimal way in terms of making life better."
While some ideas might be fanciful, the concepts might not be that far-fetched and could be incorporated in redevelopments throughout the commercial real estate world.
"Things that are viable economically are real contenders to be picked up very fast," added Prof. Shields, who is also director of the university's City-Region Studies Centre, a research unit dedicated to making communities more livable.
In terms of design competitions, the prizes are meagre - $1,000 to the winner, a spot in a travelling road show and a book of designs - but the impact could be significant.
Strip malls have been a fixture of the landscape as development sprawled out from city centres. Arterial roads took workers between their suburban homes and downtown workplaces and asphalt pads were plunked along them to accommodate parking and single-storey retailing. Up sprung rows of convenience stores, pizza joints and drycleaners.
"You drop in, you get your groceries and you get back into your car and you drive home and you drive into your garage and you go into your suburban dream," said Merle Patchett, a postdoctoral fellow at the research centre. "Of course, the suburban dream as we know it has turned a little bit sour."
The suburbs are becoming urbanized. The Internet is transforming shopping. Big-box stores, or so-called "power centres," are replacing small ones. Getting around in cars isn't as easy, and it's expensive. Municipal planners are finally demanding building densification. And younger generations want to live somewhere hip where they can walk to local stores.
"The endless expansion of the commercial strip - that homogeneous cluster of sign clutter and asphalt that leads out from every town - is reaching the end of its useful life," according to Edward McMahon of the Washington, D.C.-based Urban Land Institute, who has written much on the future - or lack thereof - of strip malls.
The problem might be most pronounced in the United States where, between 1960 and 2000, retail space increased tenfold - in some years, it was growing five to six times faster than retail sales, Mr. McMahon pointed out.
Estimates now suggest that 11 per cent of U.S. strip malls are derelict - victims of an outdated mode of retailing and a crumbling economy.
Prof. Shields said his initial research suggests that a strip mall has a 50-year lifespan and in that time, the property is really only successful for the first 15 years. Then, it becomes a matter of land value speculation and tax write-offs.
"Essentially, an owner would need a portfolio of these properties and some would be booming and others would be just carrying," Prof. Shields said. "They're carrying and they're looking for an idea or an opportunity."
Bigger landlords are looking at redevelopment ideas to bring in more people to higher quality tenants, said John O'Bryan, vice-chairman of the commercial real estate firm CB Richard Ellis Ltd.
He points to RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust, which owns and manages Canada's largest portfolio of shopping centres, as one of the leaders in the strip mall revolution.
In a recent management presentation, RioCan told investors that its U.S. expansion is focused on grocery-anchored strip centres and that it has been rezoning its urban properties to accommodate mixed use projects over the last few years.
But Mr. O'Bryan isn't quite ready to pronounce the death of the strip mall.
"Retail evolves anyway," he said. "It is the most fluid of all of the asset classes. If you look at office buildings and industrial buildings, they're not radically different than they were 30 or 40 years ago, but if you look at retail, it is."
A jury of experts will select the winners in the Strip Appeal contest, but the public can also vote early next month at www.strip-appeal.com. The finalists will be announced Jan. 18.
Already some developers have been sniffing around, according to the organizers. "What we see in the potential for these is to reinvigorate the communities," Ms. Patchett said.

Abstract: "It's pretty universally accepted that there's a problem," said John Casselman, adjunct professor of biology at Queen's University. "But we don't know whether we're moving fast enough or doing enough of the right things to solve the problem in time."

Full text:   Canada mulls tighter limits on eel fishery, while scientists try to solve enigmatic decline in Ontario and Quebec
Nothing says Christmas to George Ruggiero and his family like live eels.
In the Ruggieros' holy-day rituals, derived from generations of meat-free meals served in the rugged Italian region of Puglia, hauling the slippery fish home from market is the essential starting point for a Christmas Eve feast that has outlasted the Vatican's old rules on dietary abstinence.
"It's a time when family and tradition and a special occasion all come together," the Toronto real-estate lawyer said as he proudly recited his 81-year-old mother's recipe for celebratory pasta infused with eel juices.
But now this tradition is in danger of disappearing as government agencies contemplate placing tighter limits on a creature that is widely seen to be in a fragile state.
In Ontario, the fish is designated as endangered: A scientific survey last year didn't find a single wild eel. In Quebec, the province has bought back eel-fishing licences to restrict the catch along the St. Lawrence River. In both Canada and the United States, the status of the eel is under official review, with the possibility that both countries could impose crippling restrictions on what remains of the fishery.
"It's pretty universally accepted that there's a problem," said John Casselman, adjunct professor of biology at Queen's University. "But we don't know whether we're moving fast enough or doing enough of the right things to solve the problem in time."
Elusiveness is characteristic of the eel. Aristotle thought it was generated spontaneously from the mud, and Freud began his scientific career fruitlessly searching for the male eel's reproductive organs before choosing a career path that took a less literal approach to sexuality. With their writhing vigour, eels served as a symbol of potency for pagan winter-solstice feasts that were the precursor of Christmas celebrations.
The eel's approach to reproduction, and therefore repopulation, remains something of a mystery: The wriggling fish that shelters in the murky depths and only moves by night, that starts and ends its life clustered in the spawning grounds of the remote Sargasso Sea but spends most of its adult days sheltered along the Atlantic Coast and up its tributaries, has existed for millions of years without giving away its secrets. Even now scientists sheepishly admit they have yet to see it spawn.
Not surprisingly, given the eel's elusive ways and expansive range, it's been hard to find the cause of its apparent decline. Could it be pollution? The numerous dams that block its movement? Overfishing? Illegal poaching to supply China's booming aquaculture trade? Or is the disappearance just temporary, a random dispersal caused by oscillating ocean currents that carry barely visible eel larvae to their scattered habitats?
Regional disagreements add to the complexity of the problem. As well as being a Christmas symbol, the embattled eel now represents the fractures of Canadian federalism, since Maritime fishermen who don't face an eel shortage may soon be asked to give up their livelihood to reinvigorate Ontario and Quebec's lost tradition.
"It's the old global-local conflict," Dr. Casselman said. "But it's accentuated in this species because it's a single breeding stock, which means that eels have to be abundant someplace else and allowed to escape in order to again expand its range."
That spirit of generosity doesn't sit well with Mitchell Feigenbaum, a live-eel distributor based in Port Elgin, N.B., who can't accept that there's a scientific basis for shutting down the Maritime eel fishery.
"We shouldn't be required to make a symbolic or political gesture if they can't establish why their eels have disappeared," he said.
His resistance is supported by research conducted by David Cairns, a PEI-based scientist with Fisheries and Oceans Canada, who challenges the orthodox view that the eel is primarily an upstream freshwater fish in steep decline. Instead, he sees evidence that it may be more plentiful in saltwater than anyone previously imagined.
"Ninety-five per cent of the habitat that we think eels occupy on the East Coast of Canada is not subject to fishing pressure," he insisted. "That's a hint that the fishery may not be a factor in the population dynamic of eels."
That finding in itself doesn't help those who want to restore Ontario's lost eels, or diminish the other problems the fish is facing. "This animal has been around for 125-million years," Dr. Casselman said, "so nothing about it surprises me. There are going to be some eels that are a bit different."
But for those seeking a guilt-free eel feast, it's good news that the ancient symbol of vitality has some life in it still.
"As long as I can remember, this has been the meaning of Christmas," Mr. Ruggiero said. "Without eel, it wouldn't be the same."

Full text:   REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Canada's housing boom is among the most long-lived in the Western world at 13 years, but the next few years could chip away at the gains that have seen the average house increase in value by 85 per cent since 1998.
In a report released Tuesday that said the Canadian housing market was the strongest in the developed world in the third quarter, Bank of Nova Scotia economists said "the slow pace of the global economic recovery, intensifying sovereign debt concerns, weak consumer confidence and high unemployment all continue to weigh on residential property markets" in 10 countries it tracks.
The malaise has already set in. Of the 10 countries studied in the third quarter, average inflation-adjusted home prices were below year-ago levels in seven of them, and above in three (including Canada, where prices are 4.8 per cent higher).
The other countries to post gains were France at 4.4 per cent and Switzerland at 3.3 per cent. The sharpest declines, meanwhile, were seen in Ireland where prices were down 14.7 per cent.
"Canada remained a notable outperformer, though activity here too shows some signs of cooling. Weak market conditions will likely persist well into 2012," economist Adrienne Warren wrote.
"While the combination of low borrowing costs and lower home prices have bolstered housing affordability, there is insufficient domestic momentum in the majority of advanced nations to support a significant revival in demand. An oversupply of housing and a more cautious lending environment also will hold back the recovery."
Merrill Lynch warned Monday that prices could correct by as much as 10 per cent in the next two years in Canada because of weakness in the economy, expressing particular concern about Toronto's condo market.
The Bank of Canada also warned the Toronto market looks overbuilt and could see prices drop.
"The cycle of rising real home prices is long, lasting on average 12 years," Ms. Warren wrote in the Scotiabank report. "Italy's boom was the shortest at eight years, while Ireland and Sweden count 15 years. Canada's ongoing housing boom is in its 13th year ... Canada's residential real estate boom started several years later than many of its counterparts, with the economy still feeling the effects of the deep recession of the early 1990s and weak labour markets through mid-decade."
The report notes that "While the sector's continued buoyancy is impressive, monthly data through November suggest prices have levelled off since the spring, with conditions in the majority of local markets in 'balanced' territory. Ultra-low interest rates are still attracting buyers, but increased economic uncertainty combined with some recent slowing in the pace of hiring could dampen demand in the new year."

Shortchanging immigrants costs Canada

Abstract: "The first thing they look is for Canadian experience," she says. "If you don't have that, they don't call you for an interview. And if you don't get an interview, it's hard to show your skills."

Full text: Royal Bank study finds Canada's economy loses out on $30.7-billion by failing to effectively utilize skilled workers
In her home city of São Paulo, Brazil, Yane Brogiollo was a manager at Hewlett-Packard Co., where she oversaw a team of 15 database professionals. She also designed and taught courses for a local university's MBA program.
They were "wonderful" jobs, and she earned a good salary. São Paolo was crowded, though, and too big. Crime was escalating. So a year and a half ago, she moved to Vancouver, hoping to find a better quality of life.
That hasn't happened. Despite 15 years of IT experience and a master of science degree in computer engineering, 70 job applications have yielded only five interviews and no offers.
"The first thing they look is for Canadian experience," she says. "If you don't have that, they don't call you for an interview. And if you don't get an interview, it's hard to show your skills."
She's not alone. Canada has a well-documented history of attracting the best and brightest immigrants from developing countries. But many of these people wind up jobless, or in minimum-wage survival jobs. And there's a wider economic cost to the country of under-utilizing these skilled workers.
New research by the Royal Bank of Canada, to be published Monday and released exclusively to The Globe and Mail, puts a price tag on that lost opportunity. The study finds that if immigrants' skills were rewarded in a similar way to that of Canadian-born workers, the increase in their incomes would amount to $30.7-billion - or the equivalent of 2.1 per cent of the country's gross domestic product.
Closing the gap with Canadian-born workers would also translate into about 42,000 additional jobs.
"If we are going to continue to flourish and grow as a country, we've got to be very receptive to foreign capital, to foreign thinking and to foreign skills to maximize our potential," Gordon Nixon, the bank's chief executive officer, said in an interview. "I think it is very important that we have that macro discussion, particularly against a backdrop of high unemployment and financial global economic turmoil."
Beyond Canada's moral obligation to dismantle employment barriers, Mr. Nixon argues that underemployment and the persistent wage gap have a huge impact on the economy.
The problem is not just individuals suffering "social injustice or underemployment," he said. Rather, it is about Canada squandering its own growth potential because it delays the ability of newcomers to put down roots by buying homes, saving for their children's education or investing for retirement.
"If you look at what drives the real-estate market, what drives consumer spending - unemployment and wealth and incomes [are] key drivers in terms of that, so it filters right across the economy," said Mr. Nixon.
The study uses details from the last census to calculate the earnings gap between immigrants and Canadian-born workers. It also explores reasons for that gap, which widened between the 1970s and 2000s - even though newcomers' education levels increased. This year's report is a follow-up to one the bank produced in 2005, called The Diversity Advantage: A Case for Canada's 21st Century Economy, which pegged the cost at $13-billion. The new study puts the figure much higher, as its methodology changed to factor in the different educational, demographic and geographic profile of immigrants to Canada.
The problem
The recession was hard on recent immigrants. Employment tumbled 12.9 per cent among new immigrants in the downturn, led by a slump in factory jobs, compared with a 2.2-per-cent drop for Canadian-born workers, Statistics Canada figures show.
As of November, the jobless rate among Canadian-born workers was 6.3 per cent, compared with 8.4 per cent for all landed immigrants and 13.4 per cent for recent immigrants, according to Statscan. Businesses, academics and community leaders are sounding the alarm on this issue - warning that broader Canadian society will pay a steep price if new immigrants continue to struggle with underemployment and a yawning wage gap.
"We need immigrants," said John Tory, the former Rogers Communications executive and past leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, in a recent speech. "We need them in our work force, we need them to sustain and expand not only the labour market, but our consumer market as well. And they want to be here. But there are still significant hurdles to overcome, and we need to come together to find a solution quickly."
Consumer spending accounts for 60 to 70 per cent of the Canadian economy. There is little doubt that underemployment and the sizable income gap facing newcomers have far-reaching consequences for both consumer spending and overall economic growth. Jamil Rehman's story illustrates the cost of underemployment. The electrical engineer speaks seven languages and held a well-paying job in Peshawar, Pakistan. Growing tensions in the region - and word that Canada needed skilled workers - landed him in Markham, Ont. in 2004.
Since then, he's held a series of low-paying jobs, including sales at Wal-Mart and cleaning fish at Sobey's. He has never earned more than $32,000 a year. Mr. Rehman (who asked his name be changed) was laid off from his last job a few months ago and hasn't found work since.
He's trying to get his professional designation as an engineer in Canada, but that requires one year of experience in the country - and so far, no employer has given him a shot.
"I knew, coming here, I would have to work all these odd jobs, which I don't mind for a period of time," he says. "But now, there's a six-year gap, and no one wants to hire me."
The father of two estimates his living standards have fallen by half in Canada - his family has had to rent a basement apartment, buy low-cost food and used furniture. It has put stresses on his marriage. And he wonders if part of the problem is his foreign-sounding name and accent.
Research shows he's right. Resumes with English-sounding names receive, on average, 35 per cent more callbacks from employers than those with foreign-sounding names, a study this fall by University of Toronto researchers found.
Frustration is a common theme. "I came here to give, not only to get," said Endrit Mullisi, a chemist from Albania who immigrated to Canada in 2009. Despite his science background, his main work experience has been in the non-profit sector.
The federal government says it's concerned about the gaps. "I am very worried," said Immigration Minister Jason Kenney in an interview. "My No. 1 preoccupation has been to reduce and eliminate that gap and we are making great strides in that direction."
The solutions
Canada is not the only country that struggles to integrate its immigrants. It fares better than Europe and the U.S., according to a Migrant Integration Policy Index released earlier this year.
But everyone from Mr. Kenney to economists and researchers know there's room for improvement. Mr. Kenney says his department's own evaluation is showing a "turnaround" for some immigrant streams.
Last month, Mr. Kenney announced the number of immigrants admitted under the Canadian Experience Class program was projected rise to 7,000 in 2012 from 2,545 in 2009 - making it Canada's fastest-growing immigration program. It is designed to fast track permanent residency applications for skilled foreign workers who are already in Canada and international students who have graduated from Canadian colleges and universities. Since those applicants have already spent time in Canada, either on temporary permits or student visas, they are considered to be better positioned for labour market integration.
The immigrant wage gap may stem from both real skill differences between them and Canadian-born workers, and labour market inefficiencies that prevent immigrants from making full use of their skills, the RBC study concludes.
Still, assistant chief economist Dawn Desjardins, one of the authors, says evidence on what's driving the gap is "scant."
There are plenty of successes - particularly with programs that help newcomers network and forge connections to the labour market. In Toronto, a half-year mentoring program that matches newcomers with established professionals has resulted in 70 per cent of them finding work in their fields. A new training program at York University aimed at integrating skilled workers into the labour market has already seen 82 people find meaningful work of the 250 enrolled.
Most of encouraging of all, more employers are seeing the benefits of hiring people with global experience. It breeds innovation, they say, and helps bolster their plans to expand internationally.
Waterloo-based Maplesoft Technologies, a unit of Cybernet Systems Co. in Japan, is hiring newcomers to help them compete globally. "Having people that have local knowledge of those markets, for us we felt it's critical," said Jim Dell, vice-president of marketing.
Back in Vancouver, Ms. Brogiollo is waiting for her chance. She hasn't given up on the Canadian dream yet, and has no plans to return to Brazil. But she hopes her luck will turn, and soon.
"I was in a good job in my country - I was recognized. I knew it would be a challenge coming to Canada, and that I would have to be prepared to spend time looking, and adapting. But actually, it has been much harder than I thought."

Full text: Architect Kyra Clarkson brought a desire for preservation to her re-design of a traditional house
jmays@globeandmail.com
To tear down or to renovate: that is the question many owners of old houses ask themselves sooner or later.
There really is no simple answer.
Bulldozing a Toronto dwelling and building again from scratch is expensive. But so is a thoughtful, top-to-bottom make-over by a good architect.
Not that everyone who hankers for a change in living circumstances starts with something top-to-bottom in mind. In the course of researching this column, I have met several people in brand-new homes who initially planned to do nothing more adventurous than knock out a few walls and raise a few low ceilings in their elderly houses. After totting up the numbers, and coming to grips with what was really needed to make their homes livable, however, they decided it wouldn't be that much more costly to rip down the structures, hire architects, and start over.
But fortunately for admirers of the unshowy rhythms of downtown Toronto's streetscapes, homeowners who might be able to demolish and put up something new often end up renovating instead.
They like the feel and exterior look of the big family homes the Victorians and Edwardians gave us, even if some ideas of our ancestors about interior space have become woefully obsolete. The successful renovation of such places requires the talents of a designer with both respect for the past and a firm grasp of contemporary notions about comfortable modern living.
If a certain house I recently visited is anything to go on, Kyra Clarkson, who renovated it, is an emerging Toronto architect with a good handle on both local history and design ideas that sync with urban life nowadays.
This 3,000-square-foot, three-storey family home is not, on the face of it, something I would have thought worthy of salvation. It was put up around 1908 on a street of similarly ample, routine residences south of Forest Hill. The sturdy brick volume spreads almost to the edges of its double-wide lot, and turns a sober, slightly dour face to the street. At the rear a wing extends into the broad garden from one corner, giving the overall plan of the project an L shape. The house belongs to an era when middle-class people had live-in servants: That's who slept in the small rooms under the dormer on the third floor, which is now reserved for guests of the current owners, a professional couple.
If I found it underwhelming, the two people who live there - one a "traditionalist," the other a "minimalist," the architect told me - liked the exterior, and wanted few changes made in its appearance. Ms. Clarkson's one conspicuous external enhancement is a deck out back that extends along much of the house's width.
Most of her energy went into the interior. Yet even here the surgery Ms. Clarkson performed has been subtle. She replaced the floors and created a light, open atmosphere throughout. And though she reduced the number of bedrooms from five to four, the old-fashioned general sense of the original scheme - the clearly articulated sequence of living room, dining room and kitchen on the ground floor, for example - has survived intact.
What makes this renovation interesting is not any single, large architectural move, since high drama was neither needed nor called for. It's rather the accumulation of several modest gestures that bring the house into the 21st century while preserving what made it attractive to its owners. (One of these gestures - invisible, and perhaps not all that modest - was the installation of a geothermal heating and cooling system.)
In the state Ms. Clarkson found it, the kitchen was dark and gloomy. It is now bright, inviting and modern, as her clients, who love to cook, wanted it to be. The massive gas-burning La Cornue stove suggests that they take their cooking seriously indeed, so it's good that they have a pleasant place in which to do it.
The old stairway up to the second and third levels, like the kitchen, was a cramped, unwelcoming feature of the house. For some reason Toronto builders of multi-storey residences, even relatively posh ones like this, often treated stairwells as tiresome things to be done as cheaply and meanly as possible. In her one really bold intervention, Ms. Clarkson ripped out the old flight of steps and replaced it with a floating stair that rises gracefully, like a well-lit corridor, through the volume of the house, lending it a unity it did not have before.
As Ms. Clarkson's quiet but thoroughgoing modernization shows, even a fusty old dwelling like this one can be rescued from obsolescence without gutting its heart and soul.

Compromised, ruthless - an end is near

Author: Doyle, John

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/compromised-ruthless-end-is-near/docview/910089621/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: A new miniseries based in a [Stephen King] bestseller is always an attention-getter but, in truth, King miniseries tend to be plodding. It's movies of his books that work best - the tendency toward long, long exposition has to be curbed. Here - only portions were available in advance - Pierce Brosnan plays the main character, a successful writer whose wife dies in an accident.

Christmas Magic
Sunday, CTV, 9 p.m.
The gist is this: "To gain entry to heaven, a woman must help a man and his young daughter." There is no denying that this sort of holiday entertainment - formulaic and slight though it is, remains enormously popular. Stressed people want a nice story about nice people at this time of the year and usually get it in something like this, a Hallmark Channel production. Lindy Booth plays Carrie, a top event planner in New York. That's a typical gig for someone in need of learning the true meaning of Christmas. Naturally Carrie is a workaholic too. Anyway, after a car accident in a snowstorm, Carrie has a head injury. Then it seems she regains consciousness in Central Park and an older man, Henry (Canadian Derek McGrath), turns up to help her get into to heaven. Her task is to help a widowed restaurant owner, Scott (Paul McGillion), who is suicidal. Of course she's single and he's a nice, well-scrubbed widower.
Stephen King's Bag of Bones
Sunday, A & E, 9 p.m.
A new miniseries based in a Stephen King bestseller is always an attention-getter but, in truth, King miniseries tend to be plodding. It's movies of his books that work best - the tendency toward long, long exposition has to be curbed. Here - only portions were available in advance - Pierce Brosnan plays the main character, a successful writer whose wife dies in an accident. Suffering from loss and ensuing writer's block, he returns to his house in a place that is obviously haunted by terrible forces of darkness. There he broods on the fact that he's been told his wife was pregnant, but he knows it wasn't by him. Jason Priestley turns up to play the overly oily literary agent who is tasked with sorting out the mess of the writer's life. But is he doing good or evil?
Becoming Santa
Sunday, CBC NN, 10 p.m. on The Passionate Eye
Made for Oprah's OWN channel, this doc chronicles the journey of a guy named Jack (part-time actor, part-time real-estate broker) who decides to play Santa for the holiday season. He goes through the entire transformation, from having his beard turned white to attending a "Santa school" for lessons. It's the school segment that is the most interesting, as viewers hear what instructors tell the students they will face from kids and adults. Jack is at first overwhelmed by the job, not to mention exhausted. But along the way he comes to understand what the Santa Claus figure represents to different people. As his journey is documented, we also get much and valuable punditry about the origins of the Santa figure and the development of the Santa myth and marketing in the USA.
Boardwalk Empire
Sunday, HBO Canada, 9 p.m.
It's the season finale for what has been a slow-burning show these past few episodes. Nucky (Steve Buscemi) is beset by rivals and the law as he is forced to be increasingly ruthless in the bootlegging business. His trial, which he has tried to manipulate, is about to get under way. Rival Jimmy (Michael Pitt) inexpertly tries to make alliances. Meanwhile tortured FBI agent Nelson (Michael Shannon) knows the jig is up. His relationship with Lucy (Paz de la Huerta, who is the show's breakout star) is more awry than ever. And Margaret (Kelly MacDonald) - who is supposed to be Nucky's comfort - is compromised, it seems. This will end badly. Stay up and awake after Boardwalk Empire for a sneak peek of HBO's new series Luck , starring Dustin Hoffman and Nick Nolte (HBO Canada, 10 p.m.).

Entrepreneur had an eye for deals of import

Author: Csillag, Ron

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/entrepreneur-had-eye-deals-import/docview/908731718/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "They were good friends for many years," said James. "When my father visited Tokyo, he would be invited for dinner to the family home. In Japan, that's the ultimate honour." In 2000, Cohen was flown to Japan to receive Sony's first Lifetime Achievement award. And this past June, he was awarded Japan's Order of the Rising Sun.

Full text: In 1955, he bought 50 transistor radios from Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo; three years later the company changed its name to Sony
It may not have been very romantic, but Albert Cohen's around-the-world honeymoon turned into the business trip of a lifetime.
It was 1955, and he and his bride were in Japan, which was then gaining momentum in the burgeoning home electronics field. Scanning the English-language edition of Tokyo's Asahi Shimbun newspaper one day, Cohen's eyes settled on an ad seeking distributors for a small local company that had produced one of the earliest transistor radios.
The portable tabletop device pictured in the paper was no larger than a toaster - a far cry from the weighty, vacuum tube pieces of furniture that graced parlours back home. Intrigued, Cohen immediately set up an appointment to visit the company's facilities.
When he arrived at the ramshackle wooden house that served as the factory, he was greeted by Akio Morita, co-founder of Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Ltd.
By this time, Cohen had earned his business stripes, having helped create a family-owned import company in 1939. He had scoured Europe and the United States for dishes, cigarette lighters, binoculars and other household goods. And a few years before his travels in Tokyo, he noticed someone in Vancouver using a Paper Mate pen, tracked down the company in San Francisco, and flew there to meet executives.
In 1952, he signed a deal to bring the world's first fast-drying ink pen to Canada. Within a year, the Paper Mate proved a top seller.
In Tokyo, he paid $1,350 for an order of 50 radios, and sealed the deal with a handshake. Three years later, the small Japanese company changed its name to Sony, and Cohen became the first overseas distributor of Sony products.
The deal paid off magnificently: The Cohen family's stake in Sony Canada was sold to Sony Corp. in 1995 for $207-million.
A canny entrepreneur and big-pocketed philanthropist who died in Winnipeg on Nov. 21 at the age of 97, Cohen will be "forever known as the man who brought Sony to Canada and the world," said his death notice. Cohen became a trusted adviser to the company on accessing markets and retailing outside Japan.
" 'Your word is your bond.' That's the message he drummed into us," said his son James, now CEO and president of Gendis Inc., the family firm. And to his courtly father, a handshake meant more than a greeting.
In fact, in a case that made headlines in 1999, a Manitoba court ruled that a handshake deal between oil and gas magnate George Richardson and Allan MacKenzie, then CEO of Gendis, constituted a valid and binding contract.
"Guided by honesty, integrity and a real sense of noblesse oblige, the modest Mr. Cohen made a difference without raising his voice or seeking personal publicity," wrote the Winnipeg Free Press in noting the death of a virtual household name in the city, but by all accounts, a low-key, media-shy man who was blasé about his success.
Albert Diamond Cohen was born in Winnipeg's North End on Jan. 20, 1914, the third of six sons of Alexander Cohen and Bereka (Rose) Diamond, both of whom had fled Ukraine for Canada in 1905.
The Jewish Historical Society of Southern Alberta relates that Alexander barely eked out a living delivering furniture with a horse and wagon, and later became a country peddler. Albert quit school after Grade 9 and sold shoes to help out at home.
In 1931, he and his father formed A. Cohen and Son, selling candy and chocolate bars to theatres and restaurants throughout Manitoba and northern Ontario.
Albert later said he'd learned salesmanship "the hard way," but at 17, he was able to buy a car for $200.
Most of the clan moved to Calgary in the mid-1930s, where two of the Cohen brothers opened a small retail store. Another brother did the same in Winnipeg. In 1939, they formed General Distributors Ltd., (renamed Gendis Inc. in 1983) acting as sales agents and wholesalers for a variety of products.
In time, all six brothers were involved in the business, each running a regional branch. There was Morley in Montreal, John (Chauncey) in Toronto, Harry in Calgary, Joseph in Vancouver, and Sam and Albert at headquarters in Winnipeg.
When war came, Albert enlisted in the navy. Stationed in Nova Scotia, he never saw combat, but served on small cruisers in Canadian and U.S. waters. It was in the service where he got the idea that the military surplus trade would be a good bet. In 1947, he and his brother Sam opened the first of what would grow to 300 SAAN (Surplus Army, Air Force and Navy) stores across Canada.
Within a decade of General Distributors' founding, annual sales hit $1-million, and the company branched out to real estate holdings, oil and gas properties and retail chains. By the mid-1970s, Gendis was riding high.
As the Winnipeg blog West End Dumplings noted, its portfolio included 51 per cent of Sony Canada, 95 Metropolitan stores, 73 SAANs and 64 Greenberg and W.L. Green stores. Annual sales stood at $137-million. In the 1980s, Gendis acquired the Pomme Rouge clearance store chain in Quebec.
Cohen became a philanthropic powerhouse, contributing to the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Manitoba Theatre Centre, Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, Manitoba Opera and various Winnipeg hospitals and health research initiatives.
As president, he found a new home for the Manitoba Theatre Centre, and at its reopening in 1970, then premier Ed Schreyer handed Cohen the key to the door.
"He was my United Way call," said Winnipeg fundraising dynamo Gail Asper. "He always answered my calls, a true gentleman. [But] he was not an easy sell. You had to really convince him. He wanted to know the facts and was very detail-oriented. If you could convince him, he would always be a generous donor. It was very unusual not to see the Cohen name associated with the major initiatives in this city."
For 25 years, he headed the nominating committee for the University of Manitoba management faculty's (now the I. H. Asper School of Business) International Distinguished Entrepreneur Award, whose recipients have included Ross Perot, Heather Reisman, Martha Stewart and Peter Munk. In 1987, the award went to his old friend, Akio Morita.
"They were good friends for many years," said James. "When my father visited Tokyo, he would be invited for dinner to the family home. In Japan, that's the ultimate honour." In 2000, Cohen was flown to Japan to receive Sony's first Lifetime Achievement award. And this past June, he was awarded Japan's Order of the Rising Sun.
Another close friend, as it later turned out, was James Bond author Ian Fleming. Through mutual friend and fellow Winnipeger William Stephenson, the author of A Man Called Intrepid , Cohen and Fleming first met in London in 1960 and began a correspondence that lasted until Fleming's death four years later.
"I'm probably the only Canadian who knew Ian Fleming as a friend," Cohen said. "He saw something in me that I didn't. For some reason, he seemed to see me as a sort of James Bond character of the business world. He seemed to think that I led an adventurous life as opposed to what he felt was a ho-hum life that he had, even in light of his startling success."
Fleming, who even bought shares in Metropolitan Stores, sent his Canadian friend a rare first edition of Thunderball , and inscribed it, "To Albert D. Cohen - Man of Action. From Ian Fleming."
Eventually, Cohen auctioned his valuable Fleming collection of letters and autographed first editions, and raised $10,000 for charity.
The 1994 entry of Wal-Mart changed Canadian retailing, and cracks began to appear in Gendis. Its Quebec-based MMG Group, which held hundreds of Metropolitan, Greenberg and Pomme Rouge stores, went bankrupt, which was tough on Cohen, his son said. The SAAN chain was sold in 2004 at a huge loss.
Cohen stepped aside as president and CEO of Gendis in 1999, at the age of 87, taking the title of co-CEO. The next year, he reassumed the reins from Allan MacKenzie, who was retiring at age 75. The story's headline in Canadian Business magazine was "Move Over, Sonny."
Infectiously vigorous, he regularly donned his old leather speedskates to whiz around an outdoor oval or inside at the Winnipeg Winter Club. This was not mere recreation: He held three Canadian speed skating records in the over-70 age category. He last skated at 94. His final golf game was at 96.
The Entrepreneurs , one of four books he wrote, was a business bestseller in 1985. He was inducted into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame in 1994. That year, he was promoted within the Order of Canada to officer. (He had been made a member in 1983). Five of the six Cohen brothers were named to the Order of Canada.
Apart from the handshake, "one thing we always talked about was that you're never going to be right 100 per cent of the time," said James. "But if you make more correct choices than incorrect ones, you're ahead of the game."
Cohen leaves his wife of 58 years, Irena (neé Kankova), children Anthony, James and Anna-Lisa and four grandchildren. He was predeceased by his brothers.

Carmel Valley Ranch: It's like summer camp for adults

Author: Matyas, Josephine

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/carmel-valley-ranch-like-summer-camp-adults/docview/907581288/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The menu at Lodge Restaurant reflects executive chef Tim Wood's commitment to sourcing ingredients from local growers, markets and Monterey Bay fisheries, as well as herbs and produce from the resort's organic gardens. The River Ranch Café is a more casual eatery found by the 9th hole of the golf course. Here golfers stop to snack on such casual fare as pizza from wood-fired ovens.

Carmel Valley Ranch
One Old Ranch Road, Carmel, Calif.;
carmelvalleyranch.com. 139 guest suites
from $250 (U.S.) No eco-rating.
Once an enclave for the moneyed and aging tennis set, the Carmel Valley Ranch has recently undergone a zeitgeist renovation: $35-million later, it's an upscale "summer camp resort" targeting families, couples, corporate groups and the premier wedding market. The new owner, billionaire Hyatt heir John Pritzker, infused a nostalgic sense of play into all aspects of the ranch - from tree swings to the kids' splash zone to gourmet s'mores roasted around the outdoor bonfires.
Just a 10-minute drive from Carmel-by-the-Sea, the low-key Carmel Valley is a patchwork of cattle ranches, understated vineyards and small organic hobby farms, sheltered by the rolling Santa Lucia Mountains. Hiking paths and horseback riding trails crisscross the wooded hillsides; becoming one with the outdoors is big here.
DESIGN
I was greeted in The Lodge, the hub of the property, whisked to the check-in desk and served a welcome drink of lavender lemonade. The comfy chairs by the fireplace are perfect for people-watching, but the real action at Carmel Valley Ranch is (you guessed it) outside. The main lodge is encircled by massive, 100-year-old oaks and nearby slopes are planted with rows of pinot grapevines. The property also features 7,500 fragrant lavender plants, which are harvested, the distilled oil used in the spa, rooms and the kitchen.
AMENITIES
More than 200 hectares is a lot of real estate, and in addition to the adult playground at The Lodge (spa, infinity hot tub, outdoor saline pool, poolside cabanas), the resort stretches out into two other distinct areas. The River Ranch is home to fitness and family-centred activities, tennis courts (two of the nine courts are clay) with two on-staff tennis pros, and courts for bocce ball, basketball and volleyball. The second hub is the sunlit Golf Clubhouse, where a lounge overlooks the only course in the Monterey Peninsula designed by world-renowned golf architect Pete Dye. Rated by Golf Magazine as a "must-play" course, the 18-hole, par 70 layout has been restored to its original, playable design with long fairways and spectacular views.
A new 5,200-square-foot fitness facility combines a gym outfitted with cardio equipment and a movement studio for Pilates, yoga, core and spin classes.
The centre also offers TRX suspension training equipment and classes.
Part of the resort's summer-camp philosophy includes a focus on the experiential. Enriched learning experiences include cooking vacations in the Culinary Adventure Kitchen, a tour of the resident beekeeper's hives, kids photography workshops, guided nature hikes, organic gardening and stargazing workshops.
The sleek new Spa Aiyana features 11 treatment rooms (including three for couples) with private patios, steam rooms and fireplaces, and the extensive spa menu incorporates lavender oil harvested from the gardens into wraps, facial treatments and massages.
ROOMS
My one-bedroom suite was built into the hillside and from the large, wraparound terrace it felt like being nestled into the treetops with a panoramic view of the valley, the mountains and a star-splashed sky. The decor was calm and contemporary, with cathedral ceilings, large gas fireplaces in the living room and the bedroom, oversized furniture to sink into, and flat-screen HD televisions backed up by a Blu-ray system (there's a small library of DVDs available at the lodge). An expansive workstation, complimentary wireless Internet and a Keurig coffee maker made it convenient to work in the suite. The king-size bed was topped with Fili D'Oro cotton linens from Italy, soft down pillows and a fluffy duvet. The enormous bathroom, with separate tub and tiled shower, has been upgraded to feature granite countertops, double sinks, and bath amenities designed by an English botanist (using the aforementioned lavender).
SERVICE
The staff are prompt and friendly. I had an in-room breakfast (complimentary on weekends) of pastries, fresh fruit and coffee delivered to my front door within minutes of placing an order.
Housekeeping and maintenance staff arrived via golf cart to quickly sort out a DVD-player malfunction.
FOOD
The menu at Lodge Restaurant reflects executive chef Tim Wood's commitment to sourcing ingredients from local growers, markets and Monterey Bay fisheries, as well as herbs and produce from the resort's organic gardens. The River Ranch Café is a more casual eatery found by the 9th hole of the golf course. Here golfers stop to snack on such casual fare as pizza from wood-fired ovens. With the organic garden a stone's throw from the kitchen, it was an easy decision to choose a luncheon dish skewed toward vegetables. My sourdough veggie panini was piled thick with melted mozzarella and products from the garden - roasted tomato, arugula, eggplant and summer squash. I felt virtuous (and satiated).
THE VERDICT
I was immediately hooked by the large wood-burning fire pits scattered throughout the property. The quiet of the hillsides, the valley views, the deer wandering the grounds and the ahhh factor that permeated from the spa to the suites all spelled relaxation. This is a prime spot for getaways steeped in the laid-back ambience of the valley.

The Action: Locals in the Upper Beach community were among the majority of visitors to this detached, two-storey house, which was available for viewing during two open houses. After about 40 individual showings, offers were presented from a handful of buyers, including one who paid a $75,600 premium.
What They Got: On a 40-by-95-foot lot, this more than 80-year-old brick structure with original and updated features, an attached garage and a private driveway.
* For entertaining, there is a living room with a wood-burning fireplace, a formal dining room, and an eat-in kitchen with a deck, as well as a recreation room with a wet bar in the basement, which also has one of two bathrooms and a separate entrance.
* Designated sleeping areas include a lower-level guest room and three upper bedrooms, including a master suite with leaded glass windows and his-and-her closets.
The Agent's Take: "A lot of people want something south of Queen at the Beach, but when they get there, they realize what you get is so small and they don't get parking a lot of times," says agent Dianne Chaput. "[This] sat on a 40-foot lot and had a private driveway. Most of the properties in that neighbourhood are semis and certainly don't have 40-foot lots."

Full text:   Creative brainstorming, running around and risk-taking help create an artful setting
kdeck@globeandmail.com
Decorating the Christmas dinner table is one of my all-time favourite things. Right up there with mulled wine and the scent of pine boughs is my ritual of settling deep in a chair and thumbing through dog-eared copies of Elle Decor, Martha Stewart Living, and Canadian House & Home.
It's an indulgence, yes, but one that pays dividends. Deciding on a theme is the first step to making an ordinary table enchanting.
Although a big-box retailer can be your friend (more on that in a second), don't wait until you're out shopping to look for inspiration. First, make a commitment to some creative brainstorming, running around, and risk-taking.
This year, one of my team members, designer Lindsay Guenter, was the walking embodiment of all three attributes and her talent was crucial to pulling off the Christmas "tablescape" we'd designed for an elegant dining room in West Vancouver.
The big idea
The clients had requested that we create an artful table setting with the grand atmosphere of an old-world dinner party but little of its formality and polish. The kind of relaxed air you'd experience, dining in, say, a New England country home.
The approach - call it rustic baroque - was inspired by its context. The dining room is wrapped in muslin wallpaper, trimmed with tall baseboards, and finished with crown mouldings. In the centre of the ceiling is a plaster medallion.
Our aim was to avoid diminishing the earthiness of the room, so we decided to forgo traditional metallic emerald and ruby tones. (They'd look garish against so muddy a background.) Instead, we put the focus on a muted palette - distressed wood, tarnished silver, polished silver, pewter, antique gold, and royal blue.
The twist
We wanted a tablescape that nodded toward nostalgia but stopped short of soppy embrace. The dining table was a rough, country piece whose texture underpinned the rest of the room. But the scheme needed a balancing twist, and we hoped to find it in refined elements that would add sparkle and contrast.
Her sights set, Lindsay drove through a rainstorm and spent an entire day scouring the Lower Mainland's best thrift stores. (They're in Langley.) What she found brought our table to life: two silver tea services, a serving dish, six brass candle holders, and two large bags of pinecones someone had grown tired of.
She divided the silver pieces into two groups - those she'd painstakingly polish and those she'd preserve for their perfect blue and bronze patinas.
We then laid the centre of the table, playing with visual balance: polished pieces beside tarnished, brass candlesticks in between. Then we popped fresh hydrangeas and greens into vessels and dispersed among them tea lights in mercury glass and mounds of pinecones.
The big spend
We tried inexpensive dishware and a collection of thrift-store china, but nothing felt right on the table. The cheap plates looked ordinary, the fine china uptight. We wanted old-world feeling, but without all the finery. Something with a traditional style form, uncluttered by patterns or metallic details.
After hours of hunting, we found what we wanted at Vancouver decor mainstay The Cross: eight sets of warm grey dishes and eight linen napkins embossed with a handwriting motif.
The scalloping of the plates related beautifully to the silver of the centrepiece, and the muted hue of the plates and the napkins kept the look quiet and understated. Getting it right cost us about $300, but was worth every penny.
The big save
The tablescape was taking shape, but we couldn't spend as freely on glassware as we had on plates. What I wanted was cut-crystal wine goblets, heavy and ornate. Pieces that would reflect candlelight and add crucial dimension to our colour scheme.
They're the kind of thing you might score at an estate sale or thrift store, but we had no luck. Until Lindsay came through again, that is. Poking around at Homesense, and found two Waterford Crystal glassware sets of four - for $40 each.
The special touches
When all the big pieces are taken care of, it's the small details you can't forget. My favourite small table items are customized place markers and gifts.
Store-bought place markers tend to be cheesy, but it's easy to create unique ones for your table. For ours we used golden tree ornaments - we simply tied the name card to the metal hook. True, the card looks a little wonky, but it adds to the table's imperfect charm.
Instead of Christmas crackers, I like individual presents. For ours we picked up chocolate boxes at a local craft store, put in them one fine truffle and wrapped the box in dark blue paper and ribbons. It's the only hit of colour on the table.

Joint venture condo cuts a new path for development

Abstract: The deal, which was unveiled with much razzle-dazzle, also proclaims that Toronto is now in the business of investing in the schemes of huge residential developers. And never mind that this enthusiasm exposes the city, which already has enough fiscal headaches, to the slide that will surely come, sooner or later, in the local condo market.

Full text:   Build Toronto's deal with Tridel on 75-storey tower takes a novel approach for a difficult site
jmays@globeandmail.com
Despite the housing bust in the United States, and bad jitters about Europe in markets everywhere, Toronto's long-running residential real-estate boom just rolls on and on. As Hogtown developers and investors thrive, however, the city finds itself bleeding red ink from every pore. So why shouldn't our local government jump into the condo game and try to make some money?
Before I propose a couple of reasons why it shouldn't, a glance is in order back to last week, when Torontonians got their first real chance to see what becoming a public-sector speculator in the high-rolling housing market looks like.
Build Toronto, the public agency charged with unloading municipal property, and construction behemoth Tridel announced that they had joined forces to put up a $295-million, 75-storey condominium tower on an awkward site south of Union Station. Fans of the partnership hailed it as a sure-fire money maker at a time when Toronto sorely needs the cash.
On paper, the deal seems good. By selling about 80 per cent of the $5-million property to Tridel, then keeping the rest as an investment, Build Toronto stands to reap an estimated dividend of more than $40-million over the next four years.
How the money will be spent, and how much of the total will actually be passed on by the Crown corporation, are still unanswered questions. (According to published reports, Build Toronto gave the city only $11-million last year on revenues of $21.8-million.)
But for the sake of argument, let's say Toronto gets the whole $40-million and council pours it all into deficit reduction. That sounds like a lot of money - until one factors in the gaping hole in the municipal budget that this dollop is supposed to help plug: about $770-million in 2012 alone.
In addition to doing very little to cure what ails this city, the Build Toronto-Tridel arrangement sends out messages that are, or should be, repugnant to every citizen.
It says any piece of our public realm that can't be made to pay its way financially - whatever its cultural, recreational, historical or aesthetic value - may be put on the auction block, even if the proceeds from the sale are relatively small. Granted, the tiny plot sold to Tridel has no worth of a higher kind. But how sure can we be that Build Toronto really understands the difference between a dispensable muddy patch of public property tucked in among expressway ramps and a park? What part of our common inheritance from the past would they definitely not sell? We need to know.
The deal, which was unveiled with much razzle-dazzle, also proclaims that Toronto is now in the business of investing in the schemes of huge residential developers. And never mind that this enthusiasm exposes the city, which already has enough fiscal headaches, to the slide that will surely come, sooner or later, in the local condo market. If we're lucky, this softening won't happen in the next four years. But does Toronto really need to tempt fate at this point?
Now that I have poured all the cold water at my disposal on Build Toronto's plans, it's time to take a gander at what the people at Tridel intend to do with the place they've bought from us.
The very tall building is being designed by Toronto architect Rudy Wallman. If renderings are to be believed, the shiny, boxy modernist tower will look a little different from its high-rise neighbours on the landfill south of the railway tracks. Vertical panels several storeys tall, composed of angled glass to give them sparkle and extruded (like large bay windows) from the central volume of the building, will be scattered in random patterns across each façade.
The biggest design challenge, the architect told me last week, is what to do with the bottom. The ground, shaped like a pie slice, is hemmed in tightly on all sides
by streets and the Gardiner Expressway. To make life at grade as tolerable as possible, Mr. Wallman (working with landscape architect Janet Rosenberg) will provide ample sidewalks around the triangular podium.
The residential component of the tower has to be boosted above the traffic deck of the Gardiner, so Mr. Wallman will fill the podium with parking spots for residents in the 780 units, and a full floor devoted to fitness rooms, guest suites, an indoor pool and other amenities.
This building is located in one of the most aesthetically tough spots in downtown Toronto. But there aren't a lot of lovely inner-city places left where developers can throw up towers - unless, of course, Build Toronto decides to sell off Nathan Phillips Square.

Winnipeg fans finally get to vent after 15 years of holding a grudge

Abstract: "I never said I didn't want to come here," Doan tried to explain Wednesday after the Coyotes practised at the MTS Centre. "I said I wanted to stay in Phoenix in exactly the same way as if I'd been in Winnipeg for 15 years and someone told me I had to leave. I would have said, 'Hey, this is where my family is from.'"

Full text:   On the NHL schedule it's game No. 360 and one of eight played Thursday night. But to people such as Paul Kuzina, this game means so much more.
It's Winnipeg versus Phoenix. In Winnipeg. At the MTS Centre. For the first time.
"It's going to be a pretty electric atmosphere," said Kuzina, who works in commercial real estate and is a Jets season ticket holder.
"I think there's 15 years of pent-up emotion for a lot of people that's going to let loose."
He and a few hundred thousand other people around here haven't let go of the fact that Phoenix was the place the old Jets fled to in 1996 when hockey know-it-alls said the NHL would never work in an isolated prairie city with a lousy economy. Hockey's future, they said, was in the desert. Now Winnipeg has its NHL team back, transplanted from another hockey wasteland in the deep south, and Phoenix is the place with no team owner, no decent prospects and a struggling economy.
Schadenfreude?
Kuzina was among the couple of thousand Winnipeggers who travelled to Phoenix in October when the Jets played there. He brought a banner, a bunch of friends and just about all the rage he could muster to let loose across the Sun Valley. "Even though we have our team back people still look at Phoenix as 'that's who we lost our original Jets to,' " he said.
Just ask Philadelphia Flyers goalie Ilya Bryzgalov what it feels like to come to Winnipeg after dissing the city from afar.
Bryzgalov infuriated Winnipeggers last spring when, as a member of the Coyotes, he suggested Winnipeg had little to offer and he wouldn't want to move there. When the Flyers came to play the Jets a couple of weeks ago, Bryzgalov apologized profusely before the game and even agreed to take a tour of the city. It meant nothing.
The boos, chants, heckling and cries of "Ilya" rained down constantly during the game. And he didn't even play.
Now it's Shane Doan's turn. The Coyotes captain actually played for the Jets in 1996 just before the team moved to Phoenix, but that won't spare him from the fans' fury over comments he made last season about not wanting to leave Phoenix.
"I never said I didn't want to come here," Doan tried to explain Wednesday after the Coyotes practised at the MTS Centre. "I said I wanted to stay in Phoenix in exactly the same way as if I'd been in Winnipeg for 15 years and someone told me I had to leave. I would have said, 'Hey, this is where my family is from.'"
He knows that explanation won't work.
"Hey, it's what makes sports fun when you have fans that can get into it," he said with a smile. "Anybody that comes into this building, that is playing against them is the enemy and you understand that and love that."
Coyotes head coach Dave Tippett was less charitable.
"Why would there be any booing?" he asked incredulously Wednesday. "I don't understand that part of it. None of these players here were the ones that made the decision to leave."
The Coyotes players have long got used to living with the uncertainty about the future of the franchise, which has dragged on for more than two years. At present the team is owned by the NHL while city officials search for a local buyer. If that doesn't happen soon, the club could move.
"We don't even pretend to cope with it any more," Coyotes defenceman Adrian Aucoin said referring to the constant ownership rumours. "The amount of times last year we heard 'two weeks, two weeks, two weeks.' Now, we don't even talk about it."
For a team with so much disarray at the ownership level, the Coyotes have been remarkably strong at ice level. They arrive in Winnipeg tied for first place in the Pacific Division with a record of 13-7-3. The Jets have lost two in a row and are near the bottom of the Southeast Division at 9-11-4.
"It's going to be a tough game for us," Jets defenceman Zach Bogosian said. He relishes any extra help the crowd can offer including booing the Coyotes as much as possible. "It's not going to hurt us. We are just going to have to make sure right off the bat we get [the crowd] into it."
There are a few Winnipeggers ready to forgive and forget, sort of.
"It's just like another team coming here, personally," said Carey Chartier, a season-ticket holder. "We got a team," he added. "And I think we got a better franchise than if Phoenix would have come here."

Target takes on union as retailer readies launch in Canada

Abstract: Target's blueprint for Canada entails converting about 135 Zellers stores to the Target name by 2013 after letting go all the Zellers employees and starting fresh with newly hired staff - and no union. Currently about 15 of the Zellers stores are unionized. But now, in a test case, the union has applied to the B.C. Labour Relations Board to declare Target as the "successor employer" to Zellers at an outlet in Burnaby, B.C., and keep the employees unionized.

Full text:   RETAILING REPORTER
Target Corp. is locked in a fight to prevent Zellers employees from maintaining their union status, as the discount giant pushes to keep its costs down for its foray into the competitive Canadian retail field.
Target's blueprint for Canada entails converting about 135 Zellers stores to the Target name by 2013 after letting go all the Zellers employees and starting fresh with newly hired staff - and no union. Currently about 15 of the Zellers stores are unionized. But now, in a test case, the union has applied to the B.C. Labour Relations Board to declare Target as the "successor employer" to Zellers at an outlet in Burnaby, B.C., and keep the employees unionized.
"It could be quite a battle," said Richard Chaykowski, a professor at Queen's University's School of Policy Studies in Kingston. "Any decision a government board makes would potentially be only Round 1."
Target and its discount archrival, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., have fought the United Food and Commercial Workers for years as the union attempts to organize the retailers' employees and improve their pay and working conditions. So far, the retailers have managed to keep unions out in North America, although for brief periods the unions have succeeded in organizing some employees.
At stake is Target's low-cost operating model, which relies on competitive compensation and flexibility in scheduling shifts and assigning tasks. A move to unionize workers could hurt that model. Target is taking on the even bigger Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, which has generally been successful in its opposition to unions.
However, Target in Canada is now facing a well-entrenched principle in labour laws that calls for a successor company in a takeover to hold on to a union if the firm is operating in the same area.
"The whole purpose of successor rights protections are to prevent this sort of thing from happening," said Steven Barrett, a lawyer with employee law specialist Sack Goldblatt Mitchell LLP.
Lisa Gibson, a spokeswoman for Target, said it believes that Target's $1.8-billion acquisition of Zellers leases "is a real estate transaction and not the acquisition of a business, technology or employees. As such, we do not believe Target is a successor employer under applicable law and do not believe that there was reasonable cause to file a successorship application."
Target will contest the union's B.C. application, she said. It's not clear how many Zellers locations could be affected by the dispute.
Starting next year, Target plans to close its Zellers stores for six to nine months for major renovations, and re-launch them - beginning in March of 2013 - as Target outlets.
Mr. Barrett said provincial successor rights provisions are designed to protect unionized employees in the case of a temporary shutdown because of an ownership change if the switch is in virtually the same area of operations. Other provinces also recognize the "fundamental" protection of successors rights, he said. "You can't let those rights disappear simply because the business gets sold."
Ivan Limpright, president of Local 1518 of the UFCW, which applied to the B.C. labour board earlier this month, said the union aims to ensure that Target honours its legal obligations and continues to employ its 120 Zellers members. The union is negotiating the renewal of its collective agreement for staff at the Zellers outlet at Brentwood Mall in Burnaby, B.C.
Prof. Chaykowski said unions have faced an uphill battle in organizing retail workers, partly because they are highly transient and because the sector is so competitive, with razor-thin profit margins. Target feels tremendous pressure to remain union-free to help keep costs down, he said.
In June, a Target store in New York voted against joining the largest retail union in the U.S. Labour organizers had hoped a vote to join the union would encourage other retail workers to follow suit.
While Wal-Mart has agreed to work with labour unions in some parts of the world, it has fiercely opposed unionization in North America. When workers in Jonquiere, Que. voted to unionize in 2005, Wal-Mart shut down the store. in Quebec. After butchers at a Jacksonville, Texas, Wal-Mart voted to unionize in 2000, Wal-Mart dropped all U.S. meat-cutting departments.

NHL LOOKAHEAD: NOV. 28 - DEC. 4

Author: Shoalts, David

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/nhl-lookahead-nov-28-dec-4/docview/906148329/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: One of [Wayne Gretzky]'s major endorsement deals is with TD. Before TD sold its 13.5-per-cent share of MLSE to the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan last May, its executives often asked Gretzky about one day joining forces with the Leafs' parent company. But these discussions always came up at various corporate schmoozes and never went beyond the informal stage.

dshoalts@globeandmail.com
WHAT'S AHEAD FOR MLSE
Now that sale rumblings have quieted, the Leafs' owner can go back to its other corporate priorities, including finding a new boss
Now that Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan is going to hang on to its 80-per-cent share of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, the company can come out of its state of suspended animation.
The to-do list, roughly in order, is to resume the search for a successor for retiring president Richard Peddie who will depart on Dec. 31, pray for the return of goaltender James Reimer in the next few days to keep that Toronto Maple Leafs playoff bandwagon moving toward a cash bonanza in the spring, get ready to rake in millions, probably from Bell Media, in a new radio deal and quietly, very quietly, hope the Toronto Raptors lose as much as possible in the lockout-shortened NBA season so they can get the first overall draft pick in 2012. Then, once all of that is out of the way, get started on that regional sports network for which MLSE already has a licence, tentatively called Real Sports, which will combine Leafs TV, NBA TV Canada and Gol TV, as first reported by The Globe and Mail more than a year ago. But more about that later.
First, the search is officially back on for a new president, although MLSE types are keeping quiet about potential candidates. Maybe that's because the front-runner internally is Tom Anselmi, MLSE's chief operating officer.
Anselmi has been working hard to get the job since Peddie announced his plan to retire Dec. 31. Peddie was going to leave as early as July 1 but agreed to stay when Teachers' put its shares up for sale. But now that Teachers' is staying, Peddie will definitely leave on Dec. 31, according to an MLSE source.
At this point, it looks like Anselmi will either be named acting president or assume Peddie's duties and keep his title as COO in a sort of audition for the top job until a permanent president is named. The rest of the management team will remain in place.
The trouble with finding a new president for MLSE is the same as finding a buyer for Teachers' share of the company: There are few qualified candidates. MLSE's varied holdings require expertise in a lot of areas, from sports to media to real estate.
In the NHL, for example, the most obvious candidate is Tim Leiweke, president and chief executive officer of Anschutz Entertainment Group, which operates the Los Angeles Kings in addition to other sports teams, the LA Live entertainment venue and various arenas around the world.
He has a friendly relationship with Peddie and MLSE. But he's worked for Philip Anschutz for many years and probably has an equity position in his company which would complicate a move to Toronto.
The radio rights for the Maple Leafs come up for auction at the end of this season. Even though AM 640, the present holder, is not expected to bid, MLSE can anticipate a sharp increase in the current fee of $1.5-million a year. Bell Media sees those rights as the key to the future of its sports radio station in Toronto, TSN Radio 1050. What remains to be seen is how eager Rogers Communications is to get them for its own station, Sportsnet 590 The Fan.
As for a regional sports television network, MLSE is biding its time until 2015 when the Leafs' local television rights expire, since those are the ones that will make this venture pay. The important stuff, the licence, is already in place, so the company has four years to build Real Sports into a network as successful as its sports bar namesake.
Like Peddie told The Globe and Mail in October of 2010: "Imagine a channel that had Leafs, Raptors, TFC and Marlies games on it. Imagine what you could charge for that."

FIVE GAMES TO WATCH
Predators at Oilers
If you're interested in the NHL's trophies, this one has some candidates going head-to-head. Calder candidates as top rookies are Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, above, of Edmonton and Craig Smith of Nashville. Both Nikolai Khabibulin of the Oilers and Pekka Rinne of the Preds will get votes as top goalie, while Nashville blueliner Shea Weber is a favourite for the Norris as best defenceman. Monday, 9:30 p.m., Sportsnet-West.
Penguins at Rangers
Sidney Crosby's comeback takes him to the Big Apple but there's another reason to watch this one. It is the first game for the Penguins agitator Matt Cooke against the Rangers since he was suspended for 10 games last regular season, plus the first round of the playoffs, for a head shot on Ryan McDonough of the Rangers. Tuesday, 7:30 p.m., TSN2.
Penguins at Capitals
This is the first Crosby-Ovechkin showdown of the season. It's also the first Washington-Pittsburgh game since the Arron Asham, above, of the Pens KO'ed Jay Beagle of the Caps in a preseason fight. Beagle only started skating recently. You'll need the Centre Ice package or a good sports bar to see it. Thursday, 7 p.m., NHL Network-US, Root TV.
Coyotes at Jets
Here it is, the first visit by the former Jets to the home in Winnipeg they abandoned in 1996. If it is possible for a crowd to boo for the entire 60 minutes of a game, it will happen here. Thursday, 8:30 p.m., TSN-Jets.
Flames at Oilers
Edmonton's youngsters are trying to stay in playoff contention while Calgary is merely trying to stay afloat. But it's the Battle of Alberta, so this one should be emotional. Saturday, 10 p.m., CBC.
**********
COMING AND GOING
Larry Tanenbaum
When the NHL's board of governors gather for their annual pow-wow on Dec. 5 and 6 in Pebble Beach, Calif., it will be the first time Toronto Maple Leafs chairman Larry Tanenbaum attends as a new power in the league. An NHL source says Tanenbaum was named to the 10-person governors' executive committee, the one that has a role in every big decision. The Leafs were shut out of the halls of power for many years by commissioner Gary Bettman despite their status as the richest team because they were moderates in the 2004-05 lockout. The freeze officially ended when Bettman filled a committee vacancy with Tanenbaum.
Randy Carlyle
Randy Carlyle passed the 500-game mark as head coach of the Anaheim Ducks in late October, the longest tenure in franchise history. But not many are betting Carlyle will hit 600. He's the latest NHL coach on the hot seat, thanks to the six-game losing streak and one win in 13 games the Ducks took into their game Sunday against the Maple Leafs.
*******
POWER BROKERS
Providence did not have Gretzky on its side
If the Toronto Maple Leafs ever do get a new owner, do not expect Wayne Gretzky to automatically be part of the mix. Somehow that notion was planted when it was mistakenly reported Gretzky was approached by Providence Equity Partners to be part of a bid for Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment.
Gretzky's representative, Darren Blake, said Sunday that Providence never approached him and the other groups that did were "people kicking tires."
It turns out the key party in this drama, Toronto-Dominion Bank, was never mentioned in any of the stories about this. For almost all of the discussions - and they were all informal - about Gretzky taking a role with MLSE were with TD.
One of Gretzky's major endorsement deals is with TD. Before TD sold its 13.5-per-cent share of MLSE to the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan last May, its executives often asked Gretzky about one day joining forces with the Leafs' parent company. But these discussions always came up at various corporate schmoozes and never went beyond the informal stage.
Gretzky never jumped up and said, "Yeah, let's go," only that he would be interested under the right circumstances. The right circumstances would be a version of the deal he had with the Phoenix Coyotes, where he was essentially paid to be a minority owner and he would only have to make a few appearances a year for the Leafs.
When TD was looking at selling its stake in MLSE, it told some prospective buyers that Gretzky would be a good person to have on board. A few of those buyers put out feelers to Gretzky and received a polite but non-committal response. None of those buyers was named Providence Equity Partners.
All of that chatter ended a long time ago and ceased entirely when TD sold its stake in MLSE but, Blake said, "somehow the whole thing got carried away."
*******
SPEAKING OF COYOTES ...
Thursday is deadline day for Glendale, Ariz., to come up with an owner who will buy the Coyotes from the NHL and keep them in the Phoenix suburb. But don't expect the NHL to stick to its deadline. Why start now?
It's hard to meet a deadline if there is no owner in sight. An NHL source who keeps an eye on the situation says it isn't clear if Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf is still in the picture. Former San Jose Sharks president Greg Jamison is said to have a conditional deal but one of the major conditions is that he raise the money, which is proving to be a challenge.

Full text:   Designed by celebrated architect Ron Thom, Caledon home roosts above the Credit River
The listing
Asking Price: $2.8-million
Taxes: $4,688.06
Agent: John Dunlap (Moffat Dunlap Real Estate Ltd.)
The back story
Stuart Horne planned to become a farmer when he left the Yorkshire dales in 1949 to emigrate to Canada. But Mr. Horne studied at McGill University, turned a couple of corners, and made his way to the world of finance.
"On his first boat ride over the called himself a farmer," says his daughter, Bridget Colman, of her late father. "Five years later, he called himself an economist. You could do that in Canada."
As his success on Bay Street grew, Mr. Horne still yearned for the rolling landscape he had left behind. In the 1970s, he bought 25 acres of land severed from a farm in Caledon.
Ms. Colman recalls being about four years old when her father led her up a steep hill through the farm's apple orchard and told her that he planned to build a house on top of the ridge. It was an amazing chunk of countryside, with the Credit River flowing along the southern boundary. Across the valley stood a slice of the Niagara Escarpment known as the Devil's Pulpit.
"You sit on just under 30 acres and yet you feel like you're on 500. You've got the whole escarpment," says Ms. Colman. "It's such a unique piece of property that to put something standard on it would be a tragedy."
And so Mr. Horne found his way to one of Canada's most pre-eminent architects of the day, Ron Thom. A friend brought the two together and the partnership flourished.
"He chose an architect that intellectually he believed in, and it just worked," says Ms. Colman. "It's not that my parents could speak the language so much - it was that they had the intention."
Ms. Colman says her parents were both very involved in the design of the house but her father also knew when to let the professional reign.
"He would choose someone who was good at what he did and just let him go," she says.
The architect designed a house that seems embedded into the hillside. "Ron Thom really read the environment," says Ms. Colman.
Visitors arrive to a foyer that leads into a living room with views far into the distance.
"The front door - it's not that it pulls you to the view - but you know it's there waiting for you."
The living room, dining room, kitchen and family room are located together, while a hallway leads to a secluded master suite with a private balcony overlooking a meadow.
Stairs lead to a lower level where the children's bedrooms each have large windows with views across the land.
A later addition created a separate wing for a home office.
Respected landscape designer Lois Lister created the gardens.
Ms. Colman says she and her siblings attended the local school in the nearby town of Belfountain. They also spent much of their time roaming the forests and hills on the property. For years the kids swam in the river before her parents had an in-ground pool built up beside the house.
Her father loved to ride and the family kept their horses in the meadow beside the river. When her father became ill in his later years, he sent his horse Sir Jeffrey to Ms. Colman, who has her own country property north of New York City.
The house today
During the 1970s, as the friendship between the Hornes and the Thoms grew, young Adam Thom would sometimes accompany his father to the house.
The younger Mr. Thom, who is now a Toronto-based architect himself, recently revisited the property and was struck by how well suited the building fits the dramatic setting.
"I had forgotten how breathtaking the site is," he says. "The house is wonderfully sited and woven into the landscape."
Mr. Thom says his father - who designed Massey College at the University of Toronto among other landmark buildings - had completed many, many houses by that stage of his career.
He adds that the house seems quite modest by today's standards when some people are building huge country estates. But he points out that the plan was well-suited to a family that wanted modern, open principal rooms while keeping some separation and privacy.
The expansive master suite, Mr. Thom says, is one of those revelations. There's also a secret passageway leading to the basement built in behind one of the fireplaces.
"You could run and disappear at different ends. It's full of surprises and all that great stuff," he says.

A condo design set to a different beat

Author: Kelly, Deirdre

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/condo-design-set-different-beat/docview/905963886/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Kravitz Design doesn't have a signature style in the sense that you can look at different projects that we've done and it might not look like the same firm did them, which I think is one of our strengths. But there is definitely a sensibility that runs through them all that gives each project the Kravitz Design feel. [Bisha] will be a unique project that will evolve from the collective desires of myself, [Charles Khabouth], and the other Bisha partners.

Full text:   Rocker, actor, real estate investor set to lend Toronto builder a stylish hand
Lenny Kravitz is a house musician in more ways than one. While well-known as a pop star who has scored four Grammy awards with hit songs like Fly Away and Dig It , he is also something of a real estate mogul with a history of buying and flipping big-ticket residential properties he fixes up himself under the banner of his New York-based Kravitz Design, Inc. Last year, he sold a 6,000 square foot SoHO duplex he renovated - with the addition of two suspended glass staircases and terrace with wood-burning fireplace - to singer Alicia Keys and her then fiancé Swizz Beatz for a reported $12.750-million (US), a price that was considerably more than the estimated $7-million he paid for the property in 2001. Today he lives in Paris in a townhouse he decorated in his signature sexy style. He also owns properties in New Orleans, the Bahamas and Brazil.
Kravitz also has Hollywood blood in his veins - his late parents were the producer Seymour Kravitz and the actress Roxie Roker ( The Jeffersons ). He played a hospital nurse in the Oscar-winning fim Precious and will return to the screen in the upcoming and hotly anticipated The Hunger Games , in which he plays a stylist tasked with preparing child gladiators for the arena.
After overseeing the design of downtown Miami's Paramount Bay condo project among other interior design assignments, Kravitz's next gig is Bisha, a new condo-hotel in Toronto. It is partly owned by Charles Khabouth, a local restaurant and night club owner, who commissioned Kravitz to create a specialty floor for the building, currently in the pre-building stages of development.
As a multifaceted artist playing writing and producing all your own songs you have said that when creating music you are writing for yourself. As founder and head of Kravitz Design Inc., your New York-based residential and commercial interior design firm, is the same true: do you also design for yourself, no matter who the client?
My first priority is to understand my client and their vision. Then I create my world within that concept. It's like producing someone else's music. It is my job to bring out what they are looking for in a new and exciting way that they might not have realized.
You seem to have a thing for Canadians: scoring a Top 50 hit out of your remake of The Guess Who classic, American Woman, collaborating with Canadian rapper Drake on your latest release, Black and White in America, and now joining forces with Toronto entrepreneur Charles Khabouth to create a specialty floor for his new BISHA Hotel and Condo project. How did you meet each other and what made you decide to work together? Do you have a shared vision for the specialty floor?
Charles and I met through a mutual friend. He had heard about Kravitz Design and was curious enough to take a meeting. After speaking for a few minutes I saw that we had a lot of the same tastes in art, fashion, and design. He is an interesting gentleman and I saw that he really wanted to create something very special with Bisha. After this meeting I think we both walked away knowing that it would be a pleasure to work together and began to move forward. Our sensibilities for the specialty floor are vey much in line with each others thinking.
You have homes around the world -- the Bahamas, Brazil, and Paris, the latter where you've lived for the past few years after relocating from New York; how do your environments influence your design aesthetic? How will Toronto inspire you?
I am inspired by everywhere that I go. My repertoire is built on my travels and experiences. I can draw inspiration from the Opera in Paris to a shack in a favela in Rio. Style is style. I've obviously been to Toronto many times but I will be observing it with new eyes for this project.
If Kravitz Design Inc. has a signature style what is it, and how will it translate to the BISHA project?
Kravitz Design doesn't have a signature style in the sense that you can look at different projects that we've done and it might not look like the same firm did them, which I think is one of our strengths. But there is definitely a sensibility that runs through them all that gives each project the Kravitz Design feel. BISHA will be a unique project that will evolve from the collective desires of myself, Charles, and the other Bisha partners.
Condos are more than apartments these days; they are lifestyle statements combining residential living with the boutique hotel experience as BISHA is planning. How might buying a condo with a hotel attached intrigue you?
Well, I live in hotels for a living and I become accustomed to the services that I get from fine hotels. But then of course I want to go home. Mixing home with the services and amenities of a hotel is a fabulous lifestyle. This you don't get from a traditional condo.

City will be Tridel's partner in condo

Author: Church, Elizabeth

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/city-will-be-tridels-partner-condo/docview/905662747/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Councillor Doug Ford, the mayor's brother and vice-chair of Build Toronto, said the investment will allow the city to increase its return ninefold compared with the money it could collect through a simple land sale. "I'll take that any day. When there is that much profit sitting on the table, we wouldn't be very prudent business managers if we turned our head on this opportunity," he said.

Full text:   The City of Toronto is making a bet on the waterfront's high-rise condo boom, predicting it can make more than $40-million by investing in a proposed 75-storey tower development on a vacant sliver of city land.
Build Toronto, the city-owned company charged with selling surplus property, is teaming up with residential developer Tridel to invest in a new skyscraper on a pie-shaped city lot at York and Harbour Streets. If approved as planned, the project will join a cluster of nearby skyscrapers, part of a wave of development on land south of the railway tracks and will rival a new building at College Park as the city's tallest condo tower.
The joint venture - a first for Build Toronto - is designed to boost profits from real estate sales by giving the city a portion of the returns from development. It's a model that the fledgling company, charged with generating revenue for the cash-strapped city, plans to use on future deals, said Build Toronto's chief executive Lorne Braithwaite.
"The market is hot as a pistol and we are about to generate funds for the city and create a fantastic new development," he told reporters Tuesday. "From Build's perspective, pardon me for saying it, this is one hell of a deal."
Councillor Doug Ford, the mayor's brother and vice-chair of Build Toronto, said the investment will allow the city to increase its return ninefold compared with the money it could collect through a simple land sale. "I'll take that any day. When there is that much profit sitting on the table, we wouldn't be very prudent business managers if we turned our head on this opportunity," he said.
Under the deal, Build Toronto will use proceeds from the land sale to become a 20-per-cent partner in the development, with Tridel holding the remaining stake. The city will receive its first payment next year and is expecting to collect more than $40-million over four years.
Architect Rudy Wallman expects the project will be completed in six years.
Local councillor Adam Vaughan agrees the site is suited to a tall structure, but said the joint-venture model turns the city into a real estate speculator and creates a conflict of interest as the building goes through planning approvals.
Preliminary designs, he said, includes a floor plan that is bigger than city standards and the project exceeds height restrictions for the site. Plans for aboveground parking also require zoning changes, all measures, he said, that will see the city negotiating with itself as regulator and developer. Any changes requested by staff could affect the city's potential returns, said Mr. Vaughan, a frequent critic of the Ford administration.
"It's not my job to guarantee investment," he said. "It's up to us to negotiate what is in the best interests of the neighbourhood."
Tridel president Leo DelZotto said the joint venture allows the city to share in the profits of a growing real estate market. "This is a very important step for the city," he said. "An outright sale is a one-time gain that day that you close the deal."
Sharing in the profit also means the city is exposing itself to risk if the condo boom goes bust. But Mr. Braithwaite said the deal's structure limits the city's risk. The estimated value of the property, once the city's impound lot, is just under $5-million, he said, making the potential returns very attractive.
Build Toronto returned $12-million to the city last year and has closed four deals this year, with five more in the works, not including Tuesday's announcement, he said.
With more than $16-billion worth of real estate on the books, Doug Ford said the new joint venture represents a creative way of solving the city's financial problems. He praised Build Toronto, an organization he has criticized in the past for not moving quickly enough, for getting value out of the site, which is just over half an acre.
"They turned a lemon into lemonade, and what great lemonade, to the tune of $40-million for the city's coffers," he said.

A fresh breeze amid convention

Author: John Bentley Mays

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/fresh-breeze-amid-convention/docview/904454749/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "I love to play with borders," he told me. "It pushes my clients and myself and my team to explore the limits of the system. If we don't stay in full consciousness of what's around us, and we start to be comfortable, the projects will not be so interesting. It would be better to become a businessman and make money. For me, architecture is political engagement."

Full text: Didier Faustino regularly questions every piety and transgresses boundaries - and gets short shrift from the rich and powerful
jmays@globeandmail.com
Generally speaking, the speakers featured in this year's Bulthaup lecture series at the University of Toronto's architecture school are professionals on the cutting edge of contemporary design and theory. But not many of them slice larger hunks out of the conventional wisdom about what architects are supposed to be and do than Didier Faustino, who will present his work and tell his story as part of the series on Tuesday evening.
Born in France and based in Paris, Mr. Faustino actively pursues a career as an architect, while also showing works of visual art. He has engaged in numerous design competitions since finishing school in the late 1990s, but most of his proposals - often beautifully imaginative and daring - have been too provocative to get built. And even the name he has given to his small practice, Bureau des Mesarchitectures, is an irreverent gesture toward his profession: it sounds, in French, like "office of misadventure."
But if he doesn't fit any stereotype in either the art scene or the field of architecture, Mr. Faustino blows through both worlds like a fresh breeze. He questions every piety and persistently transgresses boundaries. He has used the occasion of an embassy competition, for example, to criticize the deceit and prevarication involved in much international diplomacy. And, in executing one of his few realized projects, a community meeting place in South Korea, he has backed local resistance to official schemes to bulldoze a squatter settlement in the neighbourhood. University of Toronto students may not learn much about winning big commissions from Mr. Faustino's lecture, but they will likely get a moral lift from seeing the work of so politically forthright an architect.
"I will really focus on one idea in Toronto," he told me by phone last week. "It's the fragile membrane between private and public, between the collective and individual. The way we develop a project is to try to make something visible as an object or position or situation, then go to a different symbolic plane, developing something more conceptual, more hidden and dangerous. This danger is really positive, because without it life is really monotonous."
The strategy comes straight out of the social and cultural vociferousness of the late 1960s and the left-wing conceptual art of the 1970s - though Mr. Faustino, who came into the world in 1968, was too little to take part in the revolution.
"It's funny," he said. "I grew up in this period, in a family absolutely not interested in contemporary art or architecture. It came to me a bit later, this spirit of political engagement. The 1980s were cynical, and so were the 1990s. But this spirit is coming back now, in a reboot of engagement, and it seems to me to have a kind of elegance,"
Given his embrace of such attitudes, it's not surprising that Mr. Faustino gets short shrift from the rich and powerful.
"A commission starts to be unacceptable when I cannot make visible the question of power - when it's an invitation to camouflage or hide domination. Of course, we didn't win the embassy competition, but it was really about freedom, a way of thinking about what is really important in art and architecture. We need artists and architects who reveal what is wrong, what is not working out, what is an unacceptable situation. I do it my way. My projects are my weapons."
If all that makes this designer sound too pugnacious and moralistic ever to land a job, it's worth noting that he occasionally finds an assignment that satisfies his exacting demands. He's now at work on a small house in Spain, for example, and he is doing a nightclub in France - the latter being a place of what he calls "seduction and freedom and animality." (He is French, after all.)
Mr. Faustino's most incisive and eloquent projects, however, tread the borderline between art and architecture, and do strange things at the interface between public and private spaces. Take, for instance, a recent two-part installation - one version was realized in New York, the other in Los Angeles - in which he transformed the galleries into territories that resembled, in a nutshell, the typical public-private relationship in their respective cities.
To do this, he deployed chain-link fencing, topped with barbed wire, to demarcate the boundary between inside and outside. In New York, this move took the form of a threatening barrier - a visible manifestation of a hard, invisible line that New Yorkers instinctively respect. In Los Angeles, on the other hand, the fencing creates an open passageway - a symbol of the more fluid, mobile sense of space in that city.
"I love to play with borders," he told me. "It pushes my clients and myself and my team to explore the limits of the system. If we don't stay in full consciousness of what's around us, and we start to be comfortable, the projects will not be so interesting. It would be better to become a businessman and make money. For me, architecture is political engagement."

Stepping stones to a stunning room

Author: Deck, Kelly

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/stepping-stones-stunning-room/docview/904454729/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The Caulfeild home had light walls and ceilings, and sunlight streamed into it during the day. An airy room, though, threatens to float away. It's important to ground it with a weighty architectural element, like a stone or concrete fireplace. We chose concrete for its contemporary look. A stacked stone façade would have felt too much like an alpine resort. Working with a local concrete artisan, we custom designed the façade to feel proportionate in this overscale space.

Full text: Decorative minutiae, sweeping lines and enduring finishes add up to design success
kdeck@globeandmail.com
We've been on a year-long streak of designing and building traditional-style homes. Construction on one - a 6,100-square-foot home in West Vancouver's Caulfeild neighbourhood - has now wrapped, and we moved furnishings in last week. The client, a long-time home builder in the area, asked us to decorate it to sell on the fall market.
When we designed the home last fall, the clients had several requests. They wanted the timeless formality of a traditional interior, but hoped the space would feel easy for a busy family. That meant two things. The design scheme needed fine detail, but not so much that it felt fussy. And its maintenance requirements had to be low.
Our team spent a long time discussing how much character detail would be right. We wanted to juxtapose the decorative minutiae with sweeping lines and enduring finishes. The living room is a good example of the balance we achieved. Here are some questions we had to answer on the way to doing it.
Why do a coffered ceiling?
Our living room is part of a great room - a shared living room, dining room, and kitchen. The entire space is long and narrow. It's 22 by 50 feet and twice the size of my Vancouver apartment.
In a modern home, where you want the atmosphere pared down and austere, a flat ceiling is best. But in a traditional home, broad swaths of ceiling make a home feel vacant. (In either space, imperfections in the drywalling are painfully clear.) To add architectural detail, we designed an oversize grid of decorative six- by six-foot beams that we finished with crown moulding. This traditional detail elevates the character of the room and prevents it from looking "builder basic."
Why the unusual flooring choice?
We used white oak hardwood throughout the home and had it stained, on site, matte grey. Doing the staining in the home - rather than the more common method of using prefinished product - allowed our design to team to work with the finisher to achieve the perfect colour. We spent a full morning reviewing test patches. The disadvantage of this method is the delay. A stain-on-site floor needs several days to cure, and little other work can take place in the home in that time.
We chose a mid-tone grey stain in a flat finish. The reason is its forgiveness of scratches, dust, and wear. Darker floors, although rich and sumptuous, reflect more light and so become a canvas for imperfections. They need more maintenance.
Why the concrete fireplace?
The Caulfeild home had light walls and ceilings, and sunlight streamed into it during the day. An airy room, though, threatens to float away. It's important to ground it with a weighty architectural element, like a stone or concrete fireplace. We chose concrete for its contemporary look. A stacked stone façade would have felt too much like an alpine resort. Working with a local concrete artisan, we custom designed the façade to feel proportionate in this overscale space. Once we'd finalized the design, he mocked up one side of the fireplace in foam and we fine-tuned from there. I'm very happy with the result. The façade is beautiful and velvety, yet strong.
Why is the millwork so large?
As I've often said, one of the great investments you can make in a home is custom millwork.
We put floor-to-ceiling cabinets on either side of the fireplace for three additional reasons.
First, open bookshelves are great for the display of books and framed art.
Second, they create storage for blankets, games, and other children's playthings. And, third, the lower cabinets provide a home for electronic equipment. (Their interior depth is a uniform 22 inches.)
We debated whether it was better to match the millwork's finish to the floors (which would have increased visual weight) or to go with paint-grade white. We decided on the white to maintain the airiness of the atmosphere, counting on the fireplace and furnishings for their heft.
How did you choose your furniture plan?
Our aim was to create a room that easily did double duty: Comfortable enough for family lounging, elegant enough for entertaining.
The symmetrical arrangement of the furniture gives the room its formal feel - twin sofas across from each other another, matching chairs adjacent, and a large ottoman in between.
The tailored look of the upholstered pieces keeps the room looking polished, and the ottoman acts as a great footrest when lounging.
The chairs' patterned slipcovers create interest when you happen to glance into the living room from the dining room and kitchen.
In each corner of the room sits an open-frame side table with a substantial lamp. We selected the side tables for their farmhouse feel; the chunky lamps give the space weight, balancing out the dark grey flannel of the sofas. In the evening, with all four lamps aglow, the room is deliciously inviting.
Aren't those drapes too long?
Ordinarily, I'm no fan of romantic indulgence in interiors, but when my star designer Lindsay Guenter suggested pooling drapery for the living room, I knew it was an inspired call.
Pooled drapes are made about six inches too long so that they spill onto the floors.
It's a luxurious touch normally made (in silk or satin) in formal living or dining rooms.
But here, in linen, it looks pert and unapologetically casual. Perfect.

Abstract: This place is basically an open invitation to sloth and sensuality for those who can afford its spoils. Sense, the Rosewood Spa at Jumby Bay, goes all out when it comes to all-day pampering. I check into this open-air sanctuary for the Sea Coral and Coconut Ritual, where my therapist greets me not so much with a handshake but a "hand-hug" - a sure sign this massage is going to be good.

Full text: The treatment
Jumby Bay feels like that summer house you never want to give up to autumn, where every day unfolds like fresh cotton pyjamas tumbling out of the dryer - warm, comforting, a perfect fit. Three kilometres off the coast of Antigua and reached only by ferry, the destination is a car-free utopia. Guests frolic on shores once set upon by Christopher Columbus, bequeathed by royalty, possessed by smugglers and, in 1915, owned by a pipe-smoking eccentric known for routinely hitching up her skirt, wading into the surf and scooping up lobsters in the gin-clear waters.
This place is basically an open invitation to sloth and sensuality for those who can afford its spoils. Sense, the Rosewood Spa at Jumby Bay, goes all out when it comes to all-day pampering. I check into this open-air sanctuary for the Sea Coral and Coconut Ritual, where my therapist greets me not so much with a handshake but a "hand-hug" - a sure sign this massage is going to be good. She gives my skin a brisk brushing with a natural-jute-fibre mitt filled with moisturizing aromatic soap beads, preparing the skin to absorb the nutrients of a silky white clay body mask. While my body drinks this in, she chases my tension down the rabbit hole with a spot-on pressure-point scalp massage. After a rubdown so deep it dissipates dark, fugitive strongholds of guilt (as well as bloating from late-night frothy desserts and morning-after rum fruitcake), my eyes flutter open to a surreal lineup of palm trees, waving emerald fronds like cheerleaders.
The Benefits
The silky white-clay body mask feels cool and slick, infused with the essences of calming local flowers. This mixture also offers mineral-rich pink coral and healing coconut milk for lasting moisturizing.
The Spa
The resort's close proximity to an international airport is key to luring discerning types to this manically manicured, 120-hectare island, which takes all of 20 minutes to cycle around. Its shoreline is sprinkled with 40 suites, villas and 32 private homes, many of which are British-owned. By far the most jaw-dropping is Hawksbill Cove, with its five bedrooms, lagoon-style pool and private beach, rented by the likes of Paul McCartney, Hilary Swank and Jim Carrey. Celebs are drawn to the multimillion-dollar private estates as they come fully staffed and each one is truly distinct. Buying real estate here is a big shot's dream: Just ask long-time residents Lord Sainsbury, Robin Leach and novelist Ken Follett. Think of it as a gated community - with the tranquil Caribbean Sea acting as the gates. The backdrop of this kind of "millionaire's co-op" makes for an interesting stay; daily operations run with noble precision, as if Lord Sainsbury himself were overseeing the guest docket.

As it probes Chinese listings, TMX courts new ones

Abstract: "Canadians should be able to invest in China-based, TSX-listed companies with the assurance that if something goes wrong, wrongdoers both in Canada and China will be held accountable," said Steve Conley, a management consultant who invested hundreds of thousands of dollars of his family's money in Chinese firms. "The TSX should not allow any future China-based companies to list in Canada until structural changes have been made to enforce this accountability."

Full text: The country's largest stock exchange isn't about to let a series of scandals get in the way of pursuing business in China.
As regulators try to unravel the tangle of allegations against Chinese companies listed in Toronto such as Sino-Forest Corp., TMX Group Inc. is opening an office in Beijing, through which it plans to seek more Chinese listings.
The company, which runs the Toronto Stock Exchange and the TSX Venture Exchange, decided to find real estate in China's capital more than a year ago, when Chinese stocks were hot investments. But it had to wait for local approval. Now the value of Chinese companies on its exchanges has been decimated by scandal.
Investors who were burned say they are frustrated, and some want the TSX to stop accepting listings from China-based firms until some problems are fixed.
Sino-Forest is the most high-profile case. Once the largest forestry company on the TSX, it is the subject of an RCMP investigation and a probe by the Ontario Securities Commission.
The securities regulator said in August it had found evidence of fraudulent activity at the company, which is accused of overstating revenue and assets.
"Canadians should be able to invest in China-based, TSX-listed companies with the assurance that if something goes wrong, wrongdoers both in Canada and China will be held accountable," said Steve Conley, a management consultant who invested hundreds of thousands of dollars of his family's money in Chinese firms. "The TSX should not allow any future China-based companies to list in Canada until structural changes have been made to enforce this accountability."
Shoe manufacturer Zungui Haixi Corp. was listed on the TSX Venture Exchange about two years ago. Its shares have not traded since August; its auditors have quit - as have its independent directors and its chief financial officer - and it has been unable to file up-to-date financial statements. Last week, the OSC said Zungui's chairman and its chief executive officer - both based in China - are refusing to co-operate with an investigation.
The OSC is conducting a broader review of the procedures for foreign companies that list in Canada. But a senior executive at the Toronto exchange suggested that it's business as usual for the exchange operator.
"We have not shut down listing [Chinese] companies," said Kevan Cowan, president of TMX Markets and TMX group head of equities.
"We apply the same level of due diligence now as before and between both domestic and international companies," he said. "Often for international companies, because we're not necessarily on the ground, we work with agents that provide us with an additional set of due diligence for those companies."
Critics wonder whether the TMX Group has been properly balancing its role as a regulator in Canada's capital markets with its desire to attract new listings and earn a profit for its shareholders.
"If we had a more coherent securities regulatory framework, the TSX would probably be out of the business of regulation, because there is an inherent conflict," said Edward Waitzer, a lawyer who previously chaired the OSC and was a vice-president of the Toronto Stock Exchange.
TMX Group said this month that its markets had 318 new listings in the first nine months of this year, more than any other exchange group in the world. TMX attracted, and allowed, more new listings than China's Shenzhen Stock Exchange, which came in second with 201.
The TMX Group's exchanges have attracted the most new listings for three years in a row. The number of Chinese-based companies that listed on the TSX and TSX Venture exchanges grew from 35 to 53 between 2006 and 2010. At the end of last year they had a market value of $12.8-billion.
The company's new Beijing office is setting up education sessions and a mentorship program to make sure ambitious Chinese companies are fully versed in the legal requirements of listing in Canada, said Robert Fotheringham, senior vice-president of equities trading at TMX Group.
"We do have a responsibility and we do feel that responsibility, so we want to make sure we bring quality companies onto the exchange," Mr. Fotheringham said after the office's opening ceremony. "You have to be able to offer confidence to investors. It's critical to investors. So we have a very, very serious interest in making sure these companies are properly vetted."

COURTING CHINA
Excerpts from a presentation TMX Group made earlier this year to attract Chinese listings. The presentation said that companies can go through the entire listing process in 14 weeks:
"Canadian office not required - Recommend a contact person in Canada be accessible for shareholders and analyst inquiries."
"Board and management must have adequate relevant North American public company experience - Canadian directors are not required."
"Companies listed on another senior market may be exempt from certain requirements...Exemptions from various TSX policies."
Initial listing fees for foreign companies range up to $150,000, the presentation said. One advantage of listing in Canada is "access to U.S. capital without the higher cost of regulatory compliance," and another is that "Canadian regulatory commissions and exchanges are customer-focused."

Full text: Builder/developer: Lifetime Developments
Size: 327 to over 3,700 square feet
Price: mid-$200,000s to over $3-million
Sales centre: 290 Adelaide St. W., west of John Street. Open Monday to Thursday from noon to 6 p.m.; weekends and holidays from noon to 5 p.m.
Contact: Phone 416-546-7525 or visit www.thebond.caLifetime Developments' latest condominium project in the Entertainment District will appeal to a segment of the market that partakes in the lively club, bar and food scene that thrives late at night.
Yet it will also satisfy a crowd of all ages looking for entertainment by day in trendy fashion outlets, art galleries, film and performing arts centres.
"It's only one block way from the part of King Street that everyone wants to be on - between Blue Jays Way and John Street where all the restaurants are and Bell Lightbox - so the location sells the site," says vice-president Brian Brown, whose own family enjoys outings around the site at Adelaide and John streets.
"[Plus] it's not just a pure residential building. There's lots that happens both within the building and around the building."
For instance, below the glass and steel section of the 40-storey tower that will house 383 suites, the podium will contain retail and office space on the first six floors.
"There are two reasons for the name [as] Bond Street - in a lot of other North American locations - is a very high-end, very recognized street," says Mr. Brown.
The moniker also refers to the volume of local input in the project, from its architectural appearance to a social media-driven ad design contest.
"People that live in the Entertainment District are very actively involved in the neighbourhood, so there is a strong bond and connection between the people that would live in this building and the neighbourhood," adds Mr. Brown.
In terms of private facilities, The Bond will have recreational attractions on two floors styled by Tomas Pearce Interior Design Consulting. "Their suites are where they sleep and relax, but when they want to entertain and socialize, the amenity spaces are where they spend most of their time," adds Mr. Brown.
The seventh floor will have a lounge, billiards room, dining area and special events kitchen, as well as a games and golf simulation room and two terraces, including one with lounge seating, a dining table and barbecue station.
On the eighth floor, there will be a fitness centre with weights and cardio equipment, a yoga studio, lounge and juice bar with access to an outdoor pool, hot tub and landscaped terrace.
The floors above will be filled with studios to three-bedroom suites with private balconies and terraces, including a penthouse with more than 3,700 square feet indoors and 1,800 square feet outdoors.
To give the interiors a more spacious feel, many plans will have open concept layouts, nine-foot ceilings, sliding bedroom doors, kitchen facilities set against one wall, study nooks and stacked laundry machines.
Finishes will be upscale, such as pre-engineered wood floors, Tomas Pearce-designed cabinetry, stone or quartz counters, and European-style stainless steel appliances.
Monthly fees will be around 52 cents per square feet, plus hydro. Parking will be an extra $45,000.
Move-in dates are scheduled for fall 2015.

Abstract: Squibb's Stationers has remained in business in Weston for nearly 85 years partly because it caters to recent immigrants, says proprietor Suri Weinberg-Linsky. "The store has been kept alive because we've got this influx of people," she says. She has added a Bible section and workbooks for learning English to her traditional stock of textbooks.

Full text: When Santa Claus glides along the route this Sunday for the 32nd annual Weston Santa Claus Parade, his companions will be children from the local day care. The tiny kids in their reindeer costumes will be riding through one of the most diverse communities in the country.
The parade is a fitting symbol for Weston today: This is a community that holds fast to tradition while striving for revitalization at the same time.
The area around Weston Rd. and Lawrence known as Weston Village was a genuine village back in 1796. In the 1800s, the settlement burgeoned into a town on the strength of mills established along the Humber River and the arrival of the Grand Trunk Railway. Today the river and the railway remain the defining landmarks.
David McBride, chair of the Weston Village Residents' Association, says the town's retail strip went into decline in the 1960s with the arrival of the Yorkdale Shopping Centre a few kilometres to the east. Another blow was the closing of the CCM bicycle plant in the 1980s.
"It's seen some changes, no doubt," Mr. McBride says of the town.
Weston will see a transformation again with the construction of the planned Air-Rail Link from Union Station to Pearson and a new GO station.
"We're looking forward to that," says Mr. McBride of the renewal in the downtown. "It's going to draw people in from other areas."
Mr. McBride says more residents are beginning to realize the importance of shopping locally. According to Statistics Canada, York South-Weston is one of the poorest ridings in Canada.
For now the signifiers of gentrification - Starbucks, trendy cheese shop or blow dry bar - are nowhere to be seen on the main drag, which is a good thing or bad, depending on your point of view.
Mr. McBride hopes a major coffee chain or two will come in with the rebuilding at Lawrence and Weston. Some locals are even envisioning a bicycle rental scheme that would let cyclists ride along the Humber all the way to Lake Ontario, then return on the GO train to Weston.
"There are lots of ideas percolating."
In the meantime, Mr. McBride points out, the sense of community couldn't be stronger. And locals have noticed an interesting real estate phenomenon: People who live on the gracious older side streets will move to another house a block or two away rather than move out of the neighbourhood.
"We all know each other's kids," says Mr. McBride. "I can take the dog for a walk and end up talking to eight people."
It gets high marks for...
Heritage recognition: Part of the old town has been designated a heritage conservation district and the area will soon be expanded. Weston Public Library was built in 1914 with money donated by Scottish-American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. Weston Lions Recreational Arena is a traditional old wooden hockey arena with a sand base under the ice.
Humber River trails: In 1830, a sawmill stood on the east side of the Humber River. In later years the Cruickshank family took over the mill site and made it Weston Wagon Works. In 1929, the family donated the land to the Town of Weston and it's known today as Cruickshank Park.
Weston Golf and Country Club: The club began as a gathering spot for four golfing friends on the east bank of the Humber River. Over the years, the territory expanded and in 1920, Scottish architect Willie Park Jr. designed 18 holes in the rolling landscape along the river. A statue of Arnold Palmer behind the first tee reminds members that the golf legend won the Canadian Open here in 1955. The course continues to be ranked among the best in the country. Of course, barriers to entry are high.
World Famous Peter's Barber Shop: You can get your hair cut, but this memorabilia-filled establishment bills itself as the second Hockey Hall of Fame. To celebrate their 50th anniversary last month, they summoned the Stanley Cup.
Weston Farmers' Market: Farmers from Holland Marsh, Bradford and the like set up on Saturday mornings in the GO Train parking lot on John Street.
Transit: At 5:30 p.m. on a weekday, Weston residents flood out of the GO Train and walk to their houses on the traditional side streets. The Georgetown South GO service reaches Union Station in 66 minutes. The area is well-served by TTC buses and, for drivers, Highway 401 is just a few minutes away.
Harbingers of Change...
Schools : Weston Collegiate Institute has come a long way since the time 200 kids were standing on the tables in the cafeteria, cheering on two girls in a fight, says a former teacher. The school now has an International Baccalaureate program within it and a police officer based on site. Other schools in the area include St. John the Evangelist, H J Alexander Junior Public School, C R Marchant Middle School and Weston Memorial Junior Public School.
Successive waves of new Canadians: Squibb's Stationers has remained in business in Weston for nearly 85 years partly because it caters to recent immigrants, says proprietor Suri Weinberg-Linsky. "The store has been kept alive because we've got this influx of people," she says. She has added a Bible section and workbooks for learning English to her traditional stock of textbooks. Customers come from Central and South America, Somalia, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, South Korea and Vietnam. "It's really this interesting mix."
Welcoming attitudes: Frontlines is a community drop-in centre; Weston United Church is very active in reaching out to the neighbourhood.
Lower crime: Redrawn police division lines and community-based policing have both helped to keep incidents down, says Mr. McBride, who sits on the local community police board.
They're Still working on...
The plan for transit giant Metrolinx to build an Air-Rail Link from Union Station to Pearson airport has been a lengthy saga. Weston Community Coalition has been pushing for electrification of the line but it remains to be seen whether that will eventually happen. Environmental assessments have been called for and current plans call for the first trains to run on diesel.
Market Values
Lovers of Victorian-era architecture seek out the original area farm houses. Grand Edwardian manses stand on streets with such anglophile names as Rosemount, Church, King, John and Elm. But confusion over whether the Air Rail Link will be diesel or electric could weigh on property values if buyers want to wait and see how it all plays out. Bungalows can be found for under $400,000 and condo towers draw first-time buyers with units under $200,000.

Full text: CGI Group Inc. says its U.S. commercial business remains challenging but contracts with the federal, state and local governments are picking up steam, especially in the past couple of months. "The U.S. looks to me a little more favourably than it did last quarter," CEO Michael Roach said Thursday. The Montreal-based information technology company said its fourth-quarter profit decreased to $73.1-million or 27 cents per share from $84.1-million or 30 cents a year ago. The decrease reflects a pre-tax charge of $45.4-million related to the advancement of real estate consolidation plans, work-force adjustments and a non-cash impairment charge related to an underperforming part of its business. Revenue increased to $1.03-billion from $1.01-billion.

Few players on Greece's Wall Street today

Author: Smith, Graeme

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/few-players-on-greeces-wall-street-today/docview/902811049/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: When the shepherd wandered into his shop and declared his intention to play the market, Mr. [Panagiotis Pitsilos] said, he warned the old man that the game was rigged. Years later, he feels vindicated. "Look, I was right," Mr. Pitsilos said, gesturing at the darkened street, where scavengers hauled a trolley full of scrap past the former exchange. "People are eating garbage out there," he said.

Full text: In better days, during the 1990s, Greeks fell so completely in love with the stock market that ordinary people emptied their savings accounts into the local exchange. A shepherd once walked into a bookshop adjacent to the old Athens bourse and announced that he had sold his entire flock, and wanted to buy a manual with instructions about how to invest. Sofokleous Street, the local equivalent of Wall Street, had become a symbol of optimism about the global financial system.
Now the decaying street has the opposite significance. Littered with garbage and graffiti, the road named after the great author of tragic dramas serves as metaphor for the Greek economic collapse. Businesses are moving away. The drab facades need a facelift to bring people back, but nobody is willing to risk the investment.
It's not just that the trading floor closed and the exchange moved to a new location in 2007; shopkeepers say the street has lost more than 80 per cent of its businesses in the past decade.
The survivors have an air of resignation. Panagiotis Pitsilos, 45, renegotiated the mortgage on his bookshop earlier this year but has already slipped three months behind on payments. He shakes his head in wonder at the way his fellow countrymen once threw themselves into the embrace of unfettered capitalism.
When the shepherd wandered into his shop and declared his intention to play the market, Mr. Pitsilos said, he warned the old man that the game was rigged. Years later, he feels vindicated. "Look, I was right," Mr. Pitsilos said, gesturing at the darkened street, where scavengers hauled a trolley full of scrap past the former exchange. "People are eating garbage out there," he said.
A visitor to the bookshop nodded sagely. Thom Kakaes, 38, an accountant, says he now finds himself wondering what kind of financial advice to give his clients. Stocks on the Athens exchange trended upward this week on news of Greece moving closer to a bailout deal, but the index has lost half its value since March.
Mr. Kakaes prefers to stay away from the volatile market. Nor does he encourage his friends to look for property bargains in the depressed real-estate scene, because of rising taxes and corruption. "If you wanted to fix up a store on this street and open a new business, you would need to bribe some civil servants," Mr. Kakaes said. "It's a losing battle."
The exchange first opened its doors in 1876, and moved into the neoclassical building on Sofokleous Street in 1934. Greece emerged from dictatorship in 1974 with a massive civil service - the public sector still accounts for 40 per cent of the economy - and for many years the middle class did not embrace the idea of gambling their money on private business. That changed as the economy boomed at the end of the millennium, and the investor class grew large enough to be considered a potent group of voters.
"A million Greeks have poured their money into Sofokleous Street and the new army of share-owning voters could affect the election," the Athens News reported in 1999.
Guidebooks in those days included the rollicking trading floor as an attraction in Athens, but all mention of Sofokleous Street has now disappeared from tourist pamphlets. Locals mutter about muggings and crime, and a bus full of police idles at one of the intersections. Like the city itself, the street seems poised for violence.
Yanis Stratigoulis, 45, a shop clerk, gave a fatalistic shrug when asked if the street might ever return to life. "Some day," he said, "when the big guys have played their games."

Games might not be gold for London shops

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/games-might-not-be-gold-london-shops/docview/902672174/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: All the back and forth doesn't cut it with [Tom Seaton], who looked out at the Olympic stadium as sparkling sunlight cascaded through his windows. He can't but help wonder about the opportunities lost with the one cafe forced to close. "We were all set to go," he said in dismay.

Full text: You would think Tom Seaton would be sitting pretty right now, given that his cafe offers an almost-touch-it view of Olympic Stadium here.
But Seaton and other small business owners who work in the five London boroughs staging the 2012 Olympics are mostly worried. Businesses in east London are likely to face severe disruption during the Games that will take place on their doorstep.
"From the local community's point of view, the sooner the Olympics are gone, the better," said Seaton, who together with his sister, Jess, converted a derelict warehouse adjacent to the River Lea into the Counter Cafe, a relaxed gathering point for the arty hipsters who inhabit Fish Island, just across from the park.
The London Games begin July 27 and end Aug. 12, and that means huge crowds and heavy security around the stadiums they can now see. But they don't know if it will mean boom or bust - or how much they'll be affected by the restrictions on vehicle and pedestrian traffic outside their front door.
Far from the boom times promised by British authorities, the companies closest to the venues may suffer the most, said Peter Vlachos, an expert on events management at Greenwich University. Though little scholarship exists on the impact of the Olympics on small businesses, Vlachos cited related research suggesting that being too close to a hub of any kind can be detrimental - even if it is a positive kind of hub.
He cited real estate studies that suggest being a short walk from a subway stop is a good thing that increases your property value, while being right next to one can depress such values because of noise and crowds.
"You can actually be too close to the fire," he said.
Seaton is particularly concerned, as another cafe he operates on the greenbelt outside the main stadium, the Container Cafe, will be shut down during the Games.
Olympic officials say they are concerned about small businesses, but argue it isn't so simple to make sure that Olympic ticketing, security and other primary issues are addressed. Each venue is different, and each has to work into a complex road network meant to spirit athletes and officials to events on time.
"We are engaging with local communities around each venue starting now and continuing into the new year to ensure people have the chance to understand our plans in good time," the organization said.
Transport for London hotly disputed the Hackney mayor's criticism, arguing they are more than ready for the Games. The organization notes it has held dozens of meetings with businesses to offer advice on how to circumvent any troubles.
But all the back and forth doesn't cut it with Seaton, who looked out at the Olympic stadium as sparkling sunlight cascaded through his windows. He can't but help wonder about the opportunities lost with the one cafe forced to close. "We were all set to go," he said in dismay.

SHRINKING CREDIT, MISSING MANAGERS

Author: MacKinnon, Mark

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/shrinking-credit-missing-managers/docview/902215630/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "In the past, it was just one phone call to borrow 1 million yuan from a friend. They wouldn't even write it down; they'd just send the money to my account. Now, it's impossible to borrow even 50,000 or 100,000 yuan," said the company's managing director, Liu Feng. "I think the money's still there in the private markets, but the trust is gone. It's a crisis of trust."

Full text:   No one believed more fervently in China's economic miracle than the residents of this pretty coastal city, which produces shoes, eyeglasses and cigarette lighters sold around the world. The good times of the past decade made many in Wenzhou rich, and residents repeatedly doubled their bets, pouring their earnings and more into stock markets and real estate.
This city's captains of commerce kept borrowing and investing even as China's government, worried about the rising pace of inflation, began gently trying to apply the brakes to the country's overheating economy. As loans from state-owned banks dried up, many in Wenzhou turned to shadier sources of money, eventually falling into a trap familiar to many on Wall Street and elsewhere - borrowing from one lender to pay off another, at higher and higher interest rates, sometimes 15 times the official standard.
Recently ranked the fourth-richest city in China per capita (trailing only the far larger centres of Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou), Wenzhou's impressive but spookily empty real estate projects make the city feel far larger than its population of three million. Its streets are lined with multiple BMW, Porsche, Mercedes, Jaguar and Maserati dealerships. But part of that wealth now appears to be illusory, having been funded by some $300-million in high-risk loans from what locals call "shadow banks."
The reckoning began in June, when three factory bosses, confronted with debts they couldn't pay, disappeared without a trace. Spooked, the "shadow banks" that had become the lenders of last resort - pawn shops, credit companies, in some cases loan sharks who pooled the wealth of individual investors - started calling in more debts. More than more 100 other laoban , as bosses are known in Chinese, fled or went into hiding. Some say the number on the run is twice that, and at least two Wenzhou laoban have jumped off tall buildings to their deaths.
Surrounded by creditors
"I believe the first three laoban [who disappeared] are somewhere outside China. Some of the others, who had even greater debts, didn't run. They're just lying on their beds, staring at the ceiling, surrounded by their creditors," said Huang Fajing, the director of a local company that manufactures cigarette lighters and barbecue starters for export to Europe, Japan and North America.
"It was very similar to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the U.S., it spread so quickly," said Mr. Huang, who is more than $2-million in hock himself.
As a result, while Chinese President Hu Jintao was being wooed in Europe this week to contribute to a fund to save that continent's failing economies, his government was quietly setting up its own $160-million bailout fund to try to halt a domestic credit crisis that many say has already spread beyond Wenzhou to other parts of China. It threatens millions of small and medium-sized businesses, though larger state-backed firms thus far seem immune.
Laoban on the lam
An estimated $580-billion in private loans were handed out in the first 10 months of this year, a number almost 10 per cent the size of the Chinese economy. While cautioning that it did not believe China to be on the verge of a subprime crisis the scale of which the United States recently experienced, the troubles in Wenzhou were one reason Bank of America this week lowered its growth forecast for China next year to 8.6 per cent, which would be the country's slowest pace of growth in a decade. Wenzhou's credit crunch, while perhaps an extreme example, reflects one of biggest fears of investors: that China - rather than being the country that can lead the world out of its debt woes - may be the next one headed for a hard fall. The city has long been unique in China for its experimentation with free enterprise and private credit, but that doesn't mean the crisis can't spread.
"Almost every business in Wenzhou has been affected, to one degree or another," said Zhou Dewen, director of the Wenzhou Small and Medium Enterprises Association. He said one-fifth of the city's businesses had either cut production in half or shut down completely since the crisis began, in some cases leading to streets protests by laid-off workers who never received their last paycheques. The total amount owed by fleeing laoban is estimated at more than 10 billion yuan ($1.6-billion).
It's a situation that has its roots in the global financial meltdown of 2008. As demand for Chinese exports dried up in North America and Europe, Beijing introduced a massive stimulus package worth trillions of dollars in order to keep its economy rolling. In practice, much of that money was distributed in the form of loans through state-owned banks.
In Wenzhou, at least, only a fraction of that money went where it was supposed to, namely upgrading businesses and developing domestic demand for their products. Much more went into speculative real estate investments - Wenzhou residents famously played leading roles in driving up property prices in Beijing, Shanghai, even Hong Kong and Singapore - and living the high life.
By late 2009, however, the Chinese government dramatically tightened monetary supply, worried that rising prices for food and other basic goods could fuel popular discontent. As anger swelled over skyrocketing housing prices, the government also moved against speculators, restricting the number of properties any individual could buy.
As real estate prices started to reverse direction and money from the official banks dried up, Wenzhou's laoban turned to the "shadow banks." Mr. Zhou said loan sharks doled out some $300-million in high-interest loans in 2010 and 2011. Some of that money was used to pay back older loans, the rest to keep speculating (bank interest rates are lower than the pace of inflation in China, so many look for other places to put their money).
But the cooling of China's economy, almost imperceptible to the outside world, began to pinch hard in Wenzhou. The carefully balanced finances of many laoban depended on the country maintaining its usual double-digit pace of expansion. So the slowdown from 10.3-per-cent growth last year to 9.1 per cent in the third quarter of 2011 meant the math no longer worked. The good times were over - in Wenzhou and maybe beyond.
Wenzhou 'fever'
"This isn't just about Wenzhou; they're just the ones who came down with the fever first," said Patrick Chovanec, a professor of economics at Beijing University. "What is the fever? You borrow based on growth continuing, not decelerating. So if [growth] goes down to even 9 per cent, people go bust."
The problem was unlikely to infect the wider Chinese economy, Prof. Chovanec said; the state has more than enough cash to prop up the official banking system by swallowing non-performing loans, essentially pretending they don't exist. "The magic of the Chinese financial system is it's all supported by untabulated, undisclosed, contingent liabilities. The government is the ultimate backstop for everything."
But among smaller, independent businesses, the twin symptoms of Wenzhou's fever - a growing number of bankruptcies and disappearing laoban - have already struck Yiwu, a nearby city famous for producing many of the toys that end up under Christmas trees in the West. Small business owners here say their colleagues in other parts of the country are just as reliant on shadow banks as they are. The loans just haven't come due yet. "This is not just happening in Wenzhou. Wenzhou is in fact a microcosm of what's happening all over China," said Mr. Zhou of the small business association.
One reason the problems came to light here were a series of anonymous postings on a local Wikileaks-style website, 703804.com (in local Wenzhou dialect it sounds like "chit-chat"). Back in April, one laoban "lost over 300 million [yuan] gambling," according to a post on the site that started an avalanche of similar tales. "Now he ran away [from his debts] and his company has stopped production. Workers didn't get their salaries and the company owes a lot of debts to suppliers."
'Horse at the edge of the cliff'
Ye Zhe, the website's 35-year-old founder, rejects the suggestion that he's the Julian Assange of Wenzhou (he sees himself as helping the government fight speculation and fraud, rather than trying to expose official secrets), but he believes his website helped the city avert a worse fall. "My website gave an early signal of the crisis, and warned us that we should stop the horse at the edge of the cliff," he said.
The Chinese government is certainly pulling hard at the reins. In addition to the bailout money, it is considering a proposal from the local government to turn Wenzhou into a special test region where private lending forbidden in other parts of the country would be allowed - in other words, making the shadow bankers legal in order to try to regulate them.
But some of those teetering on the edge believe the help may come too late. In the city's manufacturing core, the 170 employees of Sinoman Clothing were still working the sewing machines on Friday, producing cheap men's wear for sale within China. But the company's owners say they're only days away from having to repay a bank loan of 2 million yuan. It's money they just don't have.
"It's very hard now. There's no way to borrow from the banks, and no way to raise money on the private markets," said Jin Yanzi, a vice-president and founding partner of Sinoman. Ms. Jin said many of her friends and competitors have already been forced to flee their creditors. Though her company's debts are comparatively small, she and her partners admit to musing about leaving Wenzhou too. "I've been thinking about leaving for a long time," Ms. Jin said.
"In the past, it was just one phone call to borrow 1 million yuan from a friend. They wouldn't even write it down; they'd just send the money to my account. Now, it's impossible to borrow even 50,000 or 100,000 yuan," said the company's managing director, Liu Feng. "I think the money's still there in the private markets, but the trust is gone. It's a crisis of trust."

In heart of the Annex, lineups around Honest Ed's are a common sight, but across the street, there's a permanent lineup around the sales centre of the latest development by Lindvest Properties Ltd.
The lineup is a series of 23-foot tall portraits of local residents, painted around the building to depict the vibrant food, entertainment and street scene that they - and future homeowners - can be part of in the long-established community.
"It's been decades since somebody has built really true, new condo product of this nature in this area, so there's really pent up demand," says vice-president, Michael Klugmann.
"We released the first release of units to the VIP broker community and north of 80 per cent of those sold."
Later this month, the public will have their chance to purchase from the balance of 195 suites at B.Streets Condos, a contemporary nine-storey structure to be built on a vacant school site on Bathurst Street.
The project will be just steps from independent shops, cafes and restaurants in Mirvish Village, Harbord Village and Korea Town, as well as local landmarks, such as Lee's Palace and Bloor Cinema.
"One of the greatest assets here is the neighbourhood and all the different boutique offerings," says Mr. Klugmann. "We're right at Bathurst subway station and we'll also have the streetcars literally outside the doors of the new condo."
This building will also add new points of interest with street-level shops and private recreational facilities, such as fitness, party and dining rooms, a theatre and Internet lounge, as well as a patio and bar, pet spa and hobby room.
To complement the character of masonry shops along the street, Hariri Pontarini Architects designed this mid-rise with balconies and terraces receding inwards at different intervals from a façade wrapped with gunmetal brick and smooth cream-toned pre-cast concrete.
"It's a very attractive and interesting frontage on Bathurst, so it's lively at every angle you look at it," says Mr. Klugmann.
"On the east face of the building ... the building terraces down, which provides tremendous amount of outdoor space for the suites."
The building's unique contour also resulted in the creation of 98 different floor plans, including one-storey units with up to three bedrooms and two-storey penthouses and townhouses.
"What is unique about this project is that there are a tremendous amount of suite types and variation as compared to the typical model of Toronto condos," says Mr. Klugmann. "Our units tend to be larger than the typical offering."
Ceiling heights will be nine feet and finishes will have local flavour with industrial elements combined with a clean, contemporary aesthetic.
"We're using one of the more renowned names in interior design - Cecconi Simone - and they've come up with many unique suite types that reflect the eclectic nature of the people and what they're looking for," adds Mr. Klugmann.
For instance, kitchens will feature custom cabinetry with black shaker doors, wood grain flat panel doors and upper display doors with metal mesh inserts, plus metallic tile backsplashes in a brick pattern.
Bathrooms will be outfitted with small, glossy tiles with contrasting grout and contemporary vanity with a porcelain vessel sink and stainless steel accessories as homage to turn-of-the-century New York style.
Monthly fees will be about 52 cents per square foot, plus individually metered utilities.
Move-in dates are scheduled for 2014.

Full text:   Plans to sell off a stake in Toronto Hydro will have to wait until the new year, with members of the mayor's executive committee saying they need more information before they can back a proposed share issue for 10 per cent of the public utility.
The sale, to take place through an initial public offering, with local residents getting first dibs, is part of a plan to raise as much as $600-million by selling off a range of city assets. Staff have recommended the sale as a way to fund planned capital projects.
Despite a grim financial outlook presented by the city's chief financial officer, Cam Weldon, members of the executive committee asked Tuesday for more time to consider the Hydro sale - a move that means the matter is unlikely to be settled before next year's budget is planned.
"Once it is gone, you can't get it back," said councillor Jaye Robinson who asked for the deferral until January. "It is a very big decision to sell off a stake in such a key asset."
Mr. Weldon said the asset sale is needed to cover several large capital purchases in the next five years and because the city is reaching its self-imposed limit on the amount of money it can borrow to fund them.
The $600-million in asset sales will result in some loss of revenue, staff estimate, but will save the city $65-million in debt charges over a decade. After that, the sale will cost the city about $10-million each year in forgone revenue. The alternative, Mr. Walton said, is the delay or cancellation of capital projects.
Opponents of the sale, including councillor Gordon Perks, said it makes no sense to sell an asset that provides valuable revenue to the city. Toronto Hydro is expected to generate about $33-million for the municipality this year.
The committee did give the green light to the sale of the other assets recommended by staff, including unnamed real estate holdings and the city's interest in Enwave Energy Corp., which runs the downtown district's heating and cooling system. The city owns a 43-per-cent stake in Enwave, with OMERS, a public-sector pension fund, holding the rest. The report recommends the city work with OMERS to put the whole company up for sale in order to improve its selling price.
Council will vote on the sale of Enwave and the real estate holdings later this month.
Councillor Mike Del Grande, head of the city's budget committee, has estimated the 10-per-cent stake in Toronto Hydro could add roughly $200-million to the city's coffers, with another $100-million coming from the Enwave.
The decision to delay the Hydro sale, he said Tuesday, will have implications for the city's capital plans. "I think people are going to be in shock about just how much capital we are going to have to defer, " he said.
Some, such as the planned purchase of streetcars by the TTC, he said, are too far along to cancel without serious cost implications. "We can't turn back," he said of the streetcar deal.

Full text:   First there was the largesse of the industrial barons, then the big international agencies of the postwar years. Now comes Philanthropy 3.0: On one side are the billions wielded by '1 percenters' like Bill Gates and power brokers like Bill Clinton. On the other are countless social enterprises, micro-charities and campaigns via cellphone, Facebook and Twitter. Traditional charities are squeezed in the middle. It's a dramatic change, but can it really improve humanity's dismal record in making the world any less desperate, diseased, dangerous and unfair? Doug Saunders investigates
PORT-AU-PRINCE: REDRAWING THE MAP
If you had visited the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince a few years ago, you would have found the mountainside suburbs to its west, where the grand old homes are located, scattered with a few handsome compounds housing the great institutions that had dominated philanthropy since shortly after the Second World War.
At the hilltop was the enclosure of CARE International, down the street from the three houses occupied by Medecins sans frontières (Doctors Without Borders) and a few blocks from the whitewashed buildings of Oxfam. Down the hill were various branches of the Red Cross, and at the foot were Plan, World Hope, Save the Children and the sprawling blocks of United Nations agencies. These fortresses of altruism, humming with air-conditioned SUVs, were more permanent, changeless and bureaucratic than any branch of the impoverished nation's government. And not just in Haiti. Around the world, these were the power centres of giving and helping.
In Port-au-Prince today, you can watch the map of charity being remade. Amid the twisted wreckage of the 2010 earthquake and the tent cities that still fill every available space, the old charity village has turned into something of a metropolis. Those well-heeled old institutions have been joined by at least 2,000 new ones, some even larger and many much smaller, filling tracts of new prefab buildings and providing one of the island's few sources of steady employment.
Hundreds of micro-charities have collected tens of millions through text messages, online donations and Twitter and Facebook campaigns, their offices jammed with new Apple computers, engaging in running behind-the-scenes battles and mutual jealousy with the old agencies.
Many are built on celebrity: Singer Wyclef Jean, who was raising a million dollars a day in mobile-phone donations after the quake, is no longer seen much at his charity's lavish hilltop estate, ever since it was accused of squandering vast sums on video production, personal expenses and a $250,000 carnival float.
Actor Sean Penn's operation, by the refugee camp that was once a golf course, is more securely in place, deploying squadrons of digging machines, though he rubs some of the charity elite the wrong way, as do the smaller charities of Patricia Arquette and Ben Stiller.
Officials from agencies such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Red Cross have complained the celebrity charities duplicate their work without the standards - for example, giving donated food to refugee camps, a practice established charities stopped years ago because it cuts into local farmers' profits.
Many more of the new philanthropic powers in Haiti, and around the world, are not charities at all in the old sense, but corporations that mix profit-seeking with benevolent missions. Such "social enterprises" produce results that can be exceptionally efficient - and sometimes awkwardly self-interested.
Digicel, for example, is an Irish-owned company that dominates Haiti's cellphone service. Its chief executive, Denis O'Brien, has spent hundreds of millions rebuilding large parts of downtown Port-au-Prince, providing shelters, sanitation and aid. It's an act of generosity that also raises Digicel's brand identity, making it a beloved household name among Haitians, which can only be good for its market share.
Mr. O'Brien plays another important role: He is a key figure in the huge network of corporations, governments and agencies organized by former U.S. president Bill Clinton, who has channelled hundreds of millions onto the island, persuading billionaires to give large amounts.
And that is the other factor looming over Haiti - the vast resources of the world's wealthiest 1 per cent. With hundreds of their agents trooping around the traffic-clotted streets here, the vast funds of Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, George Soros and others are often among the most influential forces on the island.
What you see in Port-au-Prince, and what is taking over the world's $2.2-trillion non-profit sector, is what some insiders call Philanthropy 3.0.
It marks a historic change. Philanthropy 1.0 was the handful of U.S. and British foundations, such as Rockefeller and Carnegie, that did "scientific" charity work in the prewar decades. Then came a revolution after the Second World War, with the births of both foreign aid and a galaxy of large non-governmental organizations and bureaucracies, including the United Nations and groups such as CARE. This edifice of Philanthropy 2.0 remained remarkably stable for six decades.
But over the past few years we have seen a third wave, born of globalization, crisis and technology, that is both more dynamic and less stable than the compounds of yesterday.
At the top of the pyramid are the new private foundations, dwarfing the largest of the old and playing a dramatic political role: They remake the executive structures of the old charities, forcing many of their activities to be organized in a much more businesslike way, or bypass established charities altogether to make direct links to the poor, diseased and disaster-ravaged.
At the opposite end of the scale are countless micro-initiatives and social networks, leveraging money and effort bit by byte, for causes great and small.
"You have the big givers, the Bill Gateses who've appeared all of a sudden, on the one hand, and then you've got the emergence of philanthropy in rapidly developing countries, and then the whole dimension of direct-giving philanthropy. It's changing everything," says J. Allister McGregor, head of the British-run Bellagio Initiative, created by the Rockefeller Foundation.
It is not hard to imagine a situation, when the dust clears after the global crisis, in which conventional charities are largely obsolete, squeezed out between the world-improving schemes of billionaires and the surging efforts of lesser people responding to calls for help on Twitter.
The economic crisis has put a dent in traditional giving. The U.S., which accounts for more than two-thirds of the world's charitable giving, saw donations decline 13 per cent in the first two years of the crisis, bouncing back by a lacklustre 2.1 per cent last year. "At that rate, it will take five to six more years just to return to the level of giving we saw before the Great Recession," says Patrick M. Rooney, executive director of the U.S.-based Center on Philanthropy.
Canada has seen a similar squeeze. According to an Imagine Canada report, a quarter of charities say they will have trouble covering expenses this year.
There is a sense that many of those contributions may be gone forever, because the high-tech ways of Philanthropy 3.0 allow people to connect almost directly to a recipient. That's what younger people are doing (and giving less than their parents). Online micro-loan outfits such as Kiva, for example, put people in touch with, say, a street vendor in Rwanda looking for a $400 loan (at interest) to set up a store or buy a delivery motorcycle. Everyone is meant to profit: lender, Kiva and street vendor.
You might think that charities would find succour in the dramatic rise in giving from fast-growing China and India. In 2009, China's 50 largest philanthropists gave a total of $1.2-billion, about a third of what their counterparts in the U.S. did.
But that money largely appears to be bypassing the 2.0-style institutions. Typical is actor Jet Li's One Foundation, which collects millions of minuscule donations of only 1 yuan (16 cents), often through cellphones, and attracts huge sums for causes unlike the traditional ones in China, from adolescent depression to earthquake relief.
Much of the developing world's giving doesn't go to organizations at all. One study found that Pakistanis, for example, are perhaps the world's most generous philanthropists - but they give almost exclusively to the needy in their own communities, often through mosque-based networks.
Yet as the economy sags, the established charities are being asked to take on monumental loads. On top of disasters, diseases, hospitals, universities and global poverty, the "third sector" is increasingly being expected to take the place of austerity-crippled government services.
Prime Minister David Cameron in Britain has made this official with his Big Society program. Its general failure so far hasn't prevented the Canadian government from moving to copy it, as Ottawa revealed this week. And the U.S. Congress is currently debating a bill to slash funding to USAID, Washington's foreign-aid and international development agency, by as much as a third ($1.4-billion), leaving charities to take up the slack.
The non-profit sector, meanwhile, is far from up to the challenge. Only 14 per cent of its funding worldwide actually comes from donations, according to the Bellagio Initiative - almost 40 per cent comes from governments. In truth, the vaunted "third sector" of charity and volunteerism can barely be called an independent sector, so tightly linked is it to government and big business.
As much as Philanthropy 2.0 is a victim of circumstance, though, there is also a sense that it has failed in its original mission to alleviate global poverty and disease.
There were some initial triumphs: UN agencies and major international charities began their efforts to eradicate smallpox worldwide in 1950 and succeeded by 1980; others spearheaded the Green Revolution, which ended large-scale famine in countries such as India in the 1970s. Today, many disasters and crises would be far more deadly if not for the highly evolved, fast-responding infrastructure of big agencies such as the Red Cross.
But in many areas, the world's troubles have seemed immune to charity's salve. A billion people still live on mud floors with no toilets and hardly enough food. Diseases such as typhus and cholera are not being eradicated as fast as they should. Over all, inequality and deprivation have yielded little to the trillions of charitable dollars thrown at them in the postwar decades.
And the main advances that have come cannot be credited to old-school charities. That includes the huge decrease in absolute poverty during the 1990s and 2000s (the rate worldwide plunged from 34 per cent to 25).
Researchers who polled thousands of individuals who managed to escape absolute poverty asked them what institutions and sources of income touched their lives. Not charities. Not Western foreign-aid programs. What brought people out of poverty was export-led economic growth and political stability.
The nagging question is whether Philanthropy 3.0 can do better. Its record, as we'll see, includes historic gains against AIDS in Africa. But on the other side there is the tragic mess in Haiti. This country's post-earthquake donation drive was the largest in history, with an astonishing $1.4-billion in private donations in four months. But despite the huge sums and the sprawling overgrowth of charities, there are few signs of improvement.
Some critics would even say that no matter what model they used, charities - by pouring free money into an economy that needed to start generating its own wealth - made things worse.
NEW YORK CITY: Rise of the Philanthro-Capitalists
In September, more than 50 prime ministers and presidents, dozens of billionaires, scores of Hollywood celebrities and scads of NGO heads and social entrepreneurs gathered in midtown Manhattan for the three-day annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative.
Mr. Clinton strode the stage like a faith healer, extracting promises of aid from businessmen and philanthropists (close to $10-billion at this meeting, adding to the $69.2-billion pledged to date) and nudging those with money and those with causes into impromptu hallway meetings.
"We've learned that if you have government and the private sector and the NGOs working together, they can do things faster, cheaper and better, so that even if there's less money, they can make the money they have go further," Mr. Clinton said this week at his Manhattan office, where many of his group's 1,400 employees work. "You want to get everyone pulling in the same direction."
At any moment at the summit, he might have been huddling with billionaire Carlos Slim, the Foreign Minister of China and an NBC news anchor to talk urban reform, or hosting an informal discussion on climate change with the leaders of Bangladesh, Mexico, Mali, Norway, Grenada and South Africa, with Forest Whitaker and Geena Davis in the audience.
In the midst of it all were Ashok and Amrita Mahbubani, an elegant couple who became wealthy running an electronics company out of Toronto.
For many years, their main manufacturing plant was in Haiti, operated by Ms. Mahbubani's Indian father, and his death in 2007 inspired them to start giving back. They set up their foundation, EKTA, with $1-million from his legacy. But instead of taking the traditional path - setting up an office and cutting cheques to the big charities and organizations - they decided to plunge into Philanthropy 3.0.
"We realized that we can multiply our impact if we use the network of people here," Mr. Mahbubani says. "What took maybe six months to do here would have taken three years if we'd gone monkeying around by ourselves."
The price of attendance is very steep, involving an obligatory pledge, but for smaller players such as the Mahbubanis, it is the ticket into a tight-knit network that combines world-transforming idealism with elite connections.
What is new in the Clinton approach, but now widely imitated, is that the ex-president's group does almost nothing on the ground itself. Instead, it persuades others to join forces and take action, whether they're private- or public-sector, religious or corporate or volunteer. The range of commitments is huge, from "rebuild Pakistan" to "empower girls and women," as well as the famous Clinton commitments to fight AIDS and fix Haiti - or, rather, to get others to do so.
Unlike the older charities, they hope to create local economic conditions that make it unnecessary to have permanent agency headquarters in poor countries and regions. "You want to be in there so you're working yourself out of a job," Mr. Clinton says.
For their part, the Mahbubanis linked up with the Internet-driven charity Water.org, founded in part by actor Matt Damon, which seeks to provide clean water in poor countries. And they struck a deal with Invenio, a California-based social enterprise that uses an entrepreneurial model to provide solar-powered Internet access in dirt-poor rural areas (while technically a non-profit, it otherwise operates like a corporation).
The couple don't just give money to these organizations. They actively take part in their projects and activities, linking their interests with the varied objectives of their partners. "We didn't want to be a foundation that gives money to charity and never knows how it will be used," Ms. Mahbubani says. "We wanted to do this in a businesslike way. I questioned that approach at first, because this is philanthropy - it's different from the business world. But it has worked."
That sense of unease about the private-sector-dominated philanthropy pioneered by Mr. Clinton is shared by a lot of people. In Haiti, for example, the initiative has been criticized for having brought in flawed shelters that happen to be manufactured by a company owned by one of the Clinton members.
In traditional philanthropy, there was a stark line between the capitalist activities of the benefactors and the altruistic activities of their chosen causes. The Clintonites have blurred the line, and perhaps erased it forever.
For a vivid example, consider Thomas Nagy, executive vice-president of the Danish-based multinational biotech company Novozymes. One of his tasks is to oversee its social enterprises in sub-Saharan Africa: In Mozambique, and soon in other countries, Novozymes has mounted a huge venture to end the reliance of poor villagers and slum-dwellers on indoor charcoal stoves - a practice that creates chronic health problems and ecological destruction, both from the stoves themselves and from the charcoal-making trade, which destroys forests and belches out tonnes of carbon.
Novozymes is replacing tens of thousands of family cookstoves with gas stoves. It is also paying the charcoal makers to become cash-crop farmers, while helping set up markets for their crops.
If it works, the project is unquestionably beneficial to huge numbers of people. But nobody is pretending it's a purely altruistic venture. One of Novozymes's businesses is converting farm crops into ethanol fuel. The charcoal makers will be taught to grow plants Novozymes can buy for that purpose, such as cassava. And the gas stoves in turn will create a large new untapped market in ethanol cylinders, assuring future markets for Novozymes.
"This is for profit. It is a social venture, designed to assemble an entire value chain," Mr. Nagy says. "We are assembling a sustainable agricultural food and energy system with a supply chain that serves real needs, is more healthy and increases rural income and livelihood. It will have both a profit and a social and ecological benefit."
Replacing the fuel economy of an entire nation is a kind of project that no charity or UN agency or foreign government would ever have attempted. The new profit-friendly philanthropy is built around such coincidences of interest - or conflicts, depending on your perspective.
Its great merit is that it is far more immediate, responsive and direct than the bureaucratic edifices of Philanthropy 2.0; the potential for profit prompts companies to mobilize far more people and resources far more quickly. But that is also its largest potential flaw - that self-interest could overshadow altruism, with no outside force overseeing it.
For established charities, there's another worry: If people come to believe that the world's problems can be fixed by acts of capitalism, will they be less inclined to make donations to charity?
It has come full cycle: Philanthropy 2.0, created to smooth out the flaws in the capitalist market economy, may end up being put out of business by it.

On a grubby stretch of Seattle's industrial waterfront sits a drab, unmarked four-storey building that was once a cheque-processing centre. What takes place inside it is doing more to end the old order of philanthropy than anything else on Earth. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is not just the largest philanthropic organization in the world. It is using its extraordinary wealth to remake the basic nature of charity, aid, development and, in some respects, government.
Founded by the software billionaire in the late 1990s, when he needed to compensate for his international reputation as a monopolist, the Gates Foundation is now to philanthropy what Microsoft is to personal-computer software.
With the $33.5-billion endowment it won in 2008 when investor Warren Buffett donated half his fortune and Bill Gates quit Microsoft to run the charity full-time, it is by far the largest charitable foundation in the world, three times the size of the next-largest (the Ford Foundation) and larger than the entire economies of many of the 100 countries in which it operates; it gives out a sum of money each year - more than $3-billion - larger than that disbursed by the other top 10 foundations combined.
If older foundations have viewed the world through the goggles of a missionary, a nurse, a social worker or a policeman, Bill Gates has approached it as an engineer. A great many of the 1,200 people working here devote themselves to metrics - painstaking measures of the precise impact of every dollar spent - for example, the precise amount it costs a particular program to extend life expectancy in a poor country by one year.
And where old-school charities would assess their projects on an annual or biennial basis, the Gates people prefer their data daily, live from the field, as it's happening.
Mark Suzman, the head of the Gates Foundation's international-development program, began his career in a UN development agency. "One of the things that was really surprising" about old-school philanthropy, he found there, "was the degree to which it was a field that had not focused on results. It was much more focused on outputs: Did you get your money out the door? ... We spend a lot of time mapping out what we think the metrics of success will be, and how we will measure it, and the way it will be reported back."
They also typically have longer time frames: Among the 20 core Gates projects, many, such as vaccination programs, are calibrated on five-, 10- or 20-year schedules. And the scope is beyond what even large governments would consider - system-wide re-engineering projects: changing the type of rice grown in Africa so it will be both flood- and drought-resistant, after climate change; changing the total secondary and post-secondary education system of the United States; ending AIDS and tuberculosis around the world, completely.
As with the Clinton Initiative, a lion's share of the Gates money does not land directly on the ground, but is instead used as seed money to help other organizations raise and disburse further sums for their work. The Gates people call this "catalytic philanthropy" - not to do something themselves, but to cause someone else to do it.
Like the postwar charities, Bill Gates sees this as a mission to correct the imperfections of faltering governments and failing capitalist economies. "Where does the marketplace fall short and therefore a foundation can have a catalytic effect?" he asked in an interview last year.
As a result, though, the Seattle team is in the odd position of being not just rivals but often the main financiers of huge charities, UN divisions, other funds and government departments around the world.
To receive the funds, these bodies must apply the scientific standards, success-measuring techniques and organizing structures of the Gates Foundation. Since the amounts involved are so large, they often end up altering those institutions' basic DNA.
An official with the British government's Department for International Development tells of a foreign-aid program that was receiving hundreds of millions from both Whitehall and the Gates Foundation. The two clashed over how to measure the program's results.
"The outcome was, as it always is in such cases, that the Gates people got to install one of their people as the director," the official says.
Such effects can be witnessed around the world, as the Gates people struggle to spend a sum of money each year that some analysts consider too large to be absorbed.
"Gates is so big and so influential that if they decide they want to focus on, say, food security, then they have the weight to get other foundations and, indeed, government agencies to change the game," Randall Kempner, whose Aspen Institute promotes for-profit philanthropy, told an interviewer last year.
Mr. Gates's influence is even more powerful because it is amplified through the funds of other billionaires. Media tycoon Ted Turner's United Nations Foundation, founded in 1999, gets substantial funding from the Gates Foundation and, in turn, finances many of the old-school charities (and governments). Mr. Buffett took that meta-charity approach to a new level when he decided not to attach his name to a foundation but to leave his legacy to Mr. Gates.
And Mr. Turner, Mr. Gates and Mr. Buffett are all now campaigning to persuade other billionaires, such as Oracle chief executive officer Larry Ellison and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to part with half their fortunes in the name of philanthropy.
Some may spot a piquant irony here: In an age of grotesque inequality, the interests of the world's poor and diseased have become the concern of a small circle of billionaires, motivated - whether by guilt, concern for their reputations, vanity or pure altruism - to give a proportion of their wealth to do things that tax-deprived governments can't manage.
And the effect of their huge injection of personal wealth is often to change the behaviour of governments and more middle-class postwar charities. It is, in short, a very top-down way to impose bottom-up solutions to the world's problems.
Whatever the long-term effects, few will deny that the Gates effect has been broadly beneficial so far. "It puts human well-being back on the agenda," the Bellagio Initiative's Mr. McGregor says, "because people like Gates are keen to rethink it now."
Although the old-school charities claim to be happily co-operating with the billionaires' funds, in many important ways they are being left behind. That was most dramatically evident in what many consider the greatest accomplishment of the Gates and Clinton era: the taming of the AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa.
In 2002, when Mr. Gates, Mr. Clinton and others decided to create the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, people assumed it would be operated by the World Health Organization, a branch of the UN. But Mr. Gates and Mr. Clinton were quietly adamant that the WHO be bypassed entirely.
"There's a real sense," says a WHO official who was involved in the dispute, "that if it had gone to the WHO, we'd still be at the planning stage today. We were seen as too slow-moving and bureaucratic - not entirely inaccurately."
Since then, the Global Fund has spent $19-billion on programs of education, HIV drug treatment, adult circumcision and hands-on preventive health care of unprecedented scope and scale. And the campaign is a startling success: The AIDS crisis, which at the beginning of the decade had reduced average life expectancy in some countries to little more than 30 years, is coming under control in most countries, with deaths down by 20 per cent and new infections by more than 25 per cent in the past decade.
In a parallel effort, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization has vaccinated more than 250 million children and prevented five million deaths. It created a successful meningitis vaccine last year and announced a malaria vaccine this month.
Reducing continent-ravaging plagues to expensive but manageable issues may be the most dramatic demonstration of the new philanthropy's best potential.
GENEVA: The End of an Empire
At the opposite extreme from the mud shacks, tent cities and crowded hospitals where aid is typically received is the calm, silent expanse of low, glass-walled buildings along the shore of Lake Geneva, the bureaucratic capital of the postwar philanthropic archipelago. Here are the well-paid elite of the Red Cross, many UN agencies and a number of the largest charities.
One of those glass buildings is home to CARE International, the quintessential 2.0 organization: Founded to deliver American food packages to the refugee camps that covered postwar Europe, it expanded and internationalized to become one of the world's largest charities, with 12,000 employees across virtually every global trouble spot, backed by fundraising in a dozen countries, including Canada.
Robert Glasser, the seasoned field worker who is the chief of CARE's worldwide operation in Geneva, remains one of the sector's outspoken optimists, but he can't help seeing the crises both within charity and outside it: "There are huge changes happening in philanthropy, and the scale of the problems is actually growing, and that is a real challenge to groups like ours."
Donations to CARE from Canada, Britain and France actually have increased during the crisis. Yet in the U.S., which supplies 60 per cent of CARE's donor base, donations are sharply down. Mr. Glasser is also beginning to see steep cuts in grants from deficit-stricken governments - the source of more than half of CARE's funds, as is typical of the larger charities.
For the big institutions, the thousands of new organizations of Philanthropy 3.0. bring chaotic scenes of competition and crossed agendas, and not just in disaster zones such as post-tsunami Indonesia or Haiti. It's also a problem in the capitals of a great many sub-Saharan African countries and in unstable countries such as Pakistan and Somalia, where the parade of pop stars, evangelists, single-issue obsessives, Chinese-government agents and U.S. billionaires can create unhelpful distractions.
"There's good and bad with the crowded field," Mr. Glasser says, diplomatically. "The good is that there's new energy, innovation, new approaches, great ideas ... The problem with that has been in situations like Indonesia and Haiti, where you have hundreds of NGOs descending and trying to be helpful ... some of them are just chasing the money. The problem is it really clogs up the system, and actually decreases the efficiency of the response."
He is one of many charity heads who would like to see a global registration system for philanthropy, to prevent incompetent, flaky or ultra-religious organizations from poisoning the well.
The way donations are going, the opposite is more likely to occur. A generation ago, charitable giving was almost entirely middle-aged, middle-class and Western (in fact, mostly American - of the $52-billion donated worldwide each year, all but $15-billion comes from the States).
But today, the old practice of tithing part of your paycheque or pension to charity, or getting a letter and writing a cheque, has not been passed down from the older generation.
A recent study found that Canadians born before 1945 give an average of $833 a year, and three-quarters of them donate regularly; among those born from 1965 to 1980, annual donations drop to $549 and only 60 per cent give. Among those born after 1981, only 55 per cent do, and the average falls to $325.
Clearly, the decline in giving is not merely an effect of the Great Recession. But the crisis does put charity in a new light: A system meant to alleviate the bumps and pitfalls of the global market economy is bound to seem less relevant and effective when that whole economy has become a charity case.
The effort to find solutions may have become more complex and sophisticated - but the problems have never been larger.

The messenger
Jim Manis
Chief executive officer, Mobile Giving Foundation
Age: 58
Instant gratification can be a good thing, thanks to Jim Manis. As the pioneer of mobile fundraising, the wireless-industry veteran has made it possible for the texting generation to unleash its charitable impulse. Media images of earthquakes, floods and other international disasters arouse feelings of sympathy that need an instant outlet for the emotion to be transformed into a donation. Mr. Manis recognized how phones can serve as the instruments of immediacy, particularly for a younger demographic that might go unreached by the traditional modes of fundraising. Over the past three years, as the CEO of the Mobile Giving Foundation, he has greatly simplified the relationship between wireless carriers and non-profit organizations so that consumers can make microdonations to the charity of choice through a quick texted response on their mobile phones. Young mobile users may not be the best candidates for regular and dependable donations, but Mr. Manis believes the phone's immediacy can bring them much closer to the good works they will want to support.

The funster
Tim Hwang
Founder, The Awesome Foundation
Age: 25
Proof that philanthropy has a fun side, Tim Hwang's Awesome Foundation clears away all of the solemnity and most of the paperwork that traditionally accompanies the handover of money. Mr. Hwang, a recent Harvard graduate, shared the frustrations of friends overwhelmed by the burden of funding applications and in 2009 devised a nimble alternative that makes the donor-recipient relationship more direct and immediate. The Awesome Foundation distributes $1,000 grants to projects that spark joy and delight, relying on the pooled funds of "microtrustees" in autonomous local chapters who each contribute $100 to a monthly pot. While the definition of awesomeness is kept deliberately loose and free-form, preferred projects are those that "bring communities together, casting aside social inhibitions and boundaries for a moment." The winning fellowships so far include a mobile compost-pickup service in Miami, a starry-night simulation in overlit London and a pop-up Indiana Jones experience (picture giant rolling boulders) in a Washington alleyway.

The modernizer
Judith Rodin
President, the Rockefeller Foundation
Age: 67
Judith Rodin took over the leadership of the Rockefeller Foundation in 2005 and found an institution of global benevolence that hadn't done enough to justify its reputation since the 1960s, when it fostered the green revolution and helped to develop a vaccine against yellow fever. Since her tenure began, she has prodded the Rockefeller into a more meaningful role as it pursues its mission "to promote the well-being of humanity around the world."
She demands high-impact results from the foundation's $100-million annual expenditure. She has narrowed its focus down to five issues: basic survival needs (water, food, housing), health care, climate change, solutions to accelerating urbanization and strengthening social and economic security. She has also developed a culture of local involvement: The Rockefeller funded Spike Lee's post-Katrina documentary When the Levees Broke , a key part of her campaign to shake up political complacency and push forward the reconstruction of New Orleans.

The teacher
Azim Premji
Chairman, Wipro;
founder, Azim Premji Foundation
Age: 66
India's literacy rate is much lower than China's, and its backward rural schools are largely to blame. Software tycoon Azim Premji decided to challenge an educational culture that overvalued the discipline of rote learning and accepted the inevitability of poor performance from impoverished students. A decade ago, the chairman of Wipro started a foundation dedicated to improving primary-school education, reasoning that the country's economic potential would never be realized as long as millions of its young people couldn't read. Last December, he pledged a further $2-billion to fund an educational institute that will train teachers and improve classroom techniques. Though many wealthier Indians disdain the government-run schools, and fear that Mr. Premji's good intentions will be frustrated by a system that doesn't share his strategy, the Stanford-educated engineer has the entrepreneur's faith that change is attainable. One of his first goals is to dispense with the textbook drills of old-school India and give students more freedom to think for themselves - because if they gain independence in the classroom, he reasons, they are more likely to learn the skills that a free-ranging world demands.

Former president of eBay; producer of socially
conscious films; founder, Skoll Foundation
Age: 46
While it is easy to give away a lot of cash in Hollywood, it is much harder to do good.
Jeff Skoll's dream to inspire social change through big-screen stories might have seemed like exactly the sort of quixotic quest a young ex-eBay billionaire would undertake. But the Montreal-born, Toronto-raised entrepreneur has proved surprisingly successful at it: He has backed films such as An Inconvenient Truth , Syriana, Fast Food Nation, The Kite Runner, Charlie Wilson's War and The Help . However, moviemaking is just one part of Mr. Skoll's social-change portfolio. His foundation funds idealistic entrepreneurs who are well-placed to solve seemingly intractable social problems. Through the Skoll World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship, he brings together 800 of the major players in global good works. And just to ramp up his ambitions a little more, Mr. Skoll created his Global Threats Fund in 2009, with the aim of saving humanity from its darker self.

The democrat
George Soros
Financier; founder, Open Society Institute
Age: 81
For George Soros, making money and creating a healthy democracy start with the same thing: an open mind. Critical thinking is the key to his fortune, and it is the core value of the better world he has been trying to create since he first got involved in political philanthropy by helping black students fight South African apartheid in 1979. As a hedge-fund activist, he has often stood alone in his pioneering support for political dissidents and opposition groups around the world - including the United States, where he energetically opposed George Bush in the 2004 election, believing that the White House Republicans had turned America into a global oppressor. Mr. Soros came of age in Nazi-occupied Hungary and he has remained sensitive to the totalitarian threat. His Open Society Institute has emerged as the leading philanthropic force in the campaign to democratize authoritarian regimes. He even deserves credit for the collapse of the Soviet bloc, or at least for the speedy transition toward democracy in Eastern Europe.

Abstract: "When we first opened, we were selling everything immediately," said one young sales agent, who would give only her family name, Wang. "Now we are selling six or seven units a month. But it's really better than houses selling outside the Fifth Ring," she said, referring to an area about 10 kilometres from the city centre. "Houses there are so inconvenient, they aren't selling at all."

Full text:   On the edge of east Beijing's Central Business District, the Tun San Li sales team stands ready to show off ornately decorated apartments to prospective buyers. But with only one person browsing the literature in the developer's plush waiting room, it's no wonder the sales representatives look bored.
A buying frenzy for the apartments has fizzled, and sales have slowed to a crawl. More than 100 units sit unsold.
"When we first opened, we were selling everything immediately," said one young sales agent, who would give only her family name, Wang. "Now we are selling six or seven units a month. But it's really better than houses selling outside the Fifth Ring," she said, referring to an area about 10 kilometres from the city centre. "Houses there are so inconvenient, they aren't selling at all."
In Shanghai this week, protests erupted when developers offered discounts of up to 40 per cent on new unsold apartments. Several hundred buyers, who had plunked down the full price, were furious their investments had lost so much value before they even received the keys.
Increasingly common stories of slow sales and discounted property are raising fears of a deeper and, many say, overdue correction in the Chinese property market.
Chinese authorities, alarmed by soaring prices and increasing numbers of speculators, have placed limits on who can buy property and on how many homes a person can own.
Bank lending has been tightened to limit developers' ability to undertake new projects and a new emphasis has been placed on the construction of low-cost housing.
The measures appear to be working: National Statistics Bureau numbers released this month showed that housing-price inflation cooled in 59 of 70 cities tracked in September, compared with a year earlier. Property prices in so-called first-tier cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, were flat month-over-month. Shanghai's housing authority this week showed overall property sales volume fell 13 per cent year-over-year, to a six-year low.
The country's largest developer, China Vanke, has also warned that prices have begun a downward spiral.
"We can see a trend of declining sales, especially in the major cities," executive vice-president Shirley Xiao said during a conference call with investors this week, following news that the company's property sales revenue fell 12 per cent in September. "Prices have begun to decline little by little, so we think even buyers who are able to buy will choose to wait because they're targeting even lower price cuts."
China's lofty property prices are far beyond the reach of many citizens, and have prompted widespread talk of an unsustainable bubble.
At Beijing's 800-unit Tun San Li project, which started sales in 2009 and is set to open next June, a small one-bedroom apartment runs about $400,000, and larger dwellings cost more than double that.
In comparison, a typical Chinese middle manager, teacher or government official usually earns less than $1,000 a month.
The fate of the property market is a concern for rising middle-class Chinese families. Owning a home - or two or three - is seen as the most secure way to invest savings when stock markets are notoriously volatile, and a way to help only sons secure a mate in a society where 118 boys are now born for every 100 girls.
The Shanghai protests sparked a great deal of discussion on Chinese Web portals. There have been other reports of developers giving deep discounts in outlying areas of Beijing as well as Shanghai (and, in at least one case, they were pressured into giving rebates to earlier buyers).
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, who as recently as last Saturday called upon local governments to continue adhering to strict recommendations about reining in property prices, now says economic policies may be "fine-tuned." The statement has been interpreted to mean there could be relaxing of the People's Bank's tough monetary policies, which have also included interest rate hikes and increases to banks' reserve ratio requirements.
"Everyone who is buying homes now knows housing prices are in a sensitive period. And of course, owners worry," said Zhang Yue, chief analyst for Beijing real estate agency Homelink.
"But the people who are buying now still believe that future housing prices won't fall significantly, and those who are in doubt are just standing by and watching."

Full text:   REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Real estate information that was once almost impossible to get without the help of an agent is now available online, in yet another sign that the business of selling homes is rapidly changing.
Carefully guarded data on home appraisal values - once the private preserve of real-estate industry insiders - has been posted by a listings website backed by Rogers Communications Inc., which has tapped private databases to give people an instant estimate of a property's value.
The move is significant for buyers and sellers from coast to coast because it is another step in weakening the position of real estate agents, who have long used their privileged access to data about local housing markets as a tool for getting customers - and for justifying commissions that usually cost about 5 per cent of the value of a home.
Last year, the federal Competition Commissioner Melanie Aitken loosened the grip of property agents on home sellers by taking on a case against the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA), arguing that restrictive rules for using the Multiple Listing Service, through which most homes in Canada are sold, were anti-competitive.
The two sides eventually settled the case after CREA agreed to make it easier for sellers to list their homes on that website without using an agent through the entire sales process and paying a full commission.
Now Zoocasa.com has partnered with property valuation company Centract Settlement Services to make local market information available to anyone with a Web connection. By entering any address in the country and providing a few additional details, such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in a house, a user can get an instant price estimate. It can give them a better idea of what their own house is worth - or something to gossip about around the dinner table as they discuss the net worth of friends, family members and neighbours.
"That's one of the fun things about this service," says Butch Langlois, president of Zoocasa. "It's not necessarily your own home that you are interested in pricing."
The service is the latest assault on the traditional real estate model, which has often kept information in the hands of agents to ensure they are an integral part of any sale. As the Internet catches up with the industry, more and more services are being offered individually by smaller companies looking to fill niches.
"Hoarding data has been a crutch that has hurt agents," Mr. Langlois said. "It's a commodity and they have treated it as though it were not. And that has taken the focus away from their more valuable services."
The industry has opened up considerably since the Competition Commissioner's case. The decision caused a proliferation of flat-fee agents, who will post a house on the MLS site and then leave the consumer to handle the rest of the sale on her own, rather than pay a commission to be guided through the entire process.
As the industry evolves, a new host of à la carte services such as Zoocasa's appraisal site are popping up to help consumers with specific portions of a deal. The service, which Zoocasa has coined a Zoopraisal, is modelled on similar features offered by American websites such as Zillow.com.
Zoocasa doesn't charge for the appraisals - it makes its money by charging real estate agents fees to have their ads pop up along with the data. The business is a portfolio company of Rogers Ventures, the business development arm of Rogers Communications.
Mr. Langlois said his site's estimates aren't perfect - they don't take into account improvements such as granite countertops, for example - but they will continue to improve as the service evolves. He also believes the information will ultimately drive business to the country's real estate agents, as consumers make faster decisions based on better information.
The estimates are based on data collected by Centract, an appraisal company owned by Brookfield Residential Property Services that has inspected more than 4 million Canadian homes on behalf of banks and other financial services companies in need of valuation data before writing mortgages.
"This information isn't meant to replace a professional appraiser by any means," said Rob Soja, vice-president of business development at Centract. "But it's a pretty fun tool that can give people a pretty good idea of a property's value."
While Mr. Langlois said he's been surprised by the generally warm reception the service has received from agents since quietly launching last week, there are some who feel the site could give homeowners an inflated sense of worth.
"Homes that are priced too high to start have a good chance of selling for less than they would have if it had been priced right in the first place," said Sara Hamilton, a Century 21 agent in Unionville, Ont. "It also encourages people to not have adequate representation, which can make them more susceptible to being taken advantage of by a buyer looking for a deal."

DIGITAL HOUSE HUNTING
Realtor.ca
What it does
The main web portal of the Canadian Real Estate Association, the site is powered by the trade group's 100-plus regional boards and contains all of the listings held by the country's realtors. Ninety per cent of the country's sales are sourced here.
What it doesn't do
While the public site contains basic information about a house such as price and the number of rooms, to access more comprehensive features, consumers must ask a real estate agent for help. That includes finding out how long the house has been on the market.
Zoocasa.com
What it does
The site offers agents another place to post their listings, and is often seen as complementary to Realtor.ca. It offers rich neighbourhood data, such as demographic breakdowns and neighbourhood amenities. It now offers appraisal estimates, as well.
What it doesn't do
It lacks the richness of listings that is offered by Realtor.ca, because it doesn't get a direct feed from the country's regional real estate boards. That means fewer listings, although the company tries to offset this by offering more services.
Zillow.com
What it does
Often cited as the most sophisticated real estate site in the world, Zillow offers consumers the opportunity to mine deep into a property's history without the help of an agent. It shows recent sales, property tax histories and historical trends for every house listed.
What it doesn't do
Offer Canadian listings. And until recently, it didn't make money either. But after going public this summer, the site just managed to post its first profitable quarter when it earned $1.6-million (U.S.). A year earlier, it had lost $2-million.

Abstract: For [Ashley Margeson], taking advantage of everything university has to offer has accomplished just that. "Getting involved is what helped me survive first year," she says, her voice self-assured. As a student at Acadia-a relatively small, undergraduate-focused school-she found that it was almost impossible to be anonymous and that made her feel like she was part of a supportive community.

Full text:   There's a lot more to university than a piece of paper declaring you a bachelor of arts, science, commerce or engineering. The degree matters, but more importantly, these three or four years could - and should - be the best of your life.
University marks the transition from adolescence to adulthood and from dependence to independence; it's the perfect environment for growth, whether you're ambitious and career-driven, an academic dynamo or haven't the slightest clue what you want to do with your life.
It's an opportunity that is, simply, just too good to waste. And to mark our tenth year, we at the Canadian University Report have singled out 10 aspects of university life in Canada that will help you put into perspective what it's all about. You'll discover, among other things, why university (as expensive as a degree might seem) is cheap at the price; how freshman year is the perfect stepping stone to adulthood; why extracurricular activities and the campus environment will expand your mind and possibly change your life; how easy it is to find the school that suits you best; and how you can find academic fulfilment in the classroom.

1: IT'S A BARGAIN
Tuition is too high in Canada, right? Actually, no. Our universities offer top-flight education on the cheap, compared to global competitors
BY ERIN MILLAR
As soon as Talia Varoglu first stepped foot on the University of British Columbia campus two summers ago, she fell in love. She pictured herself devouring literature on UBC's sprawling grounds, exploring beaches and mountains and pursuing her favourite hobby, horseback riding, at nearby stables. Vancouver seemed a world apart from her hometown in Colorado where she was about to start Grade 12. Wisely, her parents scheduled a second campus tour in January 2011, so that she experienced Vancouver at its worst (and wettest). But for Varoglu, the trip was a mere formality; she was so set on UBC, she didn't apply to any other school.
That UBC offered high-quality education at what for Americans is a cut-rate price was the icing on the cake. Even with international student fees (which, at $22,000 a year, are nearly five times higher than what domestic students are charged), first-year arts student Varoglu paid around the same amount as her older brother who enrolled in his home state at the University of Colorado in Boulder.
Intellectually ambitious and with strong high-school marks, Varoglu wanted the academic challenge of attending a leading school but didn't want to go to an exclusive liberal arts college with its somewhat homogeneous student body. For a fraction of the tuition, UBC offered her an education that consistently ranked among the top three in Canada and top 40 in the world. "Whenever I tell my [Canadian] friends what I'm paying, they are shocked at how expensive it is for international students," she says. "But UBC is actually a total bargain."
Although it may not seem like it to those students and parents who have just finished digging deep into their pockets to pay this semester's tuition, Varoglu has a point. When compared to countries around the world, post-secondary education in Canada is a great value. Not only is tuition here dirt cheap compared to American, Japanese or British schools, but the quality of education delivered by Canada's publicly-funded universities is consistently excellent.
However, cheap tuition doesn't necessarily guarantee quality education. Policy makers have long debated this tricky balancing act. Charge too much tuition and higher education becomes inaccessible for low-income students; charge too little and resource-starved schools struggle to maintain quality. "If you look at what our universities actually spend per student, the value is extraordinary," says Alex Usher, president of the consulting firm Higher Education Strategy Associates. According to a September report from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Canada spends more than $20,000 (U.S.) a year on each post-secondary student, 50% above the OECD average, ranking us third among OECD countries in per-student expenditures after the United States and Switzerland.
Of course, tuition isn't the only expense students struggle to pay. Sarah Klain, a master's student in environmental science at UBC, was shocked by the cost of living when she moved to Vancouver from Salmouth, Maine. But after crunching the numbers, she came to the conclusion that Canada's affordable tuition and health care made up for more expensive groceries. She estimates that she would have needed a $50,000 loan to go to graduate school at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Canada's generous financial aid programs, such as the Canada Grant Program and student loans, also make education here a steal. "We have to remember that although we charge everyone tuition up front, a lot of that is given back right away in tax rebates," says Usher, noting that tax credits range from 20% to 30% of tuition depending on the province.
Financial aid was a significant contributing factor to Klain's decision to study in Canada. Scholarship programs designed to attract talented graduate students allowed her to access funding she may not have received in the United States. As an international student, she isn't eligible for research funding through the federal research funding bodies, but she was offered funding from UBC and private fellowships. When discounts to tuition such as student loans, need-based grants, scholarships and tax breaks are taken into consideration, Canada starts to look even more affordable. In a ranking of the education affordability in 15 countries authored by Usher and his colleague Jon Medow, Canada rose to seventh place once indirect subsidies were included. "When it comes to affordability, we are solidly in the middle of the pack," says Usher. "But we can hold our head up high because the quality is there. We may be one of the best-funded public education systems in the world, up there with the Scandinavians."
For Olivia Freeman, it was Canada or bust. Without the luxury of über-rich parents, the Washington-state native simply couldn't afford to go to college in the U.S. "I quickly realized that UBC and Simon Fraser University were my only financially viable options," she says. Like Varoglu, she believes she has gotten great value for her tuition dollars at UBC.
The aim of the relatively affordable Canadian system is accessibility. By contrast, the U.S. has approached the accessibility challenge by offering post-secondary education at various price-points, from the exclusive $50,000 a year liberal arts college to the much cheaper state university. "But the problem is, of course, that when you provide different price points, you also get different quality points," says Usher. Canada, for the most part, offers high quality across all of its publicly-funded institutions. "This makes us genuinely open, not exclusive." Klain has experienced UBC's openness firsthand through the diverse student body. Having completed her undergraduate degree at the prestigious Reed College in Portland, Oregon, she noticed immediately how her new classmates differed from her former college peers. "Half of the students at Reed College were on financial aid, like me, and the other half came from extremely wealthy families," she explains. "At UBC, I'm exposed to a much more diverse group of students and it's really positive. It has contributed so much to my thinking."
HOW TO GRADUATE (NEARLY) DEBT-FREE
Forget about tuition and the cost of books-the hidden cost of a university education doesn't start adding up until after convocation, when student-loan interest kicks in. Take for example Jack, who graduated with $20,000 in student loan debt. His friend Jill racked up $30,000 in debt. After graduating they both scored decent jobs and were able to pay $4,000 annually against their loans. But because the government began charging 10% interest as soon as they graduated, it took Jack seven years to pay off his $20,000 in principal, which cost him an additional $9,128 in interest. Jill who only borrowed $10,000 more than Jack made loan payments for more than twice as long as he did and forked over $28,228 in interest.
Here are 10 tips for minimizing student loan debt:
1. Start saving early
Ask your parents if they have contributed to a RESP. Put aside a portion from your summer job income-saving even $500 can save you hundreds in interest.
2. Consider alternatives
Can you start your degree at a college where tuition is usually cheaper? Is there a school closer to home so you can live with your parents for the first year or two?
3. Plan your education carefully
Over 50% of undergrads change their major or university. Plan ahead so you don't end up paying for unnecessary classes.
4. Maximize awards
Research scholarships and bursaries, keep an organized application folder containing essays, references and your resumé and apply for as many awards as possible.
5. Create a reasonable budget
Monthly budgets will help you make informed choices about your expenses. But make it realistic; if you pledge never to spend a dime on going out for a beer or other indulgences you're sure to blow the budget.
6. Save on textbooks
Hit up cheaper alternatives to the campus bookstore such as online sellers, used book stores, libraries, friends, or your student union. Some unis even rent textbooks.
7. Work part-time
Ask around campus about student-friendly jobs or look for casual gigs like tutoring.
8. Quit your car
Most universities offer cheap transit deals. The reality is that cars might be meant for people richer than you.
9. Learn about cash flow
Avoid wasting money on credit-card interest, phone-bill penalties, or tuition late-fees by understanding your flow of expenses and income.
10. Be a stingy gourmet
Working on your cooking skills can save you loads of money. Experiment on cheap dishes and bring leftovers to school to avoid pricey cafeteria lunches.

2: FRESHMAN YEAR IS ONE BIG SUPPORT GROUP
It's time to grow up: First year on campus provides everything students need to ease their transition into adulthood
BY ERIN MILLAR
When Ashley Margeson graduated from high school, she was nervous about leaving her family home for her new life as an undergraduate at Acadia University in Wolfville, Nova Scotia. She didn't know how to live on her own, manage a household or stick to a budget. "I had no idea what I was doing," she says. However, within weeks of moving into residence, Margeson's fears had largely abated. She found that she was part of a community of 100 other students, which included residence advisers who could help her deal with any difficult issue. "Residence was definitely the place I wanted to be," she recalls. "It felt like a home, not just a place to sleep."
This May, almost three years after she first arrived at Acadia, the fourth-year nutrition-science student moved into an apartment off-campus. Margeson's experience living in residence-she eventually became a residence advisor-taught her to be aware of how her actions affect others, how to resolve conflicts, and, most importantly, the value of knowing her neighbours. "I don't think I could be pulling this off without first living in residence," she says, adding that "everyone should live at least one year in residence. You learn so much about yourself." Her sentiment can be applied to undergraduate life in general. With so many support services, opportunities and mentors, university is a safe place to make the transition from high school to adulthood.
For example, students can access co-operative education programs, which provide an intermediate step between the academic world and full-time employment. Daniel Finnis, a third-year engineering student at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia has participated in co-ops at three different companies. He worked at B.C.-based Surrey Fluid Power (a manufacturer of hydraulic parts). He then programmed a computer system to control vehicle headlights for Mercedes in Stuttgart, Germany. And, most recently, he was a software tester at LMI Systems in Delta, British Columbia. "Co-op is a chance to test-drive potential careers," Finnis says. "I learned about what I enjoy doing, and the jobs I don't want." While in Stuttgart, Finnis learned how to work with workers who spoke a different language than he did and realized the value of being flexible. He also learned how to deal with different management styles and, more importantly, recognize employers that don't suit him. Co-op is about more than acquiring soft skills, of course. Finnis gained valuable contacts and experience that will help him find employment when he graduates.
The key to these type of programs is that universities provide the infrastructure and support for students to try something new or apply their education in a relatively low-risk environment. "As soon as students enter postsecondary education, they take on a lot of responsibility," says James Sanford, senior director of student services at Acadia University. "It starts in the classroom with higher academic expectations and then stretches into everything from extracurricular activities to personal health."
University students navigating these new challenges are never alone. Counselling and academic services are there to help them as they learn to manage schedules, deal with stress and academic pressures, organize busy social lives and more. Support systems are not designed to bail students out but they do make universities more forgiving. "We want to help students learn to identify what they're feeling, how they're doing, so they know when and how to access what they need," says Sanford. "When they move on, they will take those skills with them. University should instill a sense of confidence and comfort."
For Margeson, taking advantage of everything university has to offer has accomplished just that. "Getting involved is what helped me survive first year," she says, her voice self-assured. As a student at Acadia-a relatively small, undergraduate-focused school-she found that it was almost impossible to be anonymous and that made her feel like she was part of a supportive community. In a student club, she rediscovered her love of dance and now teaches beginner ballet and serves on the club's executive. She also volunteers along with 250 other Acadia students to mentor children with disabilities. She was also elected to student government. The benefits of all these experiences are hard to measure but Margeson feels that her experiences have prepared her for life outside of university. "I now feel like I can get over any bump in the road because university has thrown so much at me in terms of academics, extracurriculars, social life," Margeson says. "You can't figure out how to do something differently until you've made mistakes, and I've been lucky enough to be in a place where I could make mistakes." She adds, "I tell new students I meet that university isn't all about books. Push yourself out of your comfort zone because there will always be someone there to catch you."

4: PROFS WHO LOVE TO TEACH
Not all professors hide away in research labs. Respect for a student's learning style, a drive to teach well and a sense of humour are hallmarks of the great ones
BY EGLE PROCUTA
What makes a great professor? A commanding knowledge of their field is a given. But just as key is a passion for students and a respect for the journey these young adults are taking. Some are so devoted to undergraduate teaching that they choose to do it exclusively. Others maintain a commitment to undergrads while carrying out research and graduate-level teaching. A great professor is engaged-and it doesn't matter if his class has 30 students or 300. And while it doesn't necessarily mean they'll go out for beers every Friday night, it does mean that they will be available during their office hours and ready to answer questions. Often, they will have a sense of humour and demonstrate a desire to learn from their students, as much as their students learn from them. And they will have a willingness to change and adapt their teaching and evaluation methods, whether by embracing new technologies or using old-fashioned networking techniques to pick up teaching tips from other colleagues. The four educators we profile here exemplify these qualities and that's why they deserve to be called great profs.
ROLAND STULL
Professor of Earth and Ocean Sciences, University of British Columbia
Stull, 61, is a world-renowned expert in numerical weather prediction and also specializes in weather-related disasters in mountainous coastal regions. He has been teaching at UBC for 16 years and, before that, he was a faculty member at the University of Wisconsin. A native of Baltimore, Stull has a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering and a PhD in atmospheric science, both from the University of Washington. In his spare time, he likes to fly planes and is also a flight instructor.
Why he's good
Stull has a gift for making science compelling even to those without a background in it. His first-year course, called The Catastrophic Earth: Natural Disasters, has no prerequisites and is a popular choice for non-science majors. Each session draws between 300 and 400 students, half of them female. Every two weeks, Stull brings in a different professor to teach in his or her area of expertise-the topics can include everything from volcanoes to earthquakes. "[The students] enjoy when each of us comes in with our own stories. They see the human side of doing science," Stull says.
Teaching style
He is an advocate of staying on top of technological innovations that boost the effectiveness of his teaching. Between lectures, students are given online questions about that week's reading assignments, including one that asks what topic gave them the most difficulty. This allows Stull to tailor the next class to respond to how the class is progressing, as opposed to where the syllabus says it should be. During the lecture, students use wireless clickers to respond to multiple-choice questions about the topic they are discussing. "I instantly see whether they get it or not," Stull says. If they're having difficulties, he'll segue into a micro-lecture to clarify them.
On engaging students
"I love interacting with the students," Stull says, "to see their eyes light up. To see them evolve and mature. To see the joy of learning." He was very keen to take part in the university's Carl Wieman science education initiative, a project launched in 2007 by the Nobel laureate in physics to improve how science is taught to undergraduates. "Although there are many different teaching methods, it's a reality that not all are effective," says Stull. "The best way to tell is to gather a lot of data and to see where the students are learning. The bottom line is to approach scientific teaching scientifically."
ELIZABETH WELLS
Associate Professor in Music History, Mount Allison University
Wells, 46, grew up in Toronto in a family where there was a lot of music and many teachers. After graduating with a BA in music history at the University of Toronto, she worked at a radio station as a classical music programmer. She chose to go back to university to do graduate work in musicology at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, because she "wanted to go deeper" in her knowledge of the art form. She has been teaching at Mount Allison for 10 years and says that being appointed a National 3M Teaching Fellow in 2010 felt like winning an Oscar.
Why she's good
Wells has developed a number of cool courses-there's one devoted to The Beatles. Another, Music and Difference, comes with a warning label about the R-rated content. Wells is part of a growing movement called the scholarship of teaching and learning, which advocates that professors constantly refine their methods of how to engage students. So, for example, instead of a 15% participation grade, Wells now awards students a 15% professionalism grade-a more important benchmark.
Teaching style
"Because I'm a very organized person, I used to design courses that were very tight, very focused," Wells says. "Now I am much more spontaneous because that's where the real moments of learning happen." Even people who aren't registered in her class drop by because of her gregarious reputation.
On engaging students
She is empathetic to students who don't feel comfortable speaking in front of others and will tell them a story about a painfully shy woman she knew at university-herself. Students are often impressed and touched by her candour. "The journey from a place of uncertainty to a place at the front of a classroom seems a very long journey indeed," Wells says. It's imporntant for "us to always be mindful, with gratitude, of our students-their journeys, their struggles, their victories, their stories-which are ours as well."
DEBORAH SCHNITZER
Professor of English, University of Winnipeg
Deborah Schnitzer, 61, has been teaching at the University of Winnipeg since 1988. She did an undergraduate degree in English and philosophy at the University of Western Ontario and graduate work at the Universities of Calgary and Manitoba. She is also a published poet and novelist, a filmmaker and a social activist. She is a National 3M Teaching Fellow.
Why she's good
Schnitzer loves that students in her classes are not just English majors but come from all disciplines. She welcomes the use of multimedia for assignments, "anything that a student conceives of"-be it a quilt, a picture, a music composition, a dance, a video or a sculpture. Schnitzer is a big believer in learning by doing and started a program where students get hands-on experience through university-community partnerships. In one of these practicum courses, students commit themselves to working four to six hours a week for a non-profit organization, in addition to their time in the classroom. In the second half of the course, they develop a collective community-building class project.
Teaching style
The first thing Schnitzer does in all of her classes, even if there are dozens of students, is to make a circle with the desks. "In a circle, people can't hide in the back with their laptops," she laughs. Regarding the distraction of iPads and smart phones, she chooses to be upfront from the very beginning and asks the students to make a collective decision about what place the devices have in the classroom. She calls it a bill of rights. "We don't pretend it's not going on. We deal with it with humour, warmth, generosity and authenticity."
On engaging students
Schnitzer is devoted to undergraduate teaching and says that she found her very first experience dramatic and exciting. She loves sharing epiphanies with her students, "watching people fall in and out of love with literature."
JOHN BASSO
Undergraduate Laboratory Co-Ordinator, Department of Biology, University of Ottawa
Basso, 51, has been teaching molecular biology and microbiology at the University of Ottawa since 2000. Growing up in Montreal, he wanted to be a vet but, ironically for an award-winning educator, he felt he wasn't a good enough student. He has an MA and PhD from Concordia University, and held two postdoctoral research fellowships before turning to teaching. He was a professor at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, and then moved to the University of Ottawa where he teaches in both English and French.
Why he's good
Basso's open-door policy is so well known that even students who aren't in his class drop by his office to see him-their friends who are in Basso's class assure them: "Go see John. He will help you." Basso offers assistance with everything from deciphering scientific jargon to helping students figure out job applications to prepping them for interviews for medical school. "Students are often intimidated by professors," he says. "Unless you make it really clear to them that you are available, they won't [come to see you.]"
Teaching style
He tells students: "My name is John," and asks them to avoid calling him "Dr. Basso." "I want to show that I'm just like one of them. Not better than them."
On engaging students
He finds interacting with students more gratifying than scientific research and has chosen to commit himself exclusively to teaching, rather than trying to juggle both. "With teaching, you have an immediate impact. You can change minds. Independent of the size of the class, you just want to show the students that you care about what makes them unique, you care about what they'll do and that you'll guide them."
THE FLIPSIDE: RESEARCH OVER TEACHING
Professors should be inspirations and mentors, but far too many students are left disappointed with the person at the front of the lecture hall. In an analysis of 6,000 students as part of the Canadian University Report survey last year, one-quarter said their worst academic experience related to a poor professor. This ranged from frustration over a professor's organizational skills, such as inadequate office hours, to poor language or pedagogical skills and rude or mean demeanor. "They are common complaints," says Alex Usher, founding president of Higher Education Strategy Associates, which analyzes the report's survey responses. First year of university can be a huge shock to many students, he says, and "students are looking for contact and sympathy. They just feel lost and are looking for someone to give them a hand." But unfortunately, many of them are not finding this guidance from their professors. And the situation is getting worse, Usher adds.
Part of the problem stems from professors who are too caught up in their research to be committed to their undergraduate teaching responsibilities. But Usher also blames the economics of how Canadian universities are set up. The institutions are rewarded, both financially and through greater prestige, by producing top-level research. So universities admit more undergraduates then they can realistically handle and then skim from those earnings to pay for research going on at the top.
Given the reward structure, Usher doesn't see the overall picture improving anytime soon. However, there are some smaller changes being made to improve undergraduate students' connection to their professors. For instance, the University of Toronto has first-year seminar courses which are limited to 20 students, instead of the more typical 200 or 300. "Hopefully the professors signing up for these seminars are motivated [to build strong relationships with first-year students]," Usher says.
A more systemic change that would be necessary, he adds, is for university administrations to make the connection between overall budgeting and course loads for professors. He says universities are not deliberately hiding the trade-offs, but they are not making them transparent.

5: TECHNOLOGY HAS TOPPLED THE IVORY TOWER
Course content on smart phones, study notes on Facebook, professors on Skype-and it's a classroom revolution that's been driven by students
BY MICHAEL SNIDER
It's not every class that has its own movie trailer. To be fair, Sidneyeve Matrix, a professor of media and mass communications at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, is a bit of a pioneer when it comes to harnessing the power of social media and technology for her courses. Matrix uses an online chat program called Cover it Live for her office visitation hours, offers to remind students about important dates and assignments via text message and posts all of her lectures onto YouTube and iTunesU, a store for free audio and video podcasts.
She even has an app-ClassCaddy-which is free for Apple and Android devices. It provides just about all the resources her students need for her class, including lecture videos, reading lists and a schedule. And if students can't make it to Kingston for September? No biggie. As long as they have Internet access, they can take the course from home-sitting in their housecoat and bunny slippers-just like 400 other online (in addition to 700 offline) students registered for her class, Film240x: Media and Pop Cult, for the fall.
Technology and education have a somewhat checkered past. At one time or another, just about every magical invention has been predicted to change the face of education, everything from radio to the 1957 Skinner Teaching Machine. But walk into a university classroom and the one piece of technological innovation you'll likely see there is a large vertical black slate, which has been a teacher's main tool for displaying and sharing information for more than 200 years.
You don't have to go back that far to see the love-hate relationship between technology and learning. It wasn't that long ago that laptops and cellphones were banned from lecture halls and students were hauled before disciplinary committees for organizing Facebook study groups. Some universities have blocked Wikipedia while others even shunned Wi-Fi networks.
But things have changed. Today, connectivity is ubiquitous, information is limitless and the ability to communicate anytime, anywhere, with anyone has opened vast opportunities for peer-to-peer learning and collaboration. Attitudes about everything from smartphones to virtual classes are not only gaining acceptance in the gilded halls of academia, a growing number of educators view social media and technology tools as indispensable.
But it's not professors and administrators driving the change. "Momentum comes from the students," says Matrix. "When I wasn't creating podcasts, students were taping my classes. When I wasn't creating RSS feeds of lecture notes, students were trading lecture notes on Facebook. If you don't create a mechanism for them to collaborate, they will do so on their own," she adds.
So who, or what, is the student of 2011? That's just the sort of question Michael Wesch of the University of Kansas has spent the past several years asking. Wesch is a cultural anthropologist who studies and teaches digital ethnography-essentially how tools of communication have altered how we learn, connect and think. In a 2007 video project, Wesch had 200 students in his Introduction to Cultural Anthropology class collaborate on answering a simple question: "What is it like being a student today?" Participants in the video, which has been viewed nearly 4.5 million times on YouTube, hold up some of their declarations on note pads and laptop screens to help summarize some of the characteristics of students today. Among them:
- 18% of my teachers know my name
- Only 26% of class readings are relevant to my life
- When I graduate, I will probably have a job that doesn't exist today
- I Facebook through most of my class
"On some fundamental level [students] are not any different than they were 20 years ago," says Wesch. "Most students are still at school mostly to figure out who they are and who they're going to be. It's not that students are different in their nature, it's that they live in a different environment so the same sorts of drives are expressed in different ways." That's the challenge and the opportunity, says Wesch, where technology can play a role. A lot of the technologies we see today, especially in social networking, were created to explore the search for meaning and are based on the ability to connect with others. While having a course Facebook page may seem like it's just pandering to the "tech-savvy" youth of today, it's important to remember that Facebook was born on a college campus and was meant to make connections between people says Wesch.
But anthropology aside, can something like Facebook or Twitter contribute to the academic side of university?
"Absolutely," says Peter Carr, who teaches courses on the impact of information systems on society and social media for business at the University of Waterloo. "The new modern philosophies of education would say it's important to have students working in groups, interacting with each other and the professor and learning the content together."
Carr is one of the growing number of professors who spends more time online than in the classroom. Recently, Carr had a group of 30 students work with the Red Cross in Geneva as part of a project to investigate how the organization set up franchise operations and delivered services such as health education. Students connected with Red Cross workers at offices in Uganda, Colombia and India using Skype. During the week, students would be on the "phone" with Africa and whenever they had a question to ask or if they had something interesting to share, they would buzz Carr at his computer.
"The way I like to think about it is that we can make the outside world more visible to the students and have them interact more with the outside world around their subjects. That, I think, is where there is a lot of opportunity for us to really make education better."
BEYOND THE CHALKBOARD
Facebook
Every course should have a Facebook page. Students can crowdsource-that is, share relevant information with the group and post links to resources. Some profs come up with inventive ideas, such as having students create profile pages for historical figures, replete with extensive bios.
Twitter
Some professors take questions via Twitter during class or display running commentary on a big-screen monitor.
Cover it Live
The online chat tool is used by some professors for their office hours rather than managing a queue of bodies lined up outside the door. Students ask questions and everyone can read the replies. Chats are saved and links can be posted online for future reference.
Skype
The communication tool runs on computers and smartphones and can be a free source of audio or video messaging.
YouTube/iTunesU
Either is good for recording and uploading audio or video of class lectures; both are accessible on mobile and desktops and are great for catching up on classes one might have missed.
remind101
An SMS service lets profs program reminders and announcements and send text messages or emails to students.
Webex
A webinar service that live-streams video to up to 1,000 remote online viewers. Sessions can re recorded and offer e-mail reminders, detailed reporting on attendance and participation and live polling features.

6: IT WILL HELP YOU GET A BETTER JOB (REALLY)
The mix of ideas and the skills to put them in action is what's giving fresh value to undergrad degrees
BY JENNIFER LEWINGTON
Record numbers of first-year university students flocked to campus this fall-but that hasn't stopped nagging questions about the value of a bachelor's degree. Despite persuasive statistical evidence that graduates find careers related to their studies and earn more than others over a lifetime, Canadian universities are under the gun to demonstrate what it means to have a degree.
Prodded by rising expectations of students, parents, government demands for greater accountability, and a push from within to rethink undergraduate education, Canadian universities are expanding efforts to link academic studies to the "real" world. "We know the [degree] credential has value and that employers are looking at it and making hiring decisions based on the credential," says Glen Jones, a professor of higher education at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education. "Universities now are trying to expand the notion of what is associated with the credential that could be helpful to the student, make a better educational experience and yes, that may have down-the-road implications for employability." In addition to co-op education and internships, universities offer co-curricular records that recognize work-relevant skills, such as communication and leadership, developed through volunteer activities either on- or off-campus.
Some universities have started pilot projects to include resumé writing and career exploration in the curriculum, while others spell out course-level learning outcomes-such as the ability to think critically and work with others-valued by employers. The idea is to help students develop knowledge and skills that will apply whatever their chosen career. "You don't want to equip students to be bankers; you want to equip them to do whatever they might be inclined to do," says McMaster University president Patrick Deane, a leading advocate of reforming undergraduate education. His university and others have embraced "experiential learning"-such as undergraduate research projects that offer learning opportunities outside the classroom-as integral to the academic experience.
Melding theory and practice is old hat for professional schools, such as business and medicine, but new as a campus-wide phenomenon. "It's a relatively recent thing for universities across the board to think in terms of the outcome of the learning process to reasonably equip students for what they want to do," says Deane.
Since 2002, McMaster's faculty of social sciences has offered undergraduate research awards to a dozen or so top students. Over the summer, they earn $6,000 to work on a project of their choice, in collaboration with a professor, an experience designed to provide insights into potential careers.
Last summer, fourth-year anthropology student Ana-Maria Dragomir assisted Canada Research Chair and McMaster professor Megan Brickley with an inventory of skeletal remains of soldiers from the Stoney Creek battle of the War of 1812. "It was not just a summer job; it was a life experience," says Dragomir, who has landed a part-time job with Brickley this fall. "My research over the summer helped me develop a lot of skills that will be transferable regardless of the career I will pursue," she says.
Increasingly, students draw strong links between a degree and a job. A 2010 survey of first-year students by the 39-member Canadian University Survey Consortium found that future employment ranked highest among eight reasons to earn a degree. In the survey, 43% cited preparation for a specific job while 24% ranked getting a good job as the prime reason to attend university.
So how do universities measure up?
Better than the public realizes, says Paul Davidson, president of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada. "The basic premise that the value of a BA is not what it used to be is wrong," he says, citing census information that shows those with an undergraduate degree will earn, on average, $1.4 million more over a lifetime than others without a post-secondary degree and $1 million more than college graduates.
An overlooked statistics, he adds, is the creation of more than 300,000 new jobs for university graduates in the recent recession compared to the loss of 430,000 jobs for those without post-secondary education.
In Canada, as in other industrial countries, those with a university degree earn significantly more than those graduating from high school or vocational programs. Based on 2008 data, Statistics Canada reports that earnings of Canadian university graduates were 70% higher than those coming out of high school or trades training and 63% higher in country members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. As well, employment prospects also rise with educational attainment. In 2009, Statscan reported an 82% employment rate for adults aged 25-64 with a diploma or degree compared to a rate of 55% for who had not finished high school.
But the rise of degree-granting colleges, the expansion of credit transfers that smooth pathways between higher-education institutions, and college bragging rights about the employability of their graduates has universities honing their pitch.
Last month, as Ontario's 20 universities accepted a record 90,000 first-year students, their lobbying arm unveiled a new website, MyEducationHasValue.ca, to explain financial assistance and employment trends. "We know that the whole concept of a career and a job is at or near the top of the priority list of students and parents," says David McMurray, vice-president of student affairs at Wilfrid Laurier University.
At Laurier, which promotes student engagement and is expanding the menu of academic programs that blend theory and practice, a global studies course with a for-credit component on career development will be piloted this fall.
Students will be expected to integrate soft skills normally acquired outside the classroom into their academic studies. "The 'aha' moment comes when they say 'I see how those skills I learn in the classroom transfer into the economy'," says Laurier director of learning services Gail Forsyth.
At the University of Alberta, experiential learning is also a priority. For example, the university introduced a campus-wide undergraduate research initiative last month for students to take part in projects, in and outside the classroom and for-credit or not, that develop skills of inquiry, analysis and collaboration. "Students are dearly asking for these things because they are learning skills that make critical, informed citizens," says Connie Vanhagen, academic director for the initiative. "They don't just want a pile of facts in their heads. They want to do something with it and that is exactly what employers want, too."
The U of A Students' Union, which has campaigned for the initiative for two years, will put on a two-day symposium next month to show off current collaborations between students and professors. "I think it will improve the perception of the value of having an undergraduate degree," says Emerson Csorba, academic vice-president for the students' union. He is also on a university task force to identify the desired attributes of a U of A graduate. A third-year student in political science at the university's francophone campus, and the first in his family to attend university, Csorba has not settled on a career yet. But he has no doubts why he wants a degree. "To me, the aim of education is to instill critical thinking skills and a sense of engagement in students," he says.
THINK THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES? ONE SCHOOL'S JOB PROMISE
Chantal Poirier, a third-year kinesiology student at the University of Regina, knows she is heading into a competitive job market when she graduates in two years. That's why the 20-year-old from Antler, Saskatchewan, took her university up on its unusual offer to guarantee she will find career-related employment six months after earning her degree. If she is unsuccessful, the university will offer her another year of classes, worth $6,000, for free. Poirier, who attended workshops last year on interview skills, resumé writing, exam preparation and career development activities, is considering a career working with people with disabilities. As part of the guarantee, she spent 40 hours volunteering with the local chapter of Special Olympics. "I hope all this experience and help will guarantee me a job," says Poirier, one of 343 students who took advantage of the offer when it was introduced in 2009. This year, 150 students signed up even before the start of school last month.
According to the province, 98% of University of Regina graduates find employment and the university's 704 co-op education placements last year represents a 24% increase in five years.
So why the need for a guarantee?
"Our studies show the reasons student leave [without graduating] is not for academic or financial reasons but because of a lack of connection and engagement [with the university]," says Regina president Vianne Timmons. She wants to boost the current proportion of students who return after first year. The promise of a successful career is the "hook" for the guarantee, says Timmons, but its real purpose to connect students to life on campus, in and outside the classroom.
Students who sign up must stay for four years of school, participate in at least 25 hours of workshops, join the university's co-op education program and develop relevant interview skills through mock interviews. They can also attend campus career fairs, join a student club and participate in intramural athletics or volunteer activities. After they graduate, they must demonstrate efforts to find employment.
The university won't know until 2013 who might return for free courses. This year, they will evaluate students in the guarantee program against a random sample to see how they are doing in school. For Timmons, success will be measured by "whether I have a higher percentage of student success for students enrolled in the guarantee."

7: IT WILL OPEN YOUR MIND
Are classrooms plagued by rote learning with too much focus on students' job prospects? Some critics believe so-but for those with a purer vision of higher learning, all is not lost
BY ROSANNA TAMBURRI
Simon Bradshaw, a University of Ottawa graduate, didn't get much out of his first undergraduate degree in English and theatre. He admittedly spent too much of his time socializing at the expense of his studies. After graduating and then trying & reg;-largely unsuccessfully-to break into the Ottawa acting scene, he returned to Ottawa U determined to make a fresh start. This time around he enrolled in psychology-and his experience couldn't have been more different. For this, he credits his professors, some of whom challenged him in ways no one had before. But a change in his attitude also played a role. He read assignments with a more critical eye, asked questions, participated in class discussions and sought out professors after class. It was difficult at first. "I felt intimidated," he says. "It took a bit of courage to go and strike up a conversation and feel that the questions and thoughts I had were not useless." Yet, he found most professors welcomed the exchange. "So often I had their complete and undivided attention," he says. The knowledge he acquired pursuing his second degree surprisingly led him back to the theatre. "Ironically, a lot of ideas that I learned in psychology came to apply to the arts and theatre, which I thought I was leaving behind," says the actor, now 30 years old.
Universities have come under a seemingly endless stream of criticism in recent years: Students complain about rising tuition fees and overcrowded classrooms. Professors gripe about the lack of student preparedness and declining academic standards. Ken Robinson, an internationally renowned author and advocate of educational reform, chastises educational systems that shun the arts and stifle student creativity. And one notable U.S. study found that when it comes to teaching students how to think critically, universities fail miserably.
Arshad Ahmad, a business professor at Concordia University and president of the Society for Teaching and Learning in Higher Education, is among the first to admit that all is not well in the world of postsecondary education, and he has plenty of ideas to fix what ails it: smaller first-year classes to start; introducing more co-operative, community-service and problem-based learning; encouraging more student-faculty interaction; and getting undergraduates involved in research. But, he adds, the situation is far from the doomsday scenario that some critics would have you believe. Universities, he notes, are more accessible now than they have ever been. Despite its drawbacks, he says, a university education can be a "game-changer" for young people, and not solely because it can help them land a good job. "I would say the glass is definitely half full," he says.
Eli Cwinn, a master's student at the University of Guelph agrees. "University can be either as big as you want or as small as you let it," he says. Over the course of his undergraduate career, he encountered the odd professor too busy or uninterested to talk to students. But by and large most of them seemed thrilled when a curious student showed up at their office door. "They will share their expertise quite willingly," he says.
Fellow students can be another source of inspiration. Making connections can be difficult in the early years when the classes are big but by the time students reach third and fourth year, there are opportunities for collaboration. "You start to see the world from their perspective and that fuels your growth," he says. "In every university regardless of how downtrodden it is or how low it scores in the rankings, you can find a spring or well of inspired thinking," adds Ron Marken, professor emeritus at the University of Saskatchewan. The trouble is, it may not be at the forefront of the curriculum. "But you can find places if that's indeed what you want," he says.
Claude Lamontagne, a psychology professor at the University of Ottawa and the recipient of numerous teaching awards, is a strong critic of a postsecondary system that, in his view, emphasizes rote learning over critical thinking. Even so, he concedes, it is still the best place for critical self-discovery. Students, he says, "are capable of incredible insight" but are hampered by a system that all too often doesn't allow them to express their ideas. Education should be an "awakening," he says. His advice to students: Take advantage of opportunities like directed-reading courses that allow for independent study and one-on-one interaction with faculty; opt for classes with low student-to-faculty ratios; and don't fall into the trap of believing that the sole purpose of a university degree is to get a good job.
"When used creatively, I think university is the best thing that can happen to anyone," says Roger Moore, professor emeritus at St. Thomas University in New Brunswick. As he sees it, one of its many benefits is that it can help young people discover hidden talents and interests. Moore, a former professor of Spanish, recalls one student asking his permission to create a painting instead of writing an essay as the course required. It was an unorthodox request. Reluctantly, he agreed to it on the condition that she should present it to the class in Spanish. The painting was an intricate and stylized depiction of the 16th century conquest of Mexico at the hands of the Spanish. It took him aback. After many lengthy discussions with the student, he advised her to pursue a degree in the arts rather than try to master the proper technique of essay-writing. The student went on to study architecture; the painting still hangs in his home.

8: IT'S AN EXTRACURRICULAR WONDERLAND
Classes might lead you down a certain path, but it's the myriad campus opportunities that help you discover who you really are
BY EGLE PROCUTA
When people reminisce about their time at university, or high-school students look forward to theirs, often it's the campus activities and not the classroom ones that they think about. Tony Chambers, assistant professor of higher education at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, says there is a reason for that. "University changes lives," he says and his research shows that experiences outside of lecture halls and labs can contribute as much to learning, and in some cases more. That's why Chambers advocates the use of the term co-curricular to describe all the activities that take place on campus, from student government and sports teams to culture clubs and faith groups. "Extracurricular is misleading because it suggests an à la carte choice," he says. "We need to get away from the sense that learning only occurs in the classroom."
Chambers is calling upon universities and colleges to readjust their way of thinking and ensure that co-curricular activities are an integral part of all programs. This is especially important because, with the rising costs of education, more and more students need to work while they study and can be missing out on the learning that takes place on campus outside the classroom unless it is formally recognized as part of their degree process. Co-curricular activities build emotional intelligence, Chambers says, "and provide graduates with the ability to translate theory into application."
We look at two students who are putting that theory into practice:
VICTORIA SAIGLE
Saigle, 20, from Metcalfe, Ontario, is in her third year at McGill University majoring in cognitive science, with a minor in French. She hopes for a career in scientific research and wants to be fluently bilingual by the time she graduates.
Beyond the classroom
Saigle is in her third year singing with Effusion, an a cappella ensemble specializing in pop, soul and R & B that was formed at McGill in 1999. She found out about Effusion during first year at an orientation session where the group performed. "It looked like so much fun," she says. "It was immediately where I knew I wanted to be."
Memorable moment
This came in first year when she was among the 180 students auditioning for one of 20 spots in Effusion. Saigle chose Sara Bareilles's Fairytale, because it showed off her range. Although she had studied classical music at high school, she had never performed pop before. "I'm not going to lie," she says, "it was nerve-racking."
How she pulls it off
Saigle devotes about five hours a week to Effusion, going to rehearsals two evenings a week. Rehearsals get more intensive when they're getting ready for their two big concerts each year or a tour. She finds it easy to strike the right balance between Effusion and her school work because she knows at the beginning of the year when all her assignments are due and can plan her schedule accordingly. She finished her second year with a B+ average.
The payoff
Saigle says Effusion has made a huge difference in enriching her university experience. The other members in the group are like her family and provide an important support network while she's away from home. "Everyone wants to do as much as possible together," she says. "It's really a lot of love. It doesn't seem intensive at all. It's just fun."
Word of advice
Saigle says that because McGill is so big, it's hard to be aware of the range of extracurricular activities available. What's missing is cohesiveness in how information is communicated to students.
SEAN HEISLER
Heisler, 22, from Calgary, is in his final year studying applied engineering at the University of British Columbia. Engineering runs in his family, but Heisler says he doesn't see himself building bridges all his life. He completed his first year at Queen's before transferring to UBC for its multidisciplinary, co-op program.
Beyond the classroom
Heisler is deep into university politics now, even though he used to be mostly apolitical. When he signed up as secretary of the engineering department's student club, he jokes that he was drawn to the prospect of a free dinner. After, he became a student senator and that is where he really began to hit his stride. He ran successfully to serve on the university's board of governors and has now been re-elected for a second term.
Memorable moment
When he began his first term on the board of governors, he was dismayed at the three-inch binders full of support material that awaited each member at every meeting. "It was really heavy, really expensive, really wasteful," he says. So he pushed for paperless meetings. Now, all support material is sent electronically and Heisler was able to demonstrate that buying every board member an iPad actually saved money.
How he pulls it off
Heisler pends three to five hours a day on student politics-more when he travels to conferences-but he still maintains an A average. He says he builds energy through his involvement, rather than seeing it as a drain on him.
The payoff
Heisler has discovered career options like real estate development and human-resources management. As well, he thinks that he would possibly run for federal or provincial office.
Word of advice
An advocate of telling students to get involved on campus in anything and everything, he advises networking to find a good fit among the wide variety of activities available. "Dive in," he says, because you never know what's going to strike your fancy.

9: THE CHANCE TO DO RESEARCH
Research isn't just the domain of grad students. Undergrad opportunities can lead to lifelong intellectual journeys
BY ALLISON DUNFIELD
Getting a university education conjures up images of students poring over textbooks, cramming for exams and attending lectures. But more than ever, a degree-even an undergraduate one-comes with time spent in a lab. Experts say that hands-on experience is becoming necessary to compete for jobs in the real world. And the opportunities for research are as endless as a student's imagination. Some don traditional white coats and work on campus while others go abroad or trek up north to study the environment.
While lab work was once the domain of master's and PhD students, it's becoming more common for undergraduates to do research as part of their study, said Christine Tausig Ford, vice-president of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada. "Universities are making sure they're taking innovative approaches and incorporating meaningful research experiences for undergraduate students," adds Ford. And lab work at all levels provides many benefits because students improve their critical thinking and analytical skills.
We talked to three students about what they're researching:
JACQUELINE RICHELLE,
BSc in Biological Sciences, University of Manitoba
Jacqueline Richelle didn't imagine that doing research as an undergraduate science student at the University of Manitoba would lead her to India, but that's exactly what happened.
Her journey began after her second year, when Richelle applied to do research work as part of her goal to enter the faculty of medicine. "I felt research experience would be valuable to me if I could find an area that was related to health care." Luckily, Richelle was awarded a summer research position in biological sciences in 2010. She found a supervisor whose work she admired-department head Judy Anderson-and worked with her team to isolate specific individual muscle fibres in mice and zebra fish, which are activated to generate new muscle when it is damaged or exercised.
The goal is to look at the activation process causing these muscle cells to divide and make new muscle if it is exercised or damaged, she says. It's hoped that Anderson's research could help slow muscle atrophy in those suffering from disorders such as muscular dystrophy, or in elderly populations.
This past May, Anderson invited Richelle to India for two weeks to help teach the technique at the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine (inStem) in Bangalore. That experience was amazing, said Richelle. "Everyone there was so interested to hear what you had to say and it was really nice to be able to collaborate with people on the other size of the world."
NATHAN WILBUR,
Masters in Civil Engineering, University of New Brunswick
As a boy, Nathan Wilbur lived to fish. Fast forward some 20 years, and he's literally swimming with the fish as part of his lab work. The 26-year-old student at the University of New Brunswick is completing his thesis on how changes to the environment are affecting water temperatures and fish populations. "I just love anything to do with salmon and trout and their habitat and that's what this project was all about."
Wilbur was asked to take part in the research by one of his professors, Dr. Allen Curry, when he was completing his BSc degree at UNB. Under the supervision of Curry, who's also the director of the Canadian Rivers Institute, he started his master's thesis on the project in 2009. The research was, according to Wilbur, a perfect combination of high-tech computer work and field research. Researchers wanted to find cold-water regions in the Miramichi River basin where salmon and trout gather if the water temperature climbs past 23 C. Since fish can't endure such high temperatures, they will seek out cooler areas. (Because of environmental changes and human activity, water temperatures have risen in recent years, pushing the fish to find chillier spots.)
The team gathered information on the rivers using a helicopter with an infrared camera, then mapped the cold patches using a computer program. The next step, said Wilbur, was to conduct dives. "Basically I snorkelled with the fish and took measurements on where they were and other conditions, like how deep was the water, how fast was it flowing."
One goal of the study is to help forestry or watershed groups understand how fish are using the cold water zones so that they can avoid building roads or clear-cutting camps nearby, says Wilbur. The other is to provide them with resources to help them restore cold water areas. Wilbur is completing his thesis and hopes to eventually publish the work in an environmental journal. He may also do a PhD on the same subject. Being able to conduct his research in the field is one reason Wilbur is so enthusiastic about his studies. "We got to observe what the fish were doing with our own eyes, and actually see it right in front of us. I think that's so important. It's not the typical lab experience."
IDA FOSTER,
BA in Psychology, Concordia University
Ida Foster hopes her research in psychology at Concordia University could some day prevent many children affected with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) from taking up smoking. After her first year, Foster began volunteering at several labs to boost her research experience. One was Dr. Jennifer McGrath's Pediatric Public Health Psychology (PPHP) lab. McGrath's work examines cardiovascular precursors in children as part of a longitudinal study known as the Healthy Heart Study.
Now in her third year, with McGrath as her supervisor, Foster chose the topic of ADHD and smoking for her honours thesis. Using data from the Healthy Heart Study, she examined the attitudes toward smoking in children with inattentive or hyperactive forms of ADHD. She found that those with inattention-type were more likely not to notice the consequences of smoking, such as lung cancer, while those with hyperactive forms were more likely to notice perceived benefits, such as helping them calm down.
The hope is that the research will help health educators to customize smoking prevention programs for children with ADHD. "What we have found is that the literature that is out there is that those with ADHD are more likely to smoke. So we are targeting kids before they start."
Foster is currently completing a manuscript of the thesis to submit to a journal. She is applying for graduate studies in 2012 in a combined clinical and forensic psychology and law program and hopes to become a clinical psychologist.

10: THE CAMPUS BUILDING BOOM
Cool, architecturally-distinguished new academic buildings are sprouting up coast to coast, thanks to bold new thinking and an injection of government cash
BY PHILIP FINE
Architect Gilles Saucier was recently given a great compliment. An individual working in a building he designed told him how much he now enjoys going to work.
University administrators seem to know all too well the rejuvenating powers that a good space can offer its dwellers and seem to have harnessed that power for their recruitment and fundraising strategies. They've also been getting architects to help tame sprawling campuses or make traditional downtown campuses more green.
There's a building boom taking place on Canadian campuses and the new buildings have helped lure academic rock stars, while maquettes are now built a bit earlier so that funders can be brought on board.
Architect Bruce Kuwabara says a building can push forward a university's identity as it did when his firm, Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects (KPMB) helped in 2005 and 2009 to transform and open up Concordia University's downtown campus in Montreal, with over 300,000 square metres of new space. More recently it finished both its Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), affiliated with the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University, and the doubled-in-size University of Toronto Rotman School of Management.
Architects talk of making campuses more livable, including peaceful courtyards, offices exposed to natural light, windows that let in fresh air, more green space, common areas that offer colleagues from different disciplines the opportunity to bump into each other and places to step into so that conversations might turn into rich debates.
"Some of the most important conversations in learning are not in the classroom," says Kuwabara, who says it has been difficult to try and get approval for common spaces when many institutions believe their money should only go toward classrooms and labs. Michael Heeney, whose firm Bing Thom helped integrate a university and office tower into an existing shopping mall in Surrey, British Columbia, to create a new vibrant Simon Fraser University campus, says "students like to be where the action is and not be segregated in an ivory tower."
Functionally, there have been many changes among the spate of new buildings: flex rooms that can act as a classroom one semester and a TA's office the next, a building that despite its high tech equipment no longer takes on a windowless fortress identity, lecture halls designed to not put students to sleep, libraries that share warehoused collections and make space for breakout rooms and research pods, and architecture that invites the city to walk freely through its public spaces.
The building boom can be traced back to the announcement in January 2009 of the Knowledge Infrastructure Program, a two-year, $2 billion federal stimulus package. It funded 538 university and college projects, providing half the costs of infrastructure projects, including new building construction.
The Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), which has been providing tools and materials to researchers since 1997, including funds to help bring on board other partners for new buildings, has injected more than a billion dollars into the university and health sector in the last two years.
By the end of this year, one firm, Diamond+Schmitt, will have unveiled a phenomenal 11 Canadian university buildings, including Queen's School of Medicine, Thompson Rivers University House of Learning and University of Toronto's Scarborough campus.
There is a strange juxtaposition here. While there seems to be lots of money available for university infrastructure, the average amount awarded for a funding agency research grant has dropped by nearly 20% since 2004 and three out of four health researchers applying to the CIHR find themselves turned down for funding.
Does this risk having a country with pretty buildings housing cash-starved researchers? According to CFI's Douglas Lauriault, the ratio of infrastructure expenditures to research funding is on par with other developed countries. In the meantime, he says, the building boom has meant that Canadian universities are finally "dreaming big."
*
The gold standard for sustainable buildings is actually a platinum certification, and that's what Lakehead University received for its Orillia campus. It's the first Canadian university to get the award. Opened last fall, the $43 million Moriyama and Teshima designed Academic Building (officially known as 500 University Avenue) was the first new structure erected on the five-year-old campus. It boasts a geo-thermal system, a green roof and a rain-water retention pond.
*
The University of Toronto just increased the overall academic space on its Scarborough campus by 25% and it's done it with the Instructional Centre. Designed by Diamond and Schmitt Architects, the 15,000-square-metre facility houses both management, and computer and mathematical sciences programs. One innovative feature - rooftop solar cells - could end up generating revenues for the university as any excess energy will be sold to the Ontario Power Authority.
*
The Universite de Montreal recently unveiled a new suburban address in Lavaly. The six-storey building from architects Jodoin Lamarre Pratt, opened in September and stands next to a subway station. Although the building will offer some services to the public its primary function is to provide a home for students in the arts and science, nursing, continuing education and science education programs.
*
The University of New Brunswick's Richard J. Currie Centre has put a bit of drama into its new sports facility. Designed by B+H Architects, in association with Sasaki and ADI, the $35 million, five-storey building houses high-performance athletics facilities, a recreational gym, kinesiology labs and sports medicine faculty spaces.
*
"There is a growing recognition that universities have a unique societal opportunity and responsibility to be test beds for sustainability," says John Robinson, executive director of UBC's Sustainability Initiative. Its Centre for Interactive Research on Sustainability is practising what it preaches - and what it teaches. The $37 million building, designed by Busby Perkins + Will, possesses a green wall, meets its non-potable water needs with rainwater and recovers heat from one department and returns it to another.

Full text: Wingfield's World: The Complete Letters from Wingfield Farm
By Dan Needles
Vintage Books, 448 pages, $24.95
Many Canadian readers are familiar with Dan Needles's popular books, Letters from Wingfield Farm and Wingfield's Hope . Since 1984, he's also penned seven plays and mounted 4,000 performances across Canada and the United States with actor Rod Beattie starring as his protagonist newbie farmer, Walt Wingfield. Now, like the entire Stars War DVD collection, there's Wingfield's World , a novelization of all seven Wingfield plays. The author uses an 18th-century epistolary format: Rural newcomer Walt Wingfield writes to his small-town Ontario newspaper.
There's a broad appeal to Needles's fish-out-of-water tales. His setting for the Wingfield Farm letters is rural southern Ontario, within two hours of manic Toronto. This is where Needles's alter ego, urban-stockbroker-turned-farmer Walt Wingfield, lives on a 100-acre farm in fictional Persephone Township, among a multigenerational gaggle of wing-nut inhabitants.
Wingfield's neighbours comprise a mix of age groups, co-existing in an 150-year-old Scottish Presbyterian settlement. "Every August, the Women's Auxiliary gets together and holds a dance to break up the harvest. They hire a one-lung orchestra from Lavender and wax the floor of the Orange Lodge for the occasion. A general amnesty is declared on Catholics and the pictures of King Billy crossing the Boyne are retired into the loft to avoid offending anyone." This is the cultural setting for the Squire, a stoic, octogenarian ex-farmer, Don, a middle-age dairy farmer, Freddy, a middle-aged bachelor farmer-auctioneer-hoarder - with more grassy areas to drag auction detritus onto than he'll ever have time to restore - and Freddy's hillbilly twentysomething nephews, Willy and Dave.
Needles's smartest plot device in his urban-rural split saga is to have Wingfield marry a local woman, Freddy's sister Maggie, which gives Walt more acceptance. When Wingfield finally gets comfortable in his adopted community, he decides to run for council, but he is warned off by neighbour Freddy, who pragmatically explains: "It's not that people wouldn't agree with what you have to say. It's just that you're from the city. They won't even consider you."
Needles covers all of the standard rural archetypes: ancient rural feuds "that date back to the Crusades," the "Evil Eye" culture (folk wisdom), a real estate developer/urban lawyer antagonist who wants to subdivide a farm for condos, and at least one loyal border collie, who has a biting feud with one of the hillbilly nephews.
Wingfield's World even plays with the rural shun, which is carried on by rural people with more endurance and zeal than a country club could ever bother to maintain. Professor Burns and his wife, a retired, ex-urbanite couple, move into the township and build a "passive solar geodesic energy-self-sufficient New Earth" home. They may as well be cross-dressers at a Tory party rally.
Wingfield's World is rural romance, not the harsh reality of a real fish out of water, where too much truthiness can get you in trouble with your new rural friends. Needles, also a rural resident, has his central character successfully navigate the newcomer territory by making Wingfield the butt of most of the jokes.
Next time you're brooding in your postage-stamp condo pondering a move to the pastoral countryside, read the cautionary - but very funny - Wingfield's World instead.

Full text: Cleaning up and redeploying former industrial wastelands pays off for Canadian developers
Real estate developers are not always an altruistic or patient lot, typically looking for maximum returns on their investments right away.
For those who develop brownfields sites - where the soil and water are contaminated by former industrial and commercial uses - such expectations might have to be held in check. Cleaning up environmental messes, obtaining planning approvals, and building on such sites can mean long lead times and substantial costs.
Now provincial incentives, municipal planning enhancements, and trends toward urban intensification are making the redevelopment of such sites pay off, says David Harper, a managing partner with the Kilmer Brownfield Equity Fund, a private investment firm focused on redeveloping brownfields.
Mr. Harper was recently proclaimed Brownfielder of the Year at the 12th annual Canadian Brownfields conference, staged by the Canadian Urban Institute (CUI).
Mr. Harper says that there has been a recent evolution in policy supporting brownfield redevelopment. His company, which started five years ago, has raised more than $93-million from both institutional and private investors, with four projects in different stages and one finished. He says it can take about three years for brownfields to be cleaned up and ready for construction to commence; investors in such situations are not acting as charities but are looking for value.
"You can go good - and do well," explains Mr. Harper, a specialist in environmental risk management. "No one's going to do this because it makes them feel good, that's a reality," he says. "You can make a return if you do it correctly."
Cleaning up brownfields has a multiplying and leveraging effect for communities, Mr. Harper says. "It's a win-win-win."
The following projects all won 2011 CUI Brownie Awards, sponsored by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
Best Overall Project
Tannery District, Kitchener, Ont.
Lana Sherman recalls the first time she saw The Tannery, a derelict manufacturing plant occupying an entire city block in downtown Kitchener, Ont. At a friend's suggestion, she and Gary Maister, managing directors of Cadan Inc., a development company based in Toronto, drove to the property in 2007 to consider it for possible redevelopment.
"I see amazing things here," Ms. Sherman recalls thinking. Others weren't so sure, given the site's sheer scale and soil contaminated with oil and heavy metals.
Today, Ms. Sherman's "amazing things" have come to pass, with the refurbished Tannery District more than 90 per cent occupied by an eclectic group of tenants.
The huge complex, which dates to 1853 (when Kitchener was called Berlin) was originally built for industrial uses, including the stretching and finishing of leather.
Today, it comprises an astonishing 340,000 square feet (almost 31,600 metres), which Ms. Sherman likens to "the TD Tower lying on its side."
The exposed-brick-and-wood development includes Class A office space, which houses "new-economy" tenants paying premium rents, such as Google, as well as a vast collection of artisans and other eclectic uses.
Best Large-Scale Project
East Village Re-Development, Calgary
It was an area at Calgary's heart 100 years ago, bustling with commerce, industry and life, next to two rivers and the fort on which the city was founded.
Yet Calgary grew in a different direction; its oil-and-gas towers, business and residential areas rising to the south and west.
What had become known as East Calgary, and the East Village at its core, languished in the last few decades, dirty and derelict, plagued by prostitution and crime, with few services or infrastructure to attract development.
"Calgarians were not kind to the East Village; if anything needed to be dumped, they did it there," says Susan Veres, vice president of marketing and communications for the Calgary Municipal Land Corporation.
The organization was started four years ago by the City of Calgary to rejuvenate the sprawling 309-acre East Calgary, known as the Rivers District, with a particular focus on making the 49-acre (almost 20 hectares) East Village, bordered by the Bow and Elbow rivers, into a mixed-use, mid-rise community.
Today, the East Village has been transformed, with an investment of $108-million to reclaim contaminated soils and install flood-control measures, roads, a promenade, services and a storm-water retention system.
It's all part of a master plan, Ms. Veres says, that will see continued residential and commercial development for 20 years.
Best Small-Scale Project
Davie Village Community
Garden, Vancouver
Redeveloping brownfields can take years, leaving empty lots surrounded by chain-link fences as the wheels of project development slowly turn. In Vancouver's Davie Village neighbourhood, what could have been a blight left by the demolition of a gas station is instead blooming.
Prima Properties Ltd. will eventually turn the 2,000-square-metre site at the busy intersection of Burrard and Davie streets into a mixed-use residential tower. But in the meantime Prima, together with Hemmera Inc., an environmental consulting firm, have turned the idle land into the Davie Village Community Garden.
Shell decommissioned the station when it sold the property to Prima three years ago. Hemmera then oversaw the remediation of the land, which housed both the gas station and a dry cleaner. Finally, clean soil was brought in, garden beds and walkways were constructed and 135 plots were turned over to local gardeners.
*****
REMOTE PROBLEMS
Brownfield redevelopment is most viable and lucrative in urban centres where property values are highest, services are available and mixed-use development is most desirable. "You're creating vibrant communities that have significant impact," says David Harper, a managing partner with the Kilmer Brownfield Equity Fund.
Remote brownfields - for example, former mines, oil-fields and industries in outlying areas - are more difficult to address, because "they don't fit the intensification goal," according to Mr. Harper.
Some of these derelict sites end up targeted for interim uses, for example becoming brightfields, where solar panels that generate electricity are arrayed across the ground, with a goal of eventually cleaning up the land and putting it to more valuable uses.

Full text: With UM Financial in receivership, Muslims with no-interest mortgages don't know what will happen
Dozens of Muslim homeowners are complaining that they have been left in limbo by a disintegrating " sharia -compliant" mortgage arrangement, putting a focus on the emergence of parallel banking systems in Canada.
Some Muslims believe that sharia, or Islamic law, bans interest-bearing bank arrangements because they are considered akin to usury, and a small industry of middlemen has sprouted up to address those concerns.
Toronto's UM Financial, an Islamic lender backed by a credit union, was put into receivership this month by an Ontario Superior Court order. This has left more than 170 Muslim homeowners with questions such as: Who controls their properties? How much money do they still owe? To whom do they pay the money? How will this accord with religious principles?
"What ... is going on? That's where we are right now," local Muslim leader Mohammad Robert Heft said at a meeting of more than 75 homeowners in a Scarborough strip mall on Saturday.
While there was consensus at the meeting that no one risked losing their homes, little else seemed clear. "It's such a mess. There are 160 of us in the same boat," said Mr. Heft, as he was elected head of a steering committee. "This has implications for the image of Islam," he added, advising that he and other UM Financial clients had to conduct themselves "honourably" to avoid more messy public fallout.
UM Financial had effectively served as a buffer between Muslim homeowners and Credit One, a credit union. The deal was that UM Financial would help its Muslim clients buy their homes and be paid in monthly payments - including service premiums - over long periods of time.
The arrangement lasted six years but unravelled as the credit union and UM Financial went to court in a dispute over money. The management of the portfolio has been passed to a receiver, Grant Thorton LLP, which says it is reviewing matters.
Some critics suggest such practices amount to mortgage by another name. Another critique is that they invite abuse of "the poorest sections of homeowners in the Muslim world, who have been told, 'If you deal with banks that deal with interest, you will go to hell,'" said Tarek Fatah, a liberal Toronto Muslim who points out what he regards as fundamentalist practices.
Other observers say Canada needs to figure out a way to better regulate sharia financing models, given the brisk demand. "It's going to grow," said Walid Hejazi of the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, which now offers courses in Islamic finance. "In the U.S., it's doing well, in the U.K. it's doing well, but in Canada it's lagging."
Prof. Hejazi said various levels of Canadian governments, as well as big banks, are studying Islamic finance models - up to $1-trillion of "excess liquidity" in the Gulf states could be translated into some foreign direct investment one day.
There are also discussions, he added, about whether Toronto should seek to become a North American hub of Islamic banking. "If you get more players you get more transparency."
UM Financial circulated a statement on Oct. 12, which said "it is true that UM Financial Inc. has ceased operations," but the overarching company, and CEO Omar Kalair, "continue with business as usual."
The statement added that "the UM Group" continues to run separately incorporated credit card, real-estate investment, and financial-advisory arms, among other business lines.
Mr. Kalair last night said he can't comment on the specific business issues, but he stressed that the Islamic financing model is still solid. "A majority of people still want to stay with it. There is a market demand for these products."
The court order on receivership "does not affect the homeowners' rights or obligations," said Michael Creber, a partner at Grant Thorton. No one should be at should be at risk of losing their homes as long as they continue making monthly payments, he explained.

FALLING COPPER, GLOBAL PAIN

Abstract: Now, in a corner of his yard, metres-high piles of insulated copper and aluminum wire sit undisturbed, and he said this week has felt "almost the same" as three years ago. "We don't recycle copper any more because the price has fallen too much. The price has been down for more than a month, so I've stopped," Mr. [Jiang] said. "I don't believe the price will go up.

Full text: Metal's downward spiral points to trouble in China, fuelling fears of a worldwide economic slowdown
The answer to where the global economy is headed may well be found in the piles of trash towering above the brick and tin shacks belonging to Beijing's army of garbage recyclers.
On the northeastern edge of Beijing, the hardscrabble neighbourhood of Dongxiaokou is some 20 kilometres from the glittering skyscrapers that provide this community's livelihood. Here, virtually every scrap left over from a modern life - used computers and phones, appliances, furniture, clothing, even paper and plastic bottles - is collected, sorted, broken down and sold for cash.
Traditionally, copper has been among the most valuable materials for collection. But this week, after a month of sinking prices, no one is in a good mood.
"The prices are very unstable," said Li Yibing, 42, a nattily dressed native of Henan province whose recycling business consists of a Web portal advertisement, a cellphone and a crew of about 10 men pedalling three-wheeled bicycle carts all over Beijing to sort through other people's castoffs.
One tonne of copper scrap now earns about 10,000 yuan ($1,580) less than it did a year ago, he said, and there are fewer places buying. "The factories which refine copper, some have stopped or have suspended working now," he said.
Another recycler a few blocks from Mr. Li, who would only give his family name, Jiang, was morose as he sat at home, his mobile phone quiet. Also from Henan, he has been in the business for seven years, weathering the 2008 financial crisis while others gave up and went home.
But now, in a corner of his yard, metres-high piles of insulated copper and aluminum wire sit undisturbed, and he said this week has felt "almost the same" as three years ago. "We don't recycle copper any more because the price has fallen too much. The price has been down for more than a month, so I've stopped," Mr. Jiang said. "I don't believe the price will go up. It's a crisis now."
The price of copper - used in everything from household goods to power grids - is considered a bellwether for measuring global demand and, more broadly, economic health. China is thought to be responsible for some 40 per cent of the world's copper demand, so any fall in the need for copper here can be interpreted as having repercussions for the rest of the world.
From an all-time high of $10,150 per tonne in February on the London Metals Exchange, copper prices dropped to a 14-month low this month and are hovering around $7,340 a tonne.
China's monthly imports of unwrought copper and semi-finished copper products rose 11.8 per cent in September, reaching a 16-month high. But, more ominously, its overall export growth slowed in September and a former vice-minister of commerce has predicted that 2012 could bring China's first annual trade deficit since 1993.
At issue in the Chinese economy is, first and foremost, slowing GDP growth, which now sits at 9.1 per cent. Chinese policy makers, dismayed by stubborn inflation, which reached a three-year high this summer, have begun a "soft landing" approach, using interest rate hikes and tightened bank lending to slow growth and stem inflation. The policy seems to be working: Inflation last month slowed slightly to 6.1 per cent. But that comes at a cost, particularly at a time when the threat of another global slowdown is hampering Chinese exports.
The Chinese car industry is seeing demand grow slowly, hampered by an end to government subsidies on purchases and new anti-pollution regulations restricting who can drive when in major cities. The country's ambitious railway-expansion program has been put on hold for a massive safety review following a major accident that killed 39 people. And new government regulations restricting home ownership have combined with tighter bank lending to slow the fast-growing real estate sector, which means less demand for copper - in wiring, in appliances and in hooking new buildings up to power grids.
"Copper prices have gone up and down this year, volatility has significantly increased, and a large number of Chinese companies are trading on the volatility of copper. For the next period, the Chinese economy has entered a downward spiral, the industrial slowdown hasn't stopped, and market confidence is clearly insufficient," said Zhou Weifu, an economist with the Institute of Industrial Economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government advisory body.
He said while there is some growth in government programs to build affordable housing and expand the rural power grid, it is largely offset by a general economic slump and downturns in both the real estate and auto industries.
A metals department executive with one of China's largest metals and mining companies, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press, also forecasts a difficult end to 2011.
"In terms of the demand for the last quarter of the year, generally speaking, I suppose the market will be difficult from the real consumption side. Monetary policy is still very tight there and we can't expect such policies will be loosened," he said. "It's very, very difficult to get lending from the banks, and small- and medium-sized fabricators are having to suspend part or all of their production.
"I don't believe there will be any difficulties for copper supply in the local market. My only concern is for real demand," the executive continued. "Consumption has been slowing down and I suppose these kinds of situations will last for a longer time."
That is not to say demand will shrink. Even during the 2008 financial crisis, by a Morgan Stanley calculation, Chinese demand for copper still grew 4.9 per cent.
According to Antaike, the research and reporting agency owned by China's nonferrous metals industry association, China's demand for refined copper was about 6.8 million tonnes last year. Almost half of that, Antaike copper analyst Li Yusheng said, went into the country's power grid, seen as a relatively stable source of copper consumption.
"I think the growth rate [for demand] will slow down but still continue, maybe at 6 per cent year on year," he said, forecasting a price drop to $6,000 per tonne next year. "There are still worries about the Euro zone crisis and there are worries about the Chinese economy because of inflation ... I think [the outlook is] still positive, but not as strong as in previous years."
Back in Dongxiaokou, such predictions are cold comfort to many.
"It's true, a lot of people have gone out of business," said Yang Junlin, who buys and sells scrap as a sideline to his job finishing the interiors of new apartments. "It will take a long time for the price to go back up, and it probably won't be as high."
But Mr. Li, the recycling boss, his black shoes impeccably shined despite the dusty, shabby surroundings, has retained a little more confidence than some of his counterparts.
"I don't think the price of copper will go down as much as it did in 2008. It won't take long for it to go back up," he said. "I think Chinese demand is still good. I do this kind of business, and I know."

Full text: It has been easy to underestimate Big Jim Irving Jr. Born with a silver spoon, people say. Hopelessly immersed in operations, and lacking in vision. A hulking guy with the back-slapping style of a lumber salesman.
That dismissive assessment was proven wrong this week.
The award of a $25-billion combat-ship contract to his family's Halifax Shipyard is a personal triumph for Mr. Irving, oldest of the fourth-generation heirs to Canada's third-largest business fortune, which was forged by his legendary grandfather K.C. Irving, and by his father and uncles.
Many others played key roles in landing the federal contract, and the Irvings had 70 people working full time on the bid against rivals in B.C. and Quebec. But it was Mr. Irving who assembled the team, kept it energized and exhibited his trademark doggedness to pull it off.
It was, you might say, visionary.
Mr. Irving, 60, has heard the whispers about his head-down management style, and doesn't pay any mind. "All I know is we've got to make things run and make things grow," he says.
Mr. Irving carries many of the traits of his grandfather K.C., says Scott McCain, whose own father and uncle created frozen food giant McCain Foods Ltd., another powerhouse built, like the Irving companies, in New Brunswick.
"He's got the Irving tenacity," Mr. McCain says. "He has his grandfather's single-mindedness of purpose."
Vision is an admirable trait, Mr. McCain says, but it needs to be complemented by an ability to execute. "Jim wants to put the puck in the net," he says.
The new deal entails the building of warships over a 30-year period that could see a doubling of the 1,000-strong work force at the Irvings' shipyard, and could spin off an average of 8,500 Nova Scotia jobs yearly. It will spur investments in local skills that, Mr. Irving says, will create "the next generation of shipbuilders."
It also means a lot to his 83-year-old father J.K. (James) Irving, who, he says, is the genuine ship builder in the family, dating back to the late 1950s and through the big federal frigate project of the 1980s-1990s. "He gets a great kick out of the business."
Their family company, J.D. Irving Ltd., is at heart a forestry operation, founded in Bouctouche, N.B., in the 1880s by James Dergavel (J.D.) Irving. He built a sawmill business, which his son K.C. expanded and diversified, into an energy, wood products, retail, transport and shipbuilding empire based in Saint John. Canadian Business magazine recently estimated its value at $7-8-billion.
Today, K.C.'s son J.K. and grandsons Jim Jr. (also known as J.D.) and Robert run the core forestry business, which owns more than 830,000 hectares of land in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and is one of the biggest landowners in the state of Maine with another 500,000 hectares.
But it has suffered from forestry's brutal cyclicality, just slightly eased by moving into value-added products like packaging, diapers and tissue. The assurance of a 30-year-stream of stable revenues is a boon to a business that fluctuates so wildly.
It also brings bragging rights inside the Irving family. The forestry side of the now divided Irving empire has leapfrogged in prominence ahead of the energy wing, led by Jim Jr.'s uncle Arthur, now 80. In the pecking order of the Irvings - where the oldest male holds sway - Jim Jr. reasserts his status as the central player of the fourth generation.
Mr. Irving says the roots of a successful company lie not just in the big wins, but in sustaining the business when times are bad. Even in the slow years for federal procurement, he says, the Irvings kept the shipyard working, often with their own building projects.
"You need motivated folks and you need a commitment - and commitment is not always there when times get tough," he says. "These are long-term businesses and they are not always easy. There are cyclical parts and you have to get through them to be successful in the long term."
Still, the contract is bound to stoke resentment in hometown Saint John, where the Irvings had their shipbuilding start in the late 1950s and where they closed the venerable shipyard in 2003 after a long decline. Mr. Irving says New Brunswickers in general will benefit from supply contracts to the Halifax project.
And he is not turning his back on Saint John. He is building a huge new house in the affluent suburb of Rothesay, that will far eclipse the elegant 6,100-square-foot mansion that has been the family home. The smaller house is on the market for $1.65-million. Its hectare of property backs on to the grounds of the new structure that to casual onlookers is hidden from view.
Rothesay real estate was far from his mind Wednesday, as Mr. Irving hosted a huge celebration in a tent on the Halifax Shipyard site. He was in his classically ebullient mood - jumping onto a dais and shouting for "all the guys in hard hats" to come closer for the announcement.
When the news was made official, sparking a roar in the tent, he threw his arms in the air like a victorious prizefighter, a comeback kid who should never be counted out.

Full text: MEDIA REPORTER
Postmedia Network Inc. has sold the bulk of its newspaper operations in British Columbia - including one of Canada's oldest newspapers, the Victoria Times Colonist - to Vancouver-based Glacier Media Inc., as part of a broader strategy to pay down its debts.
The company announced the $86.5-million deal after the markets closed on Tuesday. It includes the 153-year-old Victoria paper and two other daily newspapers, as well as 20 community publications in B.C.
"We got a terrific price to pay down a considerable amount of our debt," chief executive officer Paul Godfrey said in an interview, adding that the Victoria paper's union rules were also a motivator for the sale. The collective bargaining agreement there prevents outsourcing services such as pagination, which the company does at a central facility in Hamilton, and ad production which it outsources to the Philippines.
The deal came together when Glacier Media made "an unsolicited offer" for the papers, according to Mr. Godfrey. Digital properties associated with the papers and some real-estate listings are also included in the purchase. Glacier Media, which publishes community newspapers in 65 markets in Western Canada, is now significantly increasing its presence in B.C. It also owns a number of trade publications.
"It gives us the broadest coverage in local markets in Western Canada, so we can go to our advertisers and offer them a broader reach," Glacier chief executive officer John Kennedy said. Glacier will now focus on paying down debt, developing its properties and looking into further acquisitions. He added that the company will continue to focus on building its business information segment.
In May, Glacier bought 15 food- and agriculture-focused publications and websites from Rogers Publishing Ltd., to expand its trade publishing business. Glacier has been showing relatively steady signs of rebounding since the economic downturn; in August, it announced its second-quarter revenue was up 7.1 per cent, to $68.1-million.
The sales deal includes the Nanaimo Daily News and Alberni Valley Times daily papers, plus a stable of community newspapers such as the Vancouver Courier, the Abbotsford Mission Times, and the Harbour City Star. The sale now leaves Postmedia with two major dailies in B.C., The Vancouver Sun and The Province, as well as five community newspapers in its Windsor-Essex group.
Postmedia has been aggressively working to pay down its debt load, but like other print publications has had to cope with a weak economic recovery. Although digital revenues have been rising, in July the company reported a second-quarter loss of $3.9-million, with revenues falling 4.1 per cent.
The deal is expected to close by the end of November.

'Old Jets against the new Jets'

Author: Waldie, Paul

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/old-jets-against-new/docview/898395561/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Technically Saturday's game is an away game for the Jets and the home opener for the Coyotes. But with plane loads of Winnipeggers arriving all week and many owning second homes in the Phoenix area, the Jets could have the upper hand as far as crowd support. "When we saw this game on the schedule we said 'We've got to be there'," said Paul Kuzina, who arrived from Winnipeg with seven friends and family members.

Full text: Planeloads of Winnipeg fans make trip to Phoenix to cheer on reborn team
When Diane Olson was moving to Phoenix from Winnipeg in the spring of 1996 to launch a real estate business, the Winnipeg Jets were right with her.
"One of the flight attendants told me that some of the players' wives and kids were on the plane," Olson recalled. A huge Jets fan, Olson had shared the city's disappointment at the club's departure and she was part of group that tried to save the team. "It was one of the saddest things to happen to Winnipeg," she said.
But now the Jets are back in Winnipeg and in Phoenix too, at least for one game Saturday. Olson can barely contain her excitement. She's rented a box at the Jobing.com arena with a group of friends, all Canadians, and proudly wore her old Winnipeg Jets jersey around Phoenix this week despite the 38C temperature, winning applause from a couple of hockey fans from Edmonton. "It's incredible," she said. "It's the old Jets against the new Jets."
Technically Saturday's game is an away game for the Jets and the home opener for the Coyotes. But with plane loads of Winnipeggers arriving all week and many owning second homes in the Phoenix area, the Jets could have the upper hand as far as crowd support. "When we saw this game on the schedule we said 'We've got to be there'," said Paul Kuzina, who arrived from Winnipeg with seven friends and family members. The group has also rented a box for the game and brought a 12-foot long banner saying "Go Jets Go."
For many Jets fans there's an added bonus in coming to the game. It's a chance to gloat and say "I told you so" to the NHL for thinking hockey would work better in the barren desert than the frozen prairie. "Oh yeah, it's a real 'in your face' moment," said Harold Nachtigall, a Winnipeg chiropractor who flew in for the game.
It's easy to see why. The fortunes of the Jets, Coyotes, Winnipeg and Phoenix, couldn't have turned out more differently.
When the Jets left for Phoenix, the U.S. Southwest was booming and the consensus was that professional sports teams couldn't survive in places such as Winnipeg, with their struggling economies, outdated arenas and poorly financed ownership.
And now? Winnipeg's economy is among the strongest in Canada, the city has a new downtown arena and the Jets' owners are flush with cash. Meanwhile Phoenix got crushed by the recent recession and is recovering so slowly one local economist described it as a "painful grind." Unemployment is roughly 9 per cent, the housing market is among the worst in the United States and the dream of building a massive sports and entertainment complex in the suburb of Glendale has bitten the dust.
Last month lenders owed nearly $100-million took back control of the Westgate City Center, a sprawling retail, restaurant and theatre complex adjacent to the Jobing.com arena. Westgate's developers, who also briefly owned the Coyotes, vowed the complex would transform Glendale into a sports mecca and the city jumped on board, spending $180-million building the arena. The project never lived up to the hype and buckled under debt. A foreclosure auction last month couldn't even attract the minimum $40-million bid, leaving lenders to take possession. Lenders owed another $200-million plan a future auction for 95 acres of mostly vacant land around the site, once earmarked for Westgate's expansion.
The Coyotes' future doesn't look much better. The club is under NHL ownership for the second season and the city is covering most of the operating losses while it searches for a buyer. One bidder, Matthew Hulsizer, walked away last summer and the city says two new bidders have emerged. One is Chicago businessman Jerry Reinsdorf, who has tried and failed to buy the club.
There's also a string of lawsuits still in court stemming from the botched move by former owner Jerry Moyes to put the club into bankruptcy protection in 2009. He hoped to sell it to Jim Balsillie, co-head of Research in Motion Ltd., who wanted to move the club to Hamilton. The NHL stepped in and bought the Coyotes for $140-million. Now the league is suing Moyes for $50-million alleging he abused the bankruptcy process. Moyes denies the allegations. As for Balsillie, he's facing pressure from RIM shareholders who claim his ill-fated quest for a hockey team distracted him from RIM, which is struggling.
The team "remains a work in progress," NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said last week. Bettman wants a new owner in place next season and he's believed to be seeking $170-million for the club. That seems high given that the Buffalo Sabres, playing in a better hockey market, sold recently for $175-million and bids for the St. Louis Blues have been just over $100-million. The Jets' owners, True North Sports & Entertainment, paid an estimated $170-million for the Atlanta Thrashers, which included a $60-million relocation fee. The NHL might consider moving the Coyotes, but only if no local buyer is found. And Bettman has made it clear moving franchises is not a league priority.
On the ice, the Coyotes look competitive. But their fan support is tentative. Phoenix ranked near the bottom in league attendance last season and while a big crowd is expected Saturday, tickets can be had for less than $20.
"We're cautiously optimistic that we'll get the support we need," said general manager Don Maloney, referring to the team's future. When asked about what could be an overwhelmingly Winnipeg crowd Saturday, Maloney laughed and replied: "As long as they come down and buy tickets, they can come back any time."

Harrisburg's bankruptcy underscores U.S. financial woes

Abstract: "Harrisburg is just a microcosm of what's going on throughout the United States," said Richard Harper, who owns a local financial-services company. "You can't continue to burn more money than you're bringing in."

Full text: For a year, the mayor of Pennsylvania's picturesque capital defied state and local pressure to slash jobs and assets. But the mountain of municipal debt proved too large to conquer. Renata D'Aliesio and Jacquie McNish report.
Under a forbidding grey sky, Anthony Palumbo wraps himself in a burgundy apron to begin the morning kitchen ritual his father started 35 years ago after he emigrated from Naples, Italy, to open a pizzeria in Pennsylvania's capital, Harrisburg.
Palumbo's Italian Eatery has thrived despite some of the worst possible local disasters, including the fallout from the 1979 nuclear meltdown at the nearby Three Mile Island reactor and the decline of the local steel industry. One block south of the eatery, the city's council delivered another blow on Tuesday when it voted to file for bankruptcy protection from its creditors, marking what is believed to be the first declaration of insolvency by a U.S. state capital.
Mr. Palumbo knows that times are tough in the picturesque town of 47,000 overlooking the Susquehanna River. There are fewer cars parked in the local municipal lot, crime is on the rise and customers are scarcer. Despite these setbacks, he believes the city and his family business, which now includes six restaurants, will survive the turmoil.
"Overall, I think it's going to be okay," he says with a shrug. "This is the state capital. When you get down to it, it's a really nice city."
To some experts, Mr. Palumbo's optimism personifies the kind of resilience that will help U.S. cities weather the worst financial strains they have faced since the Depression. To others, it represents the kind of denial that has blinded citizens, politicians and investors to towering municipal debt levels that are eroding the quality of urban life Americans have taken for granted for decades.
Harrisburg is one of only a small handful of U.S. cities that filed for bankruptcy protection in recent years. Robin Prunty, managing director of Standard & Poor's public finance unit, said she does not expect to see a significant increase in bankruptcy filings, but she expects more cities and towns will come under pressure to further cut costs because of falling revenues.
"We do see continued budget stress in the near term," she said.
There are an estimated 90,000 municipalities in the United States, and in the past decade their total debts have increased by a third to an estimated $3-trillion (U.S.). Historically, municipalities have sold bonds to pay for local improvements such as new hospitals, schools, roads and other infrastructure projects. The financial crisis has driven many stretched municipalities to borrow for another reason: to cover their costs.
Most cities depend on property taxes to pay the majority of their bills, but these revenues have shrunk in the wake of the nation's housing crisis and falling real-estate values. Many municipalities are restricted by local laws from raising taxes, presenting political leaders with the choice of cutting services or borrowing more to pay the bills.
Harrisburg is a poster child for cities that would rather borrow than cut costs. Debt on an electricity-generating incinerator have soared from $12.5-million to $310-million after three decades of overhauls and upgrades, burdening the city with annual interest costs that now exceed its budget.
Since she was voted into office in 2009, Harrisburg Mayor Linda Thompson has defied mounting pressure from bondholders and the state government to pay the city's debts by slashing jobs and assets.
"To disrupt [services] because we can't make a bond payment would just be unconscionable. As a leader, I couldn't do it," she said in an interview late last year.
After a year of jousting with bondholders and a state government that is threatening to take control of Harrisburg, Ms. Thompson was outgunned by the city's council on Tuesday when a narrow majority voted to start bankruptcy proceedings. The move will give bondholders more leverage to wrestle owed debt payments.
For business patrons at a local cigar shop called the Tinder Box, the air is starting to clear in Harrisburg after years of political infighting over the city's debts.
"Harrisburg is just a microcosm of what's going on throughout the United States," said Richard Harper, who owns a local financial-services company. "You can't continue to burn more money than you're bringing in."
Now that the process has started with the bankruptcy proceedings, Mr. Harper said he has become very concerned about the quality of life in a city where nearly 30 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line, and city outskirts are flanked by abandoned homes. He recently purchased a gun permit, and he is fine-tuning plans to move his business outside Harrisburg.
Over at Royal Cleaners, Hanna Shin has no plans to leave. An immigrant from South Korea, she opened her dry-cleaning store 19 years ago. Flanked by pictures of her customers' children and the state's governor, Tom Corbett, Ms. Shin, 63, says her business has survived the harsh times because of her loyal clientele. She hopes to keep the store open until she retires in two years.
"I want the city of Harrisburg to be alive, not dead," Ms. Shin said. "No matter what is happening, this is the capital of Pennsylvania."

LISTING AGENT
JoAnne Gludish, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
The Action: About eight shoppers came to visit this 1.5-storey house on a maturely treed lot backing onto a stream connected to the Credit River and Lake Ontario. A local resident - who initially spotted the house while cycling - became the new owner for the price of $770,000.
What They Got: What was likely constructed as a cottage has evolved into a single-family residence with one bathroom in the master bedroom on the top floor, and a second bathroom and bedroom on the lower level, which also houses a recreation room and gym.
* The eat-in kitchen was recently remodeled with stainless steel appliances and granite-topped island, while a fireside family room was constructed with 17-foot, vaulted ceilings and a walkout to a side deck with stairs to a new deck off the master suite above the garage.
* Other notable finishes include a second fireplace in the dining room, a built-in desk in the office and hardwood flooring and pot lights virtually throughout.
* Outside, the grounds are landscaped with gardens, stone walkways and a backyard
patio.
* Amenities within a five-minute drive of the property include sports facilities, a library and shops, as well as a GO Train station, waterfront parks, trails and marinas.
The Agent's Take: "It was a pretty house on a private lane in Mineola, which is a very desirable part of Mississauga," agent JoAnne Gludish said. "The lot was only 94-feet deep and 50-feet across, but it's on a private lane and a river that runs by the property."
Changes made by the seller also made this place unlike others nearby. "Either they're very old and original or brand new," Ms. Gludish sad. "This one was an older home that had been substantially updated and renovated, but maintained all of the charm."

Staking their future on the land

Abstract: "I was not afraid of anything," he recalled. He had a faint childhood memory of a well on the southwest corner of a particular stretch of land, which he requested. He was awarded 7.28 acres and named his farm "San Juan." He borrowed his neighbour's tractor and irrigation system and, against all odds, managed to coax 68 tonnes of sweet potatoes and tomatoes from the earth that year, which he sold back to the state at a profit.

Full text: Since 2008 when the state started handing out free, 10-year leases to anyone willing to take up farming, 170,000 peasants have put their backs into it, enriching themselves and vastly improving the country's ability to feed itself. But it's still not enough. And getting young Cubans to take to farming isn't proving to be easy, either. Sonia Verma reports from Havana
For years the land lay fallow, swallowed by thorny weeds. Strangers called it a lost cause. Armando Aroche saw a golden opportunity.
It was 2008 and Raul Castro, in his first major speech as Cuban President, made a shocking admission: 50 years of state-controlled agriculture had failed, resulting in chronic food shortages. The island was importing 80 per cent of the food it subsequently rationed for public consumption.
Mr. Castro offered free, 10-year leases on idle land to anyone willing to try their hand at farming.
Mr. Aroche, a rotund, 53-year-old peasant, was among the first to queue in San Antonio, a small municipality a half-hour drive from Havana.
"I was not afraid of anything," he recalled. He had a faint childhood memory of a well on the southwest corner of a particular stretch of land, which he requested. He was awarded 7.28 acres and named his farm "San Juan." He borrowed his neighbour's tractor and irrigation system and, against all odds, managed to coax 68 tonnes of sweet potatoes and tomatoes from the earth that year, which he sold back to the state at a profit.
Today, he gazes out on his fields from beneath his sunhat. Too much rain means his tomato plants are flowering. His 1952 Ferguson tractor is on its last legs. A team of oxen plow the land as if in slow motion.
But despite these hardships, farmers such as Mr. Aroche are being held out as shining examples of the new face of Cuban socialism. The cabbage, onions, carrots and lettuce he cultivates are described by government officials as the fruits of their "new and improved system" that has boosted food production by awarding more land to peasants who farm it for a profit.
Since Decree No. 259 was passed in 2008, 170,000 peasants across Cuba have been granted land. In San Antonio alone, 410 people have applied for land with 283 of those applications granted.
"Pretty soon we will run out of lands to grant," confessed Georgina Gutierrez Jimenez, president of the local chapter of the National Association for Small Farmers.
Each farmer can apply for a land grant of 13.48 acres. If the farm proves successful, they can apply for another. Farmers can also use their profits to buy their own equipment, insecticides and fertilizer - something the state used to strictly control. Each farm owner pays a 5-per-cent income tax to the state, and 3 per cent to the local agricultural co-operative.
Mr. Aroche, a trained mechanic, used to work at the "state enterprise of assorted crops," and earned the equivalent of $9 a month. He demurred when asked about his income today, but acknowledged it is exponentially higher. For the past few years, his family has been able to afford long holidays on the beach.
He employs six workers, who are each paid a monthly wage of $12, plus a yearly bonus. They help themselves to food grown on the farm and often receive a small cash "tip" at the end of each day.
The new agricultural policy has succeeded in boosting food production, officials say.
"There has been an enormous impact," said Arturo Aleaga Cespedes, a lawyer with the National Farmer's Association. He cites a 60-per-cent increase in the production of rice, milk, vegetables and root vegetables.
However, it's still not enough to satisfy Cuba's food needs.
"We produce a lot, but the demand and consumption are always increasing," Ms. Jimenez said.
Another challenge is persuading a younger generation of Cubans to take up their leaders' challenge and return to the land. Many, like Mr. Aroche's own children, were educated for urban jobs in state offices that are under enormous pressure to trim their bloated payrolls.
The country's public service is set to lose up to half a million jobs over the next five years.
Mr. Aroche's 26-year-old daughter, Joseline, quit her job as an economist when her son was born three years ago. Now, as she contemplates returning to the work force, she faces "not a lot of options," she said.
Her father believes the future of his family, and that of his country, lies in the land: "To work in the field is very hard. It's something most people don't like, but it's work that needs to be done," he said.
The agricultural reforms - considered radical at the time - have proved to merely foreshadow larger changes sweeping through Cuba as the government relaxes its communist grip on everything from private enterprise to real estate in an attempt to generate revenue.
"The only problem is that all of this should have been done sooner," Mr. Aroche added.

Full text:   At 94, Fred Hollingsworth recalls the North Vancouver home he designed in 1950 in his signature Neoteric style
Winnifred Miller still remembers the day in 1950 that she fell hard for the house known as the Moon Residence, already drawing attention as a landmark of West Coast modernism. It listed at $14,000 - a price that was then so onerous that her husband Arthur Miller told his wife that the house was already sold. Ms. Miller was undeterred: "I said to him: 'Well, if it's sold, then we'll just have to buy it back,' "she recalls. "I wanted it!" They bought the house.
Now, six decades later, their 2,000-square-foot house is on the market for $1.38-million. Nestled in a densely shrubbed lot in Edgemont Village area of North Vancouver, the residence takes its sobriquet from first owner Jack Moon, who commissioned the house in 1950, but in an unlucky twist of fate, was transferred to a Calgary office and was forced to sell it just a few months after moving in.
The house's architect is the renowned Fred Hollingsworth, who still lives around the corner on Ridgewood Drive in his own self-designed architectural marvel. At 94, Mr. Hollingsworth is largely a homebody these days but his mind and spirit remain sharp. He smiles at the memory of this house and its kindred North Shore houses, built in the years after he settled in the neighbourhood in 1946. "This was the middle of nowhere back then; there was just a gravel road," he recalls, gesturing towards the street. "I built a bunch of those houses. It was a hexagon with the bottom squared off, so that there could be an advantage to having a 45-degree angle," he says. "That was kind of fun."
This kind of post-and-beam design with angular modules became known as Mr. Hollingsworth's Neoteric houses. As in the Moon/Miller Residence, the nucleus of his typical house plan is a giant brick hearth from which a series of angled wood modules radiate, illuminated by clerestory windows. The house is sited at a 45-degree angle on the lot, so that one corner juts sharply toward the street. The main form is composed of two wings of cedar board-and-batten modules that inflect the rooms and corridors with dynamic sightlines.
The angular modules propel you from room to room as you wander through the five-bedroom house. Their oblique lines generate a series of unusual niches for storage, hallways that read as meandering paths, and marvellously unexpected light patterns. And furniture, too: the dining room features a dogleg-shaped built-in wooden table whose form evokes the larger plan of the house itself.
The two main wings meet at an acute angle that generates an intimate outdoor patio space. Even 60 years after designing it, Mr. Hollingsworth remembers why he angled the house with its V-shaped corner jutting towards Edgemont Boulevard. "It was too close to the street, so I wouldn't otherwise get enough light to the south," he says.
The modified-hex layout is a takeaway from Mr. Hollingsworth's most important mentor, American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1951, Mr. Hollingsworth spent time at Mr. Wright's famous Taliesen studio. You can see further Wrightian influences in the foyer's wooden torchières, which Mr. Hollingsworth himself crafted by hand. He also absorbed Mr. Wright's obsession with Japanese spatial arrangements, designing the Moon/Miller Residence with a network of clerestory windows and beams that criss-cross at various heights, creating poetic expanses of space at ceiling level. Composed in this way, the lighting is largely subdued and indirect, like a Caravaggio canvas. This is not a house for sun worshippers.
Compared to peers such as Arthur Erickson and Ned Pratt, Mr. Hollingsworth practised a more idiosyncratic brand of modernism, melding craft elements with the more austere postwar European modernism. So the Moon/Miller Residence boasts nonessential but lovely gestures like the jogged brickwork running up the huge fireplace wall.
Yet true to the modernist ideal, nothing is "tacked on": the decorative elements are integral parts of the architecture. The cantilevered wooden fins that serve as window mullions also double as miniature shelves to showcase the family's treasures - rocks, minerals, shells and whatever else they would find on their outdoor expeditions.
Realtor Simon Coutts points out that it was one of the earliest houses to sport a concrete floor - a gesture would still be avant-garde several decades later. This one has an epoxy enamel finish that imbues it with a warm and refined quality.
But the Moon/Miller Residence is, above all, a West Coast house, crafted with local materials and sited to maximize the views of the lush green foliage outside. The material palette is almost entirely brick and wood, with the interior walls and cabinetry built with high-quality "matched-grain" plywood. The living room features a built-in upholstered banquette that scissors apart to follow the oblique angle of the wall. "This is my favourite spot: I like to sit here on the built-in bench and look up at the trees," says Ms. Miller.
The banquette is built into a wall that stands out as the defining feature of the house: a sheet of textured glass sandwiched between two brick walls with dozens of gaps that create small windows. These apertures offer no view to speak of, but give the living-room area an ethereal light, tinged green from the foliage outside. It's a favourite Hollingsworth gesture. But subdued lighting is not the only design intention behind the window-filled brick wall. Back at his Ridgewood Drive home, Mr. Hollingsworth smiles and leans forward to explain in what sounds like a conspiratorial whisper: "It's a nice thing when someone's coming up the drive and you can see them, but they can't see you." Then he chuckles heartedly.

The bad news from everywhere

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/bad-news-everywhere/docview/896667185/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: [Michael Lewis]'s tour through Europe's most vibrant economy, Germany, is his least insightful. Captivated by the country's public obsession with cleanliness and private fascination with dirt and excrement (don't tell [Anthony Bourdain]), Lewis becomes preoccupied with unravelling this contradiction as a way of explaining why the healthy country continues to support so many of its broken Euro partners.

Full text:   Michael Lewis's very entertaining, if depressing, travelogue through the globe's economic ruins
Boomerang
Travels in the New Third World
By Michael Lewis
Norton, 212 pages, $30
Ever since Michael Lewis chucked the life of a Wall Street bond salesman to write the semi-autobiographical Liar's Poker in 1989, he has burnished his reputation as the planet's most entertaining business writer by regaling us with the absurd human stories that lie beneath corporate upheaval.
He defined an era of excess on Wall Street with his depiction of two Salomon Brothers bond titans bluffing each other in an audacious million-dollar bet on the serial numbers of a dollar bill. In The New, New Thing , he captured the fatal exuberance of the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s by joining a Silicon Valley pioneer on his massive computerized sailboat, which shortly after leaving its Amsterdam berth, lost its mast to North Sea winds.
In Boomerang , a travelogue through the globe's economic ruins, Lewis takes us into the lives of the hapless and misguided government officials, bankers and speculators who stoked the 2008 financial fires we wishfully and wrongly believed had been doused by massive government bailouts. Turns out, taxpayer dollars only stalled the carnage. Like a boomerang, the crisis is now is swinging back with a vengeance and this slight, poignantly humorous 212-page book tells even the most informed student of global economics why it was inevitable.
Lewis's guided tour of financial hot spots is a little bit like hiking through the world's remote gastronomic regions with Anthony Bourdain. Just as the New York chef travels to distant outposts to devour such delicacies as raw seal eyeballs with local Inuit or sheep testicles with Moroccans, Lewis gets up close and personal with the economic meltdown. Like Bourdain, he applies a biting wit that infuses a rare pleasure into the unpleasant business of digesting grim economic tales.
In Iceland, he finds a nation of swaggering fishermen who channelled their love of risky deep-sea catching tactics into financial speculation. To understand the madness that allowed such a small country to amass debts that equalled 850 per cent of its GDP, Lewis introduces us to Stefan Alfsson, a one-time trawler captain who, at the age of 30, quit fishing to become a currency trader. Fired after Iceland's 2008 banking meltdown, Alfsson shrugs off the setback: "If you don't take risks you don't catch the fish."
Moving to Greece, Lewis finds a banking system that had the good sense to avoid toxic subprime loans, but the bad luck to make dangerously large loans to a government that never had a hope, or probably any intention, of repaying its staggering debts. By the time the crisis hit, the average government employee was earning three times more than his or her private-sector counterpart, and payrolls on state enterprises such as the national railroad amounted to more than four times annual sales.
To illustrate the extent of the moral collapse in Greece, Lewis travels to an ancient monastery perched on the Aegean Sea, where he spends time with wildly bearded and religiously disciplined monks whose real-estate manoeuvres with valuable state land helped bring down the government.
Lewis's tour through Europe's most vibrant economy, Germany, is his least insightful. Captivated by the country's public obsession with cleanliness and private fascination with dirt and excrement (don't tell Bourdain), Lewis becomes preoccupied with unravelling this contradiction as a way of explaining why the healthy country continues to support so many of its broken Euro partners. It is a slim premise that fails to explain why the country is straining so hard to keep the fractured European Union together.
There are many colourful characters in Lewis's road trip through the financial crisis, but don't look for heroes. The closest thing that he finds to a triumph is a Dallas-based hedge-fund owner who made a fortune betting that spiralling government debts would topple the world's overheated economies. When Lewis visited Kyle Bass in 2008, to find out why the Texan rightly predicted the economic crisis would return, he found an eccentric and paranoid investor who warehoused gold bars and nickels and for fun raced around his ranch in an army jeep shooting beavers with sniper rifles.
In an era of dysfunctional capitalism, Lewis reminds us that winners can be just as unhinged as losers.

An Annex to the Beaches

Abstract: One of the pioneers who re-located from Queen Street East several years ago, florist Reed Russell at East of Eliza draws regulars who enjoy her creatively unfussy hand-tied bouquets. There's a "secret garden" in the back with nursery plants. For globetrotters, Black's Adventure Outfitters is the place to go to get your rucksack stitched up.

Full text:   For years, the Upper Beaches seemed to live in the shadow of the Beaches, which earned its moniker through proximity to Lake Ontario. But even the name "Upper" Beaches suggests a lack of distinct character, a reliance on the rising real estate values of the neighbourhood to the south.
But over time the area around Woodbine Avenue and Gerrard Street East has forged its own identity, which, its residents contend, has more soul and less ostentation than the Beaches proper.
Long-time residents grow tomatoes beside their front walkways and chat with neighbours on wooden porches.
Along this eastern stretch of Gerrard, dive bars still attract a gritty crowd at night but during the day babies glide across the pavement in Norwegian import strollers.
Perhaps the best example of that dichotomy is just east of Woodbine, where the Peek-a-Bears Child Care centre stands almost side-by-side with the Vagabonds bikers' clubhouse.
What it has going for it
Location: While the neighbourhood's character is getting stronger, residents also point to the strategic positioning at the centre of more buzzy areas, such as Little India, the Danforth and the afore-mentioned area on the edge of Lake Ontario. "You have the best of Little India and the heart of the Beaches without the traffic and parking hassles," says a long-time homeowner.
Transportation: It's a short walk south to the Queen Street streetcar or north to the Danforth subway line. There's a GO train to Union Station. By car, Yonge and Dundas is 15 minutes away.
Tranquil streets: The streets have pleasant rows of trees and a nicely-varied housing stock. The detached Edwardians are the match of many in High Park and the smaller semis are attractive to young families. St. John's Norway Cemetery standing at the bottom of the streets west of Woodbine lends serenity to that corner.
Parks: The neighbourhood has an abundance of children's playgrounds and little parkettes. The best thing about the little nook east of Woodbine and south of Gerrard is Cassels Park, also known as the dog park.
Small-box retail: One of the pioneers who re-located from Queen Street East several years ago, florist Reed Russell at East of Eliza draws regulars who enjoy her creatively unfussy hand-tied bouquets. There's a "secret garden" in the back with nursery plants. For globetrotters, Black's Adventure Outfitters is the place to go to get your rucksack stitched up.
Brunch: Upper Beach Café is a busy spot on the weekends. The wholesome breakfast club sandwich is a local favourite.
Room for improvement
Restaurants: It could use a few more, says the Gen-Y crowd. They often head out of the 'hood for more choice.
Raccoons: Lots of areas have them but they are in abundance here.
Shopping: Commerce along Gerrard Street East is still a work in progress. Some locals appreciate the lack of big box but they do have to trek to the Danforth to buy toilet paper in bulk.
Harbingers of change
At one time many of the businesses on Gerrard had papers over the windows or trash piling up inside. Now those commercial spaces are being refurbished. Residents are watching with interest to see who will take over a spiffed-up building listed for sale with an asking price of $629,000. The former corner store has a restored store front just waiting for a trailblazing merchant.
Baristas begin pulling shots at 7 a.m. at The Bandit espresso bar, which recently opened in its refurbished space with free Wi-Fi.
A new day spa offers manis and pedis and other pampering on the north side of Gerrard Street East. Newly-built houses are replacing little old shacks on the side streets and a couple of condo towers have risen up.
Market valuesTypical houses are three-bedroom semis, which fetch up to $500,000 in many cases.
An updated detached house will range from $500,000 to $700,000 on desirable streets such as Bowmore Road, Normandy Boulevard and Kingsmount Park Road.

Full text:   A planned six-storey mid-rise in the Beaches brings density without busting up already-settled urban terrain
jmays@globeandmail.com
Toronto's residential skyline has long seemed unbalanced to me. Our dwellings tend to be either soaringly tall or, at just one or two storeys, very short. What's largely missing in our housing mix is the five-storey to 10-storey apartment block. This attractive building type has proven to be a successful design tool in many European cities. I like it because it brings desirable density to our important avenues, while not busting apart old, settled urban terrains.
For an example of a mid-rise project that might work out well in its context, take the condominium building now being proposed for the corner of Queen Street East and Kenilworth Avenue. The intersection punctuates the delightful commercial strip that runs through the heart of the Beaches neighbourhood.
You may know the site of the condo stack: A Lick's hamburger palace has stood on the spot for many years. If the developer (Reserve Investments) manages to win over city staff and politicians to its side, the architecturally indifferent home of this popular rest-stop for Queen Street East strollers will vanish and be replaced by a six-storey luxury apartment building designed by Toronto architect Roland Rom Colthoff, co-founder and principal of raw design.
Pitched to older, affluent Beaches residents ready to downsize but reluctant to leave the famously comfortable, walkable district, the 29,000-square-foot structure is slated to contain just 29 apartments. These will range in size from 600 square feet to around 1,200 square feet, with one top-floor suite coming in at 2,000 square feet. Intended to retail for around $700 a foot, these apartments will not be cheap.
The block would be built out to the limit of its rectangular site. Even the usual ramp to the below-grade parking would be eliminated: In Mr. Rom Colthoff's scheme, the cars of tenants go up and down between street and garage by means of an industrial-strength lift - an application of elevator technology you still don't see very often in residential architecture, but that's surely destined to become more common in mid-to-tall tower construction as city land-values continue to rise.
If put up as designed, the building will be taller and wider than its commercial neighbours on Queen East. Complaints about its height, the architect told me, have already been lodged with the city by local residents.
Though I'm not inclined to be sympathetic to it, I understand where their concern is coming from. The urban geography along this stretch of Queen East is characterized by low, small structures, with the ample windows of shops, restaurants, bookstores and such opening toward the street. You can find much the same visual effect - businesslike, various, and also inviting and human-scaled - on any main street in small-town Ontario, and indeed in many Victorian and Edwardian neighbourhoods throughout downtown Toronto. As desirable (and inevitable) as increased density on our through-streets may be, the fact that someone would object to a mid-rise building at Queen East and Kenilworth is not surprising.
And, for his part, Mr. Rom Colthoff has surely taken steps to guarantee that his design exerts as little negative impact on the area as possible. Hewing closely to the city's official guidelines for mid-rise blocks, and honouring the old-fashioned shop-front sense of this stretch of Queen East, he has established a row of tall-ceilinged retail outlets at street level. His building abuts the sidewalk with a façade four storeys tall, a height related to the width of Queen East at that point, above which the levels step back smartly, creating terraces for the suites on the fifth and sixth storeys.
Generally speaking, I dislike podiums and setbacks of this sort, especially in buildings as small as the one I'm talking about here. I know the city wants architects to make such moves, apparently out of a desire to make streetside structures seem shorter than they are. These gestures never work - a building is just too big to camouflage - and they are quite unnecessary, in any case, in a condo development no more than six storeys tall.
But Toronto should welcome the positioning of mid-rise, mixed-use complexes like this one, with or without those mandatory setbacks, on our principal streets. They can join urban living to thriving sidewalk culture, ending the separation between commercial and residential uses that prevails in the Beaches and in similar old places in the city. Done with sensitivity and design imagination, they can inject formal and textural variety into the streetscape - a play of small against somewhat larger, cozy against somewhat more aloof, antique against contemporary - and thereby enrich the public realm we inhabit and cherish.

Abstract: [Matthew Rodgers] also found he enjoyed attending old vehicle gatherings, but that the International Harvester wasn't exactly ideal for going places - it was slow, hard riding and with headlights that aren't reliable.

Full text:   This 60-year-old Pontiac is still riding on its first set of tires
Cars that have survived in original condition for six decades acquire a patina, touches of wear, dulled chrome and sun-faded paint that many feel add to their visual charm, and their interiors acquire a unique odour some might find musty and mildly noxious but that other, more discerning noses, will interpret as a tincture of time itself.
In the description of a painstakingly restored VW microbus auctioned for more than $200,000 recently, it was noted that even the ashtray had been meticulously refinished. Matthew Rodgers, on the other hand, delights in pointing out that the one in the 1951 Pontiac he purchased last year for $5,000 still contains a cigar butt very probably puffed on by its original owner.
This isn't as unlikely as it sounds even though 60 years have passed since cigar-loving Harry Fierheller of Maple, Ont., paid about $2,200 to acquire his Fleetleader DeLuxe new from the Morton Brothers dealership in Newmarket.
It had only 22,400 miles on its odometer - the first few acquired taking relatives for rides on newly opened Highway 400 - a sticker indicates Fierheller had its oil changed at a Woodbridge area Esso station in 1958. Shortly afterward, he laid it up in his barn from which it didn't emerge until the mid-1980s.
After passing through a couple of owners, the odometer still read just 22,700 miles when Rodgers became its very happy new owner.
Rodgers, 36, who lives in Kaladar, Ont., is an accidental old auto enthusiast. He had no more than a passing interest in vintage vehicles until identical twin brother Mark (they make up two thirds of triplets with sister Rebekah) needed to sell his rare but unrestored, rough and still running on its original mechanicals, 1938 International Harvester one-ton truck a few years ago.
Rodgers stepped in to keep it in the family and, despite having to learn to double-clutch to work the gearbox, "totally fell in love with it."
And also with the reaction it drew when he drove it.
"It wasn't just a case of, 'Oh look at what I have,' but when I drove down the street that children would point and people would wave. And come up to me when I was in the Tim Hortons parking lot, or putting gas in it, and tell me their stories about learning to drive on a truck like it, or driving one on their first job. Driving a classic vehicle was completely different to anything I had experienced. It was amazing."
Rodgers also found he enjoyed attending old vehicle gatherings, but that the International Harvester wasn't exactly ideal for going places - it was slow, hard riding and with headlights that aren't reliable. "You hit a bump and they might go out. And you hope the next bump will turn them back on, which isn't always the case. The wipers also don't work and it's missing the passenger window."
Rodgers, who works in a real estate office and is establishing himself as a photographer, enlisted his more mechanically minder brother's aid in seeking something more modern and driveable. And it was he who discovered the 1951 Pontiac Fleetleader DeLuxe in Brockville, the for-sale ad posted on the bulletin board at the local Goodwill store.
After Googling 1951 Pontiacs and viewing images of shiny restored examples, Rodgers went to see the car. It was mechanically sound but its original paintwork had been crudely touched up. "It wasn't as beautiful as I was hoping. But it had class and style and a story to tell because it was 100 per cent original."
It was actually still riding on the tires fitted on the assembly line at the GM plant in Oshawa on May 18, 1951, which Rodgers finds pretty neat, as May 18 also happens to be his birthday.
In 1951, Canadian Pontiacs were to all intents Chevrolets with little more to differentiate the brand than the hood ornament - the rear-view mirror on Rodger's car actually has a Chevy bowtie on the back - and were examples of GM's first post-war redesign introduced in 1949.
This low end of the range Fleetleader DeLuxe is powered by a 93-hp, 239-cubic-inch flathead six with three-speed column shift transmission and no power steering or brakes. It came with a clock and heater but no radio and is one of 37,370 Pontiacs built in Oshawa in 1951.
Rodgers learned the Pontiac's elderly owner, who had a connection to its original purchaser through his wife's family, had turned down some offers, concerned it would be hot-rodded. But after hearing Rodgers intended to keep it the way it was, he knocked $3,500 off the asking price. "I actually drove it home that night. It was pretty exciting," he says.
Rodgers obviously has an empathy with old things - he collects antiques and enjoys photographing derelict houses and speculating on the lives that were once part of them, and this carries over to his new-found love of old cars.
"Who owned them, where did they go? Family vacations, maybe a bride sat in the back seat? And when I go to car shows I love hearing stories about other people's cars. It's really cool. And a lot of fun."
And he's not alone. At a car show earlier this year, the Pontiac - parked amidst rows of expensively restored showpieces - won the President's Choice award. "There aren't many completely original cars around any more and people obviously enjoy seeing it," says Rodgers.

Abstract: Given the sorrowful state of equity markets, this could be an ideal time to go bargain hunting - especially for those with strong stomachs and a long-term view. Stocks that are trading below book value - the total assets of a company minus its intangible assets and liabilities - could signal they are undervalued. But often these companies come with a big red danger sign.

What are we looking for?
Canadian-listed stocks that are profitable but trading below book value.
Given the sorrowful state of equity markets, this could be an ideal time to go bargain hunting - especially for those with strong stomachs and a long-term view. Stocks that are trading below book value - the total assets of a company minus its intangible assets and liabilities - could signal they are undervalued. But often these companies come with a big red danger sign. They can be operating under stress conditions and something could be fundamentally wrong, such as an overwhelming debt load or poor growth prospects amid a bad economy. Book value is an indication of the total value of the company's assets that shareholders would theoretically receive if a company were liquidated.
To make our screen, stocks must have a price-to-book value below 1 but also have a strong track record of making money, with profits being reported in each of the past three years. And to increase our comfort level, these companies are also expected to post income in both the current year and next. Their common equity to total assets has to be over 50 per cent, which should give some assurance they are not about to be knocked down by too much debt. Market cap has to be greater than $500-million (U.S.).
What did we find?
Dorel Industries Inc. tops our list, with a price-to-book value of only 0.55. The stock has been sinking throughout much of the year, currently hovering just above its 52-week low of $21.46 on Sept. 23.
The company is struggling to boost sales amid depressed consumer confidence in the United States. Demand for its car seats and strollers is waning as more Americans choose to go with second-hand products. But on the bright side, its bicycle sales are doing well. Its second-quarter earnings fell to $23-million from $32.9-million a year earlier.
Weak consumer confidence is also plaguing Rona Inc., the company on our list with the second-lowest price-to-book value. Rona, which is facing stiff competition, saw its earnings in the second quarter tumble to $37-million from $66.3-million a year earlier.
A handful of base metals producers made the list as well. Prices for the commodities they produce have plunged in recent days. While each has various operating issues to be aware of, they look like interesting candidates right now for value investors betting the global economy is going to get back on track in relatively short order.

Full text:   Ivanhoe's foray into country is cautionary tale for other companies aiming to cash in on the burgeoning middle class
RETAILING REPORTER
Real estate giant Ivanhoe Cambridge had big ambitions for India but for now is pulling out of the market without a deal to its name - victim of infrastructure challenges and a shaky Indian mall landscape.
About three years ago, the Montreal-based shopping centre specialist set up an office in Mumbai, named a senior executive to head it and looked to pour millions of dollars into projects. Today, it's closing its office in India, where it had 10 employees, blaming a weak network of roads and public transit to get people to and from buildings, and failure to find an appropriate domestic partner. Industry experts also point to notorious red tape in India and high vacancy rates in malls.
"We didn't feel that we were at a point where we could find the winning formula," Claude Sirois, senior vice-president of emerging markets at Ivanhoe in Montreal, said in an interview. "Does it take anything away from the potential of India? The answer is no. Does it take anything from the retail potential in India? Definitely no. The demand is there."
Ivanhoe's foray into India is a cautionary tale for other companies aiming to cash in on the burgeoning Indian economy and fast-growing middle class shoppers. On paper, it's a land of opportunity: its gross domestic product jumped 8 per cent in 2010 and is forecast to pick up 8.5 per cent this year, according to figures from the Indian Ministry of Finance. In contrast, Canada's GDP rose just 3 per cent in 2010, and is projected to climb between 2.2 and 2.4 per cent this year.
While the population in North America is aging, which moderates consumer spending, it's growing quickly in India, spurring retail business. Indian retail sales will almost double to $804-billion (U.S.) by 2015 from today, according to the Business Monitor International India Retail Report.
But developers grapple with government bureaucracy that can delay projects for years, poor mall planning and high retailer turnover. Many malls are a mish-mash of different types of merchants, scattered over multi-storeys with shoppers rarely venturing to top floors. Others are located on a city's outskirt with scant parking, although consumers prefer nearby urban stores. Most of the more than 200 shopping centres in India are struggling, hit by high rates of vacancies, industry experts say.
"It's a challenge which I would imagine a lot of overseas developers would face," Raghav Gupta, principal of consultancy Booz & Co. India, said in a telephone interview from New Delhi.
Only between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of malls in India draw enough shoppers to make them profitable for retailers, Mr. Gupta estimated. The failure rate makes it difficult for a company such as Ivanhoe to find a dependable local partner to team up with.
Many malls falter because developers built them looking to turn a fast profit, selling off units to third parties who then rented out the space to retailers without co-ordinating the uses with other tenants, he said. At the same time, rental rates are high, making up between 15 and 20 per cent of a merchant's sales, compared with between 8 per cent and 12 per cent in Europe, he said.
Most retailers are small mom-and-pop shops, without strategic plans for locating in malls. "Everybody is learning about the market, figuring out what works in India and what doesn't work in India," he said. "Norms are not established as yet."
Amanpreet Banga knows all about the challenges of foreign companies betting on Indian retail real estate. Until this spring, he was commercial director at European mall titan Segecé in New Delhi, aiming to strike agreements to manage shopping centres in India. Like Ivanhoe Cambridge, Paris-based Segecé recently retreated from the Indian market.
Indian developers "don't want to pay a huge amount, giving part of their profits to a management company," Mr. Banga said.
Even so, developers are starting to map out more profitable models for malls in India, he said. They're trying to ensure that similar types of retailers - such as women's and children's apparel merchants - are located next to each other. They're adding seating areas to the centres, giving shoppers a chance to get re-energized so they can shop more, he said. Big foreign chains are beginning to enter India as wholesalers, and the government is looking at loosening restrictive foreign control rules to allow them to sell directly to consumers.
"The mistakes have been understood - the lessons are there," said Mr. Banga, who now specializes in retailing with a realtor in New Delhi. "The difficult part is the implementation."
Ivanhoe's strategic shift comes as its parent, Caisse de depôt et placement du Quebec, Canada's biggest pension fund manager, revamps its overall real estate operations, merging its mall division with its office- and residential-building unit in a bid to find savings. In the office segment, the Caisse said in 2007 that it wanted to invest up to $1.6-billion in India.
Mr. Sirois wouldn't comment on specific numbers, but confirmed that the company has not directly invested in any real estate there. "We didn't feel that in the short term it was possible," he said. Instead, the company has put money indirectly into real estate funds in India, and will continue to do so.
Nevertheless, Ivanhoe will continue to invest in international markets, which it has been doing for 15 years - the past six in emerging markets such as Brazil and, to a much lesser extent, China, Mr. Sirois said.
The company will keep its eye on India from a distance, he said. In the long run, "we can't afford not to look at India. This is a growing market. This is what, in our business, we look for."

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/we-cant-save-world-alone-central-bankers-tell/docview/896226504/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Mr. [Ben Bernanke] is increasingly trying to stir a stronger legislative response to the weakening economy by becoming more explicit about the threats he sees on the horizon. On Tuesday, he told lawmakers that the recovery is "close to faltering," and last week he told an audience in Cleveland that the country's persistently elevated unemployment rate represented a "national crisis."

Full text:   Ben Bernanke and Jean-Claude Trichet have a message for politicians: Stop putting all the burden of saving the world economy on the backs of the central banks.
The world's two most powerful central bankers, in separate testimony Tuesday, tried to persuade their political masters to end their bickering and come up with definitive plans to ease uncertainty over policy and boost economic growth.
Mr. Bernanke, the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, called on lawmakers to refrain from cutting spending too quickly, while Mr. Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, said European governments must agree on a rescue program that is big enough to support cash-strapped governments and banks.
"Monetary policy can be a powerful tool, but it is not a panacea for the problems currently faced by the U.S. economy," Mr. Bernanke said in a statement to the congressional Joint Economic Committee on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Trichet, for his part, chided the European Parliament for favouring financial rescue schemes that would rely heavily on the resources of the ECB. He said he opposes turning Europe'sEUR440-billion ($617-billion) bailout fund into a bank so it could secure access to ECB loans, thus expanding the fund's firepower.
The ECB already is buying the debt of Italy and other European countries, and Mr. Trichet's remarks suggest the central bank will be a reluctant participant in future programs that go beyond its core mandate of containing inflation.
"I would say it is their responsibility to face up to the worst financial crisis since World War II," Mr. Trichet said, referring to the governments of the euro zone, which have been struggling for more than a year to come up with a convincing backstop for the region's debt-heavy countries and financial institutions. "We [in the euro zone] are the epicentre of this global crisis."
The financial crisis pushed both the Fed and the ECB into uncharted territory, forcing them to test the limits of monetary policy to provide ballast for their struggling economies and calm volatile financial markets. This has forced the central banks uncomfortably into the spotlight, especially as U.S. legislators squabble over the appropriateness of further stimulus and European legislators balk at bailing out troubled states and banks.
Mr. Bernanke is increasingly trying to stir a stronger legislative response to the weakening economy by becoming more explicit about the threats he sees on the horizon. On Tuesday, he told lawmakers that the recovery is "close to faltering," and last week he told an audience in Cleveland that the country's persistently elevated unemployment rate represented a "national crisis."
While the Fed continues to project faster economic growth over the remainder of the year than in the first half, Mr. Bernanke told the joint committee that the central bank now expects the rebound to be slower. Consumer confidence has been battered by high unemployment and a volatile stock market, crimping spending, Mr. Bernanke said. At the same time, the real estate market, which typically pulls the economy out of recession, this time "isn't doing anything," he said.
The Fed chief explicitly called on lawmakers to do more. Mr. Bernanke advised them to agree on a plan that would constrict the budget deficit over the longer term, while remaining supportive of economic growth in the present.
He noted that mass layoffs by state and local governments are contributing significantly to the high unemployment rate.
However, there were few outward signs of a willingness on the part of Democrats and Republicans to co-operate.
In Dallas, U.S. President Barack Obama pressed Congress to pass his economic stimulus plan. But back at the Joint Economic Committee, Republican members expressed concern over the Fed's use of unconventional policy, including its most recent attempt to lower longer-term interest rates by selling from its holdings of short-term debt to buy securities with durations of six years to 30 years.
Like it or not, Mr. Bernanke's Fed will likely continue to be the only source of economic stimulus, analysts said.
"With Congress so hopelessly split on those difficult long-term decisions, we doubt that Bernanke will get his wish this side of next year's presidential election," said Paul Ashworth, the Toronto-based chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.

A downtown pulled back from the brink

Author: Lewington, Jennifer

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/downtown-pulled-back-brink/docview/896008160/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "So many people fly by on the 401 and do not even know this exists - and I was one of them," says Landmark Group president Aaron Ciancone, whose company owns a roster of historic grist mills that have been converted into restaurants in southern Ontario. "When I drove into this downtown, I was flabbergasted. I thought, 'I can't believe this is in my own backyard.'"

Full text:   A mix of development, government projects and community efforts are attracting people and businesses to Cambridge, Ont.
From Highway 401, this southwestern Ontario city looks like any suburban node along Canada's busiest freeway - a mishmash of big-box retail stores, low-rise hotels and giant hydro pylons.
But what could shape this community's future lies six kilometres to the south, in Galt, one of four municipalities amalgamated as Cambridge in 1973.
That hidden gem is Galt's core at the confluence of the Grand and Speed rivers. The charm of long-neglected 19th century limestone industrial buildings and stone and brick storefronts has caught the eye of private developers who, alone or with the local government, see potential returns from a rediscovered downtown.
"So many people fly by on the 401 and do not even know this exists - and I was one of them," says Landmark Group president Aaron Ciancone, whose company owns a roster of historic grist mills that have been converted into restaurants in southern Ontario. "When I drove into this downtown, I was flabbergasted. I thought, 'I can't believe this is in my own backyard.'"
Three months ago, Landmark re-opened the Cambridge Mill, a former grist mill that had failed as a steakhouse, as a posh restaurant, conference centre and wedding venue. Since purchasing the 1.2-hectare site in 2008, the company has invested $11.5-million to restore the historic character of the building, almost tripling usable floor space to 30,000 square feet, with glass and limestone additions overlooking the Grand River. Mr. Ciancone estimates the Mill, which is a few blocks from downtown, is serving about 4,000 customers a week for restaurant meals, weddings and other events. Saturday weddings are sold out from May to December, 2012. The company also plans to add a hotel to the property.
Over on Main Street, David Gibson and Craig Beattie, partners in Perimeter Development Corp., have purchased eight properties that combine ground-floor retail and second-storey rental units with a renovation cost of $10-million to $13-million over the next couple of years.
For its part, the city has carried out a $1-million streetscape improvement on one block of Main Street, with another block pending, to install wider sidewalks, granite curbs and other amenities to attract pedestrians and limit truck traffic. Amid some controversy, the city put up $6-million (matched by the province and federal government) for a 500-seat performing arts complex at the south end of town. Drayton Entertainment, which runs professional theatres in four Ontario communities, will operate the new facility when it opens next year.
Meanwhile, developer Amir Klein purchased a seedy Main Street hotel from the city in 2007 for $115,000 and gutted the building. It now houses a Coffee Culture franchise on the ground floor and 12 residential units on the upper two floors.
A few blocks away, Mr. Klein's AAK Construction Co. is in the home stretch of converting a former industrial stone building that overlooks the Grand River into 39 residential lofts, priced between $169,000 and $500,000.
"The future is downtown," says Mr. Klein. "People don't want to drive any more. They don't want to cut the grass and clear the snow. They want to be able to walk two minutes to the coffee shop and three minutes to the bank."
Mr. Gibson, who played an influential role in the transformation of uptown Waterloo, sees lifestyle trends favouring a rebirth of urban centres.
But he warns the process takes patience, critical mass and an orderly sequence of retail development to ensure momentum. By design, Perimeter purchased several buildings on Main Street to control the pace of redevelopment and attract its preferred type of "performing retailers," who can generate enough business activity to support expected rental costs in the high teens per square foot.
He also made a point of visiting city officials, including the mayor, to gauge their interest in his vision of downtown renewal.
"It takes a lot of players, and we all need to be on the same page," says Mr. Gibson, praising the city for its streetscape improvements, which were completed on time and on budget.
Despite renewed signs of life, developers warn a full downtown turnaround is some years away.
But Mayor Doug Craig is upbeat. "We have reached a turning point," he says. "We will see more and more activity by private interests taking place downtown." In 2010, the value of permits in Cambridge as a whole climbed to $327.7-million, up from $227.8-million in 2005.
Hair salon owner Shane Murphy, chair of the Galt Business Improvement Association, has worked on Main Street for three decades, witnessing its rise, fall and rise again. "Thirty-two years ago it was an extremely vibrant, busy downtown," she says. "Like every city in North America, downtowns basically almost ceased to exist in the mall era."
Now, she observes, "people want to come down and walk to places again and spend the day. That is what we are focusing on."
*****
THE EVOLUTION'S SPARK
The arrival of the University of Waterloo's school of architecture, which opened in 2004, marked the start of a revival for old Galt's downtown.
"It changed the mindset of people in Cambridge," says Tom Watson, a retired real estate company owner who at the time was one of several civic leaders who campaigned for the school's relocation to Cambridge. He and others raised $12.5-million for the $30-million renovation of the building, a former tire plant. The balance came from the municipality, the province and the federal government.
Past revitalization efforts failed because they were done piecemeal, he says, and the current mix of private and public investment is generating a sense of momentum.

On an even keel, Manitoba's miracle takes shape

Author: Pitts, Gordon

Abstract: "It's a really, really diversified economy, and that diversification has smoothed out its business cycle," says John McCallum, a professor of finance at the University of Manitoba who has sat on a number of public and private boards in the province.

Full text:   The last time the world was racked by financial upheaval, Manitoba was a relative haven of stability.
Through the worst of the 2008-09 meltdown, the provincial economy was as flat as its prairie landscape - which is a very good showing in calamitous times. Its once meteoric neighbours, resource-dominated Alberta and Saskatchewan, fell off a cliff.
The Manitoba miracle is rooted in being un-miraculous, a middling province in the middle of the country. That even-keeled nature means that over the past five years, it has been on average Canada's best-performing provincial economy.
The secret lies in being a province that, more by accident than design, runs like an obsessively defensive investment portfolio with a balanced weighting of sectors.
"It's a really, really diversified economy, and that diversification has smoothed out its business cycle," says John McCallum, a professor of finance at the University of Manitoba who has sat on a number of public and private boards in the province.
Manitobans head to the polls on Tuesday after a month-long campaign that has been fought mostly over health care and crime, with very little emphasis placed on the economy. But now, as the world teeters on the brink of renewed recession, the province must face a troubling question: Is it strong enough to weather the storm once more? Bereft of public company head offices, a high-tech champion or a leading oil and gas player, the province must feed off its vaunted balance or sink with the rest of the world.
At stake is a jobless rate that is second best in the country after now-booming Saskatchewan. The Manitoba unemployment rate in August was 5.4 per cent - and the province did not lose as many jobs as many other jurisdictions in the recession. This time, with commodities under pressure again, that trick may be harder to pull off.
Even before recent financial choppiness, Manitoba's resilience was tested, as it reeled from historically heavy rains that cut output of canola and wheat by 20 per cent or more.
That put a crimp in Manitoba's growth, but it simply knocked it back to the middle of the pack of provinces. Instead of 3.6 per cent forecast real GDP growth this year, it seemed in early September to be heading toward 2.8 per cent, according to a Royal Bank of Canada report.
The impact of the weather was blunted because agriculture, while symbolically important, represents about 5 per cent of the economy (although a fair bit more in indirect services). Similarly, when manufacturing got hammered in the last upheaval, Manitoba got hurt, but not grievously, because manufacturing is about 10 per cent of output - and the province's bus manufacturing benefited from some stimulus spending.
Services account for more than 40 per cent of the economy, and financial services alone represent close to 20 per cent. Government plays an important role, as does mining and, increasingly, oil and gas - particularly with the boom in the rich Bakken formation.
Any talk of Manitoba starts with Winnipeg and its population of more than 760,000 - more than half the provincial total and nearly a third of the population of Middle Canada, the area between Thunder Bay and Medicine Hat. The next biggest Manitoba city is Brandon with fewer than 50,000.
Yet this economic kingpin lacks the flagship head offices of cities like Toronto or Calgary. Its two financial giants, Great- West Life and Investors Group, are cornerstones of the local economy, but both are controlled by Montreal-based Power Corp. of Canada.
"You have to play the hand you're dealt," Prof. Mr. McCallum says. The city must cope with an external reputation for high taxes, cold winter weather and long distances to major markets. But perversely, location also works as a strength, as it is positioned at the physical centre of the continent.
As a result, Manitoba has a strong transportation and warehousing component, which contributes 7 per cent of the provincial economy. The Winnipeg international airport is a big economic driver, as are trucking and rail giants, which have big operations in the region.
While short on public companies, the province is blessed with a deep contingent of big family companies, epitomized by James Richardson & Sons Ltd., owned by the most influential family in Middle Canada with interests spanning agribusiness, oil and gas, and financial services.
The other word you hear around Manitoba is resilience. In the past 15 years, it shrugged off the loss of an NHL hockey team - since regained - the death of Izzy Asper, its best-known entrepreneur, and the breakup of his broadcasting empire, CanWest Global.
Yet the city's survival instincts transcend a single company, says Leonard Asper, son of Izzy and the last family president of CanWest. In an interview earlier this year, he said CanWest might be gone, but the Asper family remains devoted to Winnipeg in its personal investing and philanthropy. He lives in Toronto but brother David and sister Gail are both very active locally.
The enduring legacy is the Asper Foundation, the charitable entity that with other local champions has helped drive the building of a human rights museum. "I don't think the museum is the last thing we will do," Mr. Asper said.
Prof. McCallum says that as the economy turn negative again, the province will regret having failed to deal with its public debt and its reliance on Ottawa's transfer payments for about a third of government revenue. In the future, the federal government will not have as big an appetite for transferring large sums.
He sums up Manitoba's challenge as being a high-debt, highly Ottawa-dependent province entering a slowing period for commodities - all the while dealing with a U.S. economy that may be on the brink of recession.
"In the sweet spot of the cycle, we didn't get out from under Ottawa the way we should have," he says. "We squandered our windfall and we will regret that."

A merger of condo and townhouse

Abstract: "You no longer have that feeling of walking through a tunnel," says Mr. [Paul Golini Jr.]. "It's truly an element of openness and light that's different than a typical condominium. From the exterior, it creates a wonderful lit building-scape where at night you have the side of the building that glows."

Paul Golini Jr. of Empire Communities was invited to Montreal by Stal Inc. to get a firsthand look at how one of their condominium projects replicated traditional townhouse living with spacious two-storey plans, windows on opposite walls and front doors exposed to natural sunlight.
Impressed by how different the development was from conventional condominiums, Mr. Golini's company teamed up with the Montreal developer and Identity Developments to import the design concept to a 14-storey building in downtown Toronto.
"The whole idea was to provide this feeling of living in a townhome, but in a condo, high-rise setting," says Mr. Golini,, who is the executive vice-president of Empire Communities. "It's already been tested in Montreal, so we really believe Toronto is ready for this type of product."
In fact, since sales for the boutique-style residence began in June, buyers picked up half of the suites, which will encompass 34 two-storey suites, called maisonettes, 11 one-storey units and three townhouses with street access.
"It's not the typical condo or the small suites you'd find in some of the bigger projects in the city," says Mr. Golini.
"There's a focus on design, so there's a lot of details being put not only into the suites, but the lobby, corridors and exterior design of the building."
For instance, the site's wide and narrow footprint at Shuter and George streets inspired Page + Steele Architects to design a charcoal brick podium and glass structure above filled with two-storey units that would have southern and northern exposures in the bedrooms upstairs. Meanwhile, the level below would feature principal rooms with south-facing windows and entrances that exit to common corridors with walls of north-facing windows.
"You no longer have that feeling of walking through a tunnel," says Mr. Golini. "It's truly an element of openness and light that's different than a typical condominium. From the exterior, it creates a wonderful lit building-scape where at night you have the side of the building that glows."
Models will range from one- to three-bedroom plans, and offer dens, balconies and terraces in many cases.
Interior finishes will include exposed concrete columns and floor-to-ceiling windows, as well as pre-engineered wood floors, imported Italian kitchen cabinetry, granite counters and glass tile backsplashes.
The maisonettes and townhouses will also feature floating staircases with open risers and nine-foot ceilings on the main floor.
Should residents need more room to relax or entertain, there will be a two-storey lobby, a gym and a third-floor lounge with a kitchen and walkout to a landscaped courtyard with seating and barbecue areas.
"It's boutique-type condo project ... so it doesn't have a lot of amenities, but the few ones it does have are going to be of high quality," Mr. Golini adds.
In terms of local attractions, the building is close to theatres, restaurants and the Eaton Centre on Yonge Street, in addition to the subway line, major universities and St. Lawrence Market.
Neighbouring communities undergoing revitalization, such as Regent Park and the Lower Don Lands, also add a new mix of commercial shops, parkland and recreational and cultural facilities.
"There's opportunity for an increase of price and value of their homes," says Mr. Golini. "If they buy now, in five years all those neighbourhoods being developed east of Yonge are going to be worth a lot more."
Monthly fees will be 54 cents per square feet or 49 cents for townhouses. Hydro and water will be separately metered.
For $40,000, purchasers of two-storey units can buy a parking spot, which comes with an monthly fee of $50.
Occupancy is slated for December 2012.

Baja homes that catch a desert wind

Author: Hadani Ditmars

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/baja-homes-that-catch-desert-wind/docview/894804708/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Drawing on references ranging from the California "healthy living" aesthetic to traditional adobe structures to underground homes in the Tunisian desert, Mr. [Javier Campos] conceived the retreat as three separate buildings.

Full text:   Vancouver's Campos Leckie Studio creates four unique dwellings in Mexico that respect an ecologically delicate landscape
Over the past decade, a remote community in Baja California has become a unique opportunity for Vancouver based designers Javier Campos and Michael Leckie to explore variations on the desert house.
With utopian desert dwellings of mid-century modernists like Schindler and Neutra as inspirational points of departure, the two have refined the aesthetic through a series of four different residences on four distinctive sites in Los Zacatitos - 30 kilometres from the nearest town. The off-grid homes reflect both the dramatic topography and climate of the area, as well as the simplicity and beauty of the desert environment.
When Mr. Campos first visited the site of the initial project - designed as a low-tech retreat for a Microsoft executive whose urban Seattle digs he had renovated in the late '90s - he was struck by how green it was.
"I'd arrived in August, during the rainy hurricane season," he explains, "and everything was bursting into bloom."
But when he came back a few months later, he was met by stark desert landscape and dried up creek beds - or arroyos. He knew that he would have to come up with a design that was both responsive to the site and adaptable to climactic contrasts.
Key to the project, he felt, was avoiding the excesses of other villas in the region - monster homes that imposed desalination plants and tennis courts on the arid, ecologically delicate landscape.
Drawing on references ranging from the California "healthy living" aesthetic to traditional adobe structures to underground homes in the Tunisian desert, Mr. Campos conceived the retreat as three separate buildings. The main residence contains the "gathering places" of kitchen, living room and patio, and two smaller houses contain bedrooms and bathrooms - all connected by a series of courtyards.
The buildings follow the contour of a natural bowl on the four-acre site and incorporate the surrounding landscape into the overall design.
Building materials were limited to steel and concrete offset by Honduran mahogany. Solar panels located on top of the garage provide power, while passive heating and cooling systems based on traditional desert architecture found in the Middle East and Mexico keep the space livable in the extreme desert climate.
After consulting with local surfers about prevailing wind patterns, Mr. Campos developed a low-impact ventilations strategy. He situated the main villa to be open to the north and south, so it could catch the Pacific winds for cooling purposes.
While Mr. Campos was working on the first Zacatitos project, his future design partner Michael Leckie (the two formed Campos Leckie Studio in 2009 but collaborated on other projects before that) happened to be getting his own dose of the Baja experience. He spent four months surfing there and living in his van. So when Mr. Campos asked him to collaborate on a second project, a few miles away from the first, he was delighted to oblige.
"I already had an intimate knowledge of the landscape," explains Mr. Leckie, who shares a deep sense of connection to the area with Mr. Campos.
The second home, built as a retreat for a Canadian couple, took the indoor/outdoor aesthetic to the next level. "Our client has a great love of architecture," explains Mr. Leckie - "and he really gave us free reign."
The result was an extraordinary dwelling that simplified and purified the desert home aesthetic so that it appears to spring organically from the landscape.
The minimalist yet elegant home fuses the indoor and outdoor - and exterior and interior programming - blurring boundaries in a unique way.
Situated on a small plateau, with arroyos on either side, "Zacatitos 2" recalls that line from Leonard Cohen's Famous Blue Raincoat : "I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert. Are you living for nothing now, hope your keeping some kind of record."
The basic starting point for the house explains Mr. Leckie, was to pare down to the "basic essentials of what was needed for the site and the climate."
"It was conceived as a singular roof to shade the site," explains Mr. Leckie, "with integrated deep beams and clerestory windows between them to exhaust out warm air." The rest of the program followed.
The most dramatic feature of the house is a 600-foot west-facing living area that literally fuses with the landscape, its flooring disappearing into the surrounding rocky outcrop. It is sheltered by a delicately detailed steel frame canopy. Private spaces like bedrooms and baths, are programmed at the cooler eastern end of the house, while a roof deck opens up to the desert sky.
A third Zacatitos house commissioned by two Canadian couples, was completed this summer and comprises 4,200 square feet of exterior and interior space. It sits on a sandy site that overlooks the ocean, so the main design imperative was one of protection from the elements. Conceived as a series of modular panels, it features one long roof that has various enclosed and open aspects. Designed perpendicular to the view axis of the west facing mountains and the east facing ocean, it features a central living area that opens up onto a pool and provides natural ventilation.
As befits a desert environment, the house is very much about balancing the tension between the open and exposed, and the enclosed and protected spaces.
Word of the Campos Leckie homes has spread quickly in the tight knit Los Zacatitos community. Now a fourth house is in the works. So far it's conceived as a bridge that spans the rocky site.
Mr. Campos and Mr. Leckie have developed a special relationship with this place and both feel protective of the ecologically vulnerable area - which could easily be destroyed by over-development.
The designs for their four projects are really architectural homages to the unique sites.
Says Mr. Leckie, "We wanted to respect the wildness of this place."

Abstract: Mr. [Don Lindsay] said commodity producers such as Teck used to depend on the U.S. and Europe. "While the market still hangs on that belief, I can assure you it's no longer true," he said, rattling off a list of China statistics, from its huge copper demand to rapid urbanization. Teck's sales staff is currently working on fourth-quarter contracts and prices, and "we haven't seen anything unusual" suggesting a change in demand, he said.

Full text: For those who once questioned the rising power and influence of China on the world economic stage, the 2008 global financial crisis laid any doubts to rest.
As stocks plunged, credit markets froze and major financial institutions collapsed, economies around the world went into freefall. China was caught in the storm too, as demand for its exports sank.
But the slowdown in China was exceedingly brief. In response to the downturn, Beijing rolled out an enormous stimulus package worth four trillion yuan or $570-billion (U.S.).
China's economy took flight almost immediately as a slew of infrastructure projects including roads, railways and buildings sparked bank lending and GDP growth.
As those projects got under way in cities like Chongqing and Wuhan, they sent positive ripple effects half a world away to Canada's resource-driven economy. Chinese demand for coal, copper, iron ore, petroleum, lumber and other commodities almost single-handedly brought the resource market back to life and helped Canada weather the economic storm better than most Western nations. China is now responsible for more than 40 per cent of the world's metal demand.
The great recession was China's time to shine. The Asian economic superpower led the world out of the downturn, as its breakneck growth sparked global recovery and helped Europe and North America get back on track. In the process, China vaulted to the rank of second-largest economy on the planet as well as the world's largest exporter.
Now, nearly three years later, as a debt-laden Europe and a jobs-starved United States teeter once again on the precipice of recession, all eyes are back on China. Can the Middle Kingdom save the world again?
The answer, according to experts on China's economy as well as Chinese business owners and consumers, is probably not. At least, not in the same way it did last time.
China's economy is in a very different state today than it was at the start of the global financial crisis in 2008.
The country is still dealing with the side effects of its previous stimulus package: burdensome local government debt, stubbornly high inflation and a red-hot housing market that many say is set to blow up.
"I don't think China will fill the void of growth that is left from a slowdown of the Western economies at this stage," said Na Liu, the founder of CNC Asset Management and an adviser on China strategy to Scotia Capital.
"A new 'shock and awe' stimulus package from China like the one in 2008 is almost impossible at this stage."
At the same time, China's economy is decelerating from the more than 10 per cent GDP growth it enjoyed in 2010.
A third month of slowdown in manufacturing highlighted by a weak HSBC Chinese purchasing manager's report this week contributed to the market mayhem that sent global stocks into a tailspin and investors rushing for the safety of bonds.
Economists are cutting China's growth forecasts. The International Monetary Fund sees growth slipping to 9 per cent next year from 9.5 per cent this year. London's Capital Economics cut its 2011 outlook to 8.5 per cent from 9 per cent. Western countries can only dream of such growth, but for China it's a gear down.
"China's economy is weaker today than on the eve of the global crisis three years ago and won't be able to shrug off the problems elsewhere or be able to completely offset them," Mark Williams, the firm's chief China economist said in a report this week.
Indeed, Chinese manufacturers, a crucial element of the country's export-driven economy, today are grappling with a host of problems they didn't face just a few years ago. Spiking labour and production costs, along with fast-rising competition, are grinding China's manufacturing engine.
In Songjiang, an industrial suburb of China's financial centre Shanghai, chemicals waft in the breeze as Chen Yun gestures to a brand-new dark-red Chevrolet Cruz with palpable frustration.
The 45-year-old factory owner, who studied in Japan and has more than 20 years of experience in China's manufacturing sector, says the car - which costs more than 100,000 yuan ($15,600) - is owned by one of his workers. This would have been impossible a few years ago, he says, and it shows the many shifts in business that have him worried about the health of his factory and Chinese industry as a whole.
Three years ago, factories in this industrial park would stay open until 9 p.m. every night, and Mr. Chen's Shanghai Shininger Electronics Co. was paying his workers just 1,500 yuan a month. Now many of the workers are gone by 5 p.m. and wages have doubled to 3,000 yuan a month for labourers cranking out machinery that prints invoices and receipts. The wages for his engineers have gone up 50 per cent to nearly 10,000 yuan a month.
Many of the factories here that helped the world out of recession are now gone. The low-skill garment factories were the first to go, and now other owners are either shuttering their operations completely or moving to the Chinese interior. As the economy in China has sagged, Mr. Chen's customers are taking longer and longer to pay for orders, asking for 30-, 60- or even 90-day payment periods, which have hit his cash flow and made him increasingly reliant on loans. However, since the state-owned banks are refusing loans to small to medium-sized businesses like his own, Mr. Chen says, he has been forced to rely on private lenders with usurious interest rates as high as 60 per cent.
As he says this, Mr. Chen leans toward his factory, stretches his hands out, and then mimes the process of picking up a pile of cash and tossing it into the street.
"Now you have vacancies in every industrial park ... If I move inland, the property there will just increase in price, too, and then what will I do?" asks Mr. Chen, standing in a crisp white shirt and khakis, holding up his hands with thoughtful resignation. "All I can do is increase efficiency. This year, I can squeeze out 20 per cent. But next year? The salaries must rise. I'm not sure I can survive."
As Chinese manufacturing and exports have dipped, the country has also been hit by cripplingly high rates of inflation - 6.2 per cent for consumer prices in August. That ties the hands of government, which is reluctant to unleash more stimulus spending that could spur inflation.
"China may not have the same strength we used to, [in order] to help the global economy," said a senior Chinese economic analyst in Shanghai, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he often consults for the government.
The analyst pointed to persistent inflation, decreasing manufacturing and exports, and weak domestic consumption as evidence of China's inability to pitch in as the world confronts yet another global downturn. "China cannot do the same things that we did in 2008."
Consumer angstChina's government has taken steps to boost domestic consumption as a way to even out its might as an exporter. But now many consumers are now feeling the pinch.
In Shanghai's ritzy Xujiahui neighbourhood, 25-year-old Zhao Zheng Qi and her 26-year-old friend Xia Yan Jie, who are six-months pregnant and four-months pregnant respectively, were busy shopping in the maternity section of a trendy mall. Ms. Zhao, who confesses that she used to liberally spend her parents money, says she has had to adjust to the times and change her shopping habits.
"Before, if I liked it, I bought it," she says bluntly. "Now I have to compare prices."
Before the two of them stroll off, arm in arm, Ms. Xia, Ms. Zhao's pregnant friend, chimes in: "Though our salaries have increased, it can never catch up with our expenses."
In the same mall, James Zhu, a 30-year-old who works in the pharmaceutical industry, says he has taken advantage of a stronger currency, but frets over the fact that the real estate market around him in China is starting to decline, as global equities are falling. "There are no good investments that I can think of," he says. "I'm worried about the future."
In a Carrefour grocery store in Shanghai's Putuo neighbourhood, there is similar pessimism. Liu Cong, a 48-year-old trader in a brown jacket and loafers, notes that gas prices have crept up over the past several months and that meat - particularly the pork beloved by Chinese - has also become more expensive. A nearby woman interjected repeatedly with approval as Mr. Liu voiced his frustration.
"If the price suddenly doubled, it would be easier to avoid certain things, but the prices have risen so slowly and that is what's really horrible," he says, adding that none of the price increases have flowed to China's poor rural farmers, only to logistics companies and the government. "Finally, inflation has blown up. And the citizens can't do anything."
Near the frozen chicken, Pan Man Kung, who moved from Hong Kong three days earlier, points to oranges and peaches in her cart and gripes, "The things here are even more expensive than in Hong Kong."
But she is optimistic about the Chinese economy, saying it is resilient. Ms. Pan, who has travelled back and forth between Hong Kong and Shanghai for years because her son works here, notes that rising incomes have meant that many mainland Chinese are now shopping in Hong Kong. At the same time, Hong Kong natives are crossing the border to try to find bargains in the fake stores of Shenzhen. "When I take the train, the Chinese have four or five bags, and I think, 'Oh no, the Chinese are richer than us, now,' " she says with disbelief.
Not all Chinese, of course, are rich. Per capita GDP is roughly a 10th of that in North America. That's part of the problem. But Alexandre Dam thinks it may be part of the solution. Mr. Dam, a project manager at SCR Global who helps French garment and clothing companies manage their supply chains in China, has recently begun to lay the groundwork for launching retail outlets for French chains outside of the major cities, in China's interior. "Second-tier cities are a good place for mid-level Western brands," Mr. Dam says. "The demand is blowing up in the second- and third-tier cities. And for sure, the Chinese economy will be supported."
Indeed, China's plan to develop infrastructure and promote more urbanization in the country's second- and third-tier cities will sustain strong economic growth and commodity demand from Western countries like Canada for years to come, according to analysts Andrew Keen, Thorsten Zimmermann and Lourina Pretorius at HSBC.
"In terms of long-term structural trends, demand is now driven by an urbanization process that is far more structural than consensus generally believes," the analysts said in a recent report. "On our analysis, China is only 20 to 25 per cent along the path towards being a mature materials market and it may take at least six to nine years before demand intensity peaks."
Resource company executives are making the same bet.
As Canadian resources stocks tumbled again Friday, Don Lindsay, the CEO of Teck Resources, Canada's largest base metals producer, outright dismissed the market turmoil and suggested that China would once again save the day for the resource sector.
Mr. Lindsay said commodity producers such as Teck used to depend on the U.S. and Europe. "While the market still hangs on that belief, I can assure you it's no longer true," he said, rattling off a list of China statistics, from its huge copper demand to rapid urbanization. Teck's sales staff is currently working on fourth-quarter contracts and prices, and "we haven't seen anything unusual" suggesting a change in demand, he said.
Sales of B.C. lumber to mainland China have been surging for several years, on pace to exceed $1-billion this year for the first time. But after a boom earlier this year, the latest statistics show the pace of growth slowing significantly. Still, foresters remain confident China's long-term growth will keep sales strong.
"They have a very aggressive five-year plan," said Hank Ketcham, chief executive officer of West Fraser Timber.
"You know there's going to be a lot of construction."

Full text: Author Aravind Adiga says he was a 'disaster' living anywhere but India
Born into a prominent South India family, educated at Oxford and Columbia Universities, winner of Britain's Man Booker Prize in 2008 for The White Tiger , his first novel, Aravind Adiga is for all appearances the very model of the successful Indian immigrant, literary division - almost like the second coming of Salman Rushdie.
Except that the 37-year-old Adiga, unlike many Indian writers of a previous generation, never settled anywhere else. Despite his cosmopolitan resumé, the author lives in a tiny Mumbai flat with the roar of the great city shaking his windows day and night.
"I never did very well as an immigrant," the author admits in a very-long-distance conversation from his perch in the midst of the bustle. "I've lived in several countries and been a disaster everywhere." Only in India, he says, has he ever "done well."
"I live here, so to succeed as a writer I have to succeed here," Adiga adds. "My primary audience is right here." And don't look for him on a book tour.
Last Man in Tower , Adiga's second novel, is a lively comedy of Indian manners dominated by the chaotic spirit of the author's beloved hometown - 21st-century Mumbai in all its squalor and glory, seen not through the scrim of memory or the plate glass of a luxury hotel but through the eyes of a native son deeply immersed in its destiny.
Dedicated "to my fellow commuters on the Santa Cruz-Churchgate local line," Last Man plumbs the local to bring to light universal themes of power and identity in the new era of the global city.
While established authors in more developed markets struggle with declining book sales, Adiga is surfing the same wave that has raised Indian commerce to unprecedented heights. "It has always been very difficult for writers to survive commercially in India because the market was so small," he says. "But that's not true at all any more. It's one of the world's fastest growing and most vibrant markets for books, especially in English."
The new novel focuses on the turmoil created among the various residents of a shabby but respectable old apartment building on the edge of a slum when a massively rich, clever and corrupt developer offers them each a small fortune to vacate their co-op. He plans to replace it with a glittering new "super luxury" building in "a mix of Rajput and Gothic styles," with a touch of Art Deco and rents rivalling anything known in Manhattan.
As the diverse members of the Vishram Society (Tower A) struggle to deflect the threats and grasp the opportunities presented to them, Adiga creates a panoptical view of life in the relentlessly dynamic city, the one true hero and clear villain of the book. No research was necessary, according to the author.
"When I was writing The White Tiger I lived in a building pretty much exactly like the one I described in this novel, and the people in the book are the people I lived with back then," he says. "So I didn't have to do much research to find them."
The often cut-throat business of real-estate speculation is equally familiar to the author, his neighbours and characters, who refer to their home city alternately as either Mumbai or Bombay, according to a subtle code known only to them. Real estate is "the great obsession of the city," Adiga says, doubting that any outsider can grasp the importance of secure personal space in a city where more than half the population lives in unserviced slums.
"Having plenty of living space has to be the greatest luxury in a city, and I guess in some sense Bombay is the antithesis of what living in Canada must be," he says. The prospect of gaining more space, more status and security drives his characters to extremes, and the rough-hewn developer who manipulates them is no simple villain.
"In a city that seems to be gridlocked in many ways, that has grown so much but whose government hasn't done much to help it, the developer is an ambiguous figure," Adiga says. "He's the only man who gets things done in Bombay."
From its chaotic transport system to its spreading slums, Adiga's hometown is a pressure cooker vessel riven with cracks. "Bombay is at a critical time in its history," the author says. "What happens in the next few years will determine whether it continues to be the great Indian city or ends up as the third or fourth most important city in India."
But its failings only make Mumbai more attractive, according to Adiga. "You become protective of the city because it's clear it's in crisis," he says. "People who live here almost always fall in love with it."
Foreign shores may beckon, but Mumbai remains a novelist's paradise. "I think there are many more stories to be told here," Adiga says, "and I plan to stay here."

Sales tax shift hits B.C.'s reno, new home markets

Full text: Homeowners in British Columbia are either holding off on major renovations or finding ways to dodge the Harmonized Sales Tax that will be eliminated in the next 18 months.
In August, British Columbians voted to scrap the province's controversial harmonized sales tax in a referendum. Consumers will see a return to the old provincial sales tax in the transition phase, and until then, many are being resourceful in finding ways to skirt the 12 per cent HST.
Victoria homeowner Trish Tacoma is installing three decks, a pond and 35 feet of planters, and is buying from independent sawmills to save on lumber. She's also traded materials with neighbours.
"It saved us more than 50 per cent on the decking, and it's the same quality as at Lumberworld and Home Depot," says Ms. Tacoma.
"I have no problem paying taxes," she adds. "Taxes don't turn me off, but I'd much rather pay taxes on $1,000 than $2,200."
North Vancouver contractor Aaron MacNabb says the only reason he's doing a major renovation on his newly purchased 1970s townhouse now is because he has a six-month old daughter and he doesn't want her living in a home that might contain asbestos in the walls.
"But if we had no chance of asbestos, or my wife and daughter could go visit family for a month, then yeah, we might as well put it off and not pay extra," says Mr. MacNabb.
"But for me, I'm not too bad off anyway, because I'm a contractor myself, and I get reasonably good discounts."
But for consumers with less purchasing power, he says they will opt to buy off Craigslist, or make cash deals for cheaper materials and labour.
"If you are willing to pay cash, there is that black market of stuff out there. That will probably happen more and more."
Kim Sanderson, who just purchased a house in White Rock, says she'll be buying off Craigslist for her renovation, and going to the U.S. to shop.
"I'm buying tons from Craigslist," says Ms. Sanderson, who's doing a kitchen renovation. "I just got a new stove, fridge, dishwasher, everything all on Craigslist - so no tax.
"And if we shop in the U.S., we still have to pay HST, but the price difference is probably a good 30- to 40-per cent cheaper for exactly the same item."
Peter Simpson, president of the Greater Vancouver Home Builders' Association, says the consumer avoidance of the HST and ongoing uncertainty will have a huge impact on his industry.
The HST only affects new home purchases that are more than $525,000, which is still significant in a pricey city like Vancouver. It is also added to home-buying services, such as realtor and lawyer fees. Mr. Simpson knows of a $50 million project already put on hold by one developer who wanted to remain nameless.
"We are getting emails from builders around the province saying how it's affected them, and it's all pointing towards this lack of certainty on the transition rules. They are telling us is that home buyers are going to sit on their wallets until more clarity is provided."
Condo marketer Bob Rennie says consumer reluctance will worsen closer to the transition date.
"I think for standing new inventory in the $2-million range, it's being questioned right now, and as we get to six months before the transition date, nobody is going to make a purchase unless the difference between HST and GST is included," says Mr. Rennie.
Another concern for renovation contractors, says Mr. Simpson, is that consumers will only do essential jobs in the next year.
"As far as renos go, consumers might fix a leaky roof right now, but they might think twice if it means saving thousands of dollars for a new kitchen if they wait until after the elimination of the HST."
Mr. Simpson says the situation could also push homeowners into hiring black market labour, putting consumers at risk of shoddy workmanship. As well, without a contract, homeowners become responsible for on-the-job injury that would otherwise be covered by a contractor's insurance.
"Consumers are very hesitant, and it will cause this ripple effect throughout the whole industry. It's not just going to affect contractors. It will also affect local manufacturing facilities that produce doors and flooring, and windows, and everything else."
His organization represents 70,000 jobs, he says, including the work that would come out of 16,300 total housing starts expected by the end of the year. That figure represents only metro Vancouver, not all of B.C.
"Those jobs will generate about $3.5 billion in wages, so it's a big industry in Greater Vancouver alone."
However, a recent Central 1 Credit Union news release forecasted that new home sales would go down as consumers hold off on purchases until 2013. And 2011 is expected to close out with a drop in new home purchases of 26 per cent. However, part of that reason may be due to supply - according to Mr. Rennie, the number of new condos built in downtown Vancouver in 2007 totaled 3,300 units. In 2012 in downtown Vancouver, only 604 new condos will be built, he says.
Another issue that needs to be addressed, says Mr. Rennie, is whether the HST will be applied to a presale condo that is purchased now but completed after the transition date.

Full text: Mayor calls agreement leaving Waterfront Toronto in charge a 'win-win for everybody'
Mayor Rob Ford has ended his bid to seize control of development on the Port Lands, painting it not as a defeat for his administration, but a "win-win for everybody."
There was no talk of Ferris wheels or megamalls - just consensus - as city council gave unanimous support Wednesday to the existing plans for revitalizing the 180 hectares at the mouth of the Don River under a new agreement designed to foster collaboration and speed development.
The show of unity was the result of two weeks of late-night meetings among Ford loyalists and the two local councillors aimed at finding a solution to the mayor's unhappiness with the status quo and the public outrage provoked by the alternative - a vision promoted by the mayor and his brother, Councillor Doug Ford.
Even before the vote was taken on the council floor, the mayor tried to cast the retreat as a victory for everyone.
"I don't think it was a change of heart," the mayor said. "The taxpayers have spoken. I've listened to the taxpayers. This is what they want. This is a win-win for everybody."
Mr. Ford said he does not listen to critics, who he said one moment call him a bully and then say he can't build
consensus.
"I'm very proud," he said. "I just can't wait to see the vote. Some people are going to have to eat their words."
The new agreement leaves control of developing the Port Lands in the hands of Waterfront Toronto, the three-government agency created a decade ago to redevelop the derelict stretch of harbour. In return, Waterfront Toronto and the city have agreed to review the existing environmental assessment for the mouth of the Don River and to look at the costs of all the options included in that document.
Council also asked the city manager to provide a business plan for the area in six to eight months.
The plan favoured by Waterfront Toronto - and approved by the former city council last year - would see a new mouth created for the Don River, which now ends in a stagnant channel.
Doug Ford and his brother attacked that plan for moving too slowly and said it failed to make the most of prime city-owned real estate, presenting their alternative with the help of glitzy conceptual drawings paid for by a city agency without council's consent. Their vision - hatched without public input - placed a retail centre where the mouth of the river was to go. The proposal and the fact that it sprang forth after private meetings with real estate developers, prompted a huge public outcry and led some of the mayor's allies to break ranks.
Realizing the plan would never get the support it needed in council, the "consensus" plan was developed and the talkative Doug Ford, who stayed silent Wednesday, had to give up his efforts.
"Everyone wants us to work together and sing Kumbaya , so we're going to work together with them," he told The Globe and Mail earlier this week.
After the decision, many councillors stood and clapped for members of the public watching the vote, and the mayor walked over to shake his brother's hand. A few bars of Kumbaya also rang out in the chamber.
"We are certainly pleased with the confidence that council has expressed in Waterfront Toronto," the agency's leader, John Campbell, said. "We heard them. They want things to move faster and we do as well. And we are open to new ideas."
"It's a great victory because it's a consensus and it's a consensus of Torontonians, not just council," said Pam McConnell, one of the four councillors, including Paula Fletcher, Michael Thompson and Peter Milczyn, who worked on the agreement.
Mr. Milczyn predicted there could now be cranes on the Port Lands in five to 10 years rather than 25 as first planned.

The dangers of ultra-low rates

Author: Hutchinson, Martin

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/dangers-ultra-low-rates/docview/893657465/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: This revives the need for excessive leverage in the quest for yield. It also pushes borrowing into the shadow banking system, a shift exacerbated by added regulation of more traditional lenders. Though the current economic recovery is lagging the trajectory of the last 14 credit cycles, according to the IMF, no other stretch has seen corporate spreads narrow so quickly - since the 1930s.

Full text: The International Monetary Fund has issued a timely warning about ultra-low interest rates. Just as the Federal Open Market Committee contemplates further easing, a new report from the Fund on Wednesday lays out the multiple threats created by such loose monetary policy. In rich nations, small firms suffer while in emerging markets, capital inflows produce bubble conditions.
Ben Bernanke and his colleagues should pay heed.
For starters, the IMF's "Global Financial Stability Report" identifies, rather significantly, how the credit cycle has been dangerously disrupted with the abundance of money. Real interest rates historically track at around 1 per cent whenever spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds hit current levels. Given how much lower rates are today, investors are struggling to meet their return hurdles.
This revives the need for excessive leverage in the quest for yield. It also pushes borrowing into the shadow banking system, a shift exacerbated by added regulation of more traditional lenders. Though the current economic recovery is lagging the trajectory of the last 14 credit cycles, according to the IMF, no other stretch has seen corporate spreads narrow so quickly - since the 1930s. Moreover, as markets trump banks for funding, the fortunes of small firms, the primary engines of job growth, increasingly diverge from those of larger rivals.
In developing countries, meanwhile, the rapid influx of money created by ultra-low rates jolts asset prices upward. Chinese real estate companies, for example, have been particularly active in international bond markets as domestic credit conditions have tightened.
The phenomenon is compounded when domestic monetary policy is similarly loose. Even without any shock, the IMF forecasts a sharp rise in non-performing loans in Asia and Latin America - and a correlating decline in the capitalization of local banks.
This backdrop should help frame the Fed's contemplation of fresh ways to intervene, including by possibly trying to reduce long-term interest rates. But as U.S. central bankers fixate on helping America recover, the broader consequences of their actions, both at home and abroad, deserve considerably more attention.

Crombie edges out Parrish in Mississauga

Author: Morrow, Adrian

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/crombie-edges-out-parrish-mississauga/docview/892552795/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Ms. [Carolyn Parrish]'s presence in the race drew an unusual level of attention for a municipal by-election. Best known as an MP for her vocal opposition to the United States invasion of Iraq in 2003 - in one famous incident, she stomped on a figurine of George W. Bush on national television - she subsequently spent a term on Mississauga's city council, where she led the push for a judicial inquiry into Mayor Hazel McCallion's involvement in a controversial land deal.

Full text: The race for a Mississauga city council seat ultimately became a battle between two former Liberal members of Parliament, with Bonnie Crombie edging out Carolyn Parrish by slightly more than 200 votes. The result is both a major setback to the career of long-time politician Ms. Parrish and a boon to the city's mayor, who gains a trusted council ally.
Ms. Crombie won Ward 5 with 21.5 per cent of the vote, against Ms. Parrish's 19.4. Real estate agent Simmer Kaur took 14.4 per cent and Peter Adams, husband of the area's former councillor Eve Adams, 11.7 per cent.
Ms. Parrish's presence in the race drew an unusual level of attention for a municipal by-election. Best known as an MP for her vocal opposition to the United States invasion of Iraq in 2003 - in one famous incident, she stomped on a figurine of George W. Bush on national television - she subsequently spent a term on Mississauga's city council, where she led the push for a judicial inquiry into Mayor Hazel McCallion's involvement in a controversial land deal.
Ms. McCallion campaigned against her in last year's municipal election, which saw Ms. Parrish go down to defeat. By contrast, the city's long-time leader is close to Ms. Crombie.
"The residents chose someone who would support council and support the mayor," Ms. Crombie said during her raucous victory party at a local bar, which the mayor attended. "I think that was the difference."
Ms. Parrish, for her part, did not immediately attend her election night party. When news photographers approached her in her campaign office, she instructed them to leave.
While Ms. McCallion did not formally endorse anyone, her association with Ms. Crombie was well-known: The mayor backed Ms. Crombie's last federal campaign earlier this year; when she was defeated in that vote, the mayor spoke with her on different occasions to ask her whether she would run for council; after an all-candidates debate during the campaign, the pair drove off together in the same car with the mayor behind the wheel.
Ms. Crombie's campaign, meanwhile, distributed leaflets containing a laudatory quote from Ms. McCallion and she benefited from the help of the mayor's supporters in fighting the election on the ground. It also helped that Ms. Adams, who voted with Ms. Parrish on council, did not put her organization in the ward to work for her old ally.
"In the short-term, [Ms. McCallion's] opposition will be demoralized," said Tom Urbaniak, an expert on local politics. "There will be a sense that the person who has the mayor's anointment will be successful in a Mississauga election."

A modern rethink of life in the 'burbs

Abstract: "People will go, 'Well, last winter it cost me $1,000 to heat my home. This winter it's going to be $3,500 ... I don't want that.' I think a lot of those homes are just going to lose their value because it's really hard to heat a house that is stupidly big."

Full text:   Films question an 'old-fashioned' lifestyle
The suburbs have taken a major bashing these last few years.
Could there be anything less fashionable in this age of new urbanism than a subdivision with two-car garages, porch-less homes, and a winding series of driveways that empty onto streets bereft of sidewalks and people?
The new thinking is that we should reconsider our entitlement to 3,000-square-foot houses and big cars, and Toronto documentary maker Gregory Greene explores that topic in his award-winning The End of Suburbia and its follow-up, The Resilient City . Mr. Greene presents The End of Suburbia at New York's BMW Guggenheim Lab in early October. With Vancouver urban issues writer Charles Montgomery representing Canada on the Guggenheim Lab team, the interactive exhibit launched this summer in Manhattan's East Village, with a lot of local press attention. It's devoted to studying all aspects of urban density - and its antithesis, suburban sprawl, as part of a mobile lab that will travel to nine major cities in six years. It leaves Manhattan on Oct. 16 and travels to Berlin, then Mumbai.
Mr. Greene's films look at the rising costs of fuel and the impact that cost will have on living far from urban centres, as well as the growing potential for shocks to the system, what with major population growth.
He says that if the suburbs are to survive, they will need to run as self-sufficient communities with excellent transit, instead of the old car-dependent subdivision.
And if the U.S. example is any indication, the era of the old-fashioned, entitled suburban lifestyle is coming to a close. We've already heard the news reports of suburban spots like Windy Ridge, in North Carolina, and Franklin Reserve, in California, sitting half empty and susceptible to looting.
"The suburbs in the U.S. are collapsing," says Mr. Greene. "If you look at the housing crisis that started in 2008, it was a suburban housing crisis. It happened when oil went to $147 a barrel. Basically, the less urban density, the greater the housing crisis."
Mr. Greene believes certain Canadian suburbs could also turn into ghost towns, especially those without decent transit, which would be made vulnerable by their dependence on the car. Monster homes, too, will become too expensive to heat.
"People will go, 'Well, last winter it cost me $1,000 to heat my home. This winter it's going to be $3,500 ... I don't want that.' I think a lot of those homes are just going to lose their value because it's really hard to heat a house that is stupidly big."
And yet, despite the high price of fuel, the Canadian suburbs appear to be thriving.
"The suburbs in Canada are definitely thriving," says Mr. Greene. "But Canadians are at record levels of debt ... The possibility of a recession could really affect the suburbs because people would want those transit options, and they are going to be moving away from large-scale housing that they saw as an entitlement to middle-class living."
A new HGTV Canada show that capitalizes on the very topic, Urban Suburban , premiered Wednesday. The show, produced by Vancouver's Force Four Productions, involves homebuyers choosing between the big life in the 'burbs, or the contained life in the city. Life in the 'burbs is still part of the natural evolution for many Canadians says Sarah Daniels, who co-hosts the show with brother Philip DuMoulin. Both hosts are real-life realtors. Consumers want more space for their dollar as they move along in life, says Ms. Daniels. That means moving further away from the urban core.
A homebuyer might start with a one-bedroom in Yaletown, but once the kids come along, they move out to Delta.
"White Rock is a high-demand area, especially for overseas buyers. They are looking for more value," says Ms. Daniels. "They love the west side and the North Shore, but they are getting more bang for their buck in South Surrey and White Rock. The market for larger homes has gone bananas."
Real estate marketers have already been responding to the demand for suburban change. In South Surrey, the newly launched 12-hectare Morgan Crossing aims to create a village-like atmosphere with housing, walkways, shops and amenities that mean residents don't need to drive elsewhere.
Vikram Vij, Vancouver's internationally acclaimed restaurateur, has announced he will open a restaurant at Morgan Crossing, a sure sign that the former suburb is becoming more cosmopolitan.
"Not everybody is working downtown anymore," adds Ms. Daniels. "With telecommuting, people are much more able to work around their own schedule."
When Canada Lands Company planning director Randy Fasan transformed former military housing in Chilliwack, B.C., into commercial housing, he made sure that at-home business was allowable.
The Chilliwack project, called Garrison Crossing, is an experiment in sustainable design, an effort in "new urbanism" to keep residents from clocking miles on the road and spending more time in their own community. As well, it's an effort to move away from soul-destroying homogeneity of the typical subdivision. The company went to lengths to ensure that their smaller houses would have distinctive, individual designs and include the long-forgotten front porch. They also kept the 60-year-old trees on the 153-acre site.
When it's complete, Garrison Crossing will house about 3,500 people, and include 80,000 square feet of commercial space, including space for dental and medical offices, nine acres of park and an aquatic centre.
Mr. Greene says that it's not a matter of everybody up and moving away from their suburban homes, either. They simply need to lobby for better transit and walkability.
A walkable community will be a desirable community in the long-term.
Former suburbs such as Mississauga, Scarborough, Markham and Surrey, B.C., are sprouting downtown cores. There are condo towers, public transit, and places to walk with ease.
"In the fifties, the premium lifestyle was getting in your car and going from suburb to work zone, and that's shifted," he says. "The premium now is on walkability. Now we're seeing people with money buying properties where they can walk to work.
"Neighbourhoods that don't get really decent transit options are really going to fall in value in the next 10 years."

Healthy profits from the healthy berry

Author: Ebner, David

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/healthy-profits-berry/docview/888334458/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Bruce Holub, professor emeritus of human health and nutritional sciences at the University of Guelph, was a key blueberry researcher. In 2002, he published work in the British Journal of Nutrition that showed wild blueberries could bolster antioxidants in humans, potentially an aid against many chronic degenerative diseases. Yet definitive links have yet to be shown, noted Prof. Holub. "If you're marketing blueberries, you use what you can. We don't know yet," Prof.

Full text:   As an antioxidant, the blueberry has risen in the popular consciousness, but maintaining the boom in sales faces challenges
Fifteen years ago, Parmjit Bains looked into the future of farming east of Vancouver and saw fields of blueberries.
The fertile soil along the banks of the Fraser River had long produced a bounty of grains and hay. But new soil technology held the promise of being able to cultivate vast tracts of blueberries, a fussy fruit that demands precise conditions. Mr. Bains set up shop as a processor on his farm just north of Abbotsford - founding Westberry Farms Ltd. A year later, a United States Department of Agriculture scientist delivered influential research that suggested blueberries combatted the effects of aging.
Demand began to percolate and a string of research projects elevated blueberries in the popular consciousness to the status of "super food." A boom was born: Canadian farms sold $149-million worth of blueberries in 2010 - overtaking apples, the perennial leader, which sold $142-million worth. Blueberries are also by far the country's top fruit and vegetable export, accounting for more than half of $400-million in exports last year.
In agriculture, with its constant battles with failed crops, severe weather and too-low prices, blueberries are one of the industry's great success stories. But even as the business flourishes, competition is intensifying, as domestic and global supply increases. Farmers and producers from the Fraser Valley to Quebec's Saguenay and Nova Scotia's Cumberland County face increased exports outside North America, especially as demand in the key U.S. market languishes, with Canadian exports down by a fifth since 2008.
"Blueberries are like any commodity, like lumber," said Mr. Bains, 57, co-owner of Westberry Farms, which employs more than 100 during the peak summer season.
"It's important to not depend too much on the U.S. Blueberries are a success story. But with all this product coming, we need to step outside North America."
There are two sides to the blueberry business. Cultivated berries, the fat plump kind consumers buy fresh in the months of August and September, are the domain of the Fraser Valley in Canada. Wild blueberries, smaller, and with a punchier healthy antioxidant kick, grow in Quebec and Nova Scotia, where the fruit is harvested for the year-round frozen market. Both wild and cultivated berries also go to other uses such juices and yogurt.
At Westberry Farms in mid-August, the bright summer sun beats down, ripening and sweetening plump blueberries as seasonal workers pick the fruit for the valuable fresh market. Near the fields, a processing facility operates at full tilt, handling the output of Mr. Bains's 30 hectares and the production from another 360 or so hectares in the valley, making him one of the top operators. There are about 700 growers in the region, most of them small-scale. The largest is Golden Eagle, owned by Vancouver's Aquilini Investment Group, which made its money in real estate and also owns the Canucks hockey team.
Westberry has poured money into technology to keep pace with rivals. The company does about $8-million in annual revenue, up from $500,000 when it started in 1997. Several years ago Mr. Bains added machines to automatically fold cardboard boxes to ship plastic packets of blueberries. Workers used to fold five boxes per minute. The machines, which cost $100,000 each, do 30. Last year, Westberry installed the latest sorting-weighing technology. A computer scans blueberries fed on to a conveyor, excising fruit that does not meet standards of colour and firmness, and then the machine packs them in plastic at precise weights.
The technology complements a natural advantage: Local growers believe the terroir of the Fraser Valley is to blueberries as France's Bordeaux is to wine. But being an hour east of Vancouver, the land does not come cheap. It is triple the cost of acreage in competing Washington State and six times that of land in Michigan, the top producer of berries in the U.S.
One-quarter of Westberry's production is exported. Mr. Bains sees opportunity in Asia, like the energy industry, which aims to send China and other countries oil and natural gas to score higher prices. Small shipments of fresh blueberries are already bring shipped to China through Hong Kong and fetch $20 a pound - five times what they cost in a grocery store in Vancouver. The federal government has worked to open South Korea and China to fresh exports, a grinding process that began several years ago. "This takes time," said Farid Makki, a market development adviser at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.
Demand in Asia could be significant, where the emerging middle class is spending on higher-quality foods. Exports to South Korea in the first five months of 2011 have already exceeded the value shipped in all of 2010 - but at roughly $3-million, it is still tiny compared with annual exports to the U.S. of about $150-million. Exports to China are also rising sharply, but this year are only on pace to barely reach $10-million. Opening Asian markets to fresh berries will be essential, similar to Canadian governments' work to stoke the market in China for lumber.
The pressure to find new customers is fierce. Similar to Canada, U.S. production is up 50 per cent in the past six years. Industry also eyes Chile, where production has more than quadrupled in the same span and now exceeds the prolific Fraser Valley.
Farmers have all rushed to sate demand that has been cultivated by what industry calls the "healthy halo" of blueberries. "It's the best marketing tool we have," said Debbie Etsell, executive director of the B.C. Blueberry Council.
The blueberry industry continues to market the oomph of its product, and fund additional research. The immediate concern is whether supply of the fruit once again overtakes demand and sinks prices, which have recovered sharply in the past two years. Views differ, given the prospects of a weak global economy, especially in the U.S.
At Oxford Frozen Foods Ltd. in Oxford, N.S., Matthew Bragg isn't worried about a weak economy. "We don't see demand slowing down," said Mr. Bragg, vice-president of sales at Oxford and son of family patriarch John, who turned blueberry profits into an Atlantic Canada telecom fortune at EastLink.
At Senco Inc., in Saint-Felicien, Que., near Chicoutimi in the Saguenay, the mood is positive but more uncertain. Last year's crop was largely destroyed by cold weather, an additional blow beyond the wild swings in recent prices.
"I'm happy about business," said Jean-Eudes Senneville, president of Senco.
"But there is no doubt that with the increase of worldwide production, we expect the market will be more difficult."

BLUEBERRIES
History
Blueberries are native to North America. French explorer Samuel de Champlain took note of first nations harvesting wild blueberries along Lake Huron in the early seventeenth century. In the 1910s, Elizabeth White of New Jersey saw potential to cultivate blueberries and enlisted Frederick Coville, who was chief botanist of the United States Department of Agriculture and had discovered the relation of soil acidity to growing blueberries. By 1916, they succeeded.
Science
Bruce Holub, professor emeritus of human health and nutritional sciences at the University of Guelph, was a key blueberry researcher. In 2002, he published work in the British Journal of Nutrition that showed wild blueberries could bolster antioxidants in humans, potentially an aid against many chronic degenerative diseases. Yet definitive links have yet to be shown, noted Prof. Holub. "If you're marketing blueberries, you use what you can. We don't know yet," Prof. Holub said. "I wouldn't put my money on just one specific fruit."

Abstract: How Mohamed Nasheed, the president of the Maldive Islands in the Indian Ocean, can ever crack a smile is amazing. A democracy advocate and political prisoner who was tortured, he says, under the country's previous autocracy, Nasheed took office Vaclav Havel-style, as the embodiment of a promising future, only to face an even more dire task. He must save the Maldives from rising sea levels caused by climate change, or the low-lying islands may completely disappear in our lifetime.

Full text:   The following short reviews of films screening this weekend at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival are by Rick Groen, Liam Lacey, Gayle MacDonald and Dave McGinn. Star ratings are on a scale of zero to four .
The Descendants
Alexander Payne (USA)
****
George Clooney stars in Oscar-winning director Alexander Payne's ( Sideways ) heartwarming, tragic and, at times, hilariously funny drama (adapted from Kaui Hart Hemmings's novel) about a middle-aged father and husband whose seeming idyllic life in Hawaii has been thrown into chaos by a boating accident that has left his thrill-seeking wife in a coma, fighting for her life. Clooney is the harried Matt King, a work-obsessed real-estate lawyer whose relationship with his wife has been strained, and drifting, for years. After the accident, King is faced with trying to fix a broken household where two teenage daughters - both angry and grappling to figure out how to reconnect with their one remaining parent - struggle to remain a loving family unit. Clooney and the elder daughter (Shailene Woodley) give Oscar-worthy performances in this hard-knocks film that will have you laughing one moment, sobbing the next. G.M.
Sept. 10, 6 p.m., Elgin; Sept. 11, 12:30 p.m., Winter Garden; Sept. 17, 11 a.m., Elgin .
The Artist
Michel Hazanavicius (France)
****
Black-and-white and mostly silent, this Cannes crowd-pleaser is an homage to the movies when the screen was still silver. Mixing French stars Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo with an American cast (John Goodman, James Cromwell and Penelope Ann Miller) this twenties-set fantasy follows a Douglas Fairbanks-like dashing movie star, George Valentin (Dujardin), adored by women and accompanied by his clever Jack Russell terrier. But George becomes a has-been when the talkies arrive, until he's helped out by an ingenue, Peppy Miller (Bejo). With elements of A Star Is Born and Singing in the Rain, The Artist is a rarity, an ingenious crowd-pleaser. L.L.
Sept. 10, 10 a.m., Lightbox 2 .
A Dangerous Method
David Cronenberg (France/Ireland/U.K./Germany/Canada)
***
Two outings after A History of Violence , David Cronenberg explores the history of sex, at least as filtered through the psychoanalytic minds of Messrs. Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) and Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender). Set in Europe at the dawn of the 20th century, the story tracks the meeting of those two minds, then their fractious parting. En route, the dialectic pits the rigorous science, and surprisingly dry wit, of Freud against the earnest mysticism of Jung, who struggles to balance a primal relationship with a troubled patient (an overwrought Keira Knightley) and the banal conventions of marriage to his rich wife. The performances are generally solid and the dance of ideas engaging, but the result feels a bit slight by Cronenbergian standards, or perhaps it's just playful. Either way, you'll exit the theatre reminded anew that a cigar, the one you can't smoke anywhere any more, is never just a cigar. R.G.
Sept. 10, 6:30 p.m., Roy Thomson; Sept. 12, 4:45 p.m., Lightbox 1 .
Shame
Steve McQueen (U.K.)
***
Following his penchant for one-word titles, McQueen examines a New York man's hunger for sex, the loveless brand purchased from prostitutes or viewed on porn sites or garnered from libidinous femmes in trendy bars. In the frank nudity here, the debts to Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris and most anything by Catherine Breillat are obvious. Certainly the picture packs all the intensity of McQueen's debut in Hunger , but it lacks the same rich thematic resonance. Still, his manipulation of the camera, his marriage of sight to sound, his ability to advance the narrative without dialogue, are a joy to watch. What's more, it's fascinating to compare Michael Fassbender's lead performance here with his work as Carl Jung in David Cronenberg's A Dangerous Method - similar primal appetites but such a vastly different style. R.G.
Sept. 11, 7 p.m., Princess of Wales; Sept. 13, 3:15 p.m., Lightbox 1 .
The Eye of the Storm
Fred Schepisi (Australia)
***
In this adaptation of Patrick White's novel, director Fred Schepisi ( Six Degrees of Separation ) forgoes dramatic tempests and instead offers several fine, highly controlled performances. Elizabeth Hunter (Charlotte Rampling) may be approaching death as she is tended to by servants in her mansion, but she is as capable as ever of manipulating those around her. When her children, Basil (Geoffrey Rush) and Dorothy (Judy Davis) come from abroad to visit Elizabeth on her deathbed, the bitterness and dysfunction that have always characterized their relationships slowly reveal themselves. D.M.
Sept. 11, 4:30 p.m., Winter Garden; Sept. 13, 2:30 p.m., AMC 6.
In Darkness
Agnieszka Holland (Canada/Germany/Poland)
***
In darkness, indeed. Much of this film unfolds beneath the cobbled streets of wartime Lvov, down within the murk and rat-infested mire. There, a Polish sewer worker, Catholic in religion and anti-Semitic in attitude, hides a small group of Jews from both the occupying Nazis and their local allies. Initially, his lone motive is money - the hidden are paying him well for their rancid sanctuary. But, over the months, a human bond develops and, even in the depth of the sewers, he begins to see the moral light. Yes, the screenplay is a bit too schematic and symbolically convenient (the Jews' refuge lies directly under a church), but Holland's direction is unflinchingly graphic. Poland in that period was a maelstrom of shifting alliances and conflicting tensions, yet she fuses the separate strands of the narrative - a suspenseful tale of jeopardy and a study in situation ethics - into a compelling, if not always convincing, portrait of shared peril. R.G.
Sept. 11, 6 p.m., Elgin; Sept. 12, 3:30 p.m., Scotiabank 3 .
Miss Bala
Gerardo Naranjo (Mexico)
***
Blinkered innocence is the sole point of view, corrupt and deadly experience is the sole content. The whole film unfolds from the perspective of a naive Tijuana teenager who, after signing up for the local beauty pageant, finds herself in the wrong place at the wrong time - witness to a night-club massacre perpetrated by a gang of narcos. She does the sensible thing and goes to a cop but, in Naranjo's take on Mexican society, sense is an endangered commodity - the cop leads her straight to the gang's vicious leader. What follows is an always violent, often surreal ride through the thickets of widespread corruption, with the audience sometimes left as confused and disoriented as the poor girl. But there's no mistaking the moral of this amoral tale: Even when innocence is crowned, injustice reigns. R.G.
Sept. 11, 9:15 p.m., Scotiabank 4; Sept. 12, 2:45 p.m., AMC 3 .
The Ides of March
George Clooney (USA)
***
Set over the course of a crucial presidential primary in Ohio, this is designed as a political exposé in the back-room tradition of The Candidate or The Best Man , the kind where idealism is the victim and pragmatism the rule. Working both before and behind the camera, Clooney plays a Democrat with impeccable liberal credentials (hardly a stretch), but the bulk of the camera time goes to Ryan Gosling as his press secretary, prowling that back room in the company of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti. The dialogue is smart, crisp and witty and, given the quorum of talent, it's not surprising that the performances are superb. What is surprising, and disappointing, is that the plot borrows, not once but twice, from the hoariest tropes in the book of smug cliches. The effect is to cheapen all the hard-earned realism. Contemporary American politics does a fine job of cheapening itself - the script doesn't need this melodramatic varnish. R.G.
Sept. 10, 11 a.m., Elgin .
Drive
Nicolas Winding Refn (USA)
***½
Tense car chases, action scenes handled with crisp panache and Canadian actor Ryan Gosling channelling Steve McQueen as an existential wheel man add up to make Drive one of the best arty-action films since Steven Soderbergh's The Limey . Gosling's character - a stunt driver by day, a getaway man by night - and his ambitious manager (Bryan Cranston) get involved with some bad people, Albert Brooks playing a razor-wielding thug/movie producer and Ron Perlman as his nastier partner. True to its seventies genre roots, the plot is enthusiastically pulpy, with the hero compelled to protect a young mother (Carey Mulligan) while battling his enemies. L.L.
Sept. 10, 9:15 p.m., Ryerson; Sept. 11, 9 a.m., Lightbox 1 .
Keyhole
Guy Maddin (Canada)
***
A story of marital breakdown and the fight for reconciliation takes on an archetypal, absurd and delirious surface in Guy Maddin's latest black-and-white dream movie. It starts out like Key Largo - gangsters and gagged hostages holed up together - and then transforms into a haunted-house version of Ulysses's home-coming. That's Ulysses Pick (an excellent Jason Patric), a gangster boss, carrying a drowned (but somehow alive) girl over his shoulder as he arrives back at his ramshackle house There, a naked old man, or possible deity (played by Louis Negin, he's also the narrator), is chained to the bed of his daughter Hyacinth (Isabella Rossellini), who is also Ulysses's estranged wife. L.L.
Sept. 11, 12:30 p.m., AMC 3 .
The Island President
Jon Shenk (USA)
***
How Mohamed Nasheed, the president of the Maldive Islands in the Indian Ocean, can ever crack a smile is amazing. A democracy advocate and political prisoner who was tortured, he says, under the country's previous autocracy, Nasheed took office Vaclav Havel-style, as the embodiment of a promising future, only to face an even more dire task. He must save the Maldives from rising sea levels caused by climate change, or the low-lying islands may completely disappear in our lifetime. It is real - the shoreline is eroding before the Maldivians' eyes. After a thorough recounting of Nasheed's activist past, the documentary switches into far more revealing straight reportage, as it follows the president's meetings with other world leaders and negotiators in an effort to set any kind of commitment to greenhouse-gas reduction at the 2009 Copenhagen climate conference. The film's examination of how these talks work (and fail) is vital information, politically and historically. And throughout, Nasheed rides on optimism. His sinking island paradise of a nation depends on it. G.D.
Sept. 10, 6:30 p.m., Lightbox 2 .
Afghan Luke
Mike Clattenburg (Canada)
*
Trailer Park Boys director Mike Clattenburg moves to a larger canvas - the Afghanistan war - for this black comedy about journalistic cover-ups, hashish and corpse mutilation. Targeting the same absurdist, sardonic mode as David O. Russell's Three Kings , the movie feels several drafts short of a tight script. Two Canadian reporters (Nick Stahl and Nicolas Wright) return to Afghanistan when an editor spikes a story about a Canadian sharpshooter cutting off his victims' fingers. Shot in the British Columbia interior substituting for Central Asia, the movie features a collection of cartoonish figures - a chirpy native guide, an airhead camp follower and a fashionable warlord who wants to help his nephew break into rap music - that fail to be even interestingly offensive. L.L.

Abstract: "There's a big gap now between full market housing and non-market housing," says Mr. [Robert Fung]. "And I think there's a real need for stuff that starts to fill that gap, that isn't social housing, but also isn't $700 per square foot. It doesn't cost $350,000 for 500 square feet, like you'd see in Yaletown.

Full text:   Developer Robert Fung takes on his most challenging project yet - deep in the heart of the gritty Downtown Eastside
While a dozen or more drug dealers brazenly do business in an alley off Carrall Street, developer Robert Fung dodges the dealing to get to the makeshift entryway of his latest condo project.
The development at 370 Carrall is a small project called 21 Doors, a simple reference to the number of units. Mr. Fung, whose company Salient Group has contributed greatly to the changing face of Gastown, is developing the 1980s building that had sat mostly vacant and dilapidated for many years. It had been built pre-Expo with intentions of being sold off as condos, but the building had only ever been used as rental.
The bank that owns the four-storey building, which includes one floor of retail and three for residential, has given Mr. Fung carte blanche to do what is necessary to develop condos that will be attractive to buyers, without offending the tightly knit downtown eastside community. The project, which is going to be priced relatively low for Vancouver, should be seen as a major improvement to what was previously there, says Mr. Fung.
"By the time the current owner got involved, there were only six units occupied," he says, standing in a freshly dry-walled unit with a view of the street below. "Put it this way. They were very low-end apartments, the equivalent of a rooming house and not being well managed at that time. It was not humane housing."
There had been previous attempts to revitalize the building as either market or non-market housing, but those fell through. The approach here is to fulfill a housing gap that exists in most popular Vancouver neighbourhoods. Starting at $209,900 for the smallest studio unit, the price point is reasonable for a condo that is situated on the edge of one of Vancouver's trendiest areas. The two-bedroom units are at the top end, priced at around $380,000. The studio, one and two bedroom units go on the market on Oct. 15, and construction is expected to be complete by November.
"There's a big gap now between full market housing and non-market housing," says Mr. Fung. "And I think there's a real need for stuff that starts to fill that gap, that isn't social housing, but also isn't $700 per square foot. It doesn't cost $350,000 for 500 square feet, like you'd see in Yaletown.
"This is really 'small A' affordable housing. It's much more affordable than our other product. The unit sizes are small but livable."
The reason prices can remain relatively low is because it's a pre-existing building that is solidly built from concrete and steel. So far the exterior brick has been painted a clean white, new windows have been installed and the interior has been completely gutted and the old-fashioned layouts have been reworked into a more contemporary style. Every unit has windows facing both an original interior courtyard and the street.
The small L-shaped courtyard is a rarity that will give an instant communal feeling to the small residence. Once finished, the courtyard will have at its centre a long outdoor table. And a new sandblasted concrete wall will give modern juxtaposition to the old brick wall next door. In keeping with Salient projects that have open kitchen and living areas, the 21 Doors project will have similar open floor plans, but the bedrooms will be enclosed. The retail level windows, formerly covered with security grills, will be big and open to the street.
The idea is to create a building that is open to the community, not shut off from it. Considering that it's located at one of the busiest corners for the drug trade, it remains to be seen whether a nice new building will oust the drug pushers from the area.
"We want to do homes for people who actually work in the area and understand the neighbourhood and aren't there because they are expecting it to change," says Mr. Fung. "This isn't just for people who are coming in, looking for a cool, trendy neighbourhood. A low-income community is part of what makes it great. We are not looking to displace it.
"But another positive change I think is the open drug trade, to not have it there on that corner. These [dealers] do not for the most part live in the neighbourhood."
Mr. Fung isn't the first to attempt transformation of the street. Across from 21 Doors is the newly renovated Rainier Hotel, with the spacious old-world charm of Nelson the Seagull café. It was immediately successful when it opened in May, the sort of place that attracts young urban types who drink espresso while they work on their laptops.
Of course, the less urban-minded would see the drug trade and poverty before they'd see the hipster-hangout across the way. But as the Woodward's Building has already proved, a younger demographic is eager to move in.
Back in the day, it was the Army & Navy discount store that pulled people to Gastown - today a rash of top-end eateries makes it a destination neighbourhood. As well, there are little galleries and boutique stores that are popping up, giving it a charm not to be found on oppressively expensive Robson Street.
Restaurateur Sean Heather has been running various food operations around Gastown for the last 15 years. He knows the area well.
"I'm a big fan of putting normal things on corners like bakeries, because drug users need to be looked after. The dealers do not. And they don't like normal activity because it makes them look abnormal."
He isn't certain if that corner will clean up in the near future, but he knows that Mr. Fung "can make a silk purse out of a sow's ear."
Mr. Heather is also venturing further into the less trendy areas of Gastown, where rents are lower and the challenge is greater.
He's currently got a total of eight food establishments on the go, including the upcoming Bitter, a beer-centric restaurant set to open on Oct. 17 on West Hastings, around the corner from 21 Doors. In January, he expects to open the Rainier Delicatessen, the last commercial space to be rented in the Rainier Hotel building. It is a prime corner unit, with original tile floors and plaster ceilings. In collaboration with local suppliers, he will sell olives, cured meats, and virgin olive oil poured straight from the barrel.
He also runs Penn, a wholesale bakery in the bottom of the Pennsylvania Hotel on Hastings at Carrall, which provides the baked goods for his operations. One day, he intends to open the bakery as a retail operation. Mr. Heather has seen the rents soar in his time in Gastown.
"It's hitting critical mass," he says. "I don't know that we can go any higher.
"When I came to Gastown 15 years ago, I was paying $12 or $13 a square foot. Now, for the same area, you're looking at $44 along Water Street. It goes down as you go towards Nelson the Seagull."
As to whether he fears the arrival of a big chain store in the area, he figures he's just leased the only possible space that would have been suitable, in the Rainier Hotel.
"I think the Rainier was the last property around that was left to be picked up. I don't know what's left," says Mr. Heather. "I think we have kind of ridden that one out and got lucky, not to have been interesting enough for them when we had spaces available. And now that we are interesting enough, we don't have space available. I can't think of one single space big enough to look after them.
"That's the character of Gastown - we don't have McDonald's or large format retailers. I've always liked that."

Abstract: "We're having a positive impact by protecting the endangered species and making sure we stay back from the provincially significant wetlands surrounding the site, and at the same time, we wanted to have a positive impact on the local economy," says president, Michael Fleming. "[We're] already having a positive impact by replacing what was there, which was a very messy and shut down trailer park."

About 90 minutes north of Toronto, Fleming Developments envisions a new and improved cottage experience on a sheltered inlet of the Georgian Bay designed to appeal to modern families.
The first step was not to raze, but revere the natural setting and resources found in and around the 165-acre site in Honey Harbour, from preserving a vast amount of the rugged topography to sourcing out locally-made finishes and furnishings for each property.
"We're having a positive impact by protecting the endangered species and making sure we stay back from the provincially significant wetlands surrounding the site, and at the same time, we wanted to have a positive impact on the local economy," says president, Michael Fleming. "[We're] already having a positive impact by replacing what was there, which was a very messy and shut down trailer park."
The size of the four-season destination, which is a major development in the small town, would easily allow for four-storey housing. But the builder preferred a more intimate, resort-style development with only 120 furnished cottages separated by tall pines and granite outcroppings, and surrounded by 8,000 wetland preserves and 1,850 feet of shoreline.
"It's nice to be part of a community like this, but at the same time, you also want to have private space and the ability to barbecue and play in your backyard and not be right on top of each other like a lot of the other developments," says Mr. Fleming.
Residents will also have access to a sandy beach, pool, tennis courts, playground, a clubhouse, boat slips, a boardwalk and a canal leading to the Georgian Bay, which is a designated world biosphere reserve.
Restaurants, grocers and festivals can also be enjoyed in town, which is a short drive to Mount St. Louis Moonstone Ski Resort where residents will have ski privileges.
Another unique aspect of this project is that it will eliminate many of the drawbacks of traditional cottage ownership.
"Owning a cottage is very expensive and very time consuming," says Mr. Fleming. "And the average cottage in Ontario gets used 35 days a year, and for a second home that's incredibly low."
So these cottages will start from $429,900 and can be put into a rental program. Furthermore, a monthly condo fee of $447 will cover exterior maintenance, and $75 will fund the upkeep of recreational facilities and activities programmed by naturalist, Robin Tapley.
The first phase offers about two dozen detached and semi-detached cottages with two to four bedrooms and up to half an acre of land. Each will have exposed timber frame construction, a screened-in porch and open entertaining and dining areas with up to 18-foot ceilings in some cases.
Occupancy begins next spring.

Buyers at Peter Street Condominiums will not only own a small piece of real estate in the downtown core, but gain premium access to urban amenities, from professionally run fitness classes to on-site shops and businesses.
With prices starting in the low $200,000s, the prospect of obtaining so much for so little helped sales for the 40 storey high-rise skyrocket to 85 per cent just three months after its launch this spring.
"It's a combination of great architecture, tremendous location and the value proposition of what we're able to offer," says Andrew Hoffman, president and founder of CentreCourt Developments. "We've got really efficient suite designs with great interior elements."
There will be 429 suites between 303 and 772 square feet in this glass and aluminum tower, which Peter Clewes of architectsAlliance designed for the infill site at the northeast corner of Adelaide and Peter streets.
"It's in the heart of a number of different districts: the Financial District to the east, the Entertainment District at the doorstep to the south, Chinatown to the west and trendy Queen West to the north," says Mr. Hoffman.
Furthermore, once this building is completed in December, 2014, there will be new shops at street-level and 15,000 square feet of office space on the second and third floors. The fourth and fifth floors will be private recreational areas, including a theatre, billiards room, lounge, kitchen and dining room, plus exercise, weight training and yoga rooms.
A local boutique fitness club - Totum Life Science - will not only collaborate on the design of the fitness facilities, but will also offer seven classes each week. Personal trainers, therapeutic services and extra classes can also be booked.
Cecconi Simone Inc will give a clean, contemporary aesthetic to these common areas and individual suites, which range from studio to three-bedroom models.
Upgraded features will be standard, such as nine-foot ceilings, engineered wood floors, custom Cecconi Simone cabinetry, quartz counters and glass kitchen backsplashes. Some green initiatives will consist of Energy Star appliances, energy-efficient windows and individually metered hydro.
Monthly fees will be 53 cents per square foot. Parking will be $45,000 and a locker $5,000.

Abstract: The latest from Belgium's brother team is another modest classic about people, especially kids, on the margins, and the power of compassion to change lives. When a ginger-haired 11-year-old ruffian named Cyril (Thomas Doret) makes a run from the children's home where he's been placed by his father, he ends up rushing into the arms of a hairdresser, Samantha (Cecile de France), who's waiting in a doctor's office.

Full text:   The following short reviews of films screening at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival are by James Adams, Guy Dixon, Rick Groen, Liam Lacey, Gayle MacDonald, Dave McGinn, Johanna Schneller and Kate Taylor. Star ratings are on a scale of zero to four and are presented in descending order .
The Artist
Michel Hazanavicius (France)
****
Black-and-white and mostly silent, this Cannes crowd-pleaser is an homage to the movies when the screen was still silver. Mixing French stars Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo with an American cast (John Goodman, James Cromwell and Penelope Ann Miller) this twenties-set fantasy follows a Douglas Fairbanks-like dashing movie star, George Valentin (Dujardin), adored by women and accompanied by his clever Jack Russell terrier. But George becomes a has-been when the talkies arrive, until he's helped out by an ingenue, Peppy Miller (Bejo). With elements of A Star Is Born and Singing in the Rain, The Artist is a rarity, an ingenious crowd-pleaser. L.L.
Sept. 9, 6 p.m., Elgin; Sept. 10, 10 a.m., Lightbox 2 .
The Descendants
Alexander Payne (USA)
****
George Clooney stars in Oscar-winning director Alexander Payne's ( Sideways ) heartwarming, tragic and, at times, hilariously funny drama (adapted from Kaui Hart Hemmings's novel) about a middle-aged father and husband whose seeming idyllic life in Hawaii has been thrown into chaos by a boating accident that has left his thrill-seeking wife in a coma, fighting for her life. Clooney is the harried Matt King, a work-obsessed real-estate lawyer whose relationship with his wife has been strained, and drifting, for years. After the accident, King is faced with trying to fix a broken household where two teenage daughters - both angry and grappling to figure out how to reconnect with their one remaining parent - struggle to remain a loving family unit. Clooney and the elder daughter (Shailene Woodley) give Oscar-worthy performances in this hard-knocks film that will have you laughing one moment, sobbing the next. G.M.
Sept. 10, 6 p.m., Elgin; Sept. 11, 12:30 p.m., Winter Garden; Sept. 17, 11 a.m., Elgin .
The Kid With a Bike
Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne
(Belgium/France/Italy)
****
The latest from Belgium's brother team is another modest classic about people, especially kids, on the margins, and the power of compassion to change lives. When a ginger-haired 11-year-old ruffian named Cyril (Thomas Doret) makes a run from the children's home where he's been placed by his father, he ends up rushing into the arms of a hairdresser, Samantha (Cecile de France), who's waiting in a doctor's office. Moved by the kid's desperation, she finds his lost bike and ends up becoming his weekend foster mother. Instead of bonding easily, though, she finds herself fighting to save the kid from falling in with a juvenile gang. Tautly structured and tense, this is stripped-down story telling that's right on target. L.L.
Sept. 13, 4:30 p.m., Winter Garden; Sept. 15, 7:45 p.m., Isabel Bader .
Le Havre
Aki Kaurismaki (Finland)
****
This note-perfect neo-realist fairy tale from the comic Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki follows a self-styled bohemian shoe-shine man, Marcel (André Wilms), who lives with his wife (Kati Outinen) in the French port city of Le Havre. When his wife learns she's suffering a serious illness, she hides it from her husband. Meanwhile, Marcel befriends a refugee boy from Africa, and uses all the resources of his network of friends to keep the kid free from the dogged police detective (Jean-Pierre Darroussin). Both playful and serious, Kaurismaki's film is an old-fashioned celebration of the fellowship between the powerless and the rejected. L.L.
Sept. 9, 1 p.m., AGO .
Once Upon a Time in Anatolia
Nuri Bilge Ceylan
(Turkey/Bosnia-Herzegovina)
****
Though not for the timid, this 156-minute slow-burner from Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan ( Distant, Three Monkeys ) is something special in its carefully controlled tone and underlying humanity: A forensic procedural that plays like a Russian novel unfolding within a 12-hour period, it follows a convoy of cars carrying a young doctor named Cemal (Muhammet Uzuner), a public prosecutor, a police chief and a couple of other cops, along with a pair of confessed murderers, who are wandering around the Anatolian countryside trying to find where a murder victim is buried. Eventually, the corpse is located and an autopsy takes place at a local morgue, while we learn a lot about adultery, the hope for children and the vast spaces that separate people who work side by side. L.L.
Sept. 13, 6:15 p.m., Lightbox 1; Sept. 14, 8:45 a.m., Lightbox 1; Sept. 16, 5:45 p.m., Scotiabank 3 .
Drive
Nicolas Winding Refn (USA)
***½
Tense car chases, action scenes handled with crisp panache and Canadian actor Ryan Gosling channelling Steve McQueen as an existential wheel man add up to make Drive one of the best arty-action films since Steven Soderbergh's The Limey . Gosling's character - a stunt driver by day, a getaway man by night - and his ambitious manager (Bryan Cranston) get involved with some bad people, Albert Brooks playing a razor-wielding thug/movie producer and Ron Perlman as his nastier partner. True to its seventies genre roots, the plot is enthusiastically pulpy, with the hero compelled to protect a young mother (Carey Mulligan) while battling his enemies. L.L.
Sept. 10, 9:15 p.m., Ryerson; Sept. 11, 9 a.m., Lightbox 1 .
50/50
Jonathan Levine (USA)
***½
Even hardened cynics will embrace the cliché - yep, you will laugh, you will cry. When doctors discover a malignant tumour in his back, Adam gets his survival odds and the movie gets its title. The rest spins his potentially terminal cancer into a buoyant romcom, an unlikely partnership that, dancing adroitly between the drama and the laughs, works remarkably well. Seth Rogen is there to dole out his trademark yuks, Anna Kendrick doubles as a callow counsellor plus the budding love interest, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is touchingly restrained in the victim's role. You'd expect black comedy here, not these brighter hues, but with a few exceptions - the bad-girlfriend subplot, an antic car crash - the colour scheme is a credible blend of lively and sombre. Expect this to be a huge crowd-pleaser - I'd put the odds at 90/10. R.G.
Sept. 12, 6 p.m., Ryerson; Sept. 13, 2 p.m., AMC 7 .
A Dangerous Method
David Cronenberg (France/Ireland/U.K./Germany/Canada)
***
Two outings after A History of Violence , David Cronenberg explores the history of sex, at least as filtered through the psychoanalytic minds of Messrs. Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) and Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender). Set in Europe at the dawn of the 20th century, the story tracks the meeting of those two minds, then their fractious parting. En route, the dialectic pits the rigorous science, and surprisingly dry wit, of Freud against the earnest mysticism of Jung, who struggles to balance a primal relationship with a troubled patient (an overwrought Keira Knightley) and the banal conventions of marriage to his rich wife. The performances are generally solid and the dance of ideas engaging, but the result feels a bit slight by Cronenbergian standards, or perhaps it's just playful. Either way, you'll exit the theatre reminded anew that a cigar, the one you can't smoke anywhere any more, is never just a cigar. R.G.
Sept. 10, 6:30 p.m., Roy Thomson; Sept. 12, 4:45 p.m., Lightbox 1 .
Footnote
Joseph Cedar (Israel)
***
A father-son academic rivalry provides fodder for this caustic comedy set in the Talmud Department of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. A bitter old professor, Eliezer Shkolnik (Shlomo Bar Aba), has worked for decades in obscurity, while an unscrupulous rival has stolen his thunder; his reputation rests on a mere footnote in someone else's work. Meanwhile, Eliezer's son, Uriel (Lior Ashkenazi), has become an academic superstar by producing popular books on Jewish culture. The two men are set against each other with the impending announcement of the annual Israel Prize. Israeli-born, New York-educated Joseph Cedar ( Beaufort ) won the Cannes screenwriting prize for his mordant script about mountains, mole-hills and the popular biblical theme of mean fathers and rebellious sons. L.L.
Sept. 12, 5:15 p.m., Lightbox 2; Sept. 14, 2 p.m., AMC 10 .
The Eye of the Storm
Fred Schepisi (Australia)
***
In this adaptation of Patrick White's novel, director Fred Schepisi ( Six Degrees of Separation ) forgoes dramatic tempests and instead offers several fine, highly controlled performances. Elizabeth Hunter (Charlotte Rampling) may be approaching death as she is tended to by servants in her mansion, but she is as capable as ever of manipulating those around her. When her children, Basil (Geoffrey Rush) and Dorothy (Judy Davis) come from abroad to visit Elizabeth on her deathbed, the bitterness and dysfunction that have always characterized their relationships slowly reveal themselves. D.M.
Sept. 11, 4:30 p.m., Winter Garden; Sept. 13, 2:30 p.m., AMC 6.
Headhunters
Morten Tyldum (Norway)
***
Roger Brown (Norwegian star Aksel Hennie) is a plucky little fellow married to a statuesque blonde and marred by a Napoleon complex. To keep his lady love in the luxury he thinks she demands, the guy works around the clock - by day as a headhunter for Fortune 500 execs, by night as an art thief. Soon enough, day collides with night and, pursued by an enthusiastic killer, Roger lams it to the country. Watch for the scene in a farm outhouse where, quite literally, he finds himself way over his head in deep doodoo. The script is like that - now bloody, then funny, often wicked and usually engaging. Tyldum keeps the pace brisk, while Hennie invests his little man with an appealing mix of vulnerability and cunning. Really, this a European movie with a Hollywood feel - good, shallow fun. R.G.
Sept. 10, 9:45 p.m., Scotiabank 1; Sept. 11, 9:15 p.m., AMC 4 .
The Ides of March
George Clooney (USA)
***
Set over the course of a crucial presidential primary in Ohio, this is designed as a political exposé in the back-room tradition of The Candidate or The Best Man , the kind where idealism is the victim and pragmatism the rule. Working both before and behind the camera, Clooney plays a Democrat with impeccable liberal credentials (hardly a stretch), but the bulk of the camera time goes to Ryan Gosling as his press secretary, prowling that back room in the company of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Paul Giamatti. The dialogue is smart, crisp and witty and, given the quorum of talent, it's not surprising that the performances are superb. What is surprising, and disappointing, is that the plot borrows, not once but twice, from the hoariest tropes in the book of smug cliches. The effect is to cheapen all the hard-earned realism. Contemporary American politics does a fine job of cheapening itself - the script doesn't need this melodramatic varnish. R.G.
Sept. 9, 9:30 p.m., Roy Thomson; Sept. 10, 11 a.m., Elgin .
In Darkness
Agnieszka Holland
(Canada/Germany/Poland)
***
In darkness, indeed. Much of this film unfolds beneath the cobbled streets of wartime Lvov, down within the murk and rat-infested mire. There, a Polish sewer worker, Catholic in religion and anti-Semitic in attitude, hides a small group of Jews from both the occupying Nazis and their local allies. Initially, his lone motive is money - the hidden are paying him well for their rancid sanctuary. But, over the months, a human bond develops and, even in the depth of the sewers, he begins to see the moral light. Yes, the screenplay is a bit too schematic and symbolically convenient (the Jews' refuge lies directly under a church), but Holland's direction is unflinchingly graphic. Poland in that period was a maelstrom of shifting alliances and conflicting tensions, yet she fuses the separate strands of the narrative - a suspenseful tale of jeopardy and a study in situation ethics - into a compelling, if not always convincing, portrait of shared peril. R.G.
Sept. 11, 6 p.m., Elgin; Sept. 12, 3:30 p.m., Scotiabank 3 .
Melancholia
Lars von Trier (Denmark/Sweden/France/Germany)
***
Lars von Trier's Melancholia begins with a haunting prelude: a bride with a charred, tattered train; birds falling from the sky; a horse falling to the ground and a little planet pinging into a large blue sphere, like a sperm entering an ovum. Life is finished. Then the story begins. The first hour follows the utterly disastrous wedding reception of Justine (Kirsten Dunst), a debacle reminiscent of von Trier pal Thomas Vinterberg's caustic The Celebration . Part two sees Justine emerge from a catatonic depression to become a source of strength to her terrified sister (Charlotte Gainsbourg) while a luminous giant asteroid glides toward Earth. The drama is clunky, but the visual experience paradoxically uplifting. L.L.
Sept. 10, 6 p.m., Ryerson; Sept. 17, 2:45 p.m., Ryerson .
Michael
Markus Schleinzer (Austria)
***
First time director Markus Schleinzer, a long-time casting director for Michael Haneke, takes us to a place where few people want to go. The title character is a 35-year-old bachelor insurance agent who has an abducted 10-year-old boy locked up in the basement of his suburban house. Meticulously made, with sharp thriller jolts, the film goes to pains to demonstrate the oddly "normal," almost parental, aspects of the man's relationship to the boy: They watch TV together, do jigsaw puzzles and even have an occasional outing. Dreadful as the subject matter is, the authenticity of the performances and the skill of Schleinzer's filmmaking are difficult to deny in this portrait of a monster as the bland guy next door. L.L.
Sept. 14, 7:30 p.m., Lightbox 2; Sept. 15, 10 p.m., Scotiabank 2; Sept. 18, 4:30 p.m., AMC 6 .
Miss Bala
Gerardo Naranjo (Mexico)
***
Blinkered innocence is the sole point of view, corrupt and deadly experience is the sole content. The whole film unfolds from the perspective of a naive Tijuana teenager who, after signing up for the local beauty pageant, finds herself in the wrong place at the wrong time - witness to a night-club massacre perpetrated by a gang of narcos. She does the sensible thing and goes to a cop but, in Naranjo's take on Mexican society, sense is an endangered commodity - the cop leads her straight to the gang's vicious leader. What follows is an always violent, often surreal ride through the thickets of widespread corruption, with the audience sometimes left as confused and disoriented as the poor girl. But there's no mistaking the moral of this amoral tale: Even when innocence is crowned, injustice reigns. R.G.
Sept. 11, 9:15 p.m., Scotiabank 4; Sept. 12, 2:45 p.m., AMC 3 .
Moneyball
Bennett Miller (USA)
***
The best thing you can say about Michael Lewis's bestselling book on new-age baseball thinking is that you don't need to be a baseball fan to dig it. Likewise, the best thing you can say about Bennett Miller's adaptation is that you don't need to know a hardball from a wrecking ball to enjoy this understated film. Brad Pitt is economical in his role of Billy Beane, the driven, game-changing general manager of the under-equipped Oakland A's, and Jonah Hill is stellar as his nerdy-brilliant assistant. The book looks at statistics and challenging conventional wisdom; the film takes a more human approach, bringing "inside-baseball" to a whole new outside audience. B.W.
Sept. 9, 6:30 p.m., Roy Thomson; Sept. 10, 2:30 p.m., Elgin; Sept. 17, 2:30 p.m., Elgin.
Shame
Steve McQueen (U.K.)
***
Following his penchant for one-word titles, McQueen examines a New York man's hunger for sex, the loveless brand purchased from prostitutes or viewed on porn sites or garnered from libidinous femmes in trendy bars. In the frank nudity here, the debts to Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris and most anything by Catherine Breillat are obvious. Certainly the picture packs all the intensity of McQueen's debut in Hunger , but it lacks the same rich thematic resonance. Still, his manipulation of the camera, his marriage of sight to sound, his ability to advance the narrative without dialogue, are a joy to watch. What's more, it's fascinating to compare Michael Fassbender's lead performance here with his work as Carl Jung in David Cronenberg's A Dangerous Method - similar primal appetites but such a vastly different style. R.G.
Sept. 11, 7 p.m., Princess of Wales; Sept. 13, 3:15 p.m., Lightbox 1 .
Sleeping Beauty
Julia Leigh (Australia)
***
Creepy but visionary, novelist Julia Leigh's debut film is about a milkily pale university girl (Emily Browning) who takes on a strange kind of prostitution. She's drugged and, in her comatose state, old men go to bed with her to do whatever they want, short of penetration. Shot in a series of single-take scenes, it has the unnerving quality of watching some weird anthropological rite, as the girl puts herself into a near-death state for old men who seek to gain life through access to young flesh. At least part of this oneiric fantasy seems to be about the idea that we're also responsible for what we choose not to know. L.L.
Sept. 14, 9:30 p.m., Lightbox 1; Sept. 18, 4 p.m., Lightbox 3 .
Take Shelter
Jeff Nichols (USA)
***
If you like portents of Armageddon, you'll dig this. Construction worker Curtis (an excellent Michael Shannon) wakes, sweat-drenched, from apocalyptic dreams. Are they premonitions, or symptoms of the schizophrenia that gripped his mother (Kathy Baker) at his age? His wife (Jessica Chastain, who lately came out of nowhere, and can do no wrong) tries to support him. But when he sinks their life savings into a backyard subterranean storm shelter, even she loses faith. What makes the film work, along with the strong performances and a well-sustained feeling of dread, is Curtis's own fervent hope that it's all in his head. A good meditation on how the very things to which we cling to save ourselves are often our undoing. J.S.
Sept. 15, 6 p.m., Ryerson; Sept. 16, 2:15 p.m., Scotiabank 4 .
Damsels in Distress
Whit Stillman (USA)
**½
For fans of Whit Stillman, it's been a long 13-year wait since his last film in the Metropolitan/Barcelona/Last Days of Disco trilogy. Alas, for this fan of Whit Stillman, great expectations are now met with mild disappointment. Witty, literate and precisely observed, each of those earlier films was a comedy of manners. This is a mannered comedy, more stylized and theatrical, almost surreal at times, and less accommodating to his trademark brand of razor-sharp dialogue. Led by Greta Gerwig, the damsels are a quartet of undergrads in a privileged East Coast university; the distress is the fashionable depression that surrounds and occasionally engulfs them. Not to worry, though - it's all played as a clever lark, complete with song and dance and a different brand of wit, the quixotic kind that sparkles one moment but strains badly the next. The setting is a present
that feels like the past - but, for admirers of that now distant trilogy, not quite enough like the past. R.G.
Sept. 13, 6 p.m., Elgin; Sept. 14, 9:15 a.m., Scotiabank 4 .
We Need to Talk About Kevin
Lynne Ramsay (U.K.)
**
Scottish director Lynne Ramsay ( Ratcatcher ) has adapted Lionel Shriver's bestseller as a stylish shocker - filled with great splashes of red - about a school shooting, but it's more horror movie than insightful psychological study. Told in a jigsaw puzzle of flashbacks, the story follows Eva (Tilda Swinton) as the traumatized mother of a psychopath, an emotionally ungiving Manhattan thoroughbred married to a regular guy (John C. Reilly). Eva's life may have an arc worthy of Greek tragedy, but the psychological credibility is undermined by the portrait of Kevin. Ezra Miller's sneering, absurdly precocious evil-child performance makes him just another bad-seed horror villain. L.L.
Sept. 9, 8 p.m., Winter Garden; Sept. 11, 9:15 a.m., Lightbox 2 .

Jill Stewart and Robert LePage, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
The Action: In the week that this unique two-storey suite was listed for $498,000, there were nine potential buyers, including one ready to make a serious offer.
What They Got: Situated within a low-rise building, this two-bedroom suite has a traditional kitchen and an open dining area overlooking an entertaining space with a wood-burning fireplace in one corner, walls of windows and sliding balcony doors.
* The second floor has walkouts to private outdoor space from both bedrooms.
* The larger master suite has a walk-in closet and direct entry to one of two bathrooms.
* For extra storage, the property comes with a locker and parking.
* A monthly fee of $845 covers the maintenance of a party room, car wash station and visitor parking, as well as a supply of firewood.
The Agent's Take: "This condo is what called a boutique building, so there are only 20 suites in it," says agent Jill Stewart.
"It was built 25 years ago in a nice location just minutes to walk to Old Mill subway and the Humber Valley bike and walking trails."
The suite also had features unlike conventional highrise units.
"What's also unique is it's a two-storey condo, so it's like a townhouse," says Ms. Stewart, who believes this appeals to a buyer downsizing from a single-family home.
"It has a stone, wood-burning fireplace and the stone was taken from the Humber [River], so it's got a lot of local character to it. And to find a wood burning fireplace in a condo building is hard to come by."

Abstract: One is its beautiful stock of historic housing. Imagine a Vancouver devoid of Vancouver specials and filled instead with the arts and crafts houses of Kitsilano and Edwardians of Mount Pleasant. (Alas, not much Vancouver can to do replicate that at this late date. Portland is lucky in having undergone a massive building boom in the early 20th century.) But there are two things this so-similar city has that we don't, although we could.

Full text:   We'd started with breakfast at Pine State Biscuits, part of the Alberta Arts District that has sprung up in this northeast part of Portland, eating our biscuits and gravy at picnic tables in the restaurant's side yard.
Lunch was chicken burritos at the food-cart pod in the Mississippi neighbourhood - just a tiny constellation among the 642 food carts in the Portland area - and a stroll past shops filled with antiques, bikes and local-designer clothing.
Late-afternoon beer: The LaurelThirst Public House, where we sat at tables on the sidewalk in the mostly residential Kerns neighbourhood listening to a bluegrass band playing inside. Dinner was at a small Italian place, part of a small cluster of restaurants and shops tucked in among the grand old houses and apartment buildings of Southeast Belmont.
Every one of these experiences - rare or impossible in Vancouver - made me envy Portland once again for several reasons.
One is its beautiful stock of historic housing. Imagine a Vancouver devoid of Vancouver specials and filled instead with the arts and crafts houses of Kitsilano and Edwardians of Mount Pleasant. (Alas, not much Vancouver can to do replicate that at this late date. Portland is lucky in having undergone a massive building boom in the early 20th century.) But there are two things this so-similar city has that we don't, although we could.
One is a high level of small-business innovation. Another is a sense of economic creativity and identity in its neighbourhoods.
In Vancouver, a huge number of the interesting restaurants and shops are concentrated in the downtown or, at best, neighbourhoods right next to downtown.
South of 16th and west of Victoria, the city is almost suburban, with commercial strips that are dominated by bread-and-butter service shops, unambitious ethnic restaurants, and ubiquitous chains. The story of bars and food carts in the two cities highlights the differences. In Vancouver, 70 per cent of all the city's bars are downtown, as are almost 100 per cent of the food carts, contributing to a sense that this is a city focused on serving visitors, rather than on creating an interesting quality of life in all neighbourhoods.
That's a far cry from Portland, which has any number of small local pubs in the middle of residential districts, like LaurelThirst, while several food-cart pods have sprung up on the east, non-downtown side of the river like the Mississippi Avenue district.
Portland's business climate has the advantage of low real-estate prices, which allow people to experiment more easily, and a more homogeneous population, which makes marketing easier.
But those aren't the only factors that make the difference.
City hall has a department dedicated to neighbourhoods that recently produced a plan for neighbourhood economic development. And its agencies have a policy of keeping rules to a minimum. Food carts have to meet basic health requirements, but nothing else - no judging panels, no numbers restrictions.
"It's really the market that dictates," says Ben Duncan, the Multnomah County health official whose department issues health permits, which can come in as little as two months.
For bars, getting a licence is a simple matter of applying to the state. There is no limit on the number of licences and the city has no say, other than zoning requirements. Neighbours get canvassed to see if they have strong objections, but that's it.
The result: Vancouver has 283 liquor-primary licences, with new ones approved at a rate of about five a year. Portland has 168 licensed brewpubs alone, not to mention a couple hundred more regular pubs, bars, lounges and more.
"In my experience, it takes two to three months to get a licence," says Bruce Bauer, owner of the Vino wine store in Portland. "There isn't a hindrance."
As a result, he's about to open a new wine bar in a little strip of stores on 28th in Laurelhurst. Another new venue to explore next time - and one more reason to envy Portland.

Full text: Canadian boxer signed contract promising wife $1-million if caught cheating, notary testifies in dispute over his fortune
Even as he settled the final details of his will, former star boxer Arturo Gatti and his Brazilian wife betrayed the joy and torture of their short marriage.
One minute, they were a loving young couple in front of Montreal notary Bruce Moidel, writing up their final testaments, as any good parent with some money might do just before a big romantic overseas getaway. Mr. Gatti was a recently retired world champ, beloved in boxing circles, who made millions on an unrivalled ability to absorb a beating and outlast an opponent.
The next moment in that notary's office, Amanda Rodrigues was the jealous wife, hinting at the inevitability of Mr. Gatti betraying her. Mr. Gatti responded with a typically emotional outburst: If it ever happens, he said, "I'll give you a million dollars."
So an unusual contract was struck, Mr. Moidel testified Tuesday at a Montreal civil trial judging a dispute over Mr. Gatti's will, and his millions, between his widow and the rest of his family.
Mr. Moidel drafted a side deal, alongside the last will and testament of the couple: Should Mr. Gatti ever cheat on Ms. Rodrigues, the former welterweight champ would hand over a million dollars.
The will signing, Mr. Moidel testified, "was a normal, typical meeting for a young couple about to fly off and leave a baby behind with family. They said they were going on a second honeymoon, and they were very excited." The million-bucks-for-infidelity was another matter. "I've never seen that before. It was their idea," said Mr. Moidel, who became a notary in 1958. The couple told the notary they planned to go to Europe.
One month later, on July 11, 2009, Mr. Gatti, 37, was found hanging by a purse strap in a luxury hotel room in Porto de Galinhas, Brazil. Ms. Rodrigues and the couple's infant son, Arturo Jr., were in the same hotel suite and the couple had earlier engaged in one of their frequent fights.
Ms. Rodrigues, 25, initially fell under suspicion, but was later cleared by Brazilian authorities, who ruled Mr. Gatti's death a suicide. Along with disputing the validity of the will, Mr. Gatti's friends, family and fans have never accepted the official account of his death.
Many in the fraternity of boxing writers noted Mr. Gatti's temper and trouble with booze, his occasional propensity to break into tears, his generosity and tempestuous love life. His widow says he suffered from depression.
His friends countered he was just too determined and courageous to kill himself. A month before he died, he told a notary to erase "retired professional boxer" from the profession line in his will. "I'm a builder," he told Mr. Moidel, referring to some new real-estate ventures.
While the civil trial lumbers on, a private investigator will release a report Tuesday denouncing the Brazilian investigation as botched and incomplete.
The Chicago-based investigator, Paul Ciolino, has concluded Mr. Gatti's death was a murder and promises to name names when the report is released in Mr. Gatti's old stomping grounds, a gym in North Bergen, N.J.
Mr. Ciolino said he and his partner dedicated nearly 11 months to their investigation, interviewed 75 witnesses and brought in a half-dozen high-profile experts in criminal profiling, crime-scene investigation and forensic medicine, among other fields.
Brazilian authorities, in contrast, wrapped up their probe in a couple days and failed to take DNA samples and fingerprints.
"The Brazilian investigation left a lot to be desired. Maybe it's economics, maybe it's because they don't know better, maybe it's because they have 4,000 homicides a year and Arturo Gatti is not an important person there," Mr. Ciolino said.
He recounted how hotel managers instructed staff to tell police that Mr. Gatti was clinging to life to elicit a prompt response.
"If they tell the cops he's dead, the locals know the cops will tell them to leave the AC on, lock the door, and they'll see you in a couple days," Mr. Ciolino said. "These guys are overwhelmed with homicides."

Full text: Lower Manhattan has been transformed from a sterile enclave of banks and brokerages to a family-friendly magnet for young professionals eager to live the kind of life that only a world-class city can offer. Shawn McCarthy reports on a residential boom that epitomizes the passion and pluck of New Yorkers
In the 10 years since al-Qaeda wreaked havoc on the World Trade Center, its downtown neighbourhood has seen a startling residential renaissance.
What was once a sterile enclave for banks and brokerage houses has become family friendly, with new parks, public schools and grocery stores springing up throughout the district known as Lower Manhattan.
The residential population has more than doubled since 9/11, with an influx of young professional parents, who often work within walking distance from home.
Magda Gagliano is a self-proclaimed pioneer in downtown living. She worked in the World Trade Center prior to the 9/11 attack and knew many victims. She and her husband, Joe, watched as emergency responders mounted largely futile rescue efforts that day.
Despite that trauma, they decided Lower Manhattan was the perfect place to raise their daughter, Daria.
"While I'll always remember it, I don't want to live in the past. We've done so much to bring this neighbourhood back," Ms. Gagliano says.
Six-year-old Daria's route to her first-grade classroom is a short walk through the urban theme park that is Lower Manhattan.
When she heads off to her public school this September, she will emerge into the glass and concrete canyons of the Wall Street financial district.
As she continues along a refurbished Battery Park, she can look to the left and wave to the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbour or to the right up West Street and view the mammoth 1 World Trade Center under construction.
The 9/11 attack - which has been followed by two well-publicized threats to New York City - has not deterred people from moving to within a few short blocks of ground zero. They greet the risk with a mixture of defiance, rationalization and avoidance: No enemy will limit their liberty, there are dangers everywhere and it's best not to dwell on what might happen.
They brave the traffic and incessant noise, the density and, yes, the threat of another terrorist attack to enjoy the stimulating activity and stunning geography that the tip of Manhattan Island offers.
The downtown residents are drawn by what Harvard University urban economist Edward Glaeser calls the triumph of the 21st-century city: a victory over the crime, pollution and economic decline that were the hallmarks of major American cities a generation ago.
In a book published earlier this year, Mr. Glaeser argues that New York - like the world's other great cities - offers unmatched opportunity for creative work and pleasurable living and hence draws in the brightest and most entrepreneurial population.
Lower Manhattan epitomizes that mixture of challenging employment and upscale lifestyle. It has also become a privileged enclave - sky-high rents and housing prices ensure that only the affluent reside there.
On 9/11, there were an estimated 25,000 people living in the downtown area. But they were congregated in two areas: Battery Park City, a high-rise development hugging the Hudson River, and Tribeca, the upscale residential neighbourhood that is home to celebrities such as Robert De Niro and James Gandolfini.
Today, there are 56,000 people living in the area south of Chambers Street. One-quarter of the households have children under 18 and, in a recent survey, 40 per cent of childless couples under 45 said they plan to have children in the next three years.
The population is expected to continue growing. Developers are putting up new buildings and converting commercial space into residences.
One glowing addition to the Manhattan skyline is "New York by Frank Gehry" - an undulating, titanium tower designed by the famed architect and billed as the tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere. Just two blocks from the World Trade Center site, the Gehry building features 69 storeys of rental units - and a new public elementary school in its first three floors.
The monthly rent for a three-bedroom unit - complete with wrap-around balcony - is listed at $20,000. The standard two-bedroom apartment in the exclusive Gehry building rents for $6,000 a month, compared to an average in Manhattan of about $2,500.
With the residential boom has come six new schools - including two public elementary facilities. The excellent reputation of the public schools is a major draw for families in a city where private tuition can average $25,000 a year.
City, state and federal governments have also allocated more than $100-million to build and refurbish parks, including Governors Island, a 70-hectare former military base that has been transformed into an urban playground with developers drawing inspiration from the Toronto Islands.
The island lies 800 metres off the tip of Manhattan in New York Harbour and houses two 1812-era forts. The green space has been turned over to the city and now has bike paths, ball fields, picnic spots, and is accessible by free ferry rides from both Manhattan and Brooklyn.
While recent construction is drawing new residents, there remain some long-time residents of the financial district who survived the devastating loss of 9/11 and chose to stay.
Catherine and Tom Hughes raised two boys, now 14 and 19, just a block from ground zero and have never regretted their choice to stay.
For the past 10 years, Ms. Hughes - a civil engineer - has worked as a volunteer on the local community board to ensure the residents benefited from the massive redevelopment of the area.
Her family was not unscathed by 9/11. Friends were lost. Mr. Hughes had been invited but decided not to attend a technology conference at Windows on the World, where the attendees all died that day. And the family was forced from their home for more than five months until the building could be made habitable again.
"New Yorkers are resilient," Ms. Hughes says. "We had freedom before Sept. 11 and we had freedom after Sept. 11 and I'm not going to have somebody tell me where I can or cannot live.
"In fact, we're going to make it better."
*****
New York state of mind
Despite the fact that Lower Manhattan was twice targeted in terrorist attacks, improvements since 2001 have increased its allure as a residential area. The most recent "Survey of Lower Manhattan Residents" reveals why various demographics call Lower Manhattan home:
Who lives there?
INCOME
The typical household in Lower Manhattan has higher income levels than Manhattan overall.
Average household $188,000
Median income $143,000
EDUCATION
On average, 85 per cent have a university degree*, and 42 per cent have done post-graduate work.
EMPLOYMENT
Lower Manhattan has a sizable percentage of entrepreneurs.
Self-employed 23%
Work from home 14%
HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION
About 23 per cent of the housholds have children under the age of 18, and 40 per cent of those without children expect to have them within three years.
2009
One-person household: 28%
Roommates: 9%
Couples with children: 25%
Couples without children: 34%
Single parent 2%
Why?
Walking distance to work, high-end real estate, good public schools, decent transportation, low crime and plenty of park land all add up to an overall high quality of life for residents of Lower Manhattan. Fine restaurants, museums and easy access to the rest of Manhattan have made the district a "playground for the prosperous," to borrow the phrase of Harvard urban economist Edward Glaeser. Those assets more than compensate for the noise and construction that has been a major feature of the area since 9/11.
LENGTH OF RESIDENCE IN LOWER MANHATTAN, in years
More than 10: 38%
Less than five: 35%
Five to 10: 27%
The majority of current residents (88 per cent) plan on staying in Lower Manhattan for at least the next three years.
SAFETY
Crime in New York is at its lowest level since the 1960s and Lower Manhattan is one of the safer areas of the city. Safety was an important factor for 81 per cent of the survey respondents.
CRIME COMPLAINTS IN MANHATTAN SOUTH
....................................'01.............'10............% Change
Murder........................24..............17................-29.2%
Rape........ ..................93..............115..............+23.7

Apartment size and affordability also ranked high on the list of reasons why residents chose the area.

Ford ally bucks belt-tightening trend

Author: White, Patrick

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/ford-ally-bucks-belt-tightening-trend/docview/887613951/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "It's another example of the mayor losing control of his executive," said Councillor Janet Davis, referring to Mr. [Giorgio Mammoliti]'s vow. "[Rob Ford] ran on a platform of no cuts to services. He's now doing exactly that and there are many councillors, including his own team, who are not going along with it."

Full text: Mammoliti pledges to prevent layoffs of front-line firefighting and paramedic workers at any cost
As City Hall enters a period expected to produce widespread job cuts and spark mass labour action, two union factions have just gained an unlikely and powerful new ally.
Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti, a staunch backer of Mayor Rob Ford and the chair of the committee overseeing fire and EMS services in the city, is vowing to prevent front-line layoffs at any cost.
"[I] will not be recommending any grassroots layoffs, you can count on that," Mr. Mammoliti, chair of the Community Development and Recreation Committee and a member in good standing of Mr. Ford's executive inner circle, told The Globe and Mail. "If there are any cuts, they will not result in job losses for grassroots firefighters or paramedics. I will not let that happen."
What's more, the long-time York West councillor and former mayoral candidate vowed to counter the prevailing belt-tightening mentality at City Hall and push for a mass hiring of paramedics.
"We are short of paramedics and as a result they are burning themselves out," he said. "Sometimes we don't have enough vehicles to respond to all the calls. We need to hire more."
The news of Mr. Mammoliti's hard-line opposition to front-line layoffs came as a pleasant surprise to Damien Walsh, vice-president of the Toronto Professional Fire Fighters' Association, as he marched in the Labour Day parade on Monday.
"We're certainly glad to hear that," he said. "We've been stating all along any cuts to the fire service are going to have huge impacts on service to the city."
Mr. Mammoliti's comments mark an apparent departure from the talking points of other Ford allies and come as both fire and EMS departments are preparing for the worst as Mr. Ford's budget axe falls in the coming weeks and months.
The mayor's office has already asked Toronto Fire and other city departments to prepare plans for 10-per-cent budget cuts. Toronto Fire brass argue that such a reduction would eliminate more than 300 firefighters, dozens of trucks and gravely imperil the department's ability to respond to emergencies.
Paramedics haven't avoided fiscal scrutiny, either. A recent KPMG review of city services proposed that Toronto could save considerable cash by folding its EMS services into Toronto Fire. Currently, the two departments operate independently, with distinct unions, city managers, dispatch systems, back-office units and, in most cases, real estate.
Mr. Mammoliti said the merger idea remains on the table, a statement more in step with the mayor and his supporters on council, who have been hesitant to shoot down any of the ideas emanating from the KPMG review.
"It's another example of the mayor losing control of his executive," said Councillor Janet Davis, referring to Mr. Mammoliti's vow. "Rob Ford ran on a platform of no cuts to services. He's now doing exactly that and there are many councillors, including his own team, who are not going along with it."
Mr. Mammoliti's comments were not entirely good news for the union overseeing paramedics, Local 416, with whom the councillor has frequently sparred at committee meetings. He also said that he will lobby to have Toronto EMS designated an essential service.
During the 2009 strike, Toronto EMS endured heavy criticism for reducing its service, resulting in a significant increase in response times that allegedly endangered lives on several occasions.
"Paramedics believe they are an essential service, they want this," said Mr. Mammoliti, who recently tagged along for a shift with a Toronto EMS crew. "The only thing holding them back is their union."

The Action: Agent Patricia Houlihan advised the sellers of this updated residence to list it for one week, despite an offer that came in before the first open house.
Shortly after that, it sold in a bidding war between local and offshore buyers from Mainland China, who are showing an increased interest in $2-million properties in this area north of 4th Avenue and west of Alma Street.
What They Got: Though this 48- by 118-foot corner lot is slightly smaller than average, it has room for a 3,509-square-foot house built in 1949, deep south-facing backyard and a separate nanny suite.
The Agent's Take: "Some people were not keen on the property because it is located across from some rental housing. However, it is two blocks from Point Grey Road," Ms. Houlihan says.

Full text: With the mega-project behind him, architect Gregory Henriquez takes on the challenge of a more intimate site
After the gravitas of Woodward's, the comprehensive mixed use project in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, Gregory Henriquez's latest residential project - a 14-storey tower at 6th and Fir - exudes a sense of levity.
It is much smaller scale, of course, and much less politically charged than the one-million-square-foot project comprising an entire city block that firmly established Mr. Henriquez's reputation. But design-wise it emanates transparency, as opposed to the solidity of Woodward's, so grounded in a sense of heritage and community history.
"It was a real pleasure to design the tower at 6th and Fir," says Mr. Henriquez, and after the huge scale of Woodward's, "an architectural delight."
Mr. Henriquez enjoyed the experience of working with an "intimate team" - primarily with his colleagues Peter Wood, Dallas Hong and Frank Stebner - as opposed to the team of 20 that worked on Woodward's. But the sense of community imperative that runs through all of Mr. Henriquez's projects continues with this tower. 6 & Fir will feature amenity contributions such as two artists studios and assistance with a new community park, as well as some limited mixed-use retail spaces (with tenants to include YYoga.)
"Meaningful architecture integrates ethics and poetics," says Mr. Henriquez, who manages to bring a sense of both importance and humility to his work.
While Woodward's offered a plethora of "problem-solving" opportunities, in this case, the challenges Mr. Henriquez faced were mainly site constraints - but ones that he used advantageously in terms of design.
Located in the newly named Burrard Slopes area of Vancouver - bounded by Kitsilano to the west and South Granville to the east - the surrounding built environment is almost exclusively low- to mid-rise commercial and light industrial use. But lately residential high-rises have emerged along the Granville Street and Broadway corridors, carving out a new community. So the plan for the new tower had to contend with view issues for surrounding neighbours as well as the off-ramp from the Granville Street Bridge that borders the site to the north.
"Because of the site constraints," relates Mr. Henriquez, "it almost designed itself."
A previous design for the site by Arthur Erickson/Nick Milkovich, was for a much lower, four-storey building - in accordance with city bridgehead guidelines.
But a four-storey building, explains Mr. Henriquez, would have "blocked light from penetrating into the south façade of the neighbouring low-rise building to the north. With extra height we could sculpt the form and kept it away from the off-ramp." Now the design is such that southern light can enter the surrounding green space and residents and neighbours can share views of the water and mountains.
A curvilinear shape, he says, seemed a "natural" way to address the issues of both view and separation from the bridge. In addition to its curved morphology, the building's façade sweeps away from the Fir Street ramp so the suites benefit from a reorientation toward Burrard Inlet. A smaller, thinner floor plate and additional height help maintain density, while creating an elegant, elliptical form.
While typically high-rises would have a larger floor plate and stairs and elevators in the middle of the building, Mr. Henriquez took the stairs and elevators and pushed them to the east side, effectively creating an asymmetrical core and suites that curve out toward the views. So the building appears elliptical from the bridge, but orthogonal from the north.
A series of little "skyboxes" - two-, three- and five-storey sculptural, rectangular forms - break down the scale and the mass of the building. Softening the façade, details like planted bamboo and wooden soffits differentiate units and offer interesting textural interplay.
"We didn't want a conventional tower," affirms Mr. Henriquez. "We wanted to create one with a distinct identity."
The landscaped skyboxes also have a practical as well as aesthetic function as they contain views and limit sight lines to and from the off-ramp, while the soffits and the bamboo planted along the western edge offer privacy and reduce noise.
This is no architectural monologue, but rather a dialogue with the off-ramp. Just as residents can look out at water and mountain views, so too can drivers coming home from work gaze up at a piece of civic sculpture.
"I think this is the most beautiful residential building I've designed," says Mr. Henriquez, and not without some self-interest. After all, he is one of those drivers returning from work downtown (to his home in Kerrisdale) who will benefit from a visual improvement to the skyline.
Indeed, Mr. Henriquez's work is grounded firmly in a love of the local. He has no international projects on the go, but is working on several different ones in the Lower Mainland. A new mixed-use residential project at 70th and Granville, not far from where he grew up, is in design stage, as is the new Telus complex downtown - integrating an office building as well as residential tower. Both projects, like 6 & Fir, are designed for Ian Gillespie of West Bank development.
Henriquez's commitment to the local is partly he says, because he has a wife and children he "adores" and wants to stay close to home. But philosophically, he believes that "meaningful architecture has to be grassroots."
"I grew up here," says the 48-year-old architect, "I believe I have something to contribute here - maybe not to say Chicago or L.A." He speaks derisively of "a certain arrogance" inherent in the belief that "architects can transport their values and vision into another city."
Instead, he strives for "an intimate dialogue with the city and its issues." But despite his earnestness and idealism, he is also a realist.
"Not every building has to end homelessness," he notes, "not that it's not an important issue."
He is proud that 6 & Fir, like the city that inspires him, is "a really lovely place to live."

Sing us a song, you're the choir, man

Author: O'Kane, Josh

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/sing-us-song-youre-choir-man/docview/887139129/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Freelance writer Kelly Jones, 38, says singing with the choir is "intoxicating." She's not the only person in her family to get a rush from it - she's even taken her two young kids to the choir and they've loved it too. Her daughter "can't wait to tell everyone at school," she says.

Full text: They may be amateurs, but when their voices come together on campy cover tunes, even bigwigs like Bryan Adams take notice
Nobu Adilman is trying to please the hundred people in front of him, but it's not easy.
"Choir's tough," he tells a woman at the back of the bar. She wants to sing the highest part of the Eurythmics' Here Comes the Rain, but Mr. Adilman has just given the part to a group standing in front of him.
He is, of course, joking. This choir is not tough. Anyone can join Choir! Choir! Choir! and no one is judging the good from the bad. What started as a spontaneous Facebook event that saw 20 people gather at a Queen West real-estate office to sing during a February snowstorm has grown to a group of close to 100 voices on any given night. The project has already gained local notoriety, with a twinkle of national attention: their cover of Bryan Adams's Run to You got a shout-out from the singer on Twitter and close to 9,000 views on YouTube, but was snubbed as an entry to CBC's Cover Me Canada contest. They've practised almost every week since that first evening, singing everything from David Bowie to Elliott Smith.
Not 15 seconds later, Mr. Adilman is conducting the ragtag crew through a series of shoo-wop-shoo-wops, and he continues, layer by layer, to construct the song.
No layer is perfect at first, but the crowd tries until they get it right. Drinks in hand, the band of choir hopefuls and happy hipsters alternate between clamouring for parts and giving Mr. Adilman and his co-star, guitarist Daveed Goldman, their full attention. This is as DIY as it gets; at one point, the conductors and the crowd argue over whether or not they've been singing in the wrong key the whole time. Upon reviewing the original track, the room goes silent - not because the crowd shuts up, but because someone is calling the iPhone that is playing the song under review.
An hour and a few full takes later, the song is perfected, recorded and readied to post online, joining a collection of three dozen covers on their SoundCloud page.
The crowd retreats for mojitos, cigarettes and a much needed breather.
Guided by Mr. Adilman and Mr. Goldman, Choir! Choir! Choir! is a fully inclusive public choir that meets every week to construct large-scale public pop-song performances. It is both a live concert and a social experiment, blurring the line between audience and performer.
"People in the audience can see us perform one week and be part of it the next," Mr. Goldman says after putting the Eurythmics song to bed. "It's so much fun."
The possibilities for collaboration are endless and the curators are working on potential partnerships ranging from a string quartet to a ukulele ensemble. They've already played their own shows, including a sold-out gig at The Boat in Kensington - where, when there wasn't enough space inside for both the choir and the audience, the choir went outside to serenade the lineup with Fleetwood Mac's Say You Love Me .
This Friday, Sept. 9, they'll join other performers at The Great Hall on Queen West for Loving in the Name Of, a regular dance party and DJ night.
The anyone-can-join nature of C!C!C! makes it a unique slice of Toronto's arts and culture scene. Each week is both performance and practice - a chance both to be entertained and to meet new people. "It makes people do things they wouldn't ordinarily do," Mr. Goldman says.
The crowd of 20- and 30-somethings has grown each week, largely by word of mouth.
"The best part is just singing," says Nyles Miszczyk, 29. "It might be all the breathing. It's the ultimate high."
Freelance writer Kelly Jones, 38, says singing with the choir is "intoxicating." She's not the only person in her family to get a rush from it - she's even taken her two young kids to the choir and they've loved it too. Her daughter "can't wait to tell everyone at school," she says.
Mr. Adilman and Mr. Goldman are in the business of entertaining, though this is their first public choir experiment. During the day, Mr. Goldman entertains hungry diners as manager of the hot College and Bathurst brunch spot Aunties and Uncles. Mr. Adilman is a multi-faceted entertainment personality - a long-time television host, writer and actor, he's appeared on shows from Trailer Park Boys to the Food Network's Food Jammers .
The weekly choir meetings, lately held at No One Writes to the Colonel at College and Bathurst, have become a whole new staple in their lives. Mr. Goldman, who's played solo music most of his life, calls C!C!C! "a full 180 for me."
"The organizational side of having a choir was something I wasn't expecting," Mr. Adilman says. The more the choir grows, the more organization it will require and the less organic it could become. "We don't want to grow too large or implode."
They'll work out those details in time. Right now, they're focused on enjoying the choir.
"The point was always just to get more people to sing and just have fun," Mr. Goldman says. "The more people who want to sing, the better. It's really about us - we're our own audience. We have fun singing."
Surrounding himself with the choir has been something of an inspiration for Mr. Adilman. "When you're doing some thing that's creative, a lot of the time it'll attract the people you want to have around you. That's what happened with this choir."
*********
SONGS! SONGS! SONGS!
Those magic moments don't disappear at the end of each session. You can find them in perpetuity online at SoundCloud.com/choir-choir-choir. Herewith, a dissection of some of their most popular covers:
England Dan &
John Ford Coley
I'd Really Love To See
You Tonight
A slow burn compared to their other songs, this almost functions as a recruiting tool for the choir: They don't want to change your life, but they'd really love to see you sing with them tonight.
Sloan
Everything You've Done Wrong
Excellent balance of ba-da-bop-ba-das with the lyrics and some rare solo vocal moments. Sloan is a good band. Choir! Choir! Choir! is a good choir.
Fleetwood Mac
Say You Love Me
An earlier recording, there are fewer members here, revealing more individual voices and the choir's deeply held demographic secret: Just like my high-school choir, there are six girls singing for every guy who's there.
Wham
Freedom
Higher highs than George Michael. This may be a part-time choir but it won't bring you down. Promise.
Bryan Adams
Run to You
Vocals come through like a rich, full-bodied wine with hints of careful picking but without the pretension of that description. Stick around for the clapping.

TIFFing with the stars

Abstract: star Juliette Lewis hits Organic Avenue in New York, and Daniel Craig escaped to Bali's Como Shambala Estate. That said, importing Toronto's 889 Yoga and Wellness Spa may be Thompson Hotel's smartest move yet in cultivating authentic local experiences for high-profile guests. I've done downward dogs next to Rachel Weisz and Woody Harrelson at 889's Rosedale location and wouldn't be surprised if they sneak in a morning sun salutation at 889's new studio at the Thompson.

Full text: Si Si Penaloza suggests ways of optimizing your chances of a sighting, from hotel lounges to clubs the size of a postage stamp
The Toronto International Film Festival's social scene is the kickoff to the Oscar derby. It's reserved for bona-fide insiders to strut their stuff, and make distribution deals. Still, if the fest has got the cred that counts in Hollywood, it doesn't mean Toronto the Good doesn't get a bit debauched during the festival. To walk the walk, here's a few places to spot the boldface names in town.
The Burroughes Building
Hollywood's Creative Artists Agency is the top dog in Hollywood, making their party at TIFF a major score. There's simply no better "get" for eager actors than an invite to CAA's party hosted by Amy Sacco on opening weekend. Her party will be at the Burroughes Building and, with CAA along for the ride, we've got high expectations. At TIFF, talent is always trying to trade up at the CAA affair, where past bashes have seen a young Dakota Fanning nearly toppling a centrepiece to get closer to Oscar-winning producer Jeff Skoll. Last year, Hilary Swank pounced over two ottomans to greet agency powerhouse Roeg Sutherland.
Soho House Grey Goose
The satellite venue of Soho House London - on Duncan Street - will host 10 A-list TIFF parties over four nights. From Keira Knightley to Channing Tatum, five bright stars are scheduled to appear here every night. The biggest? Let's just say we're holding out for at least someone Madonna-level (or Madonna herself). Capacity at Soho House is capped at a civilized 250 people each night so crashing is futile. But there is a game afoot to close the entire street so watch this space.
Gansevoort Goodnight
Haute hotelier Michael Achenbaum parties with Ben Affleck, Rihanna and Kim Kardashian on an average night at one of his many hotel lounges - in New York, Turks and Caicos and Miami Beach. In Toronto, he hopes to draw the Moneyball (Brad Pitt) and amfAR (Leighton Meester) crowd in his first foray at TIFF. For two nights, our city will get a serious Gansevoort injection in the flabby folds of the club district. If we show Achenbaum a good time, could our own Gansevoort be far behind our new Thompson outpost? He's teamed with Matt George of Goodnight, the hottest speakeasy-style bar downtown. Just keep in mind: Goodnight is the size of a suburban living room.
La Terrasse AMC & Nikki Beach
Global lifestyle and club brand Nikki Beach is a favourite with stars at Cannes. This year at TIFF they're partnering with the network AMC and taking over some pretty prime-time real estate: the outdoor terrace of the TIFF Lightbox. With AMC hosting some more intimate gatherings, Mad Men 's Jon Hamm may put in face time here while in town rallying for his wife Jennifer Westfeldt's film Friends With Kids (in which he also plays a supporting role). She patiently supported him on his maiden foray into the festival fray for last year's The Town . Stalkers, you might want to pick up some suction cups at Canadian Tire and give parkour a try.
The Thompson Toronto
Magnums of Moët aren't the only things that draw celebrities. We're seeing a real trend toward celeb migration to the feel-good sector as well - Hick star Juliette Lewis hits Organic Avenue in New York, and Daniel Craig escaped to Bali's Como Shambala Estate. That said, importing Toronto's 889 Yoga and Wellness Spa may be Thompson Hotel's smartest move yet in cultivating authentic local experiences for high-profile guests. I've done downward dogs next to Rachel Weisz and Woody Harrelson at 889's Rosedale location and wouldn't be surprised if they sneak in a morning sun salutation at 889's new studio at the Thompson.
La Societé
Nightlife czar Charles Khabouth - the impresario behind Toronto's Koolhaus, Ultra and Ame - says he was wary when approached by two major players requesting that he close his new darling La Societé for cast parties during TIFF. In the heart of Yorkville, the place is red hot and he'd like it to reign as the "people's" canteen. By people, of course, he means Torontonians with celebrity friends. "This festival is really only four days long this year," he muses, referring to the ridiculously front-loaded lineup of stars at TIFF, "I won't close for half the festival."
The Hoxton
When Kenny Hotz (of Kenny vs. Spenny ) and British expat Richard Lambert open up a pub called The Hoxton, TIFF's tribe of overweight yet still somehow undernourished Santa Monica-based publicists are going to fall in love at first sight. Might have something to do with Lambert, the once-upon-a-time Alfie of Queen Street aging so very well. Also, if anyone can get Ryan Gosling, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michael Fassbender in one place - Queen and Bathurst - it's hawkish hustler Lambert.
Buca
Must be that prized jamon hanging on meat hooks that makes headliners feel safe here. Last year had Graydon Carter, Megan Fox, Bill Murray, Jon Hamm, Kelly Lynch and John Legend packed into a back room the size of postage stamp. We also know Roots founder Michael Budman loves smoked meat and is known to travel in groups including Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones (Matt Damon also used to model for Budman back in the day). If anyone can pull off a last-minute Matt-Brad-George reunion, it's Budman.
Morton's at the Park Hyatt
The Yankee steakhouse was a great fit for the cast dinner for the redneck chronicles of Jesse James back in 2007. The film starred Brad Pitt, which meant that Angelina was also on hand to amplify the wattage when the couple showed up. Studios love Morton's for its Fort Knox-tight layout - Brad and Ange came in the front, had seven or so bites of steak, then made a clean break through one of landlord Park Hyatt's multiple exits. When speculating on venues for a private dinner for Clooney and Gosling and The Ides of March , this spot is definitely on my radar.
Jason Reitman's Living Room
We owe the fest's bright new downtown home to the Reitmans, so they're the clearly first family of TIFF. An invitation to their digs in the residential tower where the Lightbox is located is by far the biggest get. Though Jason's latest film, Young Adults , is not showing at TIFF, word is that Charlize Theron and Diablo Cody may be doing some Oscar groundwork during the festival.

LISTING AGENT
Paul Nusca, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
The Action: Two weekend open houses and 26 private showings were arranged for buyers to tour this modern, two-storey house in the Junction.
What They Got: Set on a 17-by-127-foot lot in the 1930s, this three-bedroom residence has a long and narrow layout, but feels spacious with columns rather than walls separating the entertaining space, dining area and family room.
* There is a separate kitchen outfitted with a pantry, stainless steel appliances and a walkout to a covered deck with a gas outlet, fenced garden and an oversized garage that exits to a rear laneway.
* Four-piece bathrooms are located amidst the second floor bedrooms and off the lower level recreation room.
The Agent's Take: "It was right in the heart of the Junction within a walk to all the stores and restaurants," says agent Paul Nusca, who states the property is representative of the local housing stock with the exception of a rare powder room on the main floor and renovated bathroom with a whirlpool tub upstairs.

Abstract: Councillor Peter Milczyn, chair of the city's planning and growth committee and a member of the mayor's inner circle, said investors from around the world have been "kicking tires," at city hall. He characterizes the proposals that will be presented Tuesday as "pretty pictures based on real things that have happened all around the world." He called them "reasonable options" that should not be dismissed out of hand.

Full text: Toronto Councillor Doug Ford held private talks with real estate and business leaders and one of the world's largest mall operators to produce a proposal that will fundamentally change the publicly approved strategy for the eastern Port Lands and put a large retail centre where the mouth of the Don River was supposed to flow.
Councillor Ford, the brother of Mayor Rob Ford and his closest adviser, has spent the week promoting a fast-track revitalization for the roughly 180 hectares of city-owned land at the mouth of the Don River that would include a Ferris wheel, ice rinks at a former power plant, a waterfront hotel and what he describes as a "mega-mall." The Etobicoke councillor says he has met with a long line of local and international investors about the waterfront, including Australian-based Westfield Group, which operates 124 shopping centres worldwide, but says his notions are not based on any one company's plans.
The concept, which will be unveiled to city council's executive committee on Tuesday, further raises concerns about foreign developers' plans for the coveted waterfront real estate overtaking the public's interest.
The concerns are about replacing the already approved expanse of urban green space on the lakefront with retail. The privacy of the talks, derided this week as "backroom planning," has also angered critics.
Drawings of the new designs have not been made public, but a copy of a "preliminary structure plan" prepared for the Toronto Port Lands Co. and obtained by The Globe and Mail shows a wider mouth for the Don River following the path of the existing Keating Channel, the stagnant waterway where the river now ends. A finger of parkland would also run south along the west side of the Don Roadway to provide flood control into the shipping channel for the river.
That's a dramatic change from the existing proposal for the site. That plan, prepared by a three-government agency - Waterfront Toronto - and backed by the former city council, would see the creation of a new urban park along the banks of a newly created river mouth that would flow in a wide curve through the Port Lands before emptying into the city's inner harbour.
Councillor Ford says the alternative plan adds an additional 36 hectares of valuable land for development. It is a starting point, he said, and is not cast in stone.
"We are open to great ideas - any great ideas," he told The Globe and Mail. "We are going to do consultations out our ying-yang."
The process will be "all transparent," with requests for proposals for all projects, he said. Suggestions that one developer is behind the plans are "absolute nonsense," he added.
A spokeswomen for Westfield said the company is "always looking for opportunities," but would not comment on talks with Toronto councillors.
Councillor Ford is frustrated with the pace of development on the eastern harbour site, handled for the past decade by Waterfront Toronto, a partnership between the city, provincial and federal governments. He wants to give the job to Toronto Port Lands Co. and is hoping to alter an existing environmental assessment, now with the province, in order to get construction going in a few years.
Mark Sterling, one of two architects hired by Toronto Port Lands to provide advice and preliminary planning, said he was asked to consider a list of potential land uses, including a "large urban retail centre." The other consultant is Eric Kuhne, owner of London-based CivicArts, a firm with projects around the world, including the revitalization of the Belfast shipyards and Cockle Bay Wharf in Sydney. Mr. Kuhne will present more detailed artist's renderings of the new concept for the site at Tuesday's meeting.
The addition of a retail centre, Mr. Sterling said, is designed to trigger development in the area. Offices for high-tech industry also have been added to the plans, he said. "We are speculating about what the future might be to start the public discussion."
City Councillor Adam Vaughan, a frequent critic of the mayor and his brother, said the new plan leaves many questions unanswered - the most important being flood protection. "They haven't solved the flooding problem," said Mr. Vaughan, one of several council members to get a briefing on the plans. "It is all about building a big, huge, honking mall. It is Yorkdale on the waterfront."
Councillor Peter Milczyn, chair of the city's planning and growth committee and a member of the mayor's inner circle, said investors from around the world have been "kicking tires," at city hall. He characterizes the proposals that will be presented Tuesday as "pretty pictures based on real things that have happened all around the world." He called them "reasonable options" that should not be dismissed out of hand.
Councillor Michael Thompson, chair of the economic development committee, said there has been "a parade" of people to city hall to ask about plans for the waterfront, confirming Westfield was one of them. "There have been a lot of folks that have come and said, 'You have a jewel here.' All sorts of people have come forward," he said.

Saving of EI centres in Tory ridings amid downsizing elsewhere draws fire

Full text: A Liberal MP wants to know why the federal government opted to keep open two small employment insurance processing centres in Nova Scotia ridings held by Conservatives amid a national downsizing plan that's expected to cut 600 jobs.
Gerry Byrne, who represents Humber-St. Barbe-Baie Verte in western Newfoundland, obtained an internal memo sent to EI centre employees that says processing in Atlantic Canada will be consolidated in Moncton, St. John's, Halifax and the Nova Scotia towns of New Glasgow and Bridgewater.
The memo, a copy of which was provided to The Canadian Press, says 600 positions will be cut through attrition and reassignment.
The New Glasgow office is in the riding of Defence Minister Peter MacKay, while the Bridgewater seat is held by Tory MP Gerald Keddy, Mr. Byrne noted.
"What was it about Bridgewater and New Glasgow that made them be considered as cost-effective centres?" Mr. Byrne asked.
"Can I get those criteria so I can determine if those criteria are being applied fairly?"
Mr. MacKay had nothing to do with deciding which locations would be closed, spokesman Jay Paxton insisted Thursday.
"I'll just tell you Minister MacKay was not a part of Service Canada's review of the locations under the EI modernization program," Mr. Paxton said.
Mr. Keddy also denied having anything to do with the Service Canada review.
"These sites, I would assume, were picked because of their location," Mr. Keddy said in an interview. "They're also larger sites.... Bridgewater is the hub of the South Shore."
Alyson Queen, a spokeswoman for Human Resources Minister Diane Finley, said the cuts are taking place across Canada and are the result of a review that took national and regional concerns into consideration.
"Many factors were considered in choosing each of the sites, including existing labour force and skill availability, bilingual capability, cost of real estate, among others," Ms. Queen said in an e-mail.
She did not say specifically why the centres in New Glasgow and Bridgewater would remain open.
The NDP said the cuts will prove particularly harmful to workers in remote and rural areas because it will mean fewer staff available to assist them at local claims processing centres.
"Many Canadians don't have Internet access or the computer skills needed to complete these forms online," Claude Patry, the party's EI critic, said in a statement.
"Losing your job is stressful enough as it is. It is often better for these workers to have direct contact with a real person, not a machine."
Mr. Byrne said he favours keeping smaller centres open and would like to find ways for other small towns to keep their processing centres operational.

Full text: This 'flawless' recreational retreat is set amid the rocky islets of Georgian Bay
The Listing
Asking price: $6.8-million
Taxes: Not available
Agent: George Webster (Moffat Dunlap Real Estate Ltd.)
The Island
In the 1930s, the islands of Georgian Bay near Parry Sound, Ont., were mostly untamed wilderness. A Toronto-based family purchased 12-acre Chamberlain Island from the Crown and have been spending their summers there ever since.
During the past 80 years, the owners, who asked that their name not be used, have built a family compound for the grandparents, kids and grandchildren.
The family has planted gardens that have become well-established through the years, with beds of flowers surrounding a kitchen garden that provides lettuces and herbs.
Granite pathways and wooden walkways wind throughout the island to link the terraces, cottages, gardens and waterfront.
The geography of the island and its surrounding waters provides two protected deep water harbours.
Kids can swim or launch their canoes and kayaks from a protected sand beach.
And for those with a float plane, Chamberlain Island's waters and harbours can accommodate that too.
Lots of big, smooth rocks let swimmers ease into the bay.
The main vistas face west-northwest for sunset views, notes real estate agent George Webster of Moffat Dunlap Real Estate Ltd.
"It's practically a flawless island," Mr. Webster says.
The cottages
The tradition among cottagers on Georgian Bay is to build a main cottage and then place smaller sleeping cabins around the island to take advantage of the views, breezes and privacy that island living allows.
On Chamberlain Island, the main lodge is the home base for four separate sleeping cabins, two boathouses, a laundry house and a sauna.
Family and guests congregate in the 1800-square-foot main lodge. Timber frame construction creates soaring vaulted ceilings and expansive windows that can disappear to let in the fresh air. There's a floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace in the combined living room and dining area.
A large separate kitchen has a six-burner gas range, two ovens, two built-in refrigerators, two dishwashers and a brick, wood-burning pizza oven.
At the rear of the lodge, the owners have a floor-to-ceiling wine cooler, a walk-in cooler, butler's pantry and wine bar.
Outside, large expanses of flat rock have been used as the setting for a series of terraces leading to the shore.
The master bedroom cottage provides 3,000-square-feet of space. The living room has a fireplace and views to the water. There's a master bedroom with his-and-hers ensuite bathrooms and a separate office with fireplace. Two more bedrooms and a bathroom accommodate family members.
Guests to the island often jostle for a place in their preferred sleeping cabin. Most seem to favour Sunset Cottage, which is the island's original log cabin from the 1930s.
But others are attracted to the waterside setting of Pink Cottage, which at one time provided accommodation for the cook.
The Sunrise Cottage is big enough for a family with its two bedrooms, two bathrooms, living room and kitchenette.
The boathouses are rare on Georgian Bay, where townships often ban anything more than a single-storey floating boathouse.
In this case, the island has a large main boathouse with a second storey loft containing two bedrooms and a bathroom. The first floor houses a cedar sauna, kitchenette, a bathroom and a 40-foot boat slip.
A single-storey boathouse in its own protected harbour has a single slip, workshop, kitchenette, office and bathroom.
Sans Souci
Sans Souci is one of the more highly-coveted areas within the thirty-thousand islands of Georgian Bay. The cottagers include wealthy industrialists and tycoons from both sides of the border.
The area is near the southern end of the chain of islands, which makes it about a two-hour drive from Toronto.
"It's a really established cottage community. People have been coming here since the 1800s," Mr. Webster says.
Originally many Americans came up to fish for lake trout. Some of the Pennsylvanians created a fishing lodge that still operates today, notes Mr. Webster.
As part of Lake Huron, Georgian Bay can require great skill of boaters when the weather and waters occasionally become wild. Navigating between the rocky islets can be challenging too. But it's a relatively easy cruise to Chamberlain Island from Parry Sound.
"You come out the South Channel," Mr. Webster says. "It's all protected water."
Local boaters often drop anchor at the uninhabited "picnic islands" known as The Umbrellas and The Minks.
Sans Souci also has a tennis club, community centre and day camp for kids.

Abstract: "Most homes, the elevator stops on a floor before the roof deck, [but here] you can age into the townhome as you get older, so you don't have to worry about the stairs," Mr. [Dan Flomen] says. "It's an alternative to a single-floor luxury condo."

In one of the country's most affluent neighbourhoods, Hush Homes's new infill development will incorporate many of the lavish comforts and conveniences expected of grand mansions into a smaller package and price point.
Situated between the Bridle Path and Post Road, just off Bayview Avenue, the townhouse collection will offer 20 three-storey units with private backyards, elevators and finished basements with double garages.
Prices will start at $1.9-million.
"It's the only one of its kind in the market," says Dan Flomen of TFN Realty, which is handling sales for the project, called Alexandria.
"You're in the heart of an area where homes go up to $20-million, but you're also in a very exclusive group of private residences as opposed to large townhouse projects you see throughout the city."
After sales commenced last month, interest is being generating among locals looking to downsize from $4-million and $5-million homes.
"Some people are moving out of their older houses and here they're getting all the newest technology ...," Mr. Flomen says. "But we've had a number of singles, couples and professionals who want to live in the Bridle Path, but are not at that point yet to afford that $5-million dollar house."
The community is also well established with high-calibre amenities, including the Granite Club, Donalda and Rosedale golf clubs, and Edwards Gardens, as well as the Shops at Don Mills, York University's Glendon campus and Sunnybrook Hospital.
"You're five minutes to Bayview Village and you're on Bayview, which means you're a quick drive to the Bayview extension or a quick shoot across to the Don Valley," Mr. Flomen adds.
The neo-Georgian style townhouses will have a minimum of 3,700 square feet of living space, plus several outdoor spaces, including rooftop decks with electric, gas and water outlets and optional features, from summer kitchens and fireplaces to exercise areas with outdoor showers and hot tubs.
"Although we live in Canada with a lot of snow and cold weather, people still like to be able to go outside and entertain outside," Mr. Flomen says.
"Unlike other townhome complexes - which tend to be back to back or stacked or just have one [outdoor] feature - this has a backyard, a balcony off one of the floors and a roof garden."
Another component unique to these models will be circular wood staircases and elevators connecting all five levels.
"Most homes, the elevator stops on a floor before the roof deck, [but here] you can age into the townhome as you get older, so you don't have to worry about the stairs," Mr. Flomen says. "It's an alternative to a single-floor luxury condo."
Each floor will typically offer two variations for buyers to choose between, such as finishing the basement with a nanny suite or media room, or arranging an upper floor with two bedrooms or one bedroom and a den.
Master suites will occupy an entire floor with walk-in closets, a gas fireplace and private bathroom.
The interior appointments will be upscale with wide-plank hardwood floors and nine- and 10-foot ceilings, plus main-floor kitchens - which can face the front or rear yard - with custom work from Cameo Fine Cabinetry, granite, marble or quartz counters, butler's pantries and high-end Sub-Zero and Wolf appliances.
Monthly common fees will be $600.
Construction will be completed by fall 2012.

Full text: Architects Robert Kastelic and Kelly Buffey take their cue from the county in their quietly handsome Maison Glissade
jmays@globeandmail.com
The elderly timber barns that dot the rolling hills of southern Ontario's Grey County have long brought joy to the hearts of sentimental landscape painters and watercolourists. The stalwart plainness and picturesque dilapidation of these buildings help them fit into the myth, promoted by such artists, that rural life is the blissful Arcadian idyll they portray in their popular pictures. (It isn't.)
This is not the fault of the barns themselves, of course. They are tough and serviceable structures, made to withstand wind and weather and hard use. And to be sure, the simple, workmanlike designs of these farm buildings occasionally strike the flint of tougher, more sophisticated imagination, and a spark flies off, kindling a creative flame.
That's what happened when Robert Kastelic and Kelly Buffey, principals in the Toronto architectural firm of Atelier Kastelic Buffey, started thinking about how best to craft a new getaway house for a family of five with property in the Grey County resort town of The Blue Mountains. Looking to the county's vernacular building traditions for artistic ideas, the architects came up with a scheme that mirrors these old local ways of doing things.
Maison Glissade, as the spartan, quietly handsome 2,400-square-foot result has been dubbed, has the long, pitched, gable-ended top of a barn, and is clad and roofed in red cedar planking that will weather down to silvery grey with the passage of years. Nestled among trees on its suburban-sized corner lot, the plain-lined dwelling doesn't look much like what's around it - romantic Alpine chalets, modernist bungalows à la Etobicoke, that kind of thing. But it looks a lot better, and considerably more well-grounded in the earth.
Which is not to say that this two-storey house is a simple transcription of a barn into a small Ontario town. Mr. Kastelic and Ms. Buffey have introduced several updatings of the structure's historic precedent, though without jostling its workaday profile very much. In their most dramatic move, for example - but this really isn't all that dramatic, as it happens - the architects have slid the upper level smartly off the bottom storey along the long axis, creating a deep overhang on the end facing the ski slopes and, on the other end, a broad deck accessible from the second storey.
In other respects, the changes to the basic barn format have been small, or completely hidden. The building's steel frame, for instance, does not affect the exterior appearance, but it allows the interior to be completely free of rafters, beams and columns. This means that the open-plan upper floor, where the very active family cooks, eats and relaxes together, is one clear-span space under the high ridge of the roof, devoid of structural clutter.
There are no skylights, and there is no washroom on this level. The floor is fashioned from European white oak. Illumination is provided by pot lamps sunk into the ceiling, by windows on the two long walls and by glass doors and large openings on the room's two ends. The room's centre of visual gravity is a great dining table, behind which hangs a digitally composed photographic panorama by Vancouver artist Scott McFarland. (This artist's interesting images usually depict the places where nature and culture, country and city, meet and get mixed up - which makes having his picture here, in a barn-like structure that displays a rustic face supported by industrial steel bones, seem especially appropriate.)
Like a Palladian villa, Maison Glissade keeps its most sociable areas high, in order to command good views of the grounds and the scenery round about, and its more intimate quarters down below. The darker, lower of the two above-ground storeys contains five bedrooms and a big mud room for the family's sporting equipment and below that is a finished basement.
I don't want to make too much of this building. It's an entirely thoughtful though quite modest response to the clients' desire for a year-round second home near the slopes they love to ski down and the trails they like to hike and bike and horse-back ride on. And if a glance around the neighbourhood is anything to go on, this family could have done much worse, and happily chose not to.
I understand why some town folk want their country houses to look just like their city houses, or like some architectural cliché such as the standard ski chalet - though it suggests that they and their designers really have no feeling or respect at all for the country and its best old building legacy. In commissioning Maison Glissade from two talented young architects with open minds and eyes, the couple that owns the house has demonstrated exactly the right kind of regard for the countryside they enjoy so much. I hope other customers of new architecture in rural Ontario follow their good example.

Full text: Paul Oberman helped shape Toronto, while keeping it in touch with its history
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
How can a city thank someone for making it a better place?
Name a place after that person, so he or she becomes part of the city fabric. With that name forever on resident's lips, the debt is repaid; better yet, in a hundred years, history buffs will want to know who and why, and a whole new generation will learn.
A school is good, a park even better, but, in my opinion, a street is best.
When Paul Oberman, president of Woodcliffe Landmark Properties, died tragically in a plane crash at the age of 53 this past March, it wasn't long before those who worked closely with him decided to see if such an honour was feasible.
Unlike ordinary developers, Mr. Oberman didn't shy away from the difficulties and costs associated with the restoration of heritage properties. In fact, he embraced them: "He sort of set the standard for us to think beyond our buildings, to think about the larger precincts and context within which our buildings were," said architect Bruce Kuwabara on a local television call-in program this past May, "and if you look at the buildings he's actually worked on, they weren't just any old heritage buildings."
I'll say. Mr. Oberman was a champion of adaptive reuse with a keen eye for places that enriched city living. That's evident in his works, starting in the late 1980s with the magnificent King James Place - which Mr. Kuwabara's KPMB worked on for Woodcliffe - the Gooderham Flatiron building, the North Toronto Station (now the Summerhill LCBO) and the recently completed retail strip across the street from the old station known affectionately as the Five Thieves. What's less known is the amount of personal time he gave to fight the good fight: in late 2009, Mr. Oberman fought - though he ultimately lost - for the retention of the Second World War-era hangars at Downsview Airport.
And he didn't stop at Toronto, with projects in Montreal and Ottawa. But his heart, and his best work, is here, including the short city block of Market Street from Front to The Esplanade. Opposite the St. Lawrence Market, Mr. Oberman assembled three heritage properties - one dating as early as 1858 - and a small automotive garage (demolished in 2010) and enlisted Taylor Smyth architects to envision a tourist-friendly concentration of restaurants contained within them, along with the design of a new two-storey marquee restaurant at the corner of Market and The Esplanade (currently under construction). Tucked into what is currently a dark, dead zone below the market's east side deck, a European-style flower market could spill onto the street in summer and shelter behind glass doors in winter.
"It just makes the street more animated," says Eve Lewis, Mr. Oberman's widow, a veteran real estate professional and the new president of Woodcliffe. "And I think, when people go shopping for food, flowers are part of it."
A new street name could be a part of it, too.
Shortly after Mr. Oberman's passing, architect Michael Taylor floated the idea of having the block renamed "Oberman Way." Employees at Woodcliffe got behind this, as did the Oberman family, and a website was created last month, www.pauloberman.ca. Visitors can sign an online petition in support of the re-naming and, if they'd like to carry it a step further, the creation of a pedestrian-only zone from Front to The Esplanade as well as the flower market idea - both things about which Mr. Oberman felt strongly - can be clicked as well.
Once the petition reaches 5,000 names, Woodcliffe will file an application with the city for the street name change. In addition, they'll be able to make a stronger case for the pedestrian zone and the flower market when those items come up for debate. And they most certainly will: Naysayers will lament of the loss of parking along that stretch of Market Street, and others will argue that the changing of a long-standing street name is no way to honour a heritage-loving developer.
Hopefully, cooler heads will remind them that when the new St. Lawrence Market North Building is completed a few years from now, those parking spaces will be replaced ... along with dozens and dozens more, and those with a fondness for the Market Street name will take comfort in the knowledge that it will still exist south of The Esplanade. The fiscal-minded will understand that the more people-friendly places Toronto has, the better it is for the economy.
"Pedestrian-only is not just for the restaurants, it's for the Market, it's for people to go outside," offers Ms. Lewis. "This is one of those unique opportunities, and they don't come very often - most people aren't crazy enough to assemble a whole street," she laughs.
But Paul Oberman was "a dreamer" says Mr. Kuwabara. When I dream about a restaurant/heritage district with that je ne sais quoi that comes with "café society" (to borrow Ms. Lewis's term) and a new pedestrian corridor that will connect the Novotel and condominiums along The Esplanade to the market, up to architect Jerome Markson's award-winning Market Square building and then to King Street and beyond, I get chills.
Ted Rogers got his Way. Let's thank another of our modern city-building heroes the same way.

Full text: I had my heart set on a dining-room fireplace and English cottage feel. He wanted not much yard and a dry basement. Period
Now that we're on the other side of downsizing, I think I can say this: downsizing is huge.
Five years ago we cleaned, cleansed, purged closets, basement, shelves.
Hefty old bedroom suites went bye-bye thanks to the beefy movers from a local mission who were happy to pick them up for us.
Books got sorted, with much whinging on my part, boxed and sent to a secondhand book shop.
Dishes that were rarely used got sent with one of our sons to his new apartment, along with an assortment of chairs.
We went from a generous space to, well, how to describe it? Easy to vacuum.
It had been a journey, finding this right spot. We considered every possibility with the exception of a yurt.
We looked at everything in real-estate land that year. And we disagreed on what form our new living quarters should take.
I fell in love two or three times.
The first I thought a winner was a sweet little house that reminded me of a Barbara Pym cottage, complete with apple trees for "a stroll 'round the garden in the evening," as one of her characters likes to do. But there was really no place to keep our essentials, like our shoes.
Then there was the smallish house that bordered on a footpath down to the marsh.
"Imagine the deer that would come to our garden to feed," I said, trying to appeal to the lover of wildlife in my husband.
"Too isolated down here," he said.
My other favourite spot had a fireplace in the dining room. I'd read enough English novels, seen enough Merchant Ivory productions with the flicker of flames casting shadows on the dining table while the hostess spoons ragout from a Spode terrine, to know that a fireplace in the dining room was my heart's desire.
His argument against that one?
"Look outside the bedroom window," he said. "We'd be right up against that doughnut shop."
"I can think of nothing better than to wake up to the aroma of double-chocolate doughnuts," was my feeble retort.
And the one with the lovely white walls and huge windows had a trickling stream flowing through the basement.
I wanted a cottage kind of place where we could hang out a name sign, like "Mallards" after the house in the Mapp and Lucia novels.
I hoped for charming, cozy, leaded windows, bookshelves beside the fireplace, an interesting neighbourhood, enough room for the kids when they landed.
He wanted not much yard. Dry Basement. Period.
We looked at everything from handyman specials to the houses near the university with "rooms for students."
Having just bade farewell to our own three homegrown students, we weren't sure about taking on other people's offspring.
There were condos with fees, apartments with rent.
There were houses large and small each with their unique problems and delights.
There was one so tiny you could only get out of one side of the bed (but it was cute!).
We went to the library and checked out American architect Sarah Susanka's book The Not So Big House .
Ms. Susanka touts quality over quantity, mimes the Japanese credo of less is more, says that better not bigger is the way to go.
I hoped I'd remember her charming bit of philosophy when I couldn't find enough room to keep the teapot.
But finally one wintry afternoon, there it was: our tiny perfect house, a one-floor bungalow with leaded windows, a mere smattering of grass, a room at the back where the sun pours in with enough space for people to sleep when they visit. It had no fireplace in the dining room like the double-chocolate house did, but it was near the marsh and the mallards.
Dear Reader, we bought it.
Five years hence and I can say this: Even though I can see my husband putting on the breakfast kettle in the kitchen from where I'm brushing my teeth in the bathroom, it works.
Our friends have found us and we enjoy them as much in this small space as we did at the other place. The kids come, now with spouses and soon with our first grandchild.
The birthday cakes taste as good out of the oven in a small kitchen as they did in the larger version. Mendelssohn's Scottish Symphony sounds as lovely here as it did there.
My books are happily ensconced beside the fireplace (which doesn't work), and their words have as much meaning in this house as they did in the other.
The powder-blue delphiniums in this tiny patch are the same heavenly blue as they were in that larger patch.
The Wife Of Bath roses grow as soft and as pink as if they'd been bred in the garden of a manor house (you know the kind, with a fireplace in the dining room).
There are no deer in the backyard, but the raccoons know where we live. The feeders are full of Baltimore orioles and hummingbirds in early summer. The goldfinches come for the niger seed.
In autumn, the yard will be full of sunflowers and the birds they bring. Our new neighbours are as wonderful as our former ones.
And if you decide to downsize, you can depend on this: Your kids will start filling up your basement again with stuff they want to keep and use, "but not right now."
Judy Pollard Smith lives in Hamilton.

Foreign buyers see value in U.S. real estate

Full text: For the first time since the bubble popped, some markets appear to have bottomed out. A strong loonie makes the deals even better
INVESTMENT REPORTER
As an alternative investment, U.S. real estate may never look so attractive to Canadians again.
Sunny havens such as Fort Myers, Fla., have seen property values plummet as much as 50 per cent since the start of 2007, while the value of the loonie has soared about 15 per cent during the same period. Add to the mix near record-low lending rates - not to mention the capricious stock market - and you have conditions snowbirds wouldn't even have dared to dream about just a decade ago.
In fact, parts of the U.S. residential market look so beaten up that investors from emerging markets have begun to snap up properties, with Brazilian buyers particularly interested in Miami recently.
"The basic idea [of buying U.S. real estate] makes sense for Canadians. The dollar is strong and the U.S. market has had a major collapse," says Scott Baker, portfolio manager at MacNicol & Associates Asset Management, a Toronto-based investment firm.
For the first time since property values cracked in 2007, some popular markets, such as upscale neighbourhoods in Los Angeles and Miami, appear to have bottomed out.
But overall house prices are still falling across the U.S. because of downward pressure from foreclosures, of which there are still approximately 1.6 million in the pipeline, Mr. Baker says. That means investors need to do their homework.
"Across the U.S. there is still a fair amount of stress," he says. "The market is in a long process of bottoming."
House prices across the U.S. have declined steadily since 2007, and the average value has fallen 31.5 per cent over the last four years, according to the S & P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. Average home prices across the United States are back where they were in the middle of 2002.
Mr. Baker says there are attractive investment opportunities in U.S. residential real estate for investors who take the time to research local markets. His firm's MacNicol 360 Degree U.S. Realty Income Fund has holdings in Indiana, Illinois, Georgia and Florida. He favours the southeast over the western U.S. because the prices tend to be lower and the economic and population growth prospects look stronger.
Not only are valuations reasonable by historical standards, but demand for rental properties has risen as families are forced out of homeownership. This situation has created an opportunity for investors to generate income from their investment.
"People still have to live somewhere. They are renting, and rents are rising across the nation by more than inflation," he says. "Every time there is another foreclosure you can bet that someone will have to rent."
A Canadian interested in a retirement or recreational property in Florida, for example, would likely be able to generate a small annual return of between 1 per cent and 6 per cent in today's market, Mr. Baker says.
The low prices have certainly piqued the curiosity of a lot of Canadians. A survey released in March by Leger Marketing on behalf of the Bank of Montreal reported that one in five Canadians are "interested" in buying a U.S. property.
Florida has always been a favoured location of Canadians. And although the region has experienced some of the biggest valuation drops of anywhere in the country, popular areas such as Miami and Fort Lauderdale are beginning to see prices firm up again as money moves back in from Brazil, Venezuela and Europe.
Foreign buyers are doing a lot of the deals in Miami Beach. Andy Katz, of WiseCat Realtors, says 90 per cent of his clients buying local properties come from outside the country, including Canada, Italy, Britain and Dubai. Canadians, he adds, appear to move more slowly than other foreigners because they are searching for exceptionally good deals or hesitant about their financing.
The Miami area has seen home prices tumble as much as 50 per cent off their early 2007 highs. But local activity has picked up dramatically in recent months, with foreclosure and short sales comprising about 16 per cent of deals today, down from 47 per cent at the start of the year. (Short sales are stressed sales where the bank does not actually foreclose on a property).
"A lot of buyers come in expecting great discounts today. But those days are gone. 2009 was the best time to buy," Mr. Katz says. Foreclosure properties were regularly selling with 50-per-cent discounts. Today, they sell at discounts of between 20 per cent and 28 per cent, he said.
At the moment, the best deals in the Miami area are in South Beach, an area where the properties on average are older. There are currently 172 properties listed under $150,000 and 50 per cent of them are within walking distance to the beach. Generally, these are small, art deco-style, low rises. Their monthly maintenance fees run $320 or less and the sizes range from 240 square feet to 440 square feet.
Mr. Katz strongly advises that buyers who want to rent out their property use a local management service, which charges about 20 per cent of annual rental income. Not only does it remove the headache of trying to oversee tenants from thousands of kilometres away, but it allows owners to navigate local bylaws. Miami Beach, for example, has restricted rental policies, limiting the number of times most condos can be rented out to just twice a year. That makes it very hard to generate short-term income.
Some local management firms will actually walk renters in and out of a building to present them as "friends" of the owners, he says.
Financing U.S. housing purchases has always been a challenge for Canadians, and conditions became exceptionally tough during the recession. Laura Parson, a mortgage specialist with Bank of Montreal based in Calgary, suggests clients take equity out of their Canadian homes through a second mortgage - essentially a line of credit. The bank will also facilitate pre-approval status for clients with its U.S. subsidiary, Harris Private Bank.
U.S. banks had closed their windows to foreigners looking for mortgages, but they have begun to realize that if they want to get the market cleaned up they have to support these buyers. They are increasingly willing to provide mortgages in cases where a foreign buyer puts down a minimum of 40 per cent to 45 per cent, Mr. Katz says. His advice to any Canadian shopping in the U.S. is to find a local mortgage broker who will work with at least half a dozen banks, otherwise, he says, the broker is unlikely to be able to negotiate a deal.
U.S. banks are "coming out of their cave and lending money" again, says Dale Walters, chief executive officer of Keats Connelly, a cross-border wealth management firm in Phoenix. In recent months, some have developed lending processes specifically for Canadians, realizing that they are generally a good base of customers.
He suggests Canadians look at using the U.S. operations of the Royal Bank, National Bank or Desjardins Group. By borrowing from a U.S. institution, investors remove the currency risk that comes with having their loans in Canadian currency and any rental income in U.S. dollars.
Mr. Walters, author of the recently published book Buying Real Estate in the U.S.: The Concise Guide for Canadians , warns that investors in U.S. housing need to protect themselves from litigation by forming limited liability partnerships. An LLP would shield Canadian assets from any law suit arising from an accident on the property, he says.

Full text: Like any first-time buyer, I was confident I could manage the house's flaws. Thousands of dollars later, my to-do list keeps growing
I swaggered into home ownership with the naive confidence of a first-time buyer. I had a down payment, a spreadsheet of monthly expenses and an IKEA gift card - I was ready.
After a few weeks of looking at well-built, renovated homes in my price range, I grew bored. These houses looked like everyone else's houses. They had no heart, no character. They didn't speak to me the way I felt my first home should. I wanted a warm, fuzzy feeling in my gut.
In that moment of weakness, I saw it - a listing for a century home in a charming town just 15 minutes outside the city.
"I like old stuff," I thought. "I like charming small towns with fall fairs and friendly neighbours. They'd probably bring me a pie the day I move in!" How could I resist? A viewing was scheduled.
The warm fuzzies started as I drove down the street. The house sits across from a huge field and winding river. This field and its adjacent community centre are home to annual bake sales, community breakfasts and theatre productions, and the all-important fall fair. Images of being buddies with the locals and looking out my living room window to see livestock and midway rides flooded my head.
My real-estate agent made a valiant effort to bring me back to reality. "That river floods," he warned as we turned into the driveway. I barely heard him as I gazed up at the sprawling white house with periwinkle trim. It was already whispering my name.
The front door brought us into a charming enclosed front porch flooded with sunlight. A turn of the glass doorknob (and a gentle shove of the shoulder) revealed everything I hadn't known I wanted. Creaky hardwood floors, an exposed brick wall, a nook off the family room - perfect for my library and office - and the kitchen, a huge room with original tin ceilings, a functional 1950s Frigidaire stove and a view of the gigantic backyard. This was it.
I was ready to move in immediately, but somewhere in the back of my mind, a little voice prompted a home inspection. I was a knowledgeable and well-prepared purchaser. I knew about these things.
One week later the inspection took place and the results were (mostly) favourable. The roof would need to be replaced in a year or two, a shower wall was mushy and it seemed like some of the electrical work had been a DIY job. Over all, I was told there wasn't much to worry about and it was a great, character-filled home. A real gem. I agreed wholeheartedly.
The three months before the closing date flew by. Paint colours were selected, furniture was ordered, room layouts were sketched onto many a sticky note. I experienced a few moments of doubt that I considered a natural result of making the biggest purchase of my young life, but was still convinced I had made the right decision.
The first time I really began to wonder if a 135-year-old behemoth of a house was the best choice for a single, 25-year-old woman was when we went for a final walkthrough. My brother pointed out that I wouldn't be able to put a chair with wheels into the library nook because I would roll back over the home's sloped floors. I noticed that every surface in the bedrooms was wallpapered, including the ceilings and inside the closets, and that the kitchen counter was abnormally low. I reassured myself that the house was sound, that these were cosmetic imperfections and I didn't want a chair with wheels anyway.
A month after I moved in, every ceiling in the upper level started to drip when it rained. After hours of chipping decades-old wallpaper from the master bedroom and remudding the walls, water seeped in and effectively melted the work that had been done.
It turned out the previous owners had been less than truthful about their oil heating costs, and I had been unaware buyers can ask to see previous bills. Then an inspection by an electrician revealed $5,000 in work to bring everything up to code. And how had I not processed the fact that my laundry room was in an unheated addition at the opposite end of the house from my bedroom? Those pipes burst soon enough.
It was time to admit I had been blinded by the excitement, distracted by the charm and foolish to ignore the advice of those around me. What had I been thinking? Why hadn't someone stopped me? In truth, my parents and boyfriend, co-workers and friends had tried, but I was too convinced of my own invincibility to listen. I finally understood why parents get so frustrated with kids who think they know everything. Because kids who think they know everything make ridiculous decisions.
Thousands of dollars flew from what I had considered a well-padded bank account. The roof was replaced, a gas line and new furnace installed. Empty paint cans piled up as I slowly worked through each room and made the house my own. I can stand at my oddly low kitchen sink and watch my dogs frolic in the yard.
A year and a half later, I have learned to appreciate, and more importantly listen to, the opinions and advice of those around me. I still look around and add tasks to a constantly expanding list of improvements. But my roof doesn't leak, I can afford heat and I love the work I've done and the knowledge that my friends and family will stick by me even when I'm being unreasonable. The neighbours may not have brought me pie, but the house didn't flood this spring and that's good enough for me.

Is there anything more stressful than buying your first home? In this series, property expert Sandra Rinomato helps real estate novices navigate the seemingly endless hurdles facing all first-time home buyers. In tonight's episode, she counsels the adventurous Sean, who is constantly on the road with his job. Sean is fearful of committing to his first condominium, but he's also knows it's time to stop paying rent every month. His dream is to find the ideal beachside property in South Florida, which he accomplishes rather easily with Ms. Rinomato's assistance.
MUSIC
At the Concert Hall
Bravo!, 8 p.m.
Remember Sam Roberts? The native of Quebec was formerly one of the hottest names in Canadian music, courtesy of his 2001 breakout single Brother Down , but then he seemed to pull a fast fade. The Juno-winning singer-songwriter steps back into the spotlight with his intimate concert special taped at Toronto's Masonic Temple. As in Concert Hall specials past, Roberts and his band deliver songs from past and present, including his fourth studio album, Collider , but the show is more interesting when he talks with host Matt Wells in brief interview segments.
DOCUMENTARY
Frontline
PBS, 9 p.m.
In America, football is more than a game, and tonight's report examines the serious physical toll that football is taking on high-school males. According to several coaches and physicians interviewed, the players in high school today are faster, stronger and much bigger - some weighing in at more than 300 pounds. Frontline focuses on two high schools near Little Rock, Ark., where two teen players collapsed from heatstroke last summer while practising during a record-breaking heat wave. One survived, but the other died in hospital, which has school administrators questioning the wisdom of America's game.
DRAMA
Combat Hospital
ABC, Global, 10 p.m.
Religion and faith inevitably rise to the surface in times of war. This filmed-in-Toronto series follows an international surgical unit working with the wounded in the killing fields of Kandahar. In tonight's new episode, the unyielding Colonel Marks (Elias Koteas) orders the unit chaplain Marjorie (Camille Sullivan) to hold vigil with the neurosurgeon Dr. Simon Hill (Luke Mably) while he performs a difficult surgery. The problem: Marjorie appears to have lost her faith. The episode was directed by veteran Canadian actress Helen Shaver.
MOVIE
Casablanca
TCM, midnight
One of the most revered films in the annals of cinema, this wartime drama barely caused a stir when released in 1942. The story works outward from Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of Rick Blaine, a Yank running a nightclub in relatively neutral Casablanca. The local police chief Renault (Claude Rains) is aware that the club is also the place where refugees can readily obtain letters of transit allowing them to escape to America. Out of the blue, Rick's ex-flame Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) shows up seeking escape for her new husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), who is unpopular with the Nazis swarming the city. The ending is still a heartbreaker.

Full text: Down-on-their-luck towns look for economic salvation in wealthy retirees tired of living in big expensive houses and cities
Ontario's Windsor-Essex County has hit upon a formula for reinventing itself.
Last week, ground was broken for the $1.4-billion Windsor-Essex Parkway, which will link Windsor with a planned second bridge to the United States. The town of Tecumseh's waterfront park is getting a facelift, with the province pledging $4-million toward the project, and the town of Lakeshore has a $50-million arena complex under proposal. And in the past three years, more than $110-million in residential real estate was sold here.
That's a lot of action for a community devastated by the loss of thousands of manufacturing jobs less than a decade ago. The revitalization is due in part to business leaders who came together in 2008 with a plan to create economic prosperity and spur commercial and residential development.
Their strategy? To rebrand Windsor-Essex as a destination for Canada's retiring baby boomers.
"We wanted to create new jobs and investment," said Krista Del Gatto, executive officer of the Windsor-Essex County Real Estate Board. "We could do that by attracting the affluent, active retiree, the semi-retiree and age-50-plus families planning for a comfortable, secure retirement."
In 2008, facing growing unemployment and a depressed local economy, the real estate board, the local home builders association and the Windsor-Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce banded to aggressively market the region to retirees across Canada.
"We knew the retiring boomers were going to become an incredible opportunity for any community that could see them fitting into their community development plan," said Linda Smith, the chamber of commerce's president. "Our real estate prices are 30 to 50 per cent lower [than Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary and Toronto].
"It's Ontario's warmest climate, we're surrounded by water, and there's quick access to the American marketplace," she said.
At the centre of the campaign is the coalition's website, Retirehere.ca, is supplemented by outreach programs that bring prospective buyers to sample the local hotels, wineries, restaurants and casino.
The coalition is considering its campaign an early success. In the past three years, 422 "50-plus" households have moved to the area. Also, Ms. Smith says, $90-million in new luxury development has been brought to the region because of the program's success, including a new Amica Mature Lifestyles condo development.
Canadian cities are doing what a number of U.S. cities have done, says John Geha, president of Coldwell Banker's Canadian operations. "Pittsburgh really redeveloped itself from the steel industry. Dallas, Texas, really diversified itself," he said.
Retiring boomers are craving a move to smaller cities and towns, says David Foot, a demographer and author of Boom, Bust & Echo . The first wave of boomers are selling their family homes in the big cities and relocating for their retirement.
Canadian communities that were hit hard by the loss of manufacturing jobs can benefit from the increased tax base and spending potential of the retiring boomers, says Mr. Foot. He points to Elliot Lake, Ont., as a successful example of a town that rebranded itself as a retirement community after the devastating collapse of its mining industry in the early '90s.
And what are boomers looking for? Access to water and access to health care, says Mr. Foot.
"[Cities and towns] that have the right elements, that can generate peace and quiet, good health-care facilities and proximity to water, should be thinking about it," he says.
Other municipalities are standing on the sidelines for now, says Scott Brown, senior vice-president of Colliers International's residential marketing and sales services for Western Canada.
The recession has slowed things down, he says. "Many people's erosion of wealth has seen them saying, 'Freedom 55 has become Freedom 65, or Freedom 75.' "
Mr. Brown anticipates that cities on Canada's west coast, including Squamish, Abbotsford and Langley, B.C., will ultimately benefit from retirees downsizing from their big-city family homes.
Other communities will have to "get more aggressive" to attract boomers, he says, citing the Okanagan towns of Peachland, Kelowna and Vernon.
"I think there will be an interesting play in the cities where people are going to get out of their single-family home and live in multi-family buildings, where they have access to shops, culture, restaurants and education. And their counter-existence will be a single-family home on a lake or golf course," Mr. Brown says.
Windsor-Essex business leaders say their plan is working. Ms. Smith of the Chamber of Commerce says that they are hoping to expand their marketing program to attract people from Alberta and British Columbia. She notes that 28 per cent of their new 50-plus residents have come from the West.
"We are on a five-year plan. We're only three years in, and we're still expanding," she said. "But it's working, and we're still celebrating that."

Vancouver faces highest risk of housing downturn

Author: Ladurantaye, Steve

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/vancouver-faces-highest-risk-housing-downturn/docview/884676321/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "Vancouver really stands alone in its extremes across all housing types," said Craig Wright, the bank's chief economist. "It is no doubt the most stressed market in Canada and the one facing the highest risk of a downturn. With the bar set so high, owning a home is a dream that only the area's highest-earning households can contemplate."

Full text: REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Low interest rates and tight inventories have pushed Vancouver house prices into uncharted territory, even as affordability across the rest of the country remains near normal levels.
Royal Bank of Canada said yesterday it would take 92 per cent of the median household's pretax income to own a bungalow in the city - the highest reading yet in its quarterly national survey on affordability.
"Vancouver really stands alone in its extremes across all housing types," said Craig Wright, the bank's chief economist. "It is no doubt the most stressed market in Canada and the one facing the highest risk of a downturn. With the bar set so high, owning a home is a dream that only the area's highest-earning households can contemplate."
The bank said most Canadian cities offered "reasonably affordable" housing options in the second quarter compared to the first. Nationally, a condo required 29.2 per cent of pretax household income (a 0.8 per cent increase), a bungalow 43.3 per cent (1.7 per cent) and a detached home 49.3 per cent (1.8 per cent).
"Despite the erosion so far this year, most local housing markets in Canada continue to be reasonably affordable at this juncture or, at worst, just slightly unaffordable," the bank stated in its release. "Affordability measures generally continue to stand near their respective long-term averages."
The bank's affordability index looks at the proportion of pre-tax household income needed to service the costs of owning different categories of homes at current market values. Its standard measure is a 1,200-square-foot bungalow, and the carrying costs include mortgage payments (principal and interest), property taxes and utilities. It assumes a 25-per-cent down payment, a 25-year mortgage and a five-year fixed rate mortgage. The higher the reading, the more costly it is to own a home.
The numbers are still high, however, and that's with low interest rates keeping mortgage payments low. The bank said that "typically" no more than 32 per cent of a borrower's gross annual income should go toward servicing a home.
That has some questioning just how affordable the Canadian market actually is, especially if interest rates begin to rise and mortgages become more expensive. "We'll get people who ask how much they can afford and we quite often tell them that they just can't afford what they want to pay," said Ted Rechtshaffen, president of financial planning company TriDelta Financial in Toronto.
RBC said it would take an income of $157,800 to buy a Vancouver bungalow in the second quarter, and that the average house price in the city was $822,300 - 19 per cent higher than a year ago.
Mr. Wright said to find something more affordable, most people turn to condos.
"Vancouver has always been a bit of an outlier and it still is in this report," said Mr. Wright, adding the city's affordability readings were also affected by a downward revision to income growth in Vancouver going back to 2009.
"What those numbers tell you is that it's basically impossible for someone making a median income to buy a bungalow in the city."
Financial planner Adrian Mastracci has one standard piece of advice for young families who walk through the door of his Vancouver office.
"I tell them they need to go to the Bank of Mom and Dad and see how much money they can withdraw for a giant down payment," says Mr. Mastracci, president of KCM Wealth Management Inc. "Otherwise, I tell them to consider a condo or to look outside of the city."

A design team builds on solid foundations - near and far

Full text:   Sean Pearson and Alyssa Schwann juggle challenging projects such as a Saltspring Island residence and a youth centre in Soweto
If the career arc of the design team of Sean Pearson and Alyssa Schwann were cast in cinematic terms, the climax of the film might have been in 2009. That's when Mr. Pearson and Ms. Schwann's multidisciplinary design firm RUF (it stands for rural urban fantasy) was simultaneously juggling projects in Soweto, South Africa, and on Saltspring Island.
"We were living on site in a 1911 cottage, off grid, in a remote part of the island," says Mr. Pearson, an affable, talkative 37-year-old architect, "when we got the call from Nike to design a football training centre in the heart of Soweto."
Already in mid-design of what would become a 5,600-square-foot residence on Saltspring, and given just nine months in which to design and oversee the construction of the Nike-sponsored youth training and AIDS awareness-oriented health centre, RUF sprang into action. Mr. Pearson flew to Nike headquarters in Oregon, and then on to South Africa, constantly liaising with his partner, Ms. Schwann, who was busy drawing and e-mailing from a generator-powered computer in the Saltspring Island cottage.
But bridging great design and cultural divides seems a natural modus operandi for the talented pair who worked all over the globe before returning to Canada, lured back by the call of West Coast modernism.
Their story began at the University of Manitoba in 1998. The design faculty there has a multidisciplinary approach and encourages students to study planning, architecture, landscape and interior design for a broader understanding. The quiet, soft-spoken Ms. Schwann, now 35, was studying for her master's in landscape architecture, while the more gregarious Mr. Pearson was getting his in architecture. The two hit it off and soon began a creative collaboration.
After graduation, Ms. Schwann did a residency in Sao Paolo, Brazil, worked for an English landscaping firm on projects that included the grounds of Wentworth Castle, and joined the prestigious design firm West 8 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Mr. Pearson moved to London and landed a job with Michael Hopkins. He soon went on to the multidisciplinary firm Jump, and later moved to Amsterdam to take a job as Nike's brand design director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In between, the couple found time to design a house together, carving out a cool, minimalist living space from an old Rotterdam factory - as well as design a VIP event for the European Cup. They came back to Canada to work on the Saltspring Island house in 2008.
"Neither one of us," Mr. Pearson says, "feels comfortable being tied down to singular labels like 'architect' or 'landscape designer.'"
"Each project we work on," Ms. Schwann adds, "starts off with a discussion of general concepts."
"We don't start with an idea of form," Mr. Pearson says, "but with the idea of the experience you would have in the space." RUF's approach is to leave behind preconceived ideas of a project, and have the design "come out of the narrative we weave with the client, whether it's a landscape or building or branding concept. ...
"When you build a story that relates to the brief," he says, "the designs become focused and powerful."
"Sean has the ability to get to the essence of what something needs to be very quickly," Ms. Schwann says. "We're very good at brainstorming together - and the creative process works well between us."
"Alyssa is very intuitive as a designer - she really feels things," Mr. Pearson says, "and brings a sense of poetry to her design."
Whatever their alchemy, it seems to produce some wonderful work.
The Nike Football Training Centre in Soweto - completed in eight months from design to construction - was conceived mainly in the 1911 cottage on the Saltspring Island house site "and partly in a Portland [Ore.] hotel lobby," acknowledges Mr. Pearson - and amid a background of security and other challenges. During the course of construction, the project architect was carjacked, the foreman received a death threat from a local company that bid unsuccessfully for a contract, generators were destroyed by enterprising thieves seeking to strip the valuable copper wiring and "there were constant fires and explosions in the area," Mr. Pearson says.
Referencing the historical and actual tensions between oppression and liberation, the centre plays with contrasts between the open and the gated, between the secure and the vulnerable.
Using a palette of local materials that included sandstone, Saligna timber - the ubiquitous Soweto version of Douglas fir - and concrete and steel, RUF hoped to be part of a "new
architectural language" as well as to create a symbol of a new, unified South Africa. There is an absence of dark, hidden spaces, and sightlines are everywhere so "no one feels like they're being watched. ...
"Sports are the big unifier there," Mr. Pearson says. "When people discuss football, it's like all the other factors - race, class, tribe - disappear momentarily."
A timber façade offers both shading from the sun and security for the huge expanse of interior glazing that peeks out like the architecture of hope. Conceived as a solid block with a light wrap of timber, articulated slices allow sunshine to penetrate at key points. The effect is a big, bold space, composed of layers of wood, stone and light.
Worlds away on Saltspring Island, the main challenge for RUF was to instill a sense of immediacy into the "island time" oriented construction crew and to ensure that supplies arrived to the remote site. Weather - in particular, an unpredictable winter storm season - as well as a sloping site on a rocky outcrop were also factors.
Luckily, RUF was working with "ideal clients," whose design brief of rustic cabin meets modern villa allowed them relatively free rein. Inspired by West Coast mid-century modernists, especially Arthur Erickson, the house is a contemporary take on the longhouse that pushes the concept of post and beam to its limits.
In a simple palette of wood, glass, stone, steel and cement, the house is tailored to the site and delineated by two parts: a solid stone base, sunken into the land and referencing the natural rocky outcrops, with a light timber bridge resting upon it. The L-shaped house defines an internal courtyard seeded with a variety of local wildflowers that burst into colour in different seasons.
A delicate interplay of woods - Alaskan yellow cedar on the exterior, hemlock ceilings and fir and oak flooring and walls - offers texture and grounds the house in a sense of place. At the same time, it has a floating, ethereal quality. At night, the south-facing glazing that opens up to the seafront becomes a luminescent, Japanese jewel box. Interior spaces like the kitchen are aligned to feel as if they extend into the ocean, and when it rains, the glazing-rich, two-storey residence seems at one with the elements.
The relatively small footprint of the house belies its sense of spaciousness, and everywhere the outside comes in, with the built environment bleeding into the natural. On an island of old cabins and new monster homes, it is a modernist gem.
"We were fortunate to have mill workers from Germany," Mr. Pearson says, "who understood that everything had to be perfectly flush and aligned, not slapped up and covered with mouldings."
With all the craftsmanship exposed, he says, "we wanted a rough-hewn feel with precise detailing."
He draws a parallel to the Soweto centre, citing "an awareness of process in design" and "exposure of raw materials" - letting "things be what they are without covering them up. ...
"It's very challenging and difficult to build that way. It's like wearing clothes backwards. You can see the stitching, but if it's well done, it's a beautiful thing."
Whether in Soweto or on Saltspring, RUF's approach is all about "not letting the architecture get in the way of the experience of the space," he says. "Good design should be invisible."

Full text:   Once an 'American summer colony,' the housing market is picking up and the buyers are largely homegrown
Drive the streets of Chester and assume an exodus is in progress. Not exactly, but maybe a changing of the guard.
Real-estate signs are in full bloom in this town on Nova Scotia's south shore, where it is said the summer's population used to double the permanent one.
But Chester, once aptly described as an American summer colony, isn't so American any more, and is not just for summer, either.
Less than an hour's drive from Halifax, the town came to prominence at the turn of the past century as the summer-vacation Mecca for affluent U.S. families.
They were drawn by fishing, both saltwater and fresh, sailing, golf and the beauty of Mahone Bay, which some have suggested rivals the Bay of Naples. For more than a century, the town has offered a moderate climate, stunning Atlantic views and a leisurely, affable charm.
"Gentle" was how one prospective buyer described the town as she was ferried around by real-estate agent Tim Harris, owner of Tradewinds Inc., the area's largest real estate firm.
Clapboard or shingled Cape Cod-style cottages and houses are nestled on "the Peninsula" or around the front and back harbours on the tree-lined streets.
After a two-year lull, the real estate game has returned, Mr. Harris said. During the credit crisis, high-end houses had stopped moving in a place where Brenda Mulrooney, chair of the village commission, will tell you that the main industry is real estate.
In 2009 and 2010, no homes priced at more than $1-million sold. This year, the million-dollar ceiling has been broken, with eight houses selling for about $1.8-million.
Many are being converted from summer cottages to year-round residences. More people are retiring to Chester, or using it as a bedroom community for Halifax, and even beyond.
"We're finding in the plus-million range, 50 per cent would be seasonal and 50 per cent full-time, where previously, 100 per cent would be seasonal. And that's another reason that they're selling: this is serious real estate they plan to live in," Mr. Harris said.
"We don't fish and we don't sail," said Philip Mitchell, who, along with his partner, Mark Narsansky, bought a house in the village in 2008 as an investment property to rent out.
While work was being done, they lived in rented houses and extended their stay beyond the summer, commuting to Toronto for business. Their intentions for the property began to change.
"During the course of the renovation, we changed things along the way because we really saw that we were going to be here more and that this wasn't going to be a rental property that we would let out to other people, this was going to be somewhere that we only came," Mr. Mitchell said.
Having been in the house for a little over a year, their intentions have changed again.
"It will become our primary residence probably in the next two years or so," said Mitchell.
Consequently, Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Narsansky, designers by trade, are looking for a new house in the village large enough to accommodate two offices, allowing them to open a satellite business on the East Coast.
Mr. Mitchell says that even in the short time he and Mr. Narsansky have lived in Chester, they have discerned an evolution around them.
"A lot of our new neighbours who have been moving in have been Canadians and not Americans. And they have been looking at it as more than an investment or a summer place to come for a couple weeks or months in the summer, but as a year-round place to come," he said.
This trend, too, is showing up in Mr. Harris's clientele.
"[In 2011], our business is 100 per cent Canadian. Half of our business used to be American and that is essentially gone . . . mainly Nova Scotians, some upper Canadians, Toronto, are looking and buying," said Mr. Harris, who has lived in Chester since the age of five. Americans who bought previously are staying, but there is no new migration of buyers from the south. One of those Americans who still summers here is Daniel Blain, the great-grandson of Chester's first summer resident. Mr. Blain spends six months in Chester and six in Florida.
Sport fishing brought John Wister, owner of a prosperous iron mill in Pennsylvania, and his family to the village in 1870, and every summer after, Mr. Blain said.
In 1885, Mr. Wister bought a former militia fort known as the "Blockhouse" from a local fish merchant and it has been the family summer home ever since.
Salmon brought Mr. Wister here and sailing keeps Mr. Blain coming back.
"I'm a sailing man and let's face it: Mahone Bay is the best-looking place for yacht racing, the water is deep... it's a beautiful place with the Tancook Islands, Big Tancook and Little Tancook, protecting the place," Mr. Blain said.
His boat, Eclipse, was in the 147-boat fleet of Chester Race Week earlier this month, an annual regatta and a century-old institution of the village. If Chester is Mecca, race week is its Hajj.
What was once a regatta for the summer residents, with locals skippering their boats, is now Canada's largest keel boat race.
But its growth has brought change, too. The front harbour was the start and finish line for every race.
Now only the smallest boats can be seen from the village. The largest boats race far beyond view, outside the islands that dot the bay and protected its waters. Colourful spinnakers are no longer visible as the boats rush for the finish line. And it's a scene that Mr. Blain, for one, misses.
Chester's transformation is one of the reasons behind a census launched this year by the village commission. Though voluntary, Ms. Mulrooney says it's now time to find out who calls Chester home and for how long.
But she is also quick to conclude: "Chester is always going to be Chester."

A once-cautious bank takes a bold leap south

Abstract: The time frame for these ambitions remains an open question. And given the turmoil in the U.S. economy, whether BMO can realize these goals is still highly uncertain. "We need to see some reasonable economic growth in the middle part of the country," he said. "The Midwest is manufacturing intensive, and we are seeing a rebound in industrial production," Mr. [Bill Downe] said. "While we are not yet back at pre-recession levels, we're about halfway there."

Full text:   BANKING REPORTER
A sign on the glass doors leading into Marshall & Ilsley Corp.'s main branch in downtown Milwaukee displays a few basic ground rules for doing business at an American bank: "No hats, no hoods, no sunglasses - no guns."
"Please remove these items before entering."
The man responsible for enforcing such conditions, particularly the one about brandishing firearms, is a greying security guard named Frank. During his 25 years with the bank, Frank never worried much about his shares, nor the future of his employer, Wisconsin's largest bank. M & I's stock price - and its generous quarterly dividend - always seemed to be going up.
Then one day, all that stopped. And in the midst of a global economic crisis in 2008, the landscape of American banking took a dramatic turn for the worse. Venerable names were coming under fire, and assets were being sold off like never before in recent memory.
Three years after the crash, dozens of American banks have been wiped off the map in a Darwinian purge. Some went under and were seized by regulators. Others - the slightly healthier ones like M & I - were forced to find shelter with a larger, better-capitalized partner.
Enter Bank of Montreal, one of several Canadian banks to wade opportunistically into the struggling U.S. financial sector, joining a buying spree that has seen American lenders sell more than $21-billion worth of assets to Canadian buyers in the past two years.
These days, a lot of new faces are breezing past Frank's desk in the lobby of M & I's headquarters - Canadian faces. The most prominent is Bill Downe. As he enters the branch, BMO's 59-year-old chief executive officer makes directly for the elevators leading to the executive floor.
Mr. Downe has not yet been issued a security pass for the building, but he otherwise holds the keys to M & I. And M & I, in turn, holds the key to his future.
BMO's $4.1-billion takeover of the struggling U.S. bank, which closed in July, comes at a perilous time for U.S. banking. It is not merely a turnaround job. It is by far the largest deal Canada's oldest bank has done in its 194-year history, and forms the basis of Mr. Downe's blueprint for expansion.
For a bank that has always treaded carefully - if not timidly - outside Canada, it is an uncharacteristically bold strike. Why would anyone expand in the U.S. now? Like Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which have recently purchased U.S. assets, BMO believes history will demonstrate that the deep-rooted economic problems south of the border will pass.
"BMO is always the slow-and-steady-wins-the-race bank, and this is a big leap," said Peter Routledge an analyst with National Bank Financial. "Bill Downe's legacy is riding on a successful outcome."
A cautionary tale
At a time when Royal Bank of Canada has decided to vacate the U.S. retail banking market - cutting its losses by selling its struggling Centura Bank to Pittsburgh's PNC Bank Corp. - Mr. Downe is taking his bank further into the U.S. It is a contrarian view at a moment when not a lot good can be said about the near-term future of the U.S. economy.
RBC made the wrong bet in the U.S., purchasing Centura at a high price and failing to build its scattered operations into a significant force. The North Carolina-based bank was a loosely-knit collection of branches in the Southeast, an area hit hard by the recession. When the U.S. housing bubble collapsed, Centura suffered and RBC felt the pain.
With the RBC experience as a cautionary tale, BMO is instead trying to mimic TD's international growth plan.
Faced with a mature Canadian market, TD has turned to the U.S., spending aggressively to buy banks in larger, more affluent metropolitan centres such as Boston. TD paid handsomely to acquire Commerce Bank for $8.5-billion in 2007, but in doing so, picked up a deposit-rich bank capable of churning out profits.
With the M & I deal, BMO is also getting more aggressive. By adding its 374 branches to BMO's existing Harris Bank operations, BMO has more than doubled its U.S. retail banking footprint to nearly 700 locations across eight states - Illinois, Wisconsin, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Indiana, Arizona and Florida.
But that is only the beginning. Mr. Downe thinks that soon BMO will have as many U.S. branches as the 900 it has in Canada - and from there, possibly a day when the bank is significantly bigger in the U.S. than in Canada. With interest rates expected to stay low in the U.S. for the next two years, some smaller banks may be forced to sell, unable to squeeze growth from their own tightening margins.
"Conceivably, we could double the size of this combined bank within the footprint [of those eight states]," Mr. Downe said, seated in the boardroom of M & I's headquarters.
"There are two future paths of expansion. One is adjacent markets," he said, referring to states the bank is not already in. "And the second is within this circle," he said of the states BMO now operates. In an era of upheaval in U.S. banking, Mr. Downe likes both strategies.
From stability to crisisIn many ways, M & I is a proxy for the story of a typical American bank caught in the vortex of a crisis. It is "a historically solid franchise that had lost its way," said Robert Sedran, a banking analyst at CIBC World Markets.
Founded in 1850 by Samuel Marshall and Charles Ilsley, M & I enjoyed a pristine reputation for stability during times of dire financial straits. It survived the U.S. Civil War, the Crash of 1893 and the Great Depression, and was an acquirer of other failing banks during those days.
But when the great American banking crisis hit in 2008, M & I was not the same. The bank ran into trouble by venturing beyond its comfort zone, expanding to Arizona and Florida, which were real estate hotbeds over the past decade. When the recession hit, property values plunged and those states fell the hardest. Florida and Arizona accounted for one-third of M & I's non-performing loans.
M & I booked a $2.06-billion loss in 2008 and, in an effort to preserve capital, slashed its quarterly dividend to a penny from 32 cents a share. When that proved to be of little help, it was forced to seek a $1.7-billion bailout from the U.S. federal government's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).
When the losses continued into the summer of 2010, M & I's board instructed CEO Mark Furlong to find a solution - which meant finding a buyer. "None of us had ever been through a cycle like this," Mr. Furlong said. "Everything was trial and error."
Quietly, Mr. Downe had coveted M & I as a launch pad for U.S. expansion since he took over BMO in 2007. The bank extended several expressions of interest in that time, only to be rebuffed - fortunately for Mr. Downe, since the price would have been much higher in those days.
He figured the Midwest lender fit well with Harris Bank, the Chicago-based business BMO bought in 1984 as an entree into the U.S. market. Aside from BMO buying a pair of tiny Wisconsin lenders in 2007, the two banks have a history of quietly respecting each other's territory.
In private, their relationship was even closer than most in the industry knew. Mr. Downe and Mr. Furlong regularly shared strategy, opening their books to each other, comparing notes on their respective markets. "You don't talk pricing and you don't talk about specific customers," Mr. Furlong said of those summits. "But we shared thoughts about how we go to market with different things."
When Mr. Furlong began to entertain thoughts of selling last fall, he turned to BMO. But the Canadian bank wasn't the only suitor. PNC of Pittsburgh was also in the hunt. By December, a bidding war was under way.
There were complications for any buyer. Winning the auction meant repaying the $1.7-billion worth of bailout money that M & I received from the U.S. Treasury in the TARP program (which took the total cost for BMO to $5.8-billion). The buyer also had to pay hefty change-of-control premiums in contracts of M & I's executives. For Mr. Furlong alone, that was worth an $18-million (U.S.) payout - a sum that drew public anger as union leaders attacked the bank for lavishing its executives with golden parachutes at a time when labour in Wisconsin was facing unprecedented cutbacks.
In the end, it was worth more to BMO than it was to PNC. At slightly less than 1.4-times M & I's net worth (that is, its assets minus its liabilities), the sale price was higher than the average Midwestern U.S. bank sold for in 2008-09. But it was significantly lower than the value those same banks were commanding before the downturn.
"In the annals of Canadian banks purchasing U.S. banks, that's probably one of the better deals in terms of price," Mr. Routledge said. "Whether the franchise justifies it, that's something he's going to have to prove over the next three years."
That rests in part on the bruised American economy, which is showing troubling signs of stalling in the face of the country's debt problems and the ongoing European financial crisis.
"This is a high-quality franchise," Mr. Downe said this week, as the aftermath of a U.S. debt downgrade and weak economic data pushed bank stocks lower. "There's no doubt that the downgrade temporarily hit investor psychology, but the debt is being dealt with and the U.S. economy has room to grow - especially when you look at corporate earnings at near-record levels and large cash balances [at companies]."
BMO's first job now is to keep M & I's customers from being lured away by a rival bank. A beachhead for U.S. expansion is only good if you can keep it from eroding.
Several competing banks are now attempting to eat into M & I's customer base, painting BMO as the distant foreign acquirer on American soil. Bank Mutual Corp., PNC, U.S. Bancorp. and Associated Banc-Corp. have all indicated that BMO's deal is an opportunity to gain market share.
Associated put out a public statement that pointed out - not very subtly - that "the roots of our company are in the Upper Midwest." The bank said it was reaching out to customers who desire a "local relationship" and who "want to invest their money with a locally owned and managed institution."
Banking is a relationship business - and BMO is now in the business of relationship preservation. Mr. Downe expects the recognition Harris Bank has built in Chicago will extend to M & I's markets, including large centres like Milwaukee, St. Louis and Phoenix. "We're not an unknown entity," he said.
One question that remains untested is how the market will put up with losing the M & I name (all of BMO's U.S. retail operations will now go by the name BMO Harris Bank). Milwaukee is a city with a strong sense of identity: Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley were set here. Harley-Davidson, Miller Beer and Windex are manufactured here. For a century and a half, M & I was one of those names that evoked local pride.
"There will be the odd customer that will say I will never bank with a foreign bank," Mr. Furlong said. "But that isn't the reaction we've had."
Mr. Downe won't shy away from putting BMO's stamp on the region, though. Sitting on the top floor of the bank's 21-storey headquarters, he motions to the window, noting that M & I's building - the 15th tallest in Milwaukee - is one of the few that doesn't have a corporate name emblazoned across the top. This will change: It will say BMO Harris Bank.
"When you own the building, you can put anything you want on the outside of it," Mr. Downe said. In time, BMO will be as recognizable in these parts - he hopes - as it is in its Canadian markets.
Building out
BMO now has more branches in Milwaukee (96) than it has in Montreal (94), and more locations in Chicago (216) than it has in Toronto (202). Inside M & I, Mr. Downe and Mr. Furlong, who is staying aboard to run BMO's U.S. operations, are dusting off the bank's original expansion plans.
While RBC and TD both concentrated their U.S. retail banking strategies in the East, Mr. Downe casts his gaze south and west. Colorado and Texas seem particularly attractive.
He is taking a page from Canadian National Railway, which built a 'Continental T' across North America. CN lines run horizontally across Canada and jut straight down to the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Downe envisages BMO owning a similar network of banks.
Markets like Texas and Colorado are also familiar. As an investment banker earlier in his career, Mr. Downe spent time in both states, booking energy deals in BMO's wholesale banking division. Several of BMO's top executives also bring first-hand knowledge from U.S. markets.
" A number of us have experience in Texas and know the market well," he said. "All those states, Colorado, Oklahoma - as you go down the west side of the Mississippi River, it's a market that fits very logically."
Analysts figure there are numerous banks that BMO could fit into such a strategy.
Mr. Downe doesn't mention potential targets, but he can see a day this decade when his U.S. operations will be churning out more than $1-billion in profit. That would be more than five times what BMO was making in the U.S. prior to the M & I deal.
The time frame for these ambitions remains an open question. And given the turmoil in the U.S. economy, whether BMO can realize these goals is still highly uncertain. "We need to see some reasonable economic growth in the middle part of the country," he said. "The Midwest is manufacturing intensive, and we are seeing a rebound in industrial production," Mr. Downe said. "While we are not yet back at pre-recession levels, we're about halfway there."
In many ways, the stars have aligned for Canadian banks to expand. The strong Canadian dollar makes acquisitions more affordable, and Canada's lenders are better capitalized than their American peers. Canada's stronger economy helps, too. But the risks of being saddled with the wrong assets, as RBC was, require that Mr. Downe tread carefully.
"Every opportunity that you could have is available," he said. "The question is, what are you going to do with it?"

Subprime bloodsucking in sin city

Author: Lacey, Liam

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/subprime-bloodsucking-sin-city/docview/884269145/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: [Jerry]'s approach to getting to the neck tends to be crudely sexual, with a lot of air-sniffing and talk about who is "ripe." Part of [Young Charley Brewster]'s abhorrence for Jerry is that women, including his single-but-good-looking mom (a nicely grounded [Toni Collette]) and his girlfriend, are attracted to Jerry's brand of rough trade.

Full text:   Fright Night
Directed by Craig Gillespie
Written by Marti Noxon
Starring Anton Yelchin and Colin Farrell
**½
The new DreamWorks/Disney teen horror comedy Fright Night falls into the better-than-expected category. Like the original Fright Night (1985), the new version is mildly entertaining with some fun performances and some bonuses. Though they don't hit you in the face with it, director Craig Gillespie ( Lars and the Real Girl ) and writer Marti Noxon ( Buffy the Vampire Slayer ) have slipped in some interesting economic subtext.
Young Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) and his real-estate-agent mother (Toni Collette) live in an isolated suburban housing tract outside Las Vegas (actually shot in Albuquerque), which is shown at night as a rectangle of light against the desert darkness. Charley, who has recently made the transition from geek to semi-cool kid - this is a role Jesse Eisenberg or Michael Cera could have played a few years ago -is now dating the pretty and mature Amy (Imogen Poots) and trying to forget about his dweeby childhood buddy "Evil" Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, a.k.a. McLovin from Superbad ).
But Ed has something urgent to tell Charley. He has been documenting the number of schoolkids who have been disappearing, and has narrowed down the suspect to Charley's new neighbour Jerry, a night construction worker on the Vegas strip whom Ed believes is a vampire.
"Jerry?" scoffs Charley. "That's a terrible vampire name."
And Vegas, where the lights never turn off, would seem to be a terrible vampire town, though, as Ed points out, it's got a transient population with a lot of night workers.
What's more, it's a great metaphor for the subprime mortgage crisis, which hit that city particularly hard -whole neighbourhoods emptied as the economic life-blood ran out. The idea of high-risk homeowners (vampires) emptying schools and abandoning houses, and real-estate brokers scrambling to make a living, all makes sense.
Fright Night has a few other grown-up themes. There are touches of David Lynch-style alienation in the bland, half-pretty suburb where Farrell's amusingly sleazy, pale and muscular Jerry - dressed in black, leering - is about as unobtrusive as a fly on a piece of Angel Food cake.
Jerry's approach to getting to the neck tends to be crudely sexual, with a lot of air-sniffing and talk about who is "ripe." Part of Charley's abhorrence for Jerry is that women, including his single-but-good-looking mom (a nicely grounded Collette) and his girlfriend, are attracted to Jerry's brand of rough trade.
Even Ed falls for Jerry's charms, in a scene loaded with homoeroticism. In contrast, poor Charley seems almost as afraid of Amy's forthright sexuality as he is of Jerry's bite. Though it's full of repressed eroticism, the movie has less nudity and fewer overt sexual situations than the original, made more than 25 years ago. After all, Fright Night is still a Disney movie, so the metaphors of sex, death and economic meltdown take second place to family-friendly comedy.
With improbable naïveté, Charley concludes his vampire Google searches by deciding to seek the help of a local illusionist, Peter Vincent (Scottish actor David Tennant of the BBC's Dr. Who ). Tennant, in a part that seems designed for Russell Brand, is amusingly over-the-top at first, though a little goes a long way and the bickering scenes between him and his partner (Sandra Vergara) are repetitive.
Fright Night uses 3-D, mostly for tracking through dark hallways and in the CGI-intense vampire-fighting climax. It feels inessential, but there's the occasional pleasant surprise. In a scene with a fire near the end, sparks appear to hover before your eyes for a moment before blinking out. A small glimpse of magic.

A prolific builder behind many condominium developments in the 905 area recently launched its first project in an east-end neighbourhood established mainly with detached houses.
With prices starting under $200,000 in the seven-storey building, called Terrace on Danforth, locals looking for a new home with less living space and less work for a lesser price, comprise the majority of buyers who picked up half the units available.
"The main appeal to this project has been the affordability because you've got quite a lot out there right now that is at a significant price per square foot," says Shawn Richardson, who is the sales and marketing manager for Liberty Development.
"There's not really a lot of condo [residences] in that particular area, so for someone who is looking for that lifestyle - who doesn't want to maintain a home - this provides them with that option."
Only 95 suites will be created within this glass and precast mid-rise, which will be completed at the northeast corner of Warden and Danforth avenues by 2013.
"You're five minutes from everywhere," Mr. Richardson says. "If you go east, you get to the Scarborough Bluffs, then you've got the Danforth - if cuisine is your thing - and you've got the lakeshore, which isn't far either."
The infill site is also close to Dentonia Park Golf Course, extensive parkland and trails along Taylor Massey Creek, as well as the subway line and shopping plazas.
Retail shops will be added to the ground level of this building, which will also have a gym, a fireside party room with a bar, and a sixth-floor terrace with seating just for residents.
"It gives people an opportunity, if they have come from a detached home ... to have a place where they can step out and enjoy the sun," Mr. Richardson says.
Private balconies and terraces up to 365 square feet will also be situated off individual suites, which will range from one- to two-bedroom-plus-den plans.
"There is not a lot of wasted square footage in any of our designs," Mr. Richardson says.
"If you're buying 545 square feet, you're actually getting 545 square feet of livable space. Even within something of that size, it's very typical for us to have a walk-in closet and in some cases, you may end up with a large balcony, which would be the entire width of the suite."
Interiors will be polished off with laminate and tile floors, 40-ounce broadloom or sisal carpeting, along with granite kitchen countertops, European-style cabinetry and ceramic tile backsplashes.
Green features will be standard, such as energy-efficient windows, Energy Star appliances and individually metered hydro, which will keep monthly maintenance fees to 43 cents a square foot.
Each unit will include parking.

You might think it's funny, but the judge probably won't laugh

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/you-might-think-funny-judge-probably-wont-laugh/docview/884269080/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "Couples who are going through a divorce process are quite often temporarily insane," says family lawyer Phil Epstein of Epstein Cole. "It's the worst time in their lives and sometimes the pressure gets to them and they do things they wouldn't normally do." Like taking hammers and screwdrivers to a spouse's car when it is discovered "in a compromising position," parked in front of the mistress's house, Mr. Epstein says.

Full text:   It was with great reluctance that Dany Larivière hauled away the boulder he'd gleefully dumped on his ex-wife's driveway just a day earlier. Plucked from a quarry and lugged by front-end loader in the dead of night Monday, the 20-ton rock was spray-painted with fluorescent orange birthday wishes for "Isa," then topped with a pink bow.
"She never had a rock big enough for her tastes, now she has one," Mr. Larivière quipped to the local paper in St-Theodore-d'Acton, Que., where he is also mayor.
The prank got international attention and earned Mr. Larivière possible mischief and harassment charges, yet another ugly turn in his acrimonious split from ex-wife Isabelle Prevost.
"I thought of Sisyphus as I read the story," said Harold Niman, a family lawyer with Niman Zemans Gelgoot. "It's part of the ongoing struggle that one of the people is having with their perceived wrongs, within the marriage or within the judicial system or otherwise. This is them acting out in the only way they know how to, and it's not something they're going to be contrite about later."
Boulder dumping may be unique (Mr. Larivière owns an excavation firm), but divorce "pranks" are all too common.
"Couples who are going through a divorce process are quite often temporarily insane," says family lawyer Phil Epstein of Epstein Cole. "It's the worst time in their lives and sometimes the pressure gets to them and they do things they wouldn't normally do." Like taking hammers and screwdrivers to a spouse's car when it is discovered "in a compromising position," parked in front of the mistress's house, Mr. Epstein says.
"People have taken chainsaws to inanimate objects," the lawyer offers casually, adding that others prefer to strew their exes' lawns with garbage or play hide-and-seek with precious items.
Another favourite target is the spousal-support cheque: Many spouses will scribble vulgarities on the cheque, which the ex must then endorse to get the money. Some are more inventive: "I've seen people staple spiders to a support cheque - a tarantula," says Mr. Epstein.
Wine is another tool in spousal warfare, especially since the wine lover may have been forced to move out, leaving the cellar behind temporarily.
"I've heard of people with such rage that they go downstairs to the cellar, steam off all the labels and then mix up the bottles," says McCarthy Tetrault family lawyer Stephen Grant. "If you think you're drinking a $30 bottle of Côtes du Rhône and it turns out you're drinking a $300 Château Lafite with hamburgers one night instead of filet, it's quite upsetting."
Mr. Niman recalls a wine-collecting husband who returned from a tryst to find his wife in the street, emptying his bottles down a sewer grate. "Not quite as bad as cutting off his penis, I suppose, but I guess it's figuratively doing that, isn't it?" says Mr. Niman.
While Mr. Larivière's boulder stunt has been widely treated as a gag, the recipient rarely sees it that way. "They see this as an invasion of privacy, that their spouse is unhinged," says Mr. Epstein. "It makes them ... ask the question: 'If you dump a rock on my property, what else are you capable of doing?' "
Mr. Larivière's three-year split from his wife has seethed with animosity: Ms. Prevost had harassed him, threatening to report him to tax authorities unless he gave her cash payments and real estate, he said. She, meanwhile, accused him of physical and verbal abuse and said she feared for her two children when Mr. Larivière won joint custody after the couple finally divorced last year.
"This story is a powerful example of how family litigation can leave an enduring legacy of bitterness, despite the outcome," says Victoria Smith, a collaborative lawyer and mediator. "This is not a joke - this was retribution, this was a public humiliation of the wife, despite the fact that the court case ended last year and the husband won joint custody."
As for the couple's children, a 12-year-old boy and a nine-year-old girl, "Imagine them waking up to find a boulder in their mother's driveway, their driveway," says Ms. Smith.
So why do spouses do it?
"The party that is pranking really feels like they are the victim. They're not getting the vindication they're looking for," particularly in the division of assets, says Deborah Moskovitch, divorce consultant and author of The Smart Divorce .
According to mediator and divorce coach Deborah Mecklinger, betrayal is the main motivator, "whether that's having done away with all of the family's funds or absconding for another person." She says the mayor's much-celebrated ruse was the "ultimate power play."
"It represented what a person who has a sense of limits may fantasize about but not put into action," she says, adding: "Clearly it touches a place that many people imagine and wish that they could go to with their ex."
But while pranks can bring temporary euphoria to the mischievous spouse, they can also have dire consequences for litigation and spousal support.
"All these things typically backfire. They'll look very bad to a judge," says Mr. Grant, who urges his clients to take the high road.
Ms. Mecklinger agrees, saying: "When somebody ups the ante, get out of the ring."
So which is the more vindictive of the sexes? None of the experts wants to say.
"I don't think anybody has the monopoly on that," Mr. Niman offers. "The saying 'hell hath no fury like a woman scorned' is probably no longer accurate. It's hell hath no fury like a spouse scorned."

Full text:   Small-town mayor faces probe after dumping a 20-ton rock on his ex's doorstep
The mayor of a small town near Montreal is under investigation for mischief and harassment after he admitted to dumping a 20-ton boulder on the driveway of his ex-wife.
Dany Larivière, the mayor of Saint-Theodore-d'Acton and the owner of an excavation company, says he placed the giant rock in his ex-wife's driveway to try to get her to stop harassing him.
Mr. Larivière, who festooned the rock with a giant bow and sprayed it with fluorescent orange birthday greetings, played coy in a number of interviews, saying the boulder was simply a gift for his ex.
"She never had a rock big enough for her tastes, now she has one," Mr. Larivière said. He became something of a celebrity Monday as many media outlets treated the act as a gag.
Later, Mr. Larivière said his three-year split with former wife Isabelle Prevost has been filled with acrimony. She's threatened to report him to tax authorities unless he gave her cash payments and real estate, he said. Ms. Prevost has dedicated her life to giving him grief and he's gone to police twice to complain about harassment, he added.
"I was at the end of my rope, and I want her to leave me alone," he said.
Ms. Prevost, in turn, told a local newspaper her relationship with Mr. Larivière was filled with physical and verbal abuse. "I fear for my life and for those of my children," said Ms. Prevost, who added that the stone gesture illustrated Mr. Larivière's own campaign of harassment. She declined to comment further on Monday.
Neither account of the acrimonious relationship could be independently confirmed.
Mr. Larivière said he obtained joint custody of the children, a 12-year-old boy and a nine-year-old girl, after a lengthy and expensive court battle. He told the local newspaper that Ms. Prevost is lucky he won in court.
"If I hadn't won custody, I can tell you Fathers 4 Justice [a fathers' rights group that stages protests] on the Jacques Cartier Bridge, that would have been me. And rocks like the one in her driveway, there wouldn't have been just one," he told La Voix de l'Est newspaper. Mr. Larivière declined to elaborate on the comment later in the day, saying only that he didn't intend to take part in any fathers' rights campaign.
The matter is strictly personal, he said.
Mr. Larivière delivered the load with a front-end loader at about 3 a.m. on Monday. He said he was stopped twice by police who were suspicious of the use of heavy construction equipment in the middle of the night. After checking his driver's licence and the insurance and registration on the loader, they let him carry on, he said.
The Sûreté du Quebec confirmed an investigation is underway after Ms. Prevost, who rents the home, filed a complaint and Mr. Larivière refused to remove the boulder. In addition to potential criminal charges of harassment or mischief, he could also be charged under the highway code.
Mr. Larivière, who met police Monday afternoon and was heading to a municipal council meeting in the evening, said he doesn't expect any political fallout from his act. "It's a small town. Everyone knows each other," he said.

Chocolate isn't to everyone's taste

Author: Deck, Kelly

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/chocolate-isnt-everyones-taste/docview/882999546/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Opening day was July 23. The local radio station and a live band were there to welcome visitors into the open house. The floors were a hit; people were drawn to their texture and warmth. The chandeliers were raved about (it seems that I'm not the only one bored with wrought iron). But the white kitchen and light walls sparked a few debates. Most liked the feeling of space. But there were those who preferred the darker kitchens and walls.

Full text:   Here's how to lighten an interior that's a little too hooked on espresso tones
kdeck@globeandmail.com
Sometimes it's not good to get everything you want. I'd love to start each home from the ground up, working hand in hand with an architect and the client, but that's not always possible. Instead, we often come into the design process when houses are under construction. The success of the project at this point is determined by how we work within the parameters laid before us.
We had one such opportunity recently, on a project near Vernon, B.C. We were to design a show home for an ambitious golf-resort development known as Predator Ridge. About a quarter of its 1,700 homes had already been built.
The challenge was one that many new homeowners face: putting your imprint on a space designed by someone else. When we set to work, construction on the home was nearly complete. The bones were all in place, but the homes still needed flooring, cabinets and furniture.
The style was a departure for us. The Predator properties to date were taking aim mainly at retiring baby boomers from Alberta, a cohort accustomed to interiors with dark walls, chocolate floors, espresso kitchens, chunky fireplaces and iron chandeliers.
The development's two existing show homes hewed to this aesthetic, a style I playfully think of as Choco Craftsman. Although the homes sat in an airy landscape of mountain and light, their interiors, to me, felt close.
Although Choco Craftsman isn't our norm at Kelly Deck Design, we were excited to give it a fresh approach. We intended our show home to take a step away from the weighty feel of its predecessors, but the time wasn't right for a design revolution. Success would consist of finding the middle way. With that in mind, we articulated three goals through our drawings and site visits.
Manage expansion and contraction with colour
We hoped to create the sense that the walls were pushing out, not closing in, so we avoided dense browns, opting for a light linen paint similar in tone to the grasses of the surrounding land.
Lightening the walls was a good start. But if you don't take care when adding cabinetry and millwork to a room, your hard-won sense of space will evaporate. We decided to paint both cabinet runs warm white. We also allowed all millwork to meet the ceiling, which wore the same shade of white as the cabinetry. Smoothing the transition from millwork to ceiling is an old designer's trick for making a room seem taller.
Keep it real with natural finishes
Next, we addressed the flooring and stone finishes throughout the home. These are elements people get emotionally invested in, associating them with quality and longevity.
We wanted to avoid flooring and fireplace façades that disguised their true identity. The other show homes had floors of chocolate-stained maple (a naturally blond wood) and fireplaces of cultured stone (that is, concrete coloured and shaped to look like real rock).
We knew the flooring had to be eye-catching but dark enough to ground our colour scheme. We found a wide-plank, wire-brushed walnut floor. The width (five inches) lent a contemporary edge, with a swirling grain that gave it warmth and richness. And the matte finish felt great underfoot.
We abandoned the idea of using chunky or chiselled rock on the fireplace. To get the result we wanted, we'd have had to rip the entire unit out, reframe and start over. We took a more conservative approach, painting the stately mantel in warm white. The marble mosaic surround brought a subtle refinement to the room.
Confound expectations with smart accessories
The light fixtures the homes had been using were predictable - wrought iron or brushed nickel, with swirling arms and frosted glass torches.
For the dining room, we selected a modern farmhouse chandelier. Made from greyed wood with a big, odd crystal hanging off it, the piece seemed an appropriate choice given the area's ranching history. Its colour reminded me of the fences that crisscross the fields outside.
The difficulty in a Choco Craftsman interior with espresso tables, buffets and furnishings set between dark walls is light. There isn't any. Even apart from practical concerns such as visibility and illumination, we wanted to show people that a home could envelop you and still use brighter, more colourful furnishings.
Here was our opportunity to bring the exterior landscape indoors. I'd driven around in March photographing the area, recording textures and colours. What stood out at the time was the deep blue of the sky and the burnt orange of the ubiquitous Douglas firs.
We planned the interior scheme around two fabrics - a bold blue print for the living-room chairs and a rusty velvet for the ottoman. The idea of using the outdoor colours inside was to draw visitors into the interior. The vital connective element, though, was the sapphire drapery. It's rare that we'll do a rich hue on a window in Vancouver: It nearly always distracts from the view. But here, under the big blue dome of sky, it was perfect.
Opening day was July 23. The local radio station and a live band were there to welcome visitors into the open house. The floors were a hit; people were drawn to their texture and warmth. The chandeliers were raved about (it seems that I'm not the only one bored with wrought iron). But the white kitchen and light walls sparked a few debates. Most liked the feeling of space. But there were those who preferred the darker kitchens and walls. Chocolate was more comfortable, opined those visitors - and the dark wood just felt cozier. I guess we can't sway them all.

Full text: Even rock-bottom interest rates may not be enough to get recession-scarred U.S. consumers spending again
What if it were almost free to borrow money - but nobody dared take out a loan?
Once the swaggering spendthrift of the global economy, the American consumer is now too fearful and debt-burdened to borrow and spend, and doesn't appear poised to bounce back any time soon.
Signs that the still-struggling U.S. economy is weakening further prompted U.S. Federal Reserve Board chairman Ben Bernanke to announce earlier this week that short-term interest rates will remain at or near zero per cent for two years. That would mean that, by 2013, the Fed's emergency measures will have been in place for five years.
But as the market rout Wednesday suggested, the central bank's moves won't address some of the underlying problems of the U.S. economy, notably high unemployment, and may not be enough to get recession-scarred U.S. companies and consumers spending again.
It could take years for U.S. households to recover from the housing bubble burst that triggered the financial crisis and eroded both family wealth and consumer confidence. Three years after the financial crisis that became the Great Recession, unemployment remains high, income growth is anemic and debt loads are hefty, though down somewhat from the peak of 2008.
The pledge of low rates for two years - a commitment so long that three members of the U.S. central bank's policy-setting panel dissented - was aimed at soothing markets by reassuring investors and companies that they would have that long to borrow cheaply, and repay debts at those rates.
That will only have an impact if companies and consumers are willing to spend. And American consumers simply aren't in a position to crank up spending. That's leading to concern that the U.S. economy may see a repeat of the lost decade in Japan, when a plunge in real estate and the stock market sent Japanese consumers into a funk from which they have still not emerged.
"Much like the U.S., Japan had a big asset bubble that burst, including the housing market, and that has basically hindered the Japanese economy for 10 to 20 years," said Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
"The legacy of the housing boom could go on for a similar time in the U.S."
Mr. Dales noted that U.S. household debt remains at an elevated 130 per cent of disposable income - down from the peak of 140 per cent, but well below the more sustainable 100 to 110 per cent. In such a climate, low interest rates are necessary for an eventual economic recovery, but may not be as effective in stimulating demand as they have been in past recessions.
"The deleveraging process that U.S. households started to go through once the recession started has got some way to run yet, so households are probably going to focus on saving and paying down debt rather than boosting their spending," he said.
The housing market remains under pressure, with the U.S. National Association of Realtors reporting yesterday that prices either were flat or fell in 73 per cent of metropolitan markets.
The lack of a recovery in the housing market is evident in the financial results of Atlanta-based Beazer Homes USA, one of the 10 largest U.S. home builders.
Beazer reported a loss of $53.8-million (U.S.) in the three months ended June 30, more than double its 2010 quarterly loss of $23.4-million.
"There is no question that the fiscal uncertainties in the United States and around the world have contributed to a decided lack of consumer confidence," Beazer's chief executive officer Allan Merrill said on a conference call this week. "Job growth and consumer confidence have to be pillars of any housing recovery, so until they both show signs of strengthening, we expect the level of new home sales to remain suppressed."
The U.S. jobless rate has been above - or just below - 9 per cent for 27 months, the longest stretch of such elevated unemployment since the Great Depression in the 1930s. Some 14 million Americans are unemployed and still looking for work Nevada has the highest U.S. rate at 12.4 per cent, but California is not far behind, at 11.8 per cent.
U.S. consumer confidence has been falling since late spring, as higher gasoline and food prices cut into disposable income, and job growth stalled. And the recent decline in the stock markets and political battle over the debt ceiling will serve to further sap confidence, said Chris Christopher, economist with IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Mass.
"When the equity markets are in such turmoil and the whole thing with the debt ceiling is lingering on as well, consumers get very nervous," he said. With weak consumer demand, the restructuring of key manufacturing sectors continues to play itself out. In the auto industry, for example, there are job losses still to come as plant closings announced two or more years ago actually happen this year.
One of those is in St. Paul, Minn., where Ford will close a compact pickup truck factory in December.
That means Sharon Anderson-Shearon, the financial secretary of United Auto Workers local 879, will be out of work.
Ms. Anderson-Shearon, 53, has been preparing for that day since word first came out in 2006 that the St. Paul plant was in danger.
"I've been cutting back for five years," she said Wednesday.
She's well aware of how the elimination of 2,000 jobs paying more than $30 an hour will ripple through the local economy.
"When you have a manufacturing job that pays a decent wage, people have discretionary income. People take that discretionary income, they spend it on motorcycles, they spend it on snowmobiles ... and that's what stimulates the economy."

Full text: Trade your humble house for a Parisian pad, a luxe Lisbon apartment or an artsy Mexican abode
Over the past dozen years, my family has traded our cozy cottage in Victoria for apartments in Paris, Madrid, Lisbon and San Francisco. We've exchanged for a coffee plantation in Hawaii, a gated condo in Santa Fe, suburban homes outside Montreal and Grenada, old farmhouses in Tuscany and on the coast of France, and a sprawling estate in Aix-en-Provence.
Through our membership in InterVac (short for International Vacation, with a nominal membership fee of $129 a year), travel has become a bargain. It makes it easier to splurge elsewhere when you save by cooking your own meals. But more important, staying in a home provides insights into the culture you're visiting. With a house exchange, you're not in a hotel zone. You're in a real neighbourhood. Shopping for food and visiting local cafes and restaurants for a couple of weeks has an intimacy no hotel stay has matched.
I used to think this was the best thing about a house exchange. But because our last three visits to Spain and Portugal were non-simultaneous, and with families with second homes, we managed to meet our hosts. Now, I think the best thing about house-exchange vacations is the new friends you make.
Have we had bad experiences? Items broken or stolen, unexpected nightmares? In our 15 exchanges, we had one non-wonderful weekend: a Seattle home with a kitchen that doubled as a filthy hangout for the family cats. So we ate all our meals at local restaurants. Not bad.
All the rest have been exciting, insightful adventures, problem-free. And in real-estate terms, we've always traded up.
We were nervous about our first exchange - so anxious that we painted our house. (It's a converted dairyman's shed built for one of Victoria's original farmhouses, and it never looked better.) When we departed for Paris and our apartment near Centre Pompidou in the trendy Marais neighbourhood, our place, cleared of clothing and valuables, was positively spotless. When we returned from France six weeks later, our house was exactly as we had left it - except for a fresh bouquet of flowers and a note thanking us for our hospitality. We've had similar experiences every time since.
InterVac (intervac.ca), which was started in 1953 in Switzerland, has thousands of members in more than 50 countries (mainly in Europe). The annual membership fee provides the initial connection between the organization's families, and with e-mail and photo sharing we've met our exchange families and negotiated terms (including cars, bikes and kayaks) for each exchange.
Our house in the hills above Aix-en-Provence was a gated beauty with a swimming pool and a brand-new Renault (French soccer star Zinedine Zidane and a huge entourage lived next door).
For Christmas in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, we were met by a gang at our gate. They turned out to be neighbourhood teens, our suitcases dumped, unceremoniously, from the cab at their dusty feet. Upon hearing my halting Spanish greeting, they broke into grins under their grimy headbands and by the end of the week in the elegant, art-filled home, the "gang" had painted a stunning Madonna on our gate.
Our exchange home on the outskirts of Montreal was pink on pink. Even the books on the pink chintz living-room shelves were wrapped in pink covers. Everything was pink - except for a white, long-haired cat.
My daughter had always wanted a dog - until we stayed at a coffee plantation near a beach on the big island of Hawaii. That week, as we ate papayas that had ripened on the tree and avocados off the farm, my daughter fed and cared for the host family's three mangy, neurotic dogs. Besides providing surfing and snorkelling with the sea turtles and tropical fish, our Hawaiian exchange erased her wish for a dog.
At our home on Lake Atitlan, the Guatemalan site that author Aldous Huxley called the most beautiful lake in the world, we were served by a staff of five who brought us fresh fruit every morning.
Our San Francisco exchange was a beatnik bachelor pad, a North Beach bed and tiny kitchen.
Our modern apartments in Madrid and Lisbon were spare. But wherever we go, the friendships with our exchange families - fuelled by wine tastings, restaurant dinners, coastal tours - are anything but.
*****
KEYS TO SUCCESS
In our experience, InterVac seems to draw from an educated, upper-middle-class demographic. We've met open-minded, curious, thoughtful, well-travelled and multilingual families; most have been English-speaking academics, musicians, engineers, scientists, writers and lawyers. InterVac has a code of conduct: If two members complain about another member's actions, it will lead to termination of membership at the discretion of the national representative and the board.
While we negotiate an exchange for our home, we always cover the following points:
1.How many people are coming? Are there children? What ages? Will the exchange family expect other guests?
2.What other house exchange experiences have you had?
3.Does anyone smoke? (We don't allow smoking in our home.)
4.What amenities do we need instructions for? (Figuring out foreign appliances, cars or even the TV can be tricky.) 5.What's nearby? Find out about neighbourhood walks, shopping, restaurants and landmarks.

'Creative people are not welcome' in Ford's city, Atwood says

Full text: Author Margaret Atwood says people who want to save the city's libraries need to turn their attention to their local councillor and warns that the city's reputation as a cultural centre is being damaged by comments made by the mayor's brother.
"This jumping up and down and saying 'bad Fords' isn't going to do it," the celebrated writer told The Globe and Mail Tuesday, referring to Mayor Rob Ford and his brother Doug, councillor for Etobicoke North.
"If they don't want their library to be closed, they should tell their councillor - big time."
Ms. Atwood has become a central figure in the fight to save the city's 98 branches after she passed on a link to an online petition protesting the cuts.
She also posted several Twitter comments about the mayor and his brother on council, referring to the pair as the "twin Fordmayor(s)."
Doug Ford recently told a radio host there were more libraries than Tim Hortons outlets in his ward, which is not the case.
Asked about Ms. Atwood's comments, Doug Ford, a close adviser to his brother, fired back last week, saying, "She could walk right by me. I wouldn't have a clue who she is."
"Tell her to go run in the next election and get democratically elected and we'd be more than happy to sit down and listen to Margaret Atwood," he added.
The following day the councillor tried to distance himself from the comments, suggesting the real issue was the city's estimated $774-million funding gap in next year's budget.
This week, it is Ms. Atwood's turn.
Back from some writing time in the woods, she has caught up on the events of the past week - including the all-night committee meeting at city hall to discuss budget cuts, at which several speakers made impassioned pleas not to close libraries.
A grassroots "Margaret Atwood for Mayor" campaign also has blossomed, including a Facebook page.
"I am not running for mayor yet. But if it comes to be true that people cannot voice an opinion unless they have been elected, then we are no longer in a democracy," Ms. Atwood said.
Ms. Atwood said she is contemplating drawing a cartoon of the twin mayors, or knitting a likeness of Rob Ford - although on a less-than-life-size scale.
Ms Atwood also warned in a later email to The Globe that Councillor Ford's comments are damaging the city's reputation.
"The message sent by Doug Ford - and that has now gone worldwide - is that creative people are not welcome in Toronto.
"Not artists, not musicians, not writers. Not them, not their conventions, not their festivals, not their concerts, not the innovation they bring to the city."
She ended the note by saying, "When the Pied Piper found that his musical talents and his style of dress were not appreciated, he left town. But all the kids went with him.
"Real estate prices went down."

Full text: Seeking to escape second-tier status, Vancouver's Hotel Georgia joins the trend of hotels embracing a new look and a new name
When the doors to the iconic Rosewood Hotel Georgia reopened last month after an extensive renovation, many locals paid a visit, eager to see what had become of one of Vancouver's most treasured downtown hotels.
Beginning in early 2007, the property was closed to allow for its ambitious $130-million reimagining, complete with a full restoration of heritage elements, as well as the addition of an adjacent 48-storey residential tower.
The reinvigorated 155-room hotel was almost entirely gutted and reconfigured with larger rooms, an increased number of suites and a five-star spa and restaurant, among other luxurious amenities.
The renovation was long overdue. After years of decline, the grand hotel had long since lost its lustre, most recently being branded as a Crowne Plaza hotel. That middling market position was a far cry from its heyday in the mid-20th century.
Opened in 1927, the once-prestigious hotel played host to a who's who of celebrities and dignitaries over the years, including Elvis Presley, the Rolling Stones, Frank Sinatra and members of the British royal family.
"Prior to shutdown, it had gotten down to a two-star level, had small rooms and a lot of mechanical issues," explains Bruce Langereis, president of Vancouver's Delta Land Development Ltd., the hotel's owner. "Our rates were at or near $100 per night. Now we've revitalized it to what I would say is a five-star level."
The linchpin of the Hotel Georgia's revitalization is its rebranding. Delta's plan to restore the Hotel Georgia's prestige involved recruiting Dallas-based luxury hotel management firm Rosewood Hotels and Resorts to breathe new life into the exhausted property.
In the hotel industry, rebranding is less a Hail-Mary-pass than it is a strategic move often dictated by economic circumstances or a hotel's marketing needs.
Rebranding occurs at all ranges of the market, and usually results in about 3% of the hotel's room revenue being paid to the management firm, with fees sometimes going as high as 11% with incentives.
According to a recent report by hospitality and tourism consulting firm PKF Canada, the number of branded hotels in this country is on the rise, growing by more than 40,000 rooms over the past decade. That was nearly triple the rate of growth in independent hotel supply over the same period. Nationally, about 75% of mid- and upscale rooms and 40% of economy and boutique hotels are branded.
Why the trend towards increased branding in the Canadian hotel industry?
As Monique Rosszell, senior vice-president of Toronto-based hotel consulting firm HVS Canada points out, when established, efficiency-focused brands, ranging from Best Western to Four Seasons, add more properties to their portfolio, independent hoteliers - with the exception of centrally-located, high-end boutique hotels such as Toronto's Hazelton Hotel or Montreal's Hotel Nelligan - have greater difficulty competing for guests.
"Now you would never build a large, full-service hotel as an independent, it would have to be branded," Ms. Rosszell explains. Her reasoning is simple: "When people are on the Internet choosing between the local, independent hotel and the branded Marriott, which one are they going to stay at?"
It's no secret that property owners and their marketing managers are fully aware of the potential for luring new customers by partnering with a well-known management firm.
It's the reason why property owners who decide to sell an asset - particularly during or after downturns in the economy - often opt for a fresh start with a new management firm and a new name, as in the case of the new Rosewood Hotel Georgia.
In other cases - particularly if the building's structure allows for it - an owner may wish to renovate and re-position a tired, low- or mid-range hotel at the higher end of the market, often by recruiting a hotel management firm to upgrade the property's image.
Such was the case in the mid-1990s when the dilapidated Inn On The Lake on Toronto's western lake front was converted into a Four Points Sheraton. "That was a home run," says David Larone, Toronto-based director of PKF Canada. "The hotel was horrific, but the structure was good and there wasn't much real estate that had to be renovated."
To ensure brand consistency and quality control, management agreements are typically comprehensive, allowing companies to seize full control of a hotel's operations from room service to the sign that hangs on the door.
As Mr. Langereis points out, a major brand's management expertise may come at a price, but is crucial to a property's success, relieving developers of the pressures of trying to achieve similar results themselves.
"You can't manage a hotel for free," he says. "What you save (by self-managing) you may pay for in other ways."
Hiring a major brand not only means invaluable name recognition and higher standards of service quality, as well as improved occupancies and average room rates; it also means benefits like staff and facility management efficiencies, access to global reservation systems and the patronage of loyal customers, according to Beth Walters, a director with PKF Canada in Vancouver.
They also provide another critically important offering: loyalty rewards programs. "Accumulating brand loyalty points has become a way of life and leads to a higher level of branding," adds Ms. Walters.
For Mr. Langreis, the move to rebrand the Hotel Georgia made financial and marketing sense. So did spending the time to find the right management partner.
"The most important thing is this hotel is a piece of history. Every operator wants to put their name on the building, but Rosewood respected the fact that this is a Vancouver tradition and didn't brush that aside."
*****
PERMANENT GUESTS
Beyond breathing new life into tired properties, hotel rebranding also serves a secondary purpose at the luxury end of the market: namely, an elite hotel serving as a marketing tool to drive condominium sales.
"The model we have seen over the last 15 years is that in the urban core, high-end hotels would not happen without the residential component," says David Larone of PKF Canada.
"The theory of the model is that the hotel brand will allow you to get a premium on the sale of the residential, and that premium will allow you to defray a lot of the capital cost."
As Bruce Langereis notes, well-heeled condo buyers demand premium service, access to world-class restaurants and luxurious amenities such as spas, common features in high-end hotels.
"The rebranding definitely helped sales of the residences. Now, the residences have the track record of an experienced property operator versus other new developments that don't," he said.

The Action: After an offer on this two-bedroom plus den and office suite fell through, local renters who attended the first open house returned for a second round of open houses and promptly drafted a bid to beat out any more competition.
What They Got: This ground level suite provides 1,529 square feet of living space with large windows in virtually every room, including the den, and sliding patio doors in the living room with a gas fireplace and a dining room.
The Agent's Take: "This condo in particular is truly a one-of-a-kind find in Coal Harbour, Bayshore and in downtown, as it literally feels like a rancher-style house but planted on the waterfront in Coal Harbour," states agent Holly Wood. "You are greeted with a sunken marble entrance, 11-foot ceilings and very large rooms, and [a]wrap-around balcony that is surrounded by gently tiering waterfalls with some mountain and marina views."

Full text: After only one year in upscale fashion retailing, the Quebec owners of the landmark Ogilvy department store in downtown Montreal are selling the property to Selfridges Group Ltd., the Weston family-owned holding company.
Toronto-based SGL already owns a portfolio of high-end store chains, including Holt Renfrew & Co. Ltd. in Canada, Selfridges in Britain, Brown Thomas in Ireland and de Bijenkorf in the Netherlands.
Ogilvy - whose roots reach back to 1866 - fits perfectly with SGL's strategy of operating a select group of top-end stores in geographically diversified regions, said SGL chief financial officer Paul Gallagher.
"We've got a strong history of investment and development in prestigious, iconic retail stores across the globe," he said in an interview Friday after the announcement of the deal, whose financial details were not disclosed.
The family of billionaire Galen Weston acquired the prestigious Selfridges department store chain - founded in 1909 - eight years ago. It already owned the Holt Renfrew chain as well as Brown Thomas.
Ogilvy was founded by Scottish-born James Angus Ogilvy and established itself over the years as a Montreal institution, notable for the daily lunchtime concert by a bagpiper winding his way through the aisles, a tradition that continues to this day.
The Quebec investment group selling Ogilvy is made up of the Fonds immobilier de solidarité FTQ, shopping-centre developer Devimco Inc., Champlain Financial Corp. and BB Real Estate Investment Trust, owned by the Bombardier-Beaudoin family.
Josee Lagacé, a spokeswoman for the Fonds, said it was never the intention to hang onto Ogilvy for a prolonged period of time.
The fund - owned by one of Quebec's major trade unions - got involved because of the potential for developing a 14,000-square-foot parcel of land next door to Ogilvy, she said.
The option for the investment group to buy the adjacent land was packaged with their original purchase of Ogilvy and is still available should they decide to build on it. Among the development options being studied for the patch of prime downtown real estate are plans for a 22-storey mixed-used building, Ms. Lagacé said.
Maureen Atkinson, a retailing consultant with the J.C. Williams Group in Toronto, said it makes perfect sense for the Ogilvy store to go to an owner with a solid track record in the volatile world of high-end retailing.
"You would really want [SGL] as an owner. We use them as an example of department stores that have reinvented themselves. They're very exciting stores," she said.
The deal is expected to close in the fall and existing management overseeing day-to-day operations at Ogilvy will stay on, SGL said in a news release.
Mr. Gallagher said no major changes are planned to Ogilvy, which is just down the street from SGL's Holt Renfrew store on a stylish stretch of Sherbrooke Street.
"These are stand-alone operations with local management who understand the local culture and local purchasing tastes," he said.
Ogilvy uses a store-within-a-store retail model, with about three-quarters of its 135,000 square feet of space leased out to between 30 and 40 specialty boutiques.
Mr. Gallagher said SGL anticipates it will go ahead with the previous owners' plans to open a second Ogilvy outlet, in the Quartier Dix30 shopping mall in Brossard, on Montreal's south shore.
The chairman of SGL is Galen Weston, whose family's other assets include Weston Foods and Loblaw Cos. Ltd.

Abstract: Once you've settled on a region, it's time to narrow down the search. Steven Curry, with Forest Hill Real Estate's Port Sandfield office, suggests would-be buyers make a checklist of their requirements: Do you want to use the place year-round? Could you handle boating to an island, or do you need a road right to the door? Would you prefer a place where everyone water-skis or a quiet lake that bans motorboats? Does the place need to be kid - or seniors - friendly? And so on.

Full text: For most property hunters, the search for a cottage takes at least a year. Maybe two. But armed with some savvy scouring tactics, you may be able to locate a dreamy dockside retreat sooner than you think
As far as cottage-buying experiences go, Vicky Campbell and Jordan Williams had it pretty easy. Mr. Williams had long shared his father's cottage in the Land O' Lakes region so, when the Whitby-based couple decided to buy a vacation home of their own, they knew that's where they wanted to look. And it only took them a couple of offers to land their two-bedroom property on Big Gull Lake, about 60 kilometres north of Napanee, Ont.
"We really liked the solitude. It's well-treed, there are no close neighbours, and it's on a sheltered bay, so you don't get a lot of boat traffic," says Mr. Williams of their quick, perfect find.
Their agent, Royal LePage broker Chris Winney, admits they were lucky. "Buyers are usually in contact with us for at least a year." And it's not unusual to spend twice as long - or more - in the hunt for a cottage. Ready to begin?
First off, the good news: According to agents across the province, this summer has been a buyers' market, with properties available in a broad range of prices on lakes in all the desirable locations.
The bad news: The starting price in those desirable locations is more than $300,000. Then you have to factor in all the expenses, such as having a second mortgage (likely at a higher interest rate than the one you have on your home), the high property taxes that those high property values entail, and a second set of utility bills, among others. And we haven't even gotten to the commute yet ...
Still interested? If so, then start by figuring out where you want to end up.
Ontario offers a wide range of cottaging options, from rows of off-beach summer homes along the Lake Huron shore, through the hustle-and-bustle (and celebrity spotting) of Muskoka's "Big Three" lakes, to quieter, more rustic places in areas such as Haliburton.
If you don't already have your heart set on one location, consider touring the province to check out the various flavours of cottaging on offer (see map). One great way to get to intimately know a region is by renting in the area. You'll get a sense of commute times, local attractions, and what sort of terrain, wildlife, and bug life you can expect.
Now, about that commute. In short, it sucks. But for that quintessential cabin on the Shield experience, most of us are willing to suck it up and navigate the Highway 400 hordes by heading north. And the further up you go, the lower the prices come down.
Once you've settled on a region, it's time to narrow down the search. Steven Curry, with Forest Hill Real Estate's Port Sandfield office, suggests would-be buyers make a checklist of their requirements: Do you want to use the place year-round? Could you handle boating to an island, or do you need a road right to the door? Would you prefer a place where everyone water-skis or a quiet lake that bans motorboats? Does the place need to be kid - or seniors - friendly? And so on. Once you've focused on the type of place you want, he says the cottage itself is almost irrelevant. "You can always change the building, but you can't change the land, so make sure the property works for you and your family."
How do you find the right property? "The number one thing is to use a local agent," says Bill Kingshott, a Royal LePage broker in Parry Sound. While this may seem self-serving, he makes a valid point. Unless your agent in the city is a seasoned cottager, they likely won't have had much experience with septic systems, drawing drinking water from wells, and various other quirks of cottage country, and certainly won't be up to speed on the municipal zoning laws and other local issues.
In addition to a local agent's knowledge base, Ms. Winney suggests reading back issues of the community newspaper to learn about potential deal-breakers, which can range from apocalyptic swarms of blackflies, to the possibility of a uranium mine swallowing up your town (as is the case near Goderich, Ont). You should also find out if the lake you're keen on has a cottagers' association and investigate what issues are of concern to them.
While spring is typically the busy period for sales, savvy buyers will hold off for fall, since owners would rather take a little less money than have the maintenance and carrying costs of holding it until the next year.
Before you put an offer on what you think is the cottage of your dreams, visit the place a few times, at different times of day (and different times of year, if possible), so you have a clear sense of sun exposure, privacy levels in the foliage-free seasons, amount of boat and snowmobile traffic, and other factors that can make it less than idyllic.
As part of the negotiations, arrange for an onsite orientation session - or at least a detailed set of written instructions - explaining how all the building's systems (septic, water pump, heating, and electricity) work.
Finally, a cottage is definitely a purchase you want to get an inspection done on, and you should be there while it's under way to ask at least some of the million questions that will arise after you take possession.
Ms. Campbell's and Mr. Williams's advice for buyers? "Ask for extras, like boats and other stuff that you're going to have to buy anyway," says Ms. Campbell. Since the seller of their Big Gull Lake retreat was getting out of the cottage market, the couple managed to negotiate to get a motorboat, paddleboat, four-wheel ATV, and some tools as part of the deal. You're not going to get those kind of toys thrown in on a deal in the city.
*****
THE COTTAGE COUNTRY CIRCUIT
Following the tradition of the grand tours of old through the European continent, this roughly circular route traverses most of Southern Ontario's key cottage regions. You could aggressively cover it in about a week, or take two to leisurely explore what cottage country has to offer.
1) Start off heading east from Toronto to the sandy beaches and wine country in Prince Edward County .
2) Detour option: Follow the St. Lawrence through the Thousand Islands region, or meander along the route of the Rideau Canal Waterway on your way to exploring the Ottawa Valley .
3) Start the journey back west skirting Algonquin Park and travelling through the enticingly named Land O' Lakes .
4) The adjacent Haliburton Highlands and Kawarthas regions offer a mix of large and small lakes, and the option of endless navigation along the Trent-Severn Waterway .
5) Cruise around the east coast of Lake Simcoe on your way to the famed - and popular with the famous - Muskokas .
6) After checking out the " Big Three " lakes, head north to Huntsville then west to Parry Sound and the rugged Georgian Bay coast.
7) The really ambitious can add a western route through the Bruce Peninsula , then down south and back east along the shores of Lakes Huron and Erie . Or cover those parts of cottage country in a follow-up long-weekend trek.

Full text: Two levels of government didn't want it, but gutsy partners make a success of a Kensington Market loft project
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
There is a glow around architect Paul Oberst when he talks about Kensington Market Lofts.
The 64-year-old transplanted Kentuckian seems a rather positive fellow to begin with, but when he casts his mind back, the enthusiasm is palpable: "I think the building's quite good, but I thought the story was really, really good."
It's a triple-scoop of a good story, actually, from little things such as what was retained in the three heritage structures, the bigger story of the complex's history as various educational institutions and, finally, to how a neighbourhood came together in the 1990s to see their vision realized.
Standing in dappled shade of the building's private courtyard, he points to where a sizable chunk of the glazed-terracotta-clad 1952 building was removed to allow for this amenities space. Set back into the new facade are generous balconies with zigzagging curtain walls, and below these are little square windows into the parking garage made from reclaimed glass block. "So you walk into the parking deck and there's natural light in there," he says, pleased.
Sure, it's a little thing that he and the other designers did, but it's thoughtful: so too was keeping the many original, wide terrazzo staircases. The stairs are wide, he reminds, because of the "hundreds of people" that studied here.
The first group arrived in the form of little children, when the William Houston Public School - a handsome three-and-a-half-storey building of rug brick and oversized windows - was built on Nassau Street in 1923-24. Surrounded by a large yard with a baseball diamond (a local resident who attended the school showed Mr. Oberst where it had been), by the Depression it was all but empty as kids were pulled out of school and put to work. After a stint as a military training facility during the war and then as the Ontario College of Art afterward, the building became the Provincial Institute of Trades in the early 1950s, when the two terracotta buildings were built to train plumbers, gasfitters, welders and electricians. When Mr. Oberst first moved to the city in 1970, he'd often walk past and marvel at the lightshow provided by student welders behind the glass block: "In the evening there'd be all of this sparking in the windows, it was really fun."
George Brown College took possession of the buildings in 1968 and would train an entirely new generation of tradespeople until 1993. When the college declared the buildings surplus shortly after that, Councillor Rosario Marchese got the neighbourhood together to discuss their fate. Mr. Oberst was at that meeting, as was another architect, Robert Barnett, who had worked on the building for George Brown. Interestingly, Mr. Barnett's father, also an architect, had worked on the building decades before. Despite their size, everyone wanted to see the buildings stay put, and while some ideas weren't financially sustainable (such as an art centre), the two architects convinced the group that housing was the only real choice. The community working group then came up with a wish list - such as bringing retail back to the Baldwin Street sidewalk, having front yards on ground floor units along quieter Nassau Street and forbidding pedestrian access between the two streets via the complex - and even though they weren't obligated to do so, officials at George Brown agreed to present the list to potential buyers.
Surprisingly, finding a buyer wasn't easy. The provincial government, which could have purchased the complex for seven dollars, thought it was a "white elephant," says Mr. Oberst, shaking his head at the memory: "An acre-and-a-quarter in downtown Toronto, 200,000 square feet of building and you don't want it for seven bucks?!" The municipal government didn't want it either, and a deal with Artscape fell through, so the community group decided to prepare an offer; taking into account various deficiencies, they came up with a market value of $1-million.
Unfortunately, George Brown's number was several times that amount, so the complex hit the open market. "I don't think it was even 20 groups that came through," remembers Mr. Oberst. Regardless, the college did get at least one offer, which was, ironically, $1-million, and it was accepted. When that developer couldn't close the deal, Mr. Oberst convinced a friend and colleague, architect Lloyd Alter and his then development partner Howard Cohen (who, without Mr. Alter, started Context Development before project's end) to come take a look. They were able to buy the existing contract and secure financing from the Ontario Realty Corporation due to meeting the affordable housing threshold.
"We had AutoCAD drawings ready to go," says Mr. Oberst, who at that point still wasn't sure he and Mr. Barnett would get the nod as chief architects on the project. However, because of his relationship with Mr. Alter and an agreement to hire the "new, up-and-coming, hot guys on the block" Martin Kohn and John Shnier as co-designers, it happened. Good thing, since marrying three vintage buildings, carving them into lofts, adding three levels of parking and fulfilling the community wish list wasn't easy.
Less than a year after hundreds of happy new owners moved in, the project won Honourable Mention at the City of Toronto's 2000 Architecture & Urban Design Awards. "The community-driven development process for this project is commendable," began the awards booklet, which hailed the design as a "skillful rehabilitation of a surplus building."
While no mention was made of the new glow in the sky overhead, it's still there if you look long enough.

The Action: In the popular Tip Top Lofts residence by the waterfront, this completely custom corner penthouse sparked at bidding war between four buyers on the day it was listed for sale.
What They Got: This five-storey warehouse and office facility was constructed for a menswear clothing retailer in 1929. But it is now home to authentic hard lofts and new soft lofts in a six-storey addition, including this two-bedroom plus den suite with open concept rooms, 11-foot ceilings and full height windows with unobstructed city and lake views.
* The seller - whose brokerage firm handled the conversion project's marketing and sales - combined two units to create this roughly 2,300-square-foot space and hand-picked everything from the wiring, plumbing and sound systems to a $35,000 entry staircase and dark wood panelling on 40 per cent of the walls.
* There is an east-facing balcony off a living room with a gas fireplace and a larger north-facing terrace accessible from the dining area and Poliform kitchen, which showcases high gloss and frosted glass cabinetry and stainless steel Sub-Zero appliances, including a gas stove and wine fridge.
* The master suite has a walkout to the larger terrace, a walk-in closet and open five-piece bathroom.
* This unit comes two more bathrooms, full-sized laundry machines, an exterior locker on the same floor and two side-by-side parking spots underground.
* A monthly fee of $1,432 covers maintenance of a gym and party room, plus security and concierge.
* Local amenities include waterfront trails and yacht club, as well as streetcars and the Gardiner Expressway.
The Agent's Take: "It was a completely custom apartment and you can't really find that in that price range," says homeowner and president of Brad J. Lamb Realty Inc., Brad Lamb. "Usually if you want to get something like that, it would be over $2-million."

Full text: The killing of Kandahar's mayor deepens the power vacuum as Western troops begin to leave Afghanistan
An assassin with a suicide bomb hidden in his turban has killed the mayor of Kandahar city, the latest in a string of high-profile assassinations shaking the power structure in southern Afghanistan.
The Taliban took credit for the death of Ghulam Haider Hameedi, while American officials suggested that it was more likely a revenge killing. In any case, it's a fine distinction in a place where politics are rough and personal.
The identity of his assassin is less important than the trend now unfolding with shocking speed: the unravelling of the Afghan government and an escalation of violence at precisely the moment NATO wants to start handing more responsibility to the local authorities.
Mr. Hameedi, 65, had been meeting with a crowd of men who were upset about land seizures in Loy Wiyala, a sprawling slum on the city's north side that has become notorious as a Taliban enclave. One of the petitioners reportedly grabbed the mayor and detonated the small bomb, which decapitated the attacker and left Mr. Hameedi with fatal wounds to his head and chest. Checkpoint searches in Kandahar routinely include frisking of a visitor's arms, legs, and torso, but do not always extend to hats and head scarves. That security loophole apparently remained unclosed, despite a similar attack this month when a suicide bomber with an explosive turban hit a memorial service for a slain politician, killing four people.
It was the third major assassination in less than a month. The mayor had less clout than the other two victims, Kandahar provincial council chair Ahmed Wali Karzai and presidential aide Jan Mohammed Khan, both powerful warlords. By contrast, Mr. Hameedi was sometimes considered an example of the kind of Afghanistan the foreigners hoped to build. He spoke eloquently about his plans to fix the basic problems of his ramshackle city: garbage collection, traffic congestion and tax collection. His critics accused him of serving as the pleasant face of a corrupt regime, a former employee of a travel agency selected for the mayoralty because of his close ties with the family of President Hamid Karzai.
His duties also took him into the shady world of Kandahar's real-estate business, which exposed him to allegations of corruption.
Still, the absence of the silver-haired administrator will deepen the power vacuum in the south at a time when NATO can least afford to start over with a new set of local allies.
The number of foreign troops in southern Afghanistan has almost tripled in the past two years, climbing to nearly 70,000 as the United States surged forces into the country. Those numbers are scheduled to start falling in the coming months; the just-completed Canadian withdrawal of 2,500 soldiers will be dwarfed by the U.S. plans to pull back tens of thousands.
NATO claims it can remove those soldiers as part of a smooth transition to Afghan forces, whose ranks have swollen to about 286,000 personnel, but some analysts remain skeptical about how many of those Afghan soldiers and police officers show up for duty. Local forces suffer from high attrition, poor morale and skewed demographics that fail to represent the ethnic Pashtun south.
Observers fear that the coming withdrawals could ignite a renewed north-south civil war in Afghanistan, and some of the recent violence fits that pattern. When insurgents stormed the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul, holding the highest ground in the capital for five hours, they spent their time lobbing rocket-propelled grenades in the direction of Afghan Vice-President Qasim Fahim, a northern strongman who lives nearby. If insurgents are to blame for the most recent assassinations, they would appear designed to remove figures who might prevent the Taliban from regaining control of the south.
Even before the spate of high-profile attacks, the insurgents were killing record numbers of other pro-government figures in Kandahar. In June, the United Nations singled out the southern city in its quarterly report. "The city of Kandahar and its surroundings registered the majority of the incidents during the reporting period, with a quarter of the overall attacks and more than half of all assassinations recorded countrywide."
The spike in assassinations has been part of an overall increase in violence: Kandahar saw a 347-per-cent increase in violence incidents from 2007 to 2011, according to data for the first 22 weeks of each year compiled by security analyst Sami Kovanen of Indicium Consulting.
U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker told reporters in Kabul that rising assassinations show the Taliban are incapable of mounting bigger operations. "Clearly, these are horrific attacks, but they can also be interpreted as a sign of significant organizational weakness on the part of the adversary."
That message has been repeated by Canadian, U.S. and British spokespeople for years as the violence climbed in the south. It does not address the question that grows with each attack: Will the Afghan government prove stronger?

Full text:   Has any Canadian golf course been more eagerly anticipated than Cabot Links?
Touted as the country's first true links, the dramatic seaside layout on Cape Breton's west coast is set to become an international flagship for the struggling Canadian golf industry and, not incidentally, the saviour of Inverness, a former mining town that has seen hard times since the coal shafts closed in 1953.
Built on land uncovered when the sea receded and designed more by Mother Nature than man, a true links (such as Scotland's famous Old Course) is characterized by sandy soil, undulating terrain and native vegetation. There are fewer than 250 true links courses in the world, and almost all are found in Scotland, Ireland and England. Cabot Links - which will open 10 holes July 23 for preview rounds in anticipation of the official launch next spring - joins just four other courses in North America that are generally considered to qualify for the designation.
"Cabot Links could be the biggest thing to happen to Canadian golf in years," says Stephen Johnston, the president of Global Golf Advisors, a Toronto-based consultancy firm. "The recession has brought golf-course construction almost to a standstill across North America. Cabot Links is a real shot in the arm for golf in Cape Breton and Canada."
Cape Breton, a ruggedly beautiful island of charming villages and spectacular vistas along the Cabot Trail, has long ranked among Canada's top golf destinations. Located in the quiet north shore community of Ingonish is Highlands Links, a Stanley Thompson-designed masterpiece that has anchored Maritimes golf since 1941 but which, despite its name, is not a true links. Rounding out a strong roster are Bell Bay Golf Club, The Lakes Golf Club, Le Portage Golf Club and Dundee Resort and Golf Club.
But from the moment it opens, Cabot Links is almost certain to rival even the fame of Highlands Links, which Golf Magazine has ranked as high as 57th among the world's top courses.
Constructed between the town and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Cabot Links sprawls along a wind-buffeted shoreline that trails down into the dunes along the ocean and then back to higher ground. Each hole of the subtly moulded and strategic design by Canadian architect Rod Whitman, best known for his work at Edmonton's Blackhawk Golf Club, offers panoramic sea views.
Especially memorable is the par-five second hole, where a well-protected green is set high on a dune. Just as good is the long par-four ninth, with the harbour running along the entire length of the fairway.
And destined to become one of Canada's signature holes is the diminutive 14th, a 102-yard par three featuring what's described as an "infinity green." All that's visible to the golfer from the tee is the green and the seemingly endless ocean.
Already under construction is an elegantly understated clubhouse overlooking the 18th green. And planned for completion in time for the opening of all 18 holes next spring is a string of 60 guest rooms.
When finally at full operation, Cabot Links will provide dozens of jobs for groundskeepers, caddies (in traditional links fashion, the course will be cart-free, except for those with medical conditions) and service staff in a community of 2,000 that has long dreamed of building a golf course as a way to revive the local economy.
The road to completion was littered with obstacles, but perseverance by key players is finally paying off: The provincial government cleaned old mine tailings off the site, Toronto entrepreneur Ben Cowan-Dewar bought the land and worked with Enterprise Cape Breton Corp. He was joined by Chicago businessman Mike Keiser - renowned for Bandon Dunes, a golf resort he financed on the Oregon coast that includes four championship courses, including three of North America's true links.
Inverness is already displaying the first signs of its anxiously awaited civic renewal. Stylish new houses are under construction, real-estate prices are climbing, and plans are afoot to spruce up the tired-looking main street.
"There's tremendous excitement in town," says Tom Ryan, a board member of the Inverness Development Association. "We always knew what an ideal piece of land this is for a links course."
Until now, local tourism has focused on tours of the nearby Glenora Inn and Distillery (Canada's only producer of single malt whisky), salmon fishing on the Margaree River, and the twice-weekly harness races at Inverness Raceway. Townspeople also boast that their beach offers the warmest ocean waters north of the Carolinas, reaching summertime highs of more than 20 C.
But soon golf may become as essential to the fabric of life in Inverness as it is in Scotland's St. Andrews.
Just as in that seaside town, glimpses of the green and rumpled links are visible from almost everywhere. A long public boardwalk extends between the beach and the fairways closest to the sea, enabling strollers in Inverness to feel a part of the action.
Land for a possible second course has already been purchased to the north of Inverness on a choice stretch of coastline cut by ravines and offering panoramic views of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
Links golf, the saviour, has come to Cape Breton.

TRIED AND TRUE LINKS
Though less than 1 per cent of the world's courses, true links dominate rankings of the game's top layouts.

Table for two? How does September sound?

Author: Agrell, Siri

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/table-two-how-does-september-sound/docview/878711575/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "What's frustrating in Toronto is that places open and become instantly, deeply fashionable and everybody wants to go on a Friday or Saturday at the exact same time," she said. "You have to wait two months and go on a Wednesday night. It's often so off-putting that you never go back."

Full text:   Toronto foodies may lick their lips at the recent restaurant boom, but when it's harder to get a reservation than it is to plan a wedding, a dinner out can be a tactical nightmare. Siri Agrell digs in
The voice that answers the phone at Frank's Kitchen, the popular Mediterranean bistro on College Street, is kind but firm. Tables for the week of July 19 through July 24, she explains in a recorded message that began playing on Monday, are fully booked every night except for Sunday. Spaces are available at the bar, she assures hopeful diners, but there are no tables for parties larger than six, and groups of six are only considered for a 6 p.m. timeslot.
"The next Saturday available to book for dinner is Saturday, August 20th," she says, before the beep.
Regardless of what they hope to order in this town, Toronto restaurant lovers are currently being served a heaping dish of "sorry, we're full."
As a result of rave reviews, a thriving local food scene and the real-estate restrictions of tiny, intimate restaurants, arranging a dinner out can now involve the advance-booking scenarios usually associated with planning a wedding. Smaller restaurants are full weeks in advance, and many larger ones employ early and late seatings, requiring diners to work up an appetite by 6 p.m. or drink themselves full until their table's ready at 10. Hoping to enjoy a meal with more than three of your closest friends? You may be allowed to arrange a prix fixe, but sorry, you can't order from the menu.
One frequent restaurant-goer compared the process of procuring a table on the weekend to "getting on a list for surgery," and a survey by The Globe and Mail of some popular new places, from Roncesvalles barbecue joint Barque Smokehouse to Harbord's French fave, Ici, was a tasting menu of disappointment, even with a week's notice.
As of Monday, both Barque and Ici were booked three weeks in advance, with the latter's bar seating also booked for two weeks.
At Enoteca Sociale, the popular rustic Italian joint on Dundas Street West, a request for a table on Saturday was met with an availability for 5:30 p.m. the following week.
"We don't have a later seating available until September," an employee explained.
Perhaps this is a new twist on the slow-food movement, a plot by city chefs who believe it takes a six-week wait for a reservation to make people truly savour their food.
While tables are hard to come by, stories from frustrated diners are being served up with increasing regularity.
On the food site Chowhound, where foodies compare notes on noshes, complaints abound about not being able to secure a reservation. One man remembers calling every week for more than three months in an attempt to get a seat at Ici.
Others bemoan the restrictions placed on "larger" groups and the dismissive attitude of those who guard the reservation books.
At Campagnolo, parties of six or more diners must agree to a $50-per-person fixed menu, compiled at the chef's discretion.
One woman who attempted to arrange a dinner out for eight of her thirtysomething girlfriends with two weeks notice told the Globe that she called Woodlot, Delux, Enoteca Sociale, Cafe Nervosa, Brockton General, Campagnolo and Frank's Kitchen, all of which were full, or required large parties to eat before 6 p.m. or after 10.
"Can't eight hot chicks go out for dinner at a normal hour any more?" she lamented.
Charlene Rooke, a Toronto-based editor, said it is the inconsistency of reservation policies that frustrates her as a diner.
She tried to go to Woodlot (whose answering machine graciously informs callers that they may "request" a reservation) on a Tuesday night and phoned ahead to see if she would need a reservation.
After being told a reservation would not be necessary, she and her dinner companion arrived to find the hostess on the phone and one available table for two.
As the pair waited, they listened to the hostess promise the table to a person on the phone.
"She gives away the table while I'm standing there and then she told us it would be an hour wait," recalled Ms. Rooke.
James Chatto, an editor of Food & Wine magazine and the former long-time restaurant critic for Toronto Life, believes many Toronto restaurants lack a degree of "tact and grace" when it comes to handling an increase in demand.
"It happens in New York, for sure, but for some reason they seem to do it without such offence," he said. "There's a measure of charm in the places in New York that haven't let me in which is absent from that attitude here."
Still, he finds the current difficulty in procuring a reservation in Toronto an improvement over the "no reservations" policies of places like Guu and The Black Hoof.
"That drives me up the wall, because it's just lazy. Anybody can run an efficient reservation system. It's not rocket science," he said.
Heavily booked restaurants are a sign of a healthy industry, he said, and Toronto has seen similar waits during the heyday of Centro, in the late 1980s and early years of Lee on King Street West, which opened in 2004.
"Eventually the fuss dies down and they become eager for customers," he said.
In the meantime, restaurants must be careful not to alienate diners, he said. Scheduled seatings with early and late dining times are annoying, he said, and used by restaurants to turn over tables three times in an evening.
"It looks like greed," he said. "It's really up to the kitchen to time the dishes well, not the customer."
Many of the city's popular new restaurants are also small, he noted - Ici, for example, only seats 24 - and simply can't accommodate the demand.
Others, such as Enoteca Sociale, are wisely trying to strike a balance between taking reservations and leaving some tables open for walk-ins.
"I think that's a very smart way to do it," said Mr. Chatto. "Goodwill is key in this business."
Ms. Rooke, who lived in both Vancouver and Montreal before moving to Toronto last year, feels that going out for dinner in other cities is a less stressful affair.
In Vancouver, the popular Indian restaurant Vij's often quietly provides takeout at the back door to locals who can't fight through the throng of tourists to get a seat. And in Montreal, she said, many good restaurants fly under the radar, unburdened by the onslaught of a rave review.
In her previous role as the editor of EnRoute magazine, she recalls notifying restaurants in advance if they had been selected as one of the magazine's Best New Restaurants, after the inaugural winners complained of being unprepared for the attention.
"What's frustrating in Toronto is that places open and become instantly, deeply fashionable and everybody wants to go on a Friday or Saturday at the exact same time," she said. "You have to wait two months and go on a Wednesday night. It's often so off-putting that you never go back."

Abstract: TD Newcrest analyst Jonathan Kelcher believes Chartwell Seniors Housing REIT has taken a "step in the right direction" with this week's acquisition of the remaining 50-per-cent interest in 15 U.S. properties from ING Real Estate Community Living. He believes the purchase price of $169-million (U.S.) for the 2,947-suite portfolio is attractive and makes strategic sense.

Full text:   Yahoo Inc. (YHOO-Nasdaq)
Close: $13.48 (U.S.), down $1.11
Yahoo Inc., which saw its stock sink to fresh 2011 lows Wednesday after reporting disappointing second-quarter revenue, should continue to underperform the technology sector, said Canaccord Genuity analyst Heath Terry. Yahoo's weak performance is particularly noticeable given the broad strength in the online advertising market, he suggests.
Downside: Mr. Terry cut his price target to $14 and continues to rate it as a "hold."
Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC-TSX)
Close: $15.89, down 1¢
One month after upgrading the stock to a "buy," TD Newcrest analyst Doug Young is raising his price target and financial estimates on Manulife Financial Corp. He believes Manulife will benefit from improved macro economic conditions over the next 12 to 24 months and thinks the insurance sector is under-owned.
Upside: Mr. Young increased his price target by 50 cents to $19.
Lake Shore Gold Corp. (LSG-TSX)
Close: $2.66, down 70¢
CIBC World Markets analyst Barry Cooper believes Lake Shore Gold Corp. will have to restate reserves at its Timmins mine in Ontario using a lower grade, leading to higher operating and capital costs. The mine has been struggling to meet delivery targets since its startup, and Mr. Cooper believes the market will now discount future plans for expansion.
Downside: CIBC slashed its price target to $3 from $4.50.
Chartwell Seniors (CSH.UN-TSX)
Close: $7.95, down 4¢
TD Newcrest analyst Jonathan Kelcher believes Chartwell Seniors Housing REIT has taken a "step in the right direction" with this week's acquisition of the remaining 50-per-cent interest in 15 U.S. properties from ING Real Estate Community Living. He believes the purchase price of $169-million (U.S.) for the 2,947-suite portfolio is attractive and makes strategic sense.
Upside: Mr. Kelcher upgraded Chartwell to a "hold" and maintained a price target of $8.
Torstar Corp. (TS.B-TSX)
Close: $11.90, up 5¢
Torstar Corp. 's second-quarter results on July 29 will continue to benefit from stronger digital revenues and national ad sales, offsetting weakness in local print advertising, said Paul Steep of Scotia Capital. The firm is paying off debt thanks to the sale of its share in CTVglobemedia, and the stock "is likely to experience gains as it reports results over the next several quarters," he said.
Upside: Mr. Steep rates Torstar as a "sector outperform" with a one-year price target of $18.

When fiscal responsibility offers no guarantees

Abstract: There's the trade impact as Europe's economy slows. Europe buys 10 per cent of Canada's goods and service exports, so there's potential for a GDP hit in Canada.

Full text:   bmckenna@globeandmail.com
It seems quite unjust that Canadians must suffer as the U.S. Congress plays debt roulette and Europe dithers over Greece.
Canada is a model of fiscal good behaviour, after all. We're not the United States.
The country's combined federal, provincial and local government debt stands at 35 per cent of gross domestic product. That's the lowest in the Group of Seven and roughly half of the debt burden of the U.S., according to recent International Monetary Fund figures.
Canada's combined government deficits reached 4.6 per cent of GDP - less than half the size of the U.S. budget gap, and at the low end among developed countries.
If Ottawa and the provinces make good on their intentions, Canada's fiscal performance will be even better in a couple of years.
And yet, you just have to look at your RRSP or stock portfolio to realize that Canada isn't immune to what's happening beyond its borders. Canada's economy is simply far too connected to the rest of the world.
The potential of a U.S. debt default would clearly be damaging to Canada. After all, the United States buys 70 per cent of our goods and services exports, Canadian banks are big investors there and U.S. financial markets influence interest rates worldwide.
But it's a long-term problem, not an imminent crisis. U.S. politicians won't let their game of chicken over the federal debt ceiling provoke a default. At the end of the day, Americans are less afraid of bigger government than they are of crashing markets. So Congress will eventually agree on a more austere fiscal plan.
The troubles facing the euro zone, on the other hand, may seem a long way from Canada. But the probability of a significant shock in the short term poses a greater risk here.
So it's worth exploring how a breakup of the euro zone might affect Canada.
There's the trade impact as Europe's economy slows. Europe buys 10 per cent of Canada's goods and service exports, so there's potential for a GDP hit in Canada.
The main conduit through which Canada would be hurt is via the financial system. Canadian banks have relatively little exposure to the euro zone's weakest links: Portugal, Greece, Ireland and Spain. But they do have exposure to Britain, Germany and France, whose banks are highly exposed to a default by one or more of the smaller euro partners.
And if countries like Greece or Portugal default, the euro zone might start to come apart. That could trigger a broad credit freeze up, well beyond Europe, as countries sort out who owes what and in which currency. Panic would ensue as investors seek safe havens and safer currencies.
The loonie, given Canada's relatively small economy, would be in no position to receive the bulk of these financial flows. Only the U.S. dollar, or perhaps the yen, could accommodate such a shift.
So while the Canadian dollar might get a temporary lift, it would likely be short-lived. The loonie is now so tied to the price of global commodities such as oil, potash and gold that another wave of financial panic would likely send the loonie lower over the longer term.
So brace yourself for lower commodities prices and a weaker Canadian dollar.
The future looks uncertain. In this environment, investors are acting with unusual caution.
And so is Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney. He is to make his next interest rate call on Tuesday. While there are plenty of signals to suggest a rate hike is warranted - including high oil prices, nascent inflation, an improving jobs market and some overheating in real estate - Mr. Carney is not expected to budge.
He, too, presumably, is watching what's happening in Europe and the United States. That's why he'll err on the side of caution, keeping interest rates low and credit markets flush with cash until financial markets get a grip.
If there is a consolation for Canadians it's that the country's fiscal responsibility gives Mr. Carney more flexibility than most central bankers. Unlike his European counterparts, Canada isn't facing the wrath of foreign investors. And the country is in better shape than most to withstand the next financial shock.
That still doesn't make it fair for the rest of us.

Missing real estate agent's remains found in Markham home

Abstract: "In the U.S. or Canada there is no robust or mature kidnapping industry among criminals," said Mr. [Chris Voss], who is now CEO of the Washington-based Black Swan Group. "They are relatively new at it, they don't know what they're doing, so they tend to be sloppy."

Full text:   Kidnappings like the one police say ended with the death of a Toronto real estate agent occur very rarely in North America.
That infrequency makes them all the more dangerous for the victim, said Chris Voss, who was the FBI's lead negotiator on international kidnapping for six years until 2007.
"In the U.S. or Canada there is no robust or mature kidnapping industry among criminals," said Mr. Voss, who is now CEO of the Washington-based Black Swan Group. "They are relatively new at it, they don't know what they're doing, so they tend to be sloppy."
He said kidnappers here may be more likely to kill their victim out of a fear that person will give evidence to police when they're released.
Peel police have confirmed that human remains found in a Markham, Ont., home last week were those of Jianguo (Tony) Han, a luxury realtor who went missing from the 15-room mansion he was trying to sell in Mississauga in January, along with the home's owner, Jun (Johnny) Fei. Mr. Fei turned up safe a few days after the two went missing.
Peel police say they believe Mr. Han's abduction was part of a ransom plot carried out by a group. They have laid charges against six people, at least four of whom are in their early 20s, and have issued a Canada-wide arrest warrant for Guo Wei Wu, 43, in connection with the case.
Mr. Han, an immigrant from China, worked as a landscaper before making the leap to real estate and establishing a successful career at HomeLife Landmark brokerage in Don Mills, which caters to new Canadians with a long list of agents fluent in two or more languages.
Among the realtor's listings were several multimillion-dollar homes, including the one he disappeared from, on 1801 Featherstone Dr. in Mississauga. Mr. Fei, who is the sole director of a company that owns that house, was trying to sell it through Mr. Han for $2.4-million.
Mr. Voss said Chinese communities have an international reputation among kidnapping experts as being reticent to go to the police.
"Rightly or wrongly, Chinese around the world have a reputation for keeping within their community and not going to local authorities," Mr. Voss said. "They have a reputation for being good communities to kidnap against."
Mr. Han, 44, and Mr. Fei, 40, were reported missing by a relative of one of the men at around noon on the day after the two were last seen.
Peel Police say they have set up a task force of 10 to 20 people to investigate Mr. Han's death.
"I can't personally think of another case like this," said Constable George Tudos, a spokesman who has worked for the police force for the past 10 years.
"Such a high profile, kidnapping case with human remains found is very uncommon."
******
CRIME
Kidnappings for ransom like Jianguo (Tony) Han's are rare in Canada. Here are a few famous exceptions
Graham McMynn
Graham McMynn, the son of Vancouver businessman Robert McMynn, was kidnapped at gunpoint outside his parents' luxury home in April, 2006. The 24-year-old university student was held captive for eight days before police rescued him. No ransom demand was ever received by his family. Two men were later found guilty of unlawful confinement and kidnapping.
Cecilia Zhang
Nine-year-old Cecilia Zhang was snatched from her Toronto home in October, 2003, by Min Chen, who later said he had planned to hold her for ransom. Cecilia's remains were eventually discovered in a wooded ravine behind a Mississauga church and Mr. Chen was convicted of second-degree murder.
Cynthia Kilburn
One of Canada's most high-profile kidnapping cases was that of Cynthia Kilburn, the daughter of billionaire businessman Jim Pattison. Ms. Kilburn was kidnapped in 1990 by two men who forced their way into her North Vancouver home and demanded an $8.5-million ransom. She was released after her father paid $200,000, but her young abductors were arrested soon after when they were caught taking a limousine on a shopping spree.
Jack Irving
Bllionaire industrialist Jack Irving was kidnapped from his home in May, 1982, the year he turned 50. An out-of-work security guard with a fake gun wanted to take Mr. Irving's wife, Suzanne, hostage, but Mr. Irving persuaded him to take him instead. Police arrested Stephen Gerald Childs shortly after the kidnapping and freed Mr. Irving.

In Saint John, family is everything

Author: O'Kane, Josh

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/saint-john-family-is-everything/docview/877376353/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: In any city, one's ambitions can only go as far as one's influence - and here, that circle of influence is small and close-knit. The relationships one develops in Saint John, particularly with the Irving and Oland families, are precious - with business power concentrated in such small circles, to lose those relationships is to lose much of one's own clout.

Full text:   The death of Dick Oland focuses attention on the long-established dynasties that wield unchallenged influence in the Maritimes city
Saint John is a city with tremendous history, but a kind of stunted growth; its greater narrative rests on a small, consistent cast of characters.
Over time, the characters change, but the surnames stay the same. It's a blue-collar town, and the top of its power circles has long belonged to the industry barons that bring work to the people. These barons created dynasties: The Irvings, the Olands, and in a greater New Brunswick sense, the McCains, have run the local industry for generations - in the Olands' case, six.
But Saint John is not used to murder. And while Richard (Dick) Oland, who was killed this month, was largely estranged from the Moosehead family dynasty and beer-baron brother Derek, the city is yet to pick its jaw up off the floor.
Dick Oland was killed on July 7 in his uptown office in what police have called a homicide. On Friday police with a search warrant spent nine hours examining the home of his son, Dennis. Police have not commented on the cause of the death or the progress of their investigation.
"We're in a big city, but with a small-town attitude," lifelong resident Bill Farren says. He's a two-term city councillor and former union man who's worked at Moosehead Breweries for 37 years.
When you establish yourself here, you get to know everybody. "If you can give somebody business that's in the city, rather than outside, that's what you do," Mr. Farren says.
In any city, one's ambitions can only go as far as one's influence - and here, that circle of influence is small and close-knit. The relationships one develops in Saint John, particularly with the Irving and Oland families, are precious - with business power concentrated in such small circles, to lose those relationships is to lose much of one's own clout.
"Nobody wants to pay any disrespect to them," a source familiar with the city's business dynamics told The Globe. This rings even more true this month as Saint John cringes over Mr. Oland's killing.
Without the influence of families like the Olands, there would be little reason for many to stay in Saint John, or even New Brunswick. It is a small province, left behind as immigrants and locals moved west - from Canada's earliest days until today.
In running local industry, these families created community, and a reason to belong. They have provided work for generations. And each family is noted, as well, for its philanthropy - for giving back to the community and giving reason, beyond work, for people to remain. They are crucial to the city's existence.
That is the circle of influence in broad terms. But in Saint John, a city of 70,000 (130,000 including its bedroom communities) it is not hard to narrow this down to specifics.
Many leaders of the Saint John business community live northeast of the city in the bedroom community of Rothesay. As you head into the town, there is a fork in the road: on one side is Hampton Road, which takes you to the town's business district; and on the other, Gondola Point Road, a scenic route closer to the Kennebecasis River.
Police searched Dennis Oland's property on Gondola Point Road last Thursday, just a week after his father was found dead. Behind that property, on Hampton Road, is Dick Oland's former home. Next to Dick Oland lives James D. Irving, president of the massive J.D. Irving, Ltd. forestry manufacturing company, one of the largest components of the Irving Group of Companies.
More Irving family members live within a few blocks, including one a few doors down from Dennis Oland. Andrew Oland, son of Dick Oland's brother Derek and current president of Moosehead Breweries, lives close by as well.
Family means a lot here. Jason Stephen, president of the Saint John Real Estate Board, says there exists a "traditional mindset in terms of families." His father, Ralph Stephen, established the family name as a lawyer.
"It's an easy city" to do business in, he said, "if you get out and work in the community. People respect those people."

Latest cost-saving proposals target gifts for the needy, BIAs

Author: Church, Elizabeth

Abstract: A program that distributes Christmas gifts to needy children, a "hardship fund" that covers medical supplies and funeral costs for residents who have no other resources, and support for local business improvement areas are some of the latest "non-core" city services singled out by consultants for possible cuts by Toronto council.

Full text: Consultants single out 'non-core' city services that could be cut or eliminated
A program that distributes Christmas gifts to needy children, a "hardship fund" that covers medical supplies and funeral costs for residents who have no other resources, and support for local business improvement areas are some of the latest "non-core" city services singled out by consultants for possible cuts by Toronto council.
The second batch of potential cost-saving measures were rolled out Tuesday at City Hall and this time economic development, which includes employment and social services, was the target. The city is in the midst of a belt-tightening exercise that is reviewing more than 150 services - part of several initiatives aimed at plugging an estimated $774-million funding gap in next year's budget.
In the case of economic development, the consultants who conducted the review found that 96 per cent of the programs offered were linked to mandatory services such as employment and social services. Their report, which is being released in stages as part of committee agendas, identifies a handful of non-core program areas that could be reduced or eliminated.
The city, the report states, could consider reducing staff support services to BIAs, the local business groups that put up money to pay for such extras as planters and benches in neighbourhood shopping areas. The report also pinpointed social supports and cultural services as areas that could be reduced or cut, and suggested council consider contracting out some employment services.
Michael Thompson, chair of the economic development committee that will consider the report next week, was quick to distance himself from the KPMG proposals, cautioning that it only provides options for cutting costs. Committee members, he said, understand the benefits to the city that spending in these areas brings.
"I think we have to look at the broad implication and impact," he said, noting that cutting employment services, for example, could move more people onto social services. "At the end of the day we may save a few dollars here, but that savings has a greater impact on Toronto residents."
John Kiru, executive director of the Toronto Association of Business Improvement Areas, wondered why his members, who invest $25-million annually in local improvement projects and pay $750-million in taxes, were singled out for possible cuts.
Toronto invented the BIA model more than 40 years ago and it is now copied by other municipalities, including New York City, he said. "We are leaders in this program worldwide," he said.
The city's support helps with the creation of new associations and provides a window into city services and issues for members, Mr. Kiru said. It also ensures local associations hold annual meetings and produce audited financial statements. Without this support, he said, the quality of local organizations would be affected "absolutely."
The recommendations of the economic development committee will go to a special meeting of council in September that will make the final call on all cuts. Separate reviews of city fees and service efficiencies also are in the works, as is a review of the municipality's real-estate holdings.

Full text: Loving son, police detective, world traveller, religious scholar, affordable-housing landlord. Born Sept. 18, 1954, in Calgary. Died May 10, 2011, in Huntsville, Ont., of cardiac ischemia, aged 56.
In the autumn of 1999, a motorist stopped to ask Dave Keay what he was doing outside the old Empire Hotel building in Huntsville, Ont.
Dave replied, "I just bought this building!"
When asked what he planned to do with the somewhat rundown, 50-unit former hotel, he said, "I'm going to turn it into a nice place for poor people to live." The man had vision.
In 1957, Doug's father, Ferdinand, and mother, Gertrude, moved the family to Toronto, where Dave's sisters, Linda, Janice and Lise, were born.
After graduating from high school, Dave joined the RCMP. Twelve years later, he resigned to travel the world while he was still young.
He sailed the South Pacific and travelled in Asia for five years, then enrolled at the University of Toronto. He earned an honours degree in comparative religion and completed teachers college.
Dave started a business with his mother buying and renovating old houses in the Toronto neighbourhood of Rosedale. After a few years, he decided he wanted to move to a smaller town. He scouted along Highway 11, looking for a real-estate investment opportunity.
The Empire Hotel was an intriguing prospect. Once a modern and stately hotel, the building was eventually converted into subsidized housing, with retail stores on the ground level. It had been almost completely obscured by cheap cosmetic renovations.
But Dave could see what was beneath the exteriors of both the building and the marginalized people within.
As residents moved out, he would gut and remodel apartments. Dave hired local tradesmen and labourers and, together with the tenants, he literally built a community. The rents were affordable and he rarely raised them. He was an advocate and protector to his more vulnerable tenants. He was never away for more than a few days, rarely travelling farther than Toronto, where he tended to his beloved Aqua Star, a steel-hulled sailboat he intended to sail around the world when he retired.
By the autumn of 2009, Dave had redone all but one of the apartments. Late on Oct. 8, one day after he had finished restoring the exterior of the four-storey building, an electrical fire started on the top floor. As he watched 10 years of his life's work being destroyed, Dave was most concerned about the tenants. He worked hard to help them find replacement housing and maintain their sense of community.
A few months after completing the building's demolition, Dave died suddenly while building himself a new house in Huntsville.
The site where the Empire Hotel stood is now a vacant lot, leaving an empty space in the heart of the community, much as Dave's death leaves a sad, empty space in the hearts of those who knew him.
By Doug Banwell, Dave's friend.

Starwood has no reservations about working in China

Abstract: It's difficult - I've shown up to some meetings in a suit, only to have everyone arrive in T-shirts, and I've worn a T-shirt into a meeting full of suits. One thing I've had a good laugh about is the way Chinese is translated into English.

Full text: Expect to get lost in translation, so bring a culture and language expert - and a T-shirt, advises hotel chain chief Frits van Paasschen
When Frits van Paasschen boarded a flight to China with his executive team to spend five weeks immersed in the country's business culture, the Starwood Hotels chief was quick to point out he wasn't just trying to drum up publicity.
Starwood is one of the largest hotel companies in the world, with some 300,000 rooms across more than 1,000 properties operating under banners such as W, Westin and Four Points Sheraton.
Eighty per cent of the New York-based company's growth is expected to take place outside North America in the next decade. It plans to open a hotel every two weeks in China, on average, for the next few years.
Already, China is the company's second biggest market, behind the United States, with more than 70 hotels (Canada is third largest). And like many hotel and commercial real estate executives, Mr. van Paasschen wanted to better understand what is becoming an integral market.
"I couldn't spend five weeks on a publicity stunt," he said on his way back to New York. "This is a big time investment, with the objective of better understanding a market that is increasingly important to our future."
Before the executives had even returned to New York they issued the first of several anticipated changes: a new program geared toward accommodating Chinese tourists and business travellers at 19 hotels around the world. They will offer in-room teakettles and slippers, and translation services will be available in-house.
"Just as our hotels in China have historically catered to American and European travellers, with familiar amenities from home, now our hotels globally will provide the same services to Chinese travellers," he said.
But that's not all Mr. van Paasschen learned on his trip:
What was the biggest surprise?
What has struck me the most is the rate at which the economy continues to develop. Being here has afforded me the opportunity to look outside the major cities and see the changes that are taking place. It's the second- and third-tier cities that are amazing - the cost of real estate and living in the larger cities has affected growth elsewhere. While there may be some talk of overbuilding right now, it would seem there is such a continued growth in demand that extra supply will easily be used up. Today's overcapacity is tomorrow's supply.
So there's a market opportunity for foreign hotel operators?
Absolutely. Look at a city like Shenzhen - it has essentially been built in the last 25 years. We came in a number of years ago and [looked at a more luxurious brand] opening there for us. We've been saying for some time that you need to be in these markets to see how big they can become. The other notable change is a broader range of what people consider luxury - the Chinese have traditionally had a more traditional view of luxury, but that is changing.
What have you learned in China that you couldn't have learned in the U.S?
Many decisions you take in business are not just a function of analysis and available information. By spending time with our teams in China, seeing the developments first hand and observing travellers, we all feel better able to talk about what we're doing, and we can make decisions that are based on judgment. I could have read a book about the developments talking place here, but it's not the same.
In China, relationships are extremely important. They see this as our commitment to the market.
That's an important signal, and it's not lost on most people that we'll soon have 30,000 associates working in our hotels in China.
As we double our footprint over the next three years, that number will increase proportionately.
Any advice for other business leaders?
We've really seen the value of having Chinese senior executives running the business in China.
It may seem quite obvious, but it is important to hire local managers in any market - particularly China, because the cultural differences are so great.
What cultural differences have you noticed?
There's the language barrier. That may seem trivial, as in Europe and North America you can follow the thought process even if you don't speak the language. In China, there is a different manner. Relationships are key, and in initial meetings, you speak far less about business. The communication is more subtle, and you need to talk to people afterward who are culturally and linguistically knowledgeable in order to reflect on what the reaction actually was.
It's difficult - I've shown up to some meetings in a suit, only to have everyone arrive in T-shirts, and I've worn a T-shirt into a meeting full of suits. One thing I've had a good laugh about is the way Chinese is translated into English.
It's a cautionary reminder that my attempt to say things may seem equally comical the other way around. You need to recognize that some things will look silly, but as long as you're doing it in a way that is jovial and familiar, it's not that uncomfortable.
This article has been edited for length and clarity.

Abstract: The largest year-over-year gain was seen in [Regina], where standard two-storey homes jumped 15.6 per cent. Detached bungalows also posted a strong 11 per cent gain. At the end of 2011, average house prices in Regina are forecast to be 12.4 per cent higher than 2010.

Full text: House prices have likely peaked after a strong six months, Royal LePage Real Estate Services said Thursday in a market update.
While prices saw big year-over-year price increases in the second quarter, "high house prices are concealing early signs of a moderating market."
"The market has seen its near-term peak in house price appreciation, and a slower second half of the year is expected," the brokerage said in a statement.
"In many of Canada's regional markets, we saw house prices appreciate at a significantly faster rate than wages and salaries, and this trend cannot continue indefinitely," CEO Phil Soper said.
Halifax
Healthy year-over-year price gains across all three housing types surveyed. Strong local economy coupled with low interest rates has driven demand in the region. At the end of 2011, average house prices are forecast to be 3.3 per cent higher than 2010.
Montreal
Detached bungalows and two-storey houses posted strong year-over-year gains - higher than 7 per cent in the second quarter, while standard condominiums rose modestly by 1.9 per cent. At the end of 2011, average house prices in Montreal are forecast to be 7 per cent higher than 2010.
Ottawa
Year-over-year price appreciation across all housing types surveyed. An average two-storey home rose 5.2 per cent year-over-year to $371,500. At the end of 2011, average house prices are forecast to be 5 per cent higher than 2010.
Toronto
Seller's market witnessed strong year-over-year price appreciation. Price gains ranged from 4.7 to 6.1 per cent for the housing types surveyed. Low inventory and low interest rates continue to drive real estate prices. Lack of inventory was cited as the main reason for reduced market activity.
Winnipeg
Confidence in the local economy is reflected in the real estate market's performance. Detached bungalows rose 7.5 per cent to $281,125, and condominiums 6.6 per cent. At the end of 2011, average house prices are forecast to be 6 per cent higher than 2010.
Regina
The largest year-over-year gain was seen in Regina, where standard two-storey homes jumped 15.6 per cent. Detached bungalows also posted a strong 11 per cent gain. At the end of 2011, average house prices in Regina are forecast to be 12.4 per cent higher than 2010.
Calgary
Witnessed moderate year-over-year price declines as it continues to adjust from the boom experienced in the middle of the previous decade.
Vancouver
Experienced some of Canada's largest year-over-year price increases with detached bungalows rising 14.1 per cent and standard two-storey homes rising 12 per cent. Average prices for standard condominiums rose 2.5 per cent. At the end of 2011, average house prices are forecast to be 15.4 per cent higher than 2010.

Full text: Road trip letters from the colony: Timmie's, Pippa, poutine and Player's Light
globedrive@globeandmail.com
Salutations Harry,
I hope this e-mail finds you well. The weather here is quite agreeable. Canadians, as a people, are very much like we Brits: cautiously friendly and obsessed with real estate.
You know how much I like motoring (it was me who insisted we drive away from the wedding in an Aston Martin Volante). Well, it's our first visit here and the Duchess of Cambridge and I are determined to immerse ourselves in the culture - and the best way to do that is to see the country coast-to-coast by automobile. In fact, I am writing you this from the Trans-Canada Highway.
Don't worry I'm not texting behind the wheel, Kate's driving (women's lib you know). I will report back shortly.
Dear Harry,
After two days' travel we've made our first three discoveries. 1) Timbits. 2) "Double-double" (it's a beverage, not a depraved act) 3) Canadian drivers drive on the right side of the road! God Bless the Commonwealth! Life is a highway, the Canadian poet Tom Cochrane once said. True words, dear Harry, and we shall live them.
Dearest Pippa,
My darling sister, if, on a future date, you find yourself a newlywed and your husband expresses an interest in "getting all Kerouac on Canada's ass" and then quotes an obscure colonial poet named Tim Cockburn - be very careful how you answer.
P.S. Now that Prime Minister Harper has put down the Canadian postal strike I will send you a box of Timbits.
Dear Harry,
What does it mean when a person slows down next to you, lowers their window, shrieks expletives and then roars away? In Canada, it means you were driving the speed limit.
We are currently motoring through Quebec and all the signs are "en Francais." Confusing. I thought Prince Philip said we conquered these people in 1759.
Kate has taken to eating a great deal of something called poutine. It's not what you think.
Hello, Pippa,
Have been feeling a tad strange.
The other day at Yorkton, "Saskatchewan," I stepped out of our car at a Petro-Canada in my Erdem Moralioglu form-fitting black floral lace dress and no one even noticed.
Yesterday, I told a waiter that the Edmonton Oilers were crazy for selecting defenceman David Musil in the second round. The problem? I don't know what Edmonton, the Oilers, or a defenceman is.
Dear Harry,
This morning, the Duchess of Cambridge and I participated in a time-honoured Canadian tradition. It's called yelling at farmers.
Here's how it works: one is motoring along a country road and suddenly one finds oneself stuck behind a line of 20 or 30 cars all of which are stuck behind a tractor or thrashing machine that is being driven by a sunburned farmer wearing a baseball hat. Despite the speed limit being 80 km/h, the tractor never exceeds a speed of 30 km/h and, since the roads are so windy, passing him is difficult. Hours go by and finally, when one has a chance to pass, one is so vexed one hurls abuse at the poor farmer who by this time has become inured to the verbal assault.
You would have been proud. When our turn came Kate screamed some awful things. I'm a little concerned about her. The other day she asked me to get her a "pack of Player's Light and two-four of Kokanee."
Dear Harry,
A local resident explained the preponderance of "Tim Hortons" restaurants along Canada's highways. Apparently, Tim Horton was a member of a 1920s art collective known as the Original Six. He specialized in expressing the northern landscape's terra nullius by crafting sculptures from sugar and cake dough.
Life on the road is taking its toll on Kate. Her temper is frayed. Canadians are constantly asking her about her sister. "All day long, all I hear is how great Pippa is at this or chaps banging on about how wonderful Pippa's backside looks," she said the last time she was asked. "Pippa! Pippa! Pippa!"
By the way, how is Pippa?
Some casual observations:
-Turn signals are optional in Canada. When someone wants to change lanes he just jerks his car abruptly into the desired lane and everyone makes way because Canadians are such skilled motorists.
-Canadians value their transportation infrastructure. Virtually every highway is being repaired. Ideally the same stretch of highway is repaired every summer.
Yo! Pippmeister!
This country rocks! Will and I (well, just "I" actually) got royally hammered at Kelsey's in Burnaby last night. Will was like, "I'm going to be King." And I was like, "Yeah, well you're the designated driver tonight, dawg, because Will-I-am is doing some shooters!"
I'm thinking I might spend the winter in Whistler, working at a hotel and snowboarding. You got to get out here, sis! By the way, every one in Canada wants to know how your ass is. Can you put up a status report on Facebook?
Dear Harry,
We've made Vancouver - our journey's end. It has been a memorable experience though not without its price. Experts tell us Kate suffered a mild mood swing triggered by Timbit-induced sugar levels five times the normal limit and exposure to Canadian culture. It's called being a hoser.
It's curable. She's to change outfits at least three times a day and is being given Smythe, Issa, Prada and L.K. Bennett shoes. She should be back to normal shortly.
I must say, that while we enjoyed driving across Canada, I think from now on we'll be taking air transport. Given our status, it's best to remain above things.

Montreal gas station to fill up once again

Author: Leblanc, Dave

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/montreal-gas-station-fill-up-once-again/docview/875486773/se-2?accountid=14656

Full text: In its new incarnation, the Mies van der Rohe design will house two community pavilions - one for young users, one for older ones
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
It's been called the most beautiful gas station in the world.
So beautiful, in fact, a movie, Regular or Super: Views on Mies van der Rohe , featured it in 2004.
And now it's getting a beautiful new life.
Long, low and in his trademark black steel, the shuttered-since-2008 Esso station by Bauhaus master Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, at boulevard de l'Île des Soeurs and rue Berlioz in Montreal's Nuns' Island community, currently lies stripped of a little of its beauty - huge sheets of glass and their associated mullions have been numbered and disassembled for restoration - but by fall, the building will be buzzing with youth and seniors as a maison des generations .
Underneath that long cantilevered roof, lead architect Eric Gauthier points to where the two glass pavilions will be rebuilt to their original 3,000- and 1,000-square-foot specifications - one room for young users and one for older ones - and laughs as he slaps one of the 12 massive columns: "These are not real I-beams," says the 50-year-old principal at Les Architectes FABG, who was selected to restore Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome at Expo 67 in the 1990s. "They are made up I-beams with [steel] plates that have square edges. [Mies] was an aesthete: He thought, 'I'll do proper I-beams'... all the connections are welded, it's a crazy way to do things."
Crazy, perhaps, but the incredible strength from overengineering means many massive Montreal snowfalls have been shrugged off since 1968, the year of the station's construction and one year before the architect's death.
It's made for an easy restoration, too. With such a robust structure, the team has concerned itself thus far with underground repairs and the installation of a new geothermal system. Other than the removal of glass and mullions, the only evidence of above-ground work is the sandblasting of brick walls in the garage area, now restored to their original buff yellow. On the underside of the roof, dozens of new fluorescent fixtures remain in their original configuration, and although Mr. Gauthier says with a chuckle, "I never thought that I would be duplicating and restoring fluorescent lighting," he understands that the illuminated geometric "stripes" are just as crucial to the composition as the grid of crisscrossing roof beams. It's a Mies thing, and it's beautiful.
Between the two pavilions, Mr. Gauthier is retaining the square concrete island where the gas pumps were located. In place of each pump there will be boxes built to the same scale; these will house exhaust and intake vents for the geothermal unit. These replicas, he says, are "important to understand that it was a gas station." The small cashier booth will be restored and will act as a key depot for an auto-share program.
Although much attention is being paid to the original design, and Mr. Gauthier certainly has the chops to tackle such a modernist icon - a few years ago he designed a one-storey community centre in Pierrefonds that looks very Miesian - he stresses he's not a member of the "church of Mies."
"Like with Buckminster Fuller, we tried to keep a critical eye," he says, adding that if he had gone through the "torturous" process of worrying about every nut and bolt and whether Mies would have approved, he would have gone mad. And since the gas station is also attributed to local architect Paul H. Lapointe, and, further, since the Bauhaus master was in his final years at the time of the design, it's likely he just checked the drawings and signed off on them: "It doesn't bear the excellence [of his hand] ... how do you say in English? - there are pedestrian things in the approach."
Pedestrian or not, FABG is taking great pains to get it right. Furniture, Mr. Gauthier says, will "disappear" so as to not compete and it will most likely be black or white to follow the ceiling pattern established by the black beams below the white metal decking. For elegance, texture and privacy, the architect is toying with the idea of thick, black velvet drapes, which will echo the influence of Mies's collaborator, textile and furniture designer Lilly Reich.
Unlike the cozy charm of a Victorian or Arts and Crafts room, rigid modernist spaces aren't as easy to love for some. That's why this adaptive reuse into a community centre filled with life and laughter is such an excellent choice: Much like the smart decision by Toronto developer Camrost-Felcorp to allow the impressive lobby of the former Imperial Oil building on St. Clair Avenue West to be used as a café or restaurant, what was once a perfunctory act of filling up or buying a candy bar on Nuns' Island will be replaced by sitting, relaxing and getting to know the space - some may even walk from the Mies-designed rental apartment tower two blocks away - which will, in turn, cement a sense of ownership and pride.
"I think it's enough to do the project," Mr. Gauthier says with a smile. "I'm not trying to be interesting and original and counteracting [the original scheme]. Maybe the strength of it - the roof, the glass - will be enough."

Boutique condominium residences are such a sought-after commodity in the established Beaches community, Reserve Properties sold 90 per cent of its church-conversion project in the first month and the rest shortly after that earlier this year.
People who didn't have a chance to buy a unit at Bellefair before they sold out were put on a list to be the first to purchase at the builder's latest mid-rise development nearby, called Lakehouse Beach Residences.
"It's about 65-per-cent sold out and we haven't had our grand opening," vice-president Shane Fenton said prior to the official launch last month.
"We also marketed, sold and developed the Bellefair project two blocks away, so based on that we got a good handle and understanding of where the market is, what they're looking for, price points and demand.
"What we've realized is that there's a significant demand in the Beach with a very limited supply of new condo product."
This contemporary infill project will comprise just 28 units in a six-storey structure at the corner of Kenilworth Avenue and Queen Street East.
"We think it's a great neighbourhood and a great place to be," Mr. Fenton says. "There's been such a significant demand from the local community of people who live in the Beach, love the Beach and want to stay there, but want an alternative to single-family living."
The area is well known for its abundance of parks, beaches and sports facilities along the waterfront, not to mention popular restaurants, cafes and shops on Queen Street East.
"There's so much out there, so the goal is to encourage buyers to really enjoy the neighbourhood and everything it has to offer rather than be holed up within the building," says Mr. Fenton, who excluded recreation facilities from the site for this reason, except for a pet spa.
But there will be retail shops facing Queen Street East at the base of the building, which Raw Design devised with glass, brick and Ipe wood in keeping with the character of the immediate surroundings.
The top floors will be set back from the streets, allowing for terraces and wraparound balconies with more than 1,000 square feet of space. "You've got a number of units that have very expansive, large terraces like that - almost equivalent to the size of the units," Mr. Fenton says.
Monthly fees will be 52 cents a square foot. Parking will be $35,000 and lockers $3,000. Occupancy is scheduled for November, 2013.

Full text: Summer Live, celebrating the city's 125th birthday, arrives in the nick of time
It would be folly to think that by the time Vancouver singer/songwriter Dan Mangan reaches the chorus of his hit song Robots at Stanley Park on Sunday night, the echoes of the riot will have gone silent, all of that civic sociological damage will have healed. A crowd of thousands singing "robots need love too" will not be loud enough to drown out the bad memories - or take back what was lost of the city's reputation on the world stage.
But Vancouverites need love, too, and a well-run celebratory event could be a good step in feeling better about this place.
We head into Summer Live - a free, three-day festival at Brockton Point celebrating the city's 125th birthday - with the overturned burning cars and smashed store windows very fresh in the psyche. When I asked a bunch of local musicians for a lousy Vancouver memory, many mentioned the riot. Further afield, they're thinking about it, too. Like it or not (not), this is the event that has come to define us beyond our borders.
"Our city is an international laughingstock at present," reports a Summer Live participant who doesn't want to be named.
"For the last two weeks, I've been travelling and have been completely embarrassed about Vancouver as we've been mocked for our riots and the alarmingly large number of young people who thought the whole thing a big laugh."
These are international travels, I should point out. And it's the same story elsewhere in Canada.
My husband, in Toronto for the past two weeks, says that with alarming consistency, the riot is the first topic of conversation brought up by the people he encounters. As a former Torontonian, I've taken some riot grief from people out East as well.
Remember the good old days when you mentioned Vancouver to an out-of-towner and they remarked on the quirky politics or the insane real-estate prices or all that pot smoking? Or maybe how we consistently top those best-place-to-live surveys? No more. Vancouver equals riot in the public consciousness outside of this city, at least right now.
Not exactly the birthday present we were hoping for.
I'm all for some moving on, though, so I have to disagree with the unnamed Summer Live participant on this: "Frankly, it's an embarrassment that we're trying to hold another party, ostensibly to celebrate 125 years." And on the artist's concern about the possibility of riots in the park this weekend.
Yes, there will be two licensed "bistros," an estimated 25,000 people per day, and rock and roll, but it's hard to imagine a riot breaking out among the face-painting and origami tables, the puppet workshops, the participatory mural, or the Coast Salish canoe races. Nor do I anticipate trouble brewing during performances by The New Pornographers, Daniel Wesley, L Subramaniam or the VSO.
Still, the city is promising "quite extensive security deployments" that were increased somewhat since the Stanley Cup riots, according to Margeret Specht, who is the city's lead on 125th anniversary cultural initiatives. "We added a little bit more security, a little more extensive deployment, but not largely," she said on Thursday. "It was certainly a consideration and we had lots of conversations about it, about what was enough and what was too much, so we're hoping to find the right balance."
With a free shuttle service and an emphasis on public transit and bicycle access, the $3.3-million event (about a third of that coming from city coffers, the rest from Ottawa and sponsorships) appears to be well-planned, although transportation snags could ensue.
It's certainly very well curated. Musically, there's a diverse lineup with some stellar acts, including a who's who of the Vancouver indie scene. The visual and performing arts are also well represented with the likes of Kokoro Dance and Neworld Theatre's PodPlays, and the time-based video program featuring work by artists such as Rebecca Belmore and Paul Wong. There's also a ton on offer for families. The cultural side of this has been very well thought out.
No matter how well things go, this isn't going to do anything to fix our international reputation. They won't care in New York or London and probably not even in Toronto that Neko Case played a great set or that a bunch of kids learned how to make kites at Stanley Park this weekend. But the city needs this right now; an event to celebrate itself. That doesn't mean all is forgotten, though. Or that at the ripe old age of 125, we don't have some growing up to do, still.

Europe assails 'bias' of debt raters

Full text: Leaders complain new cuts by rating agencies based in the U.S. are hampering efforts to solve crisis
Europe's leaders are accusing the world's largest credit-rating agencies of bias in assessing the debt of troubled countries, renewing calls for the creation of a European rating agency.
The complaints were sparked after Moody's downgraded Portugal by four notches Tuesday to "junk" status, and Standard & Poor's warned Monday it would consider it a "selective default" if banks and insurers roll over about $42-billion of Greek debt - a move that could derail efforts to restructure Greece's debt.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Wednesday he was surprised by the decision to downgrade Portugal, saying he "can't decipher" the basis for the evaluation.
"We need to break the oligopoly of rating agencies," he told reporters in Berlin.
The comments heighten long-simmering tensions between politicians and the three leading rating agencies, whose ratings are crucial to efforts of Europe's troubled countries to ease their debt burdens. In the short run, policy makers need to keep Athens from being declared in default so Greek banks can continue to borrow from the European Central Bank.
European leaders are struggling to extend Greece's debt and win support for fiscal plans for Spain, Ireland and Portugal, while debt-rating agencies are assessing the efforts on behalf of private-sector lenders and bondholders who are being asked to participate in some of the refinancing efforts.
Mr. Schaeuble's concerns were echoed by European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso, who criticized Moody's for downgrading Portugal so soon after it received a bailout. He said the ratings move is fuelling speculation in financial markets this week.
"It seems strange that there is not a single rating agency coming from Europe," Mr. Barroso told reporters in the European Parliament.
"It shows there may be some bias in the markets when it comes to the evaluation of the specific issues of Europe."
European Union political leaders have talked in the past about creating a European debt-rating agency, but there is no concrete plan in place to do so.
Lawmakers have butted heads with the rating agencies throughout the debt crisis, but even earlier criticized the firms for helping spark the financial crisis in 2008 by failing to adequately assess the risks of complex financial instruments.
The credit-rating firms are now facing new regulations requiring registration as well as heightened standards to control conflicts of interest.
Those new reforms, however, have not stopped European politicians from continuing to complain that the world's biggest credit raters are primarily U.S.-based, although they have local offices in Europe.
Moody's and Standard & Poor's are U.S.-based firms, while giant Fitch Ratings Ltd. is based in London and New York and is owned by a Paris-based company.
"They feel [the rating agencies] just don't understand the process, and I don't think most people would say that's a fair criticism of the rating agencies as it relates to developed-country sovereign debt," said Mark Chandler, head of Canadian fixed-income strategy at RBC Dominion Securities. "They have a long track record on that."
Mr. Chandler said the credit raters are looking at the restructuring from the perspective of the private sector as policy makers continue to propose models to entice private banks and insurers to participate in Greece's bailout.
Ben May, European economist at Capital Economics in London, said that while the fight between European politicians and the major credit agencies has flared this week, it is not a new - or particularly dangerous - development.
"There have been comments like this seen over a prolonged period in the past," Mr. May said. "I'm not sure these are necessarily anything new, although there is an element of frustration."
The head of Standard & Poor's in Germany, Torsten Hinrichs, defended his firm's work, telling a radio interview he rejects the criticisms of the firm's latest report on Greece.
"The assertions are completely made up out of thin air and factually wrong," he said. "They are either based on ignorance of the facts or are politically motivated comments (that) neglect the facts."
A Reuters report quoted Mr. Hinrichs saying S & P will not put 150 years of credibility on the line "to enable politically motivated push-ups" of Greece.
Moody's said it is simply aiming to provide investors with fair information. "Moody's priority remains providing independent, objective assessments of credit risk on debt securities," a spokesman told Dow Jones.

The big, bad number / The global debt clock (US$) as of 5:30 p.m. Wednesday EST
$42,564,763,520,877
The debt crisis in Greece, Portugal and other European countries is the manifestation of a broader global issue - the enormous amount of government debt that has been built up around the globe in recent decades. The Economist tracks the total on its public debt clock, which keeps a running tally on the money owed by all governments. The current number isn't perfectly accurate, the magazine acknowledges, but it gives an idea of the incredible debts governments have accumulated because of soft tax revenue, expensive bailouts, stimulus programs, and a sluggish economy.

A WORLD OF DEBT
Many of the world's governments have borrowed more than they can afford, prompting a spiral of bailouts, debt downgrades, skyrocketing interest costs, and the risk of default. Richard Blackwell explains the situation in a select group of countries:
Greece
Greece has been living beyond its means for years, and the government has borrowed heavily, partly to pay high public sector wages, iron-clad job security and high pensions for civil servants. At the same time, the government has not been able to collect all the money owed to it, as tax evasion is widespread.
At the moment, debt is about EUR350-billion, equal to about EUR30,000 for each of Greece's 11 million citizens. The debt level will hit about 166 per cent of gross domestic product next year.
Currently, the worry is that the European bailout may be considered a default, and that could trigger insolvencies across the continent.
Portugal
Like Greece, the government of Portugal has been overspending for decades, boosting the size of its civil service while the economy grew only marginally.
At the start of 2011, Portugal implemented a deep austerity plan, which cut civil service pay and jobs, and reduced unemployment benefits. But with borrowing costs rising, that wasn't enough. Portugal received emergency loans of EUR78-billion from the International Monetary Fund and European Union in May, making it the first European country after Ireland and Greece to get a bailout.
On Tuesday, Portugal's credit rating was cut to junk by Moody's Investors Service, which said the country may require a second rescue package.
Ireland
Ireland was the first European country to fall into recession in 2008, as unemployment rose and a real estate bubble burst. It was a humbling reversal for a county that had become known as the Celtic Tiger. Irish banks, heavily exposed to the housing market after giving cheap loans to almost anyone who wanted to buy or build, required a rescue from the government. Ireland's debt levels then soared and borrowing costs spiked.
Late in 2010 the government was forced to take emergency loans of EUR85-billion from the European Union and the IMF. The Irish economy has improved slightly, but the Greek crisis is keeping borrowing costs high and a second bailout is a possibility.
Japan
Japan is the most indebted country in the world, a situation built up over many years by a sluggish economy that just can't seem to get moving. Stalled growth has forced the government to spend heavily on stimulus, while it deals with the massive social costs of an aging population.
The government's debt is now almost 200 per cent of GDP, compared with just 60 per cent 20 years ago. However, most of it is held by Japanese citizens, not foreign countries or institutions.
The earthquake and tsunami dealt another blow to the economy, although spending on rebuilding could cause a positive jolt.
United States
With more than $14-trillion in federal government debt, the United States is massively in the red. The situation has worsened in recent years thanks to tax cuts, higher government spending, the bailout of the banking system, military spending, and a stubborn economic slump.
In April, Standard & Poor's underlined the worries over the United States' financial situation by downgrading the outlook for country's debt to "negative" from "stable."
President Barack Obama is under enormous pressure to cut spending to reduce the deficit, and he is in intense negotiations with legislators to get that done. He needs a deal so Congress can boost the country's official debt ceiling - it must be raised by early August or the United States could default on some of its borrowing.
Canada
After years of running surpluses (from 1997 to 2008, to be precise), Canada shifted back into deficit in 2009 because of the stimulus required to pull the country out of recession. Many provincial governments also moved from black to red during the downturn, adding to the overall debt.
While total federal debt is now around $560-billion - it's higher if provincial debt is included - we are in good shape relative to most other countries, with an economy back on a growth track, albeit a slow one.
Finance Minister Jim Flaherty now promises to balance the books by 2015, but he'll have to find $4-billion a year in savings to accomplish that.
*****
DEPOSIT OUTFLOWS
As the EU struggles to bail out debt-stricken countries, another trend could undercut its efforts: deposit outflows from commercial banks.
Savers and investors in Greece and Ireland are withdrawing money out of concerns about the health of the banks, and what would happen if their countries were forced out of the euro zone.
The outflows have not hit disastrous levels, but the slow bleed is large enough to raise questions about the capacity of those economies to recover.
"There is a fear" of a run on banks, said BNP Paribas economist Ken Wattret. "It is happening because of speculation about the doomsday scenario of a country having to leave the monetary union ..."
Household and corporate deposits at banks in Greece, including branches of foreign banks, have dropped about 19 per cent from their peak in September 2009. Irish bank deposits are 9 per cent below their August 2008 peak.

Realty rebels merge to grab bigger stake

Author: Ladurantaye, Steve

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/realty-rebels-merge-grab-bigger-stake/docview/875010289/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Lawrence Dale, CEO of Realtysellers, is a Toronto lawyer who has battled the real-estate industry for the better part of a decade after his flat-fee service was shut down in 2001. His persistence is widely credited for the Competition Bureau's investigation that led to the easing of listing restrictions, and he vowed not to get back into the business until he could "offer customers a buffet of services rather than force them to eat a whole meal."

The fight for real estate commissions is about to heat up, as two of the industry's biggest agitators join forces in an attempt to steal market share from the country's 100,000 real estate agents.
Propertyguys.com Inc., a company that helps people sell their own homes, will merge with flat-fee brokerage Realtysellers Real Estate Inc. The deal that will make it easier for those who want to handle their own transactions get their properties on the popular Realtor.ca website, which provides the online listings for an estimated 90 per cent of the country's home sales.
The two companies decided to merge after the Competition Bureau and Canadian Real Estate Association changed the rules to allow flat-fee listings to appear on the Multiple Listing Service, if they are posted by a licensed brokerage. Previously, anyone who had a listing on the MLS had to employ an agent to handle every component of a transaction, whether they wanted those services or not, normally for a fee of 4 to 5 per cent of the sale price of a home. At an average price of At an average price of $376,817 that means a commission of up to $18,840.
While Propertyguys was able to establish partnerships with local brokerages to get their listings posted since the Competition Bureau settlement with CREA, they had to hand off a client if they wanted additional services that required a licensed real estate agent.
Unlike agents that charge commission for their work, Propertyguys charges an up-front fee, depending on the type of service a seller wants. They can choose to simply buy lawn signs or sign up for a larger marketing package. Now they'll also be able to buy services such as appraisals to help determine a selling price, or pay for help negotiating with potential buyers.
"This will allow us to navigate the market much more easily," said director of partnerships Walter Melanson. "As outsiders and non-registrants in the real estate industry, we needed some help from an insider who understands the regulatory frameworks and can help us do things right."
The merger will allow Propertyguys to post listings through Realtysellers, which is licensed in Ontario and expects to be licensed in other provinces soon. Propertyguys has about 7,500 for-sale-by-owner listings across the country right now.

Bold makeover proposed for Yonge-Dundas

Author: Church, Elizabeth

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/bold-makeover-proposed-yonge-dundas/docview/874567658/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "Pedestrians are literally falling off the sidewalks at busy times," said planner Ken Greenberg, co-author of the study, along with architect Marianne McKenna. More than 53,000 pedestrians use Yonge and Dundas in an eight-hour period, he said, making it the country's busiest intersection. Foot traffic already outnumbers cars by more than two to one. "We want to provide an opportunity for life to spill out on to the street," he said.

Full text: Pedestrian-friendly road and new buildings will need 'Herculean' effort, councillor admits
More room for pedestrians, fewer lanes for cars.
A new planning blueprint for revitalizing the tired retail strip on Yonge Street north of Dundas Street envisions sidewalk cafes and street vendors, mid-rise buildings and heritage storefronts and one lane less in each direction for traffic on the city's main drag.
The privately funded study will be unveiled Wednesday by local Councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam after consultations with residents and businesses. The rookie councillor, who began her career in real estate, says Yonge Street has never lived up to its full potential as a commercial corridor.
Without a plan, she argues, the main face of Toronto will continue to deteriorate or come to resemble nearby Bay Street - a corridor of tall condo towers.
"We need a strategy for all of Yonge Street and especially this troubled stretch," she said.
The new study examines the section of Yonge between Dundas and Gerrard streets, long home to head shops and strip clubs, but now poised for dramatic change. Ryerson University's new student centre is slated for the former Sam the Record Man site, and to the north a 75-storey condominium is under construction that will add more than 900 residential units to the neighbourhood.
Primaris, a major retail landlord, also has bought properties on both sides of the street, including a heritage building at Yonge and Gerrard Streets.
Taking its cue from projects such as New York City's transformation of Broadway or, closer to home, the redo of Kitchener's downtown, the plan offers a solution to pedestrian congestion and recommends more street closings for special events.
"Pedestrians are literally falling off the sidewalks at busy times," said planner Ken Greenberg, co-author of the study, along with architect Marianne McKenna. More than 53,000 pedestrians use Yonge and Dundas in an eight-hour period, he said, making it the country's busiest intersection. Foot traffic already outnumbers cars by more than two to one. "We want to provide an opportunity for life to spill out on to the street," he said.
The plan also proposes new northern entrances for the crowded Dundas subway station and setting back upper storeys of new developments to keep the current scale at street level. One large tower is anticipated on the southeast corner of Yonge and Gerrard Streets.
The proposal comes at a time when councillors are contemplating ripping out bike lanes and is sure to face headwinds at city hall. Ms. Wong-Tam says she will remind potential opponents that the plan comes with the support - and funding - of business.
Still, she expects some "Herculean lifting" will be required to move it forward.
James Robinson, executive director of the Downtown Yonge Business Improvement Area, says the new plan strikes a balance, recognizing most people come to the area on foot but also leaving the door open for development.
A pilot of the expanded pedestrian space is proposed for next spring, and Mr. Robinson said his group will work with tenants on concerns over issues such as loading zones before then.
Ms. Wong-Tam said she wants all Torontonians to wade into the debate on their main street and is looking for support from other levels of government. If the plan is successful, she would like to see it rolled out beyond the few blocks in the study and become a template for economic revitalization of main streets in other urban centres.
"We can do absolutely nothing and leave it alone, or we can try it and not be risk-averse," she said.

The Action: There were just 10 showings of this ranch-style bungalow in Sechelt, which is about two hours north of Vancouver.
What They Got: The sellers of this 1,155-square-foot house had it custom built by a local company on a corner lot they purchased for $67,000 six years ago.
* The entertaining area is fairly open concept with vaulted, skylit ceilings, a gas fireplace in the corner of the living area and sliding doors to the south-facing yard off the dining space, plus a raised breakfast bar to provide some separation from the kitchen.
* The private sleeping quarters include three bedrooms, including one with access to one of two bathrooms.
* Notable finishes and features include laminate floors, main-floor laundry facilities, a surround-sound system and smart wiring for the Internet.
* Tall trees bordering the property enhances its rural feel, but it is still within a short distance of schools, golf courses and marinas, as well as local shops and restaurants.
The Agent's Take: "The home is ... close to the downtown core of Sechelt and has been maintained in an 'as new' condition by the original owners," agent Bruce Lasuta says.

Following the warm reception to Tridel's previous luxury project near the historic Old Mill Inn and Spa, activity is heating up just as quickly at its sister tower across the street.
"We are 80-per-cent sold in phase one, and after two weekends in the marketplace with Two Old Mill, we are 50-per-cent sold," says Jim Ritchie, senior vice-president of sales and marketing.
"There is not a tremendous amount of new condominium developments in that location, so what it is, where it is - and the fact that there are not that many alternatives - really helps."
Locals in particular are drawn to the setting of this 10-storey building on Bloor Street West and Old Mill Drive, adjacent to a park and minutes to trails along the Humber River, as well as shops along the Kingsway and in Bloor West Village. "It is an urban environment backing onto all that green space, but one of the reasons we've had the success we've had ... is the fact you can - within a minute or two - walk to the subway," Mr. Ritchie says.
Buyers also appreciate that this 217-unit building - which Kirkor Architects and Planners designed two floors shorter than One Old Mill - will have a high composition of large one-bedroom suites.
"We had great success in the first phase with a larger-than-normal one-bedroom plus den," says Mr. Ritchie, who points out that conventional units are often about 650 square feet.
"We have one-bedroom and dens with two full bathrooms that are in the 780- to 800-square-foot range, so it's ideally suited to a single person that wanted a little more than what was available in a typical one-bedroom."
Furthermore, this building will have more private space outdoors, as well as scenic vistas. "We're going to have more terracing towards the park at Two Old Mill," he adds. "You can see out to the Humber River."
Should residents want to entertain larger groups outdoors, a rooftop terrace will be furnished with a fireplace, lounge chairs and dining sets with a view of the CN Tower.
Amenities indoors will include a theatre, party and dining rooms with access to a kitchen and bar, as well as a swimming pool, whirlpool, fitness and yoga rooms.
Suite finishes will include laminate floors, granite or quartz kitchen counters, and master ensuite bathrooms with shower stalls and soaker tubs.
Larger two-bedroom suites and penthouses will have upgraded engineered wood floors and Irpinia Signature kitchen cabinetry, along with breakfast areas and family rooms in some cases.
To earn certification in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), the building will have various green features, from Energy Star appliances, dual flush toilets and low-flow faucets to heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and products with low volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
One and Two Old Mill will also be the first ones with solar hot water systems. "We've done many things in terms of greening our buildings, but now we'd like to spend a little more time looking at renewable energy," Mr. Ritchie says.
With individually metered utilities, monthly fees will be only 51 cents per square foot.
Select units can purchase parking for $32,000.

The visit to Canada by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leaves local members of the Monarchist League of Canada feeling royal flushed.
The westernmost province is not on the itinerary for the summertime tour by Prince William, a minor disappointment to those who help keep the British in British Columbia.
Instead, devoted royal watchers will follow by social media the cross-country journey from the green gables of Prince Edward Island to the dusty paddocks of the Calgary Stampede.
Keith Roy, a 29-year-old Vancouver real estate agent, has downloaded a mobile app for the royal tour issued by the Canadian Heritage and Official Languages Department. It provides a schedule, photographs and even virtual postcards.
Technology has made more visible the aristocratic progeny of a millennium-old institution. As well, the tabloid embarrassments of the last decade of the previous century have been overshadowed, at least for the time being, by the fairy-tale wedding this year of William Windsor and Catherine Middleton.
"It's a great time to be a monarchist," Mr. Roy proclaimed.
He joined the Monarchist League as a student a decade ago, a fortuitous decision. His membership led to a summer internship in the Office of the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario. He accompanied James Bartleman, a member of the Chippewas of Rama First Nation, on school visits, during which the Queen's representative wore a buckskin jacket and carried a carved walking stick.
Mr. Roy remembers schoolchildren being left googly-eyed by the pomp - the viceregal salute and the fluttering lieutenant-governor's standard on the limousine.
The Monarchist League knows that some consider the monarchy an anachronism, harbour antipathy to the heir to the throne and regard the Royal Family as, in Mr. Roy's words, "just a bunch of rich, old Brits." The league challenges any hint of republicanism and loyally defends the institution and Canada as a constitutional monarchy.
The tour by the Royal Highnesses will include seven official stops in four provinces and one territory over nine days. The cost? About six cents per Canadian.
To assuage disappointment over Will and Kate's itinerary not including British Columbia, the league points out that this tour "will be but the first of many Canadian homecomings" for the couple. It seems inevitable that at some future date Victoria will play host to the great-great-great-great-grandson of the monarch after whom the capital city is named.
The first royal visit to the province occurred in 1882, when the then-governor-general, the Marquess of Lorne, was accompanied by his wife, Princess Louise, a daughter of Queen Victoria. The first by a reigning sovereign took place in 1939 when George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the province, during which the large park abutting Cambie Street in Vancouver was named in her honour. Their daughter, then a princess, now the Queen, attended a football game on the University of British Columbia campus, as well as a lacrosse match in Vancouver on her inaugural visit in 1951.
A visit to an exposition in Vancouver in 1986 by Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales, led to the memorable tabloid headline: "See Expo And Di." Elsewhere in the city, a graffito offered the unkind sentiment, "Up Chuck and Di."
The local branches of the Monarchist League have been active in recent years in ensuring the Queen's portrait not be removed from public places, most notably from BC Ferries. It was learned that her image had been removed from seven ferries during retrofitting and renovations. BC Ferries said it was no longer a Crown corporation; the Monarchist League insisted the ferry routes were part of the provincial highway system and thus owned by the Crown. The photographic portraits soon returned following a public outcry.
Mr. Roy has met and had conversations with Prince Charles, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Prince Michael of Kent. He regards himself as a seasoned veteran of royal encounters.
Still, he found himself nearly speechless when he first spotted the shimmering diamonds of the Queen's tiara while on a receiving line at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto last summer.
After an aide-de-camp read aloud his name in introduction, he bowed and lightly held the Queen's gloved hand.
"Welcome home," he said.
Will and Kate travel on British passports issued in the Queen's name. The Queen does not carry a passport. As Mr. Roy well knows, she is Queen of Canada.

Full text: A second major British law firm has dipped its toe into Canada's legal market.
The latest legal merger, which will see the large London-based global firm Clyde & Co. swallow Canadian insurance-law boutique Nicholl Paskell-Mede, took two years to get off the ground.
The deal becomes official Sept. 1 and was announced this week. But talk of the possible merger first surfaced publicly earlier this year, with word that David Angus, a Conservative senator and former partner at Stikeman Elliott LLP, had agreed to help the British firm establish a Canadian wing.
The deal will see Nicholl Paskell-Mede's 38 lawyers join Clyde's network of 700 lawyers and 24 offices around the world, something the Canadian firm says will give its clients access to a global pool of insurance-law expertise.
It took two years of courtship, after an introduction from Mr. Angus, to make the marriage happen, Nicholl Paskell-Mede partner Jo-Anne Demers said, before Clyde's partners approved the merger in a unanimous vote last week. (Her firm did the same shortly before that.)
"Our clients know us, but now we will be able to respond to all their needs if they have any needs on an international level," Ms. Demers said, adding that the Canadian firm already has an international presence, counting Lloyd's of London as one of its clients.
Nicholl Paskell-Mede was founded in 1992 in Montreal, and expanded with a Toronto office in 2005. It specializes in insurance law, including acting for the insurers of professionals, such as accountants. But it also does defence work in class-action and product-liability cases. It will now use the Clyde & Co. banner.
The merger comes a month after Montreal-based national firm Ogilvy Renault LLP officially retired its name and joined with London-based legal giant Norton Rose, and amid speculation about other similar moves.
Clyde is not considered one of London's so-called Magic Circle leading firms, but ranks within the country's top 20. Like rival Norton Rose, it has been on an international-expansion spree lately, opening a new office in New Jersey last year. It also has U.S. offices in New York and San Francisco.
On the move
Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP has been on a hiring binge. In its London office, Jonathan Martin , an oil-and-gas merger specialist from British firm King & Spalding, joins as a partner. Andrew Thomas , a former partner at Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP, joins as a partner, and will head Fasken's London-based banking practice.
Closer to home, Fasken has picked up two much-talked-about lawyers.
In Ottawa, Fasken has added Peter Mantas , a veteran of complex litigation and class-action cases and shareholder fights, who will lead Fasken's emerging litigation practice after leaving Heenan Blaikie LLP. It's the latest expansionary move for Fasken in Ottawa, where it took over local firm Johnston & Buchan LLP in 2007, and then grabbed some of McCarthy Tetrault LLP's Ottawa team back in 2009.
Fasken has also announced that Karen Zimmer , whose client list is heavy with financial institutions, has left McCarthy Tetrault LLP to join Fasken's securities and mergers and acquisitions group in Vancouver as a partner.
Meanwhile, Steven Phipps - formerly an in-house lawyer for the City of Edmonton - has joined Fraser Milner Casgrain LLP as a partner in its Edmonton office's municipal and real estate law group.

Size

Price
$287,000 to $520,000
Sales centre
4679 Yonge St., south of Sheppard Avenue. Open Monday to Thursday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.; weekends and holidays from noon to 6 p.m.

Tridel recorded strong sales numbers for townhouses and high-rise suites at its Avonshire development uptown, but its newest addition is already selling much faster than previous phases.
In just over three months, Tridel sold more than 70 per cent of the 476 units slated for two modern, black and white accented glass towers called Aristo.
"We've positioned this community a little differently from the Avonshire building ... [where] the homes were larger and more traditional in terms of architecture and interior design," says Jim Ritchie, senior vice-president of sales and marketing.
"We really changed the look and finishes in the suite that were more reflective of a downtown condo, so we've presented everything you might want in a downtown condo, but we brought it to North York."
Contemporary one-bedroom-plus-den and two-bedroom models will fill out the majority of the 21 and 16-storeys towers, which Kirkor Architects designed next to a large park and playground at the centre of the project near Yonge Street and Highway 401.
Many buyers are local residents keen on staying close to the subway, shops and businesses on Yonge Street, as well as restaurants, cinemas and arts centre.
"That submarket in North York - in particular that runs along Yonge Street between Finch and the 401 - has always been an in-demand location from a condominium perspective," Mr. Ritchie says.
"And there's quite a difference in price in a single-family home or even a townhouses ... in that submarket compared to condos, so condos represent affordability."
Once Aristo is completed in 2014, residents will have access to even more attractions.
The fitness centre will have cardio equipment, a yoga/spinning studio, hot and cold plunge pools, while the entertainment compound will feature billiards and dining rooms and two party spaces that open to a rooftop terrace with barbecues and a fireside lounge area.
"We always make sure we have amenity space that can deal with cardio and strength training," says Mr. Ritchie "And because the suites are getting smaller, we use the other parts of the amenities as an extension of the home."
Like the common areas, suites will have a modern, European feel - courtesy of Munge Leung Design Associates - complete with nine-foot ceilings, plank laminate and porcelain tile floors, and quartz or granite kitchen counters and backsplashes.

Summer in a top 2011 destination: 'the other Georgia'

Author: Kirkby, Bruce

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/summer-top-2011-destination-other-georgia/docview/872325338/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: John Steinbeck, who travelled through Russia in 1947, hinted at the treasures waiting in this southern republic: "Wherever we have been, the magical name of Georgia came up constantly. People who had never been there, and who possibly would never go there spoke of Georgia with a kind of longing and great admiration. They spoke of Georgians as supermen, as great drinkers, great dancers, great musicians, great workers and lovers. They spoke of the country in the Caucasus as a kind of second heaven.

Full text:   This summer, the best-selling adventure travel author is heading deep into the Georgia Caucasus, with family in tow. Week one of a series:
Tell someone you're spending the summer in Georgia, and their eyes invariably light up.
Visions arise of the fabled subtropical American state, setting for Gone With the Wind , land of palmettos and tobacco estates, former home of the Atlanta Thrashers.
Of course, there is another Georgia, but come on, who goes there? So common is the misunderstanding that our four-year-old son, Bodi, now routinely describes our upcoming destination as "the other Georgia. You know... the Republic of!"
Earlier this week, my wife and I packed up our two young sons and flew to Tbilisi. Our plan is to soak in the famous hot springs (where Alexander Pushkin claimed to have the best bath of his entire life), to buy a packhorse and wander for the next 2½ months through the remote pastoral valleys of the High Caucasus. The reports we send back to Globe Travel each week will be our only contact with home.
Some, upon learning of our plan, seem genuinely excited. A few toss out Georgian tidbits: birthplace of Stalin, among the world's fastest-growing economies, unrivalled drinkers. Many grimace, their unspoken question clear to see: Why, on God's good earth, that Georgia? Are you nuts?
Such trepidation is understandable, for this tiny nation is as maligned as it is mysterious. Tucked between the Black and Caspian seas, with Russia to the north and Turkey to the south, Georgia and the neighbouring Transcaucasian states of Armenia and Azerbaijan have been overlooked by the modern world. These are the lands in between, delineating a hazy border between Europe and Asia, between Christian and Muslim, between ancient and modern, between democracy and dictatorships.
Recently, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia plunged into poverty. What was once the USSR's richest republic, famous for feting visitors to their Black Sea resorts with caviar and champagne, suddenly found itself among the most impoverished nations, unable to supply even the basic essentials of heat and electricity to residents. Independence also brought the horrors of civil war and mass migrations, as South Ossetia and Abkhazia struggled to break away.
In the years since, with the eyes of the world focused elsewhere, the country has gradually risen from the ashes. After the so-called Rose Revolution of 2003 - named for the flowers carried by the peaceful demonstrators - U.S.-educated lawyer Mikheil Saakashvili has steadily steered the country toward security and prosperity. While tourism remains in its infancy, things are changing fast. In January, The New York Times ranked Georgia a top 2011 destination, ahead of Oahu, Australia, Singapore and, yes, even Whistler.
With a varied geography (from a prolific, yet little-known, wine district to glaciated peaks higher than anything in the Alps) and complex ethnicity (more languages exist in the Caucasus than the European Union), the one thing every visitor seems to agree on is this: Georgians may be the most welcoming people in the world.
So legendary is their hospitality - and affinity for spontaneous day-long toasting sessions - that my biggest concern is not the bears, brigands or high mountain passes, but remaining sober enough to set up our tent each night. With Christine nursing our infant son, I alone must face the bottle-toting farmers and villagers mano a mano.
But this doesn't completely answer the question: Why Georgia? For that, I need to introduce my children.
When Bodi (now 4) and Taj (just 10 months) arrived, Christine and I - like every other parent in the world - had no real idea what the future held. Rather bull-headedly, I declared kids were not going to slow us down. So off we set, with them in backpack and canoe, to the heights of the Bugaboos and the coasts of Chile and Vancouver Island. By the time Bodi was 16 months, he had spent a quarter of his life in a tent.
While my motivations were terribly self-interested, one fundamental truth quickly emerged: Kids arrive in our wired-wimpy-latte-sipping world as natural and very able little outdoors people. Both our boys spring to life in fresh air - eating well, sleeping better, whining less and imagining more.
Just as marked are the benefits to our family. Gone are the distractions of the modern world; e-mails, tweets, televisions. Together day and night, we are a small team navigating a strange world, and the sense of camaraderie and intimacy that arise are profound. I unreservedly believe we are all - as individuals and a family - better for our sojourns together.
After a friend suggested Georgia for our next adventure, I hauled out the atlas and was soon ordering crates of antiquarian books online, and drowning our local librarian with inter-branch loan requests, as I read everything possible on the Caucasus.
The landscape appears staggeringly beautiful and untrammelled. Dotting the countryside are castles, churches, mosques and palaces. The leafy, balconied cities - most thousands of years old - now boast thumping nightclubs and modern architecture. Best of all are the reports that Georgians simply love children.
John Steinbeck, who travelled through Russia in 1947, hinted at the treasures waiting in this southern republic: "Wherever we have been, the magical name of Georgia came up constantly. People who had never been there, and who possibly would never go there spoke of Georgia with a kind of longing and great admiration. They spoke of Georgians as supermen, as great drinkers, great dancers, great musicians, great workers and lovers. They spoke of the country in the Caucasus as a kind of second heaven. Indeed we began to believe that most Russians hope, if they live very good and virtuous lives, the will go not to heaven, but to Georgia, when they die."
Our plan for the summer is purposefully vague. We'll start in the western mountains, and wander east, following our nose. If something doesn't feel right, we'll turn around. We'll trust our instincts.
So we start in the Caucasus as we have on every other journey in our lives: heads brimming with visions that almost certainly will bear little resemblance to reality. It is the discovery of what is, rather that what is imagined, which remains the essential gift of travel, and its greatest joy.

Five reasons to avoid China's unravelling economy

Author: Mandelman, Avner

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/five-reasons-avoid-chinas-unravelling-economy/docview/872118996/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: As with Japan, loans that will never be repaid are now piling up in the banking system. This is by no means a new problem. McKinsey & Co., the consulting firm, warned back in 2005 of "the enormous stock of bad loans" in China's banking sector. This past year, the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the country's financial-system regulator, said the bad loans pose a "substantial" risk. The danger has only grown since then.

Investors are fleeing from Sino-Forest and other companies with operations in China. Some people see this as a buying opportunity; I disagree.
In my opinion, China is slowly unravelling, and the imploding share prices of many Chinese companies are a symptom of deeper problems. This is a view I've held for some time and I believe the evidence is mounting that China's economy is on the verge of a slowdown. Let me list some reasons:
Banking problems:
As I've noted before in this space, China has been selling products at artificially low prices to keep its population employed and prevent social disorder.
Like Japan in the 1990s, China has kept its cost of capital depressed to help exporters generate jobs. That has fuelled a wave of indiscriminate lending, notably to local governments and the real estate sector.
As with Japan, loans that will never be repaid are now piling up in the banking system. This is by no means a new problem. McKinsey & Co., the consulting firm, warned back in 2005 of "the enormous stock of bad loans" in China's banking sector. This past year, the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the country's financial-system regulator, said the bad loans pose a "substantial" risk. The danger has only grown since then. Japan paid for its bad-loan sins with a decade of stagnation. China's stagnation is coming, too.
Currency pressure:
Following the G20 meeting in Toronto last year, China reluctantly let the yuan rise. This made Chinese goods less competitive, reduced employment, and caused social disorder.
Meanwhile, inflation is on the rise, particularly in food prices. To fight it, China is squeezing the money supply, raising margin requirements, and tightening up lending.
As a result, China's real estate bubble is starting to deflate and many residences stand vacant. Bloomberg News recently reported on the construction boom in Kangbashi, a city in China's Inner Mongolia that was originally designed to accommodate around one million people. It currently has about 30,000 residents.
Legal vacuum:
There's no property without property rights. My rule is never to invest in a country where there's no independent judiciary. Some of the latest riots in China erupted because bureaucrats have been confiscating land for projects in which they have a personal stake. Land owners have no recourse except violence.
Hard-line leaders:
China's leadership is implicitly admitting things will get tougher. The country's current leader, President Hu Jintao, could afford some openness, but the new leader who is scheduled to take power next year will probably have to clamp down harshly. Xi Jinping, the likely new leader, has a reputation as a hard liner. For me, his continued rise in the political hierarchy is a clear sign that China realizes the future will be grim.
Lack of transparency:
China is a dictatorship where analysts find it difficult to perform due diligence on prospective investments - just ask any analyst who has tried to research a Chinese company. What's more, official Chinese statistics are notoriously unreliable, leading some observers, such as Stratfor, a private intelligence consultant, to label the country's economy an unsustainable Ponzi scheme.
Even if China's economic miracle only proves to be overstated, the effects will be wide ranging. Much of the recent rise in commodity prices was the result of Chinese demand. If it tapers off, so will commodity prices. The good news? That will lower costs and liberate cash to eventually start a new bull market.
To my mind, the only question is when the Chinese economy will start to decisively slow down. Brockhouse Cooper, the Montreal investing firm, noted in a recent report that high electricity demand in China indicates the country's economy is still red hot.
The Brockhouse analysts, however, warned that Chinese authorities appear to be losing control over financial stability, with rates climbing in the "repo" market for short-term funds and banks growing increasingly cautious about lending to each other.
Those are telling signs of the growing tension in the Chinese economy. All the more reason for investors to keep away from the country's stock market.

Full text:   Mayor Rob Ford thinks the City needs to sell Casa Loma - here's what it has to offer potential buyers
Toronto Mayor Rob Ford wants to put Casa Loma, the city-owned mansion, on the block. "Casa Loma is something that I think eventually we have to sell. That's the bottom line," he said Tuesday.
It is difficult to put a price on this historical fixer upper, but could the city find a willing buyer for the prestige property? Here's a look at what perspective buyers would get.
The back story
It's been a century since local tycoon Sir Henry Pellatt broke ground on this sprawling five-acre estate. Designed by E.J. Lennox - the architect of Old City Hall - the 170,000-square-foot gothic revival mansion took 300 men, three years and $3.5-million to complete. That's roughly $90-million in today's dollars. It had 98 rooms when completed and was the largest private home in Canada. Sir Henry's grand ambitions soon fell on hard times and the city seized the castle for unpaid taxes. An attempt was made to operate it as an apartment hotel, but after sitting vacant for a dozen years, the Kiwanis Club offered to run it as a charitable venture. On Tuesday, city council voted to take back management of the property, instructing staff to craft a new long-term strategy.
The house today
The city has nearly finished a $33-million restoration of the exterior of the castle and its stables. But on the inside, this house on the hill would require a major redo, says agent Janet Lindsay, who specializes in luxury homes at Chestnut Park Real Estate. Ms. Lindsay doubts the castle would sell as a single-family home, but says it could fetch top dollar divided into condominium suites. "There is a lot of great wealth in Toronto and for one-of-a-kind properties people will pay for it, whether they are local or international," she said. "It would be splendid for multifamily units."
A penthouse at the new Four Seasons building recently sold for $28-million for 9,000 square feet, she says, an indication of the demand at the top end of the market.
The best features
This landmark property has soaring ceilings and plenty of character. Casa Loma features fountains, terraces and balconies, a secret tunnel and two hidden passageways. The main floor includes a conservatory, billiards room, great hall and library. But it's the location, at the top of the escarpment with the Toronto skyline as a constant backdrop, that really gives it the "wow" factor, Ms. Lindsay says. "It has a whole view of the city."

There's no free-lunch investment seminar

Author: Banerjee, Preet

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/theres-no-free-lunch-investment-seminar/docview/871538822/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: There are two types of seminars that are a bit more palatable to the masses. The first are the ones that focus more on education and information, without trying to sell you anything. These cater to people who want to become DIY investors but don't know where to start. Multiday events like this usually come into town once or twice a year and cover anything from real estate to stock market option trading. You'll generally see speakers from the big banks and national newspapers.

Have you ever opened your mail and plucked out a thick, glossy envelope that appears to be a wedding invite but is in fact an invitation to an investment seminar? If so, you are not alone. Investment seminars on a range of financial topics are popping up all over the country. There are many worth attending, but there are lots you should avoid. The problem is figuring out which is which.
Sometimes you'll see a celebrity pitching a workshop. Two that have made the rounds over the past few years have been the Donald Trump Institute and the Rich Dad, Poor Dad seminars. Both of these have had polarizing effects on attendees. Some love them while others are skeptical.
There are two types of seminars that are a bit more palatable to the masses. The first are the ones that focus more on education and information, without trying to sell you anything. These cater to people who want to become DIY investors but don't know where to start. Multiday events like this usually come into town once or twice a year and cover anything from real estate to stock market option trading. You'll generally see speakers from the big banks and national newspapers. Not every session will be a home run, but you should walk away knowing more about the topics you'll want to follow up later on your own.
The second type of seminars that are potentially worthwhile are the ones run by local financial advisers. Many advisers regularly hold seminars in their communities to talk about investments, estate planning, education funding and more. Let's be clear here: They want your business and are trying to demonstrate some value. If you are looking for an adviser, it can be a great way to feel one out and while you should expect that they'll want your contact information to try and book a one-on-one meeting at a later date, there is generally no obligation to become a client for attending the seminar.
But please note: There are absolutely no risk-free, "get rich quick" schemes. Higher potential returns always equate to higher risk, over time.
If someone had a secret to making money with little risk, why would they sell that secret to you for a few bucks, when they could just apply the principles themselves and make a lot of bucks? If they know how to beat the market, then they know how to take out an investment loan.
So the next time an invitation to an investment seminar lands in your mailbox, make sure to do a bit of digging ahead of time. Focus on the educational expos or local adviser seminars, at least until you learn how to differentiate the niche workshops on your own. The last thing you want is to find out that you've been wedded to a bad strategy you can't divorce.

HOW TO CHECK OUT AN ADVISER BEFORE A SEMINAR
1. Check to see if they are registered as a financial adviser.
This is actually not as easy as it sounds, because the records are kept in various places.
If you are in Ontario, the Ontario Securities Commission has a search tool: osc.gov.on.ca/en/Investors_check-registration_index.htm
If you are not in Ontario, you can start by checking the National Registration Search: www.securities-administrators.ca/nrs/nrsearch.aspx?-id=850
2 . Not all advisers are listed in the above databases.
The next step (if you haven't found registration information) is to check with your provincial securities commission.
3 . Still haven't found the adviser? Perhaps they are registered as insurance agents (and can sell certain insurance-based investments). Now you'll have to check with the provincial insurance council offices for registration information.
Newly developed by the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada is the Know Your Advisor tool: iiroc.ca/English/Investors/KnowYourAdvisor/Pages/default.aspx
IIROC advisers represent only a fraction of all the types of financial advisers out there, but they include a resource to help you search outside their jurisdiction: iiroc.ca/English/Investors/KnowYourAdvisor/SearchOutside/Pages/default.aspx
They also provide great tips on how to check for disciplinary actions against advisers, as well as any ongoing cases.
4 . Are they as qualified as they claim?
For example, for someone to use the CFP designation, they need to be registered as a Certified Financial Planner to do so. You can check that out at: fpsc.ca/directory-cfp-professionals-good-standing

Abstract: "The downtown has been steadily improving over the last few years," said Wes Schollenberg, managing director of Avison Young's Winnipeg operations. "But there has been an uptick in interest in everything from national bar franchises to local entrepreneurs thinking of opening something. The NHL has put the downtown over the top."

Full text: NHL announcement stirs a flurry of interest, with restaurants and retail chains scouting for space in the city's already thriving core
The Winnipeg Jets will bring a lot more than NHL hockey to the city's downtown when they start playing this fall - they carry the promise of a development boom to complement what is already a revitalization success story.
The Jets - or whatever they end up being called - have landlords and brokers alike salivating at the prospect of a retail and hospitality boom in a city that has already drastically improved its downtown over the past decade through a concerted effort to build condos and rental housing.
On a warm day, the downtown bustles with thousands of workers - recently relocated from the suburbs by Manitoba Hydro - buying hot dogs and French fries from stands. The University of Manitoba and the University of Winnipeg have both expanded their downtown campuses, and the government is slowly relocating its offices to more central locations.
And that's to say nothing of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, which is expected to draw 250,000 visitors annually when it opens next year.
"In the days following the NHL announcement, the interest in downtown has really accelerated," said Wayne Pratt, a Winnipeg-based managing director at Colliers International. "We think the real winners from this will be the parking lot operators and property owners who are sitting on land that developers will want to get their hands on."
While the American Hockey League's Manitoba Moose have been playing at the MTS Centre since it opened in 2004, retailers and restaurateurs didn't feel the need to overhaul their offerings for the team's 8,000 spectators per game.
There was also little need for additional hotel space - something that will change the minute the NHL team and its 15,000 fans descend on the city.
It's not the first time the MTS Centre has come to the rescue of downtown Winnipeg. The seven-year-old arena sits atop what was once the most coveted retail real estate in this city - the Eaton's store.
The decision to place the arena on such hallowed retail ground was hugely controversial. But since then, it has been credited for driving interest in downtown living by injecting vibrancy into the city's nightlife.
"The community was opposed to tearing down a building that once meant so much," said Mr. Pratt. "But it was the right thing to do, and all of this is just further proof. Everyone downtown will be able to walk to an NHL game in five minutes, and stop at bars and restaurants like in any other big league city."
Wayne Chernecki, president of Redcliff Realty Management, is responsible for the downtown City Place shopping centre. He said foot traffic has increased exponentially since the arena was built, and retailers are anxious to stay open later to take advantage of the crowds associated with the NHL.
"The MTS Centre has already been a runaway hit when it comes to bringing people downtown for concerts," he said. "That will only get better with the NHL, and that has to be good for retailers."
The NHL team's ownership group is working to secure land next to the arena for a high-end hotel and office complex to capitalize on the increased foot traffic, and national restaurant chains are scouting the area for space.
"It's a nice block of land, and though there are a few small pieces missing and they are hesitant to talk about it, they do have a good vision in place," said Mr. Pratt. "We know they have a good lead tenant for the office space, and a high-end chain is definitely interested in a deal that would put them right across the street."
While the NHL may be forcing retailers to accelerate their search for space, the city has been the focus of their attention for several years now, as its growth has outpaced that of other Canadian centres.
Retail sales are up 9.2 per cent through the first part of the year, according to a report by Avison Young. Vacancy rates in the city's strip malls and power centres fell to 1.9 per cent from 3.3 per cent in 2010.
"Winnipeg's hungry consumers will no doubt welcome increased competition," Avison Young stated in its 2011 outlook for the city. "Despite some competition from the online shopping community, we anticipate new developments and new restaurants will come on stream to satisfy consumer demand."
Meanwhile, more than 50,000 immigrants have relocated to Winnipeg in the past five years. The city's economy is expected to expand by 3.5 per cent this year.
"The downtown has been steadily improving over the last few years," said Wes Schollenberg, managing director of Avison Young's Winnipeg operations. "But there has been an uptick in interest in everything from national bar franchises to local entrepreneurs thinking of opening something. The NHL has put the downtown over the top."
The retail market has been tight because landlords are hesitant to build. Construction costs are high in the prairie city, keeping inventory steady at around 18.6 million square feet. Rents have held steady over the last several years.
Office space is also in demand. Winnipeg's vacancy rate is the second-lowest in the country, after Regina, at 4.8 per cent. There is little difference in price or vacancy between suburban and downtown space, because there is so little space available.

BUILDING BOOM
Notable projects in Winnipeg:
* The Canadian Museum for Human Rights is one of the first national museums outside Ottawa. It is expected to draw 250,000 visitors annually when it opens.
* A $42-million structure at the University of Manitoba will house 360 students. The university has also committed to spending $33-million toward its Art and Research Technology Laboratory.
* Union Bank Tower is undergoing a $27-million overhaul. It will have three restaurants at ground level.
* A new $30-million hotel is being built on the grounds of the Health Sciences Centre. It will house the family and friends of hospitalized patients.
* Bristol Aerospace has started building a $120-million research facility at its Winnipeg plant as part of its commitment to building F-35 fighter jets.

The no-hassle way to become a landlord

Author: Berman, David

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/no-hassle-way-become-landlord/docview/871538472/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "When you invest in a REIT, a lot of its business is specific to its location," BMO's Mr. [Alfred Lee] said. "For a company that has most of its business on the West Coast, the economics of the business are different from a REIT that operates mostly in Ontario. ETFs are a good way to get broad exposure - especially for those investors who are bullish on real estate but don't have the time to research individual companies."

Full text: In an era of low interest rates, REIT ETFs offer investors yield and diversification - without the headaches associated with tenants
A lot of things come to mind when you mention real estate investment trusts: shopping malls, apartment buildings, office towers, even nursing homes and hospitals.
They all have one thing in common, though. They let small investors become landlords without the headaches associated with things like late rent cheques and broken laundry machines.
REITs have become especially popular among investors looking for income when the interest paid on bonds and money market funds is so low.
"We're in a low-interest rate environment right now," said Alfred Lee, investment strategist at BMO Asset Management. "So a lot of people are looking for yield, and REITs are one of the few investments that offer yield but you don't have to take on that much risk."
Of course, REITs suffered along with everything else in the devastating stock market downturn in 2008 and 2009. Since then, with the economic recovery, many have surged by double-digits over the past year alone, after factoring in their generous dividends.
"We're seeing increasing occupancies and rising rents, which will lead to higher net operating income," said Craig Leupold, president of Greet Street Advisors, a U.S.-based firm that provides research on REITs.
While the big gains have probably been made already with REITs, he estimates that 2011 through 2016 will see modestly improving fundamentals for the industry, driven by an improvement in the overall economy.
Apartment REITs in particular should do well with improvements in employment, especially for younger workers who aren't ready to buy a home.
For many investors, exchange-traded funds are the best way to gain exposure to the sector. ETFs look like mutual funds in that they hold a basket of stocks, yet they trade on stock exchanges throughout the day and their fees tend to be exceptionally low.
The big benefit of ETFs over individual holdings is that they provide diversification, which helps to limit the downside risk.
But REIT ETFs in particular are attractive for a number of other reasons. They provide exposure to an assortment of businesses, reducing the downside risk if a couple of them run into trouble - a big plus when you consider that many REITs tend to be relatively small.
They can also provide diversification across different geographies, which is key when you're investing in REITs because real estate lives and dies by local conditions. And finally, the low fees associated with ETFs (generally under 0.5 per cent) won't eat into one of the most attractive features of REITs: their distributable income.
There are a large number of ETFs to choose from, trading in the United States and Canada, with many of the most popular ones specializing in particular regions, rather than types of REITs.
State Street Global Advisors offers three funds. The SPDR Dow Jones International Real Estate ETF gives exposure to real estate-oriented companies outside the United States, and includes Canada's Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and Japan's Mitsui Fudosan Co. among its top holdings. It has a yield of 8.4 per cent and has returned 29.9 per cent over the past 12 months, to the end of May, according to fund rating company Lipper.
The SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF consists of U.S. real estate investment trusts and includes mall-owner Simon Property Group Inc., Equity Residential and Vornado Realty Trust. It has a yield of 2.7 per cent and has returned 21.8 per cent over the past 12 months.
And if you want international and U.S. exposure, there is the SPDR Dow Jones Global Real Estate ETF. It has a yield of 6.5 per cent and has returned 25.6 per cent over the past 12 months.
"There is a big emphasis on global real estate," said Jeff Tjornehoj, head of Lipper Americas Research. "This is a good development, in my view, as investors without a good view on regional real estate values don't have to decide North America or Asia or Europe - they can have them all."
There are Canadian-specific offerings as well. Bank of Montreal recently launched the BMO Equal Weight REITs Index ETF, which began trading about a year ago. It has 18 holdings, including mall owner RioCan REIT, nursing home operator Extendicare REIT and residential owner Boardwalk REIT. It has a yield of 5.9 per cent, and has returned 32.5 per cent over the past year.
"When you invest in a REIT, a lot of its business is specific to its location," BMO's Mr. Lee said. "For a company that has most of its business on the West Coast, the economics of the business are different from a REIT that operates mostly in Ontario. ETFs are a good way to get broad exposure - especially for those investors who are bullish on real estate but don't have the time to research individual companies."

Full text: Vision Vancouver raises opponents' hackles with plans to accept money from foreign donors
Vancouver is heading into what will likely be another contentious fundraising season, with questions coming from several quarters over donations and spending in campaigns for this fall's civic election.
Vision Vancouver lobbied the province last year for limits on election-campaign fundraising and bans on foreign donations.
But Victoria rejected those ideas, and Vancouver's governing party has told The Globe and Mail that it will follow the current rules, making it the only civic party prepared to accept U.S. donations.
"We're going to follow the existing legislation," Vision's executive director, Ian Baillie, said recently. "But we don't get a lot of American donations, we're not going after them, so it's not a big issue."
However, political-campaign watchers and Vision opponents have underscored the fact that Mayor Gregor Robertson, whose stepfather is American, got a healthy chunk of campaign money from U.S. donors when he ran for the Vision mayoral nomination in 2008.
They've also publicized the fact that three Americans donated directly to the $2-million Vision campaign for the 2008 election - a total of $9,000, according to disclosure statements - and that some donations come from local people whose non-profit groups or businesses receive funds from U.S. charities and environmental groups.
Both COPE, to the left, and the Non-Partisan Association, to the right, say they won't accept any out-of-country money in what is expected to be a tough season for fundraising after a year of elections and leadership campaigns at other levels of government.
"We don't have any intention of asking for or accepting any American money," said Norman Stowe, the chair of the NPA campaign. COPE director Alvin Singh said that question has never been raised for his party, but he's certain it would be rejected.
All of the parties agreed on a common response last year to a provincial task force on local-election spending, asking for limits on spending and a ban on corporate, union and foreign donations.
That came after several civic elections in which campaign spending skyrocketed. In 2008, the three main Vancouver parties spent $3.2-million. Surrey Mayor Dianne Watts's party raised $672,000.
However, in spite of agreeing that changes are needed, none of the parties were prepared to put them in place unless the others do after the province declined to introduce spending or contribution caps.
Although COPE won't accept foreign donations and has a ban on accepting donations from real-estate developers, it has no cap on union donations, which have been its largest single source of money for decades.
Although the NPA also won't accept foreign donations, party officials say a limit on corporate donations has not been discussed. In the past, NPA fundraisers sometimes put a cap of $10,000 on what any one company was allowed to give.
Out-of-control campaign fundraising may be held in check, however, by something besides provincial or party rules.
People from all parties say donations are going to be hard to come by.
"I think fundraising is going to be more challenging than it was," Mr. Baillie said.
"And I think you'll see less spending."
Mr. Stowe said his party is aiming to raise as much as it did in the last election (more than $1-million), but he admitted it would take more effort, with donors tapped out after two provincial leadership races, a federal election, a by-election in Point Grey and a possible provincial election in the fall.

Riding shotgun in the Fordmobile

Abstract: That leaves Doug in more of a COO role to [Rob]'s CEO. He's the hands-on one who's swinging side deals and keeping the mayor's agenda in the minds of other councillors. "I think Doug makes Rob a better mayor," said Councillor Adam Vaughan, a vocal critic of the mayor. "I disagree with him a lot, but it's collegial disagreement. He's open to talking. I have two or three conversations a week with Doug.

Full text: He's a rookie councillor with bold ideas and bolder sound bites, but his brother the Mayor is still a hero to him. Doug Ford dishes to The Globe and Mail
At the beginning of the scrum, there's no hint of front-page news. It's a feel-good affair, the launch of the 100th Grey Cup festival, and it's going off without a hitch: theatre full of suits, pounding dance music, speech from the Mayor, free popcorn for all.
It's a story, but not a big one - at least until Doug Ford Jr. starts talking.
Before the rookie councillor can glad-hand, he agrees to answer a few reporters' questions. It's a request he's come to expect over the whirlwind year during which he's evolved from a successful but anonymous executive in a 200-employee family printing firm to one of the city's - and, for that matter, the country's - major political power brokers.
The initial question revolves around future subway financing. No news there.
Next comes a question about possible road tolls. Ho hum.
Finally he's asked about luring an NFL team to Toronto. His answer?
"Before our administration's four-year term is up, hopefully we'll have an NFL team."
In the middle of a CFL party? Now we're cooking.
Front Page Ford strikes again.
The next day's Toronto Sun labels him a "PARTY POOPER" on its front page, accusing him of crashing a CFL celebration by speaking on ambitions to land an American team that could kill the Canadian game in Toronto. It's typical Doug Ford: too blunt, too off-the-cuff, the kind of spontaneous quote to try a press secretary's soul. In an interview with The Globe and Mail that morning, he promises to speak about anything - his brother's intellect, the curious business philosophy he's bringing to city hall, his potential provincial candidacy, but "I'm not saying another word about football until we get a team. That's it. Not another word."
At city hall, he is rumoured to be the mouthpiece, muscle, brain and conscience of his brother the Mayor. But despite being a human news-generator, a new politician with so much sway after just six months in office that a conservative establishment that shunned him twice now openly courts him - little is known of what the rookie actually does.
"Technically, he's just another councillor," said Councillor Josh Colle, a fellow newbie councillor. "I'm not totally clear what his role is beyond what I see in the council chambers."
Others are more certain.
"He's the de facto mayor," said Councillor Joe Mihevc, who sits behind Mr. Ford in council. "He calls the shots."
Bringing Six Sigma to City Hall
Doug Ford is a 46-year-old father of four daughters. He is five-foot-ten and weighs in at 260 pounds. He does not eat red meat. He used to work out three times a day and bench-press 350 pounds, "but then everything went to hell," he says, grabbing his belly. "I'd like to get back into the 225-pound range, back to being dancing dynamite." He worries the non-stop life of a councillor will kill him.
He drives a black Lincoln Navigator SUV and can leap atop the hood in a single bound. Like many aspects of its driver's personality, the Lincoln is too big for City Hall. On Mr. Ford's first day of work at the clamshell, he scratched his roof navigating the underground parking lot.
The Lincoln has been relegated to an outdoor gravel lot ever since.
Several years ago, his life and business changed when he discovered Lean Six Sigma, a kind of contemporary Taylorism where every aspect of a business is analyzed, charted and stripped of parts that don't create value.
During an interview in his sparsely decorated office, Mr. Ford demonstrates one aspect of Six Sigma he employed while chief executive officer at Deco Labels and Tags, the family printing firm founded in 1962 by his father, Doug Sr., who died in 2006. "We'd do a spaghetti chart," he said, drawing out random scribbles. "You follow a person around. Everywhere he'd go, you follow him and follow him, by the end of it you'd have something like that, a plate of spaghetti." He holds up a tangle of squiggles, meant to map a press operator's movements for an entire shift.
When Six Sigma experts, who rank themselves according to coloured belts much like martial artists (Mr. Ford is an orange belt, third from the bottom), videotaped the press operator, they realized vast portions of his shift were spent searching for lost tools. Deco bought new tools and then traced their shapes on walls and drawers, so it was obvious when something was missing.
"It was just like shop class, we'd come by with a supervisor to check for missing tools," he said. "By end of ... it went like this, bing-bang-boom, no more spaghetti." He holds up a series of straight, symmetrical lines. "It's all about limiting movement."
He sees obvious applications at city hall and has encouraged the head of every department to hire two black belts. "It's the best investment any company could ever do."
Spontaneity, ambition and the bottom line
Doug Ford often refers to the city in company terms. He's had bottom lines on the brain since he was seven years old. Back then he was calculating income from his Globe and Mail paper route. "Those Saturday papers, I tell you, those were killers."
Later he would work at an ice rink, credit-card manufacturer and, for four years, Canada Packers, slinging beef (hence his aversion to red meat) on St. Clair Avenue for $12.49 an hour, a handsome sum for a young man at the time.
In 1984, his business attention turned to Deco. A strike at Humber College, where he was studying "business, football and females, like any college guy" prompted him to put on a suit and head to his father's office. "What are you doing?" he remembers his dad asking him when he strolled in.
"I'm not going to sit at home, I'm going to start selling," the younger Mr. Ford said. That was the only job interview he ever needed. Acting on impulse would become his corporate and political trademark.
He dabbled in politics throughout the nineties, helping with Doug Holyday's 1994 election as mayor of Etobicoke, his father's 1995 election as an MPP and then his dad's re-election campaign in 1999, in which the Progressive Conservative establishment under Mike Harris turned on the family, backing Chris Stockwell in a bitter nomination battle for Etobicoke Centre. "There was definitely a split in the conservative family there," said Mr. Holyday, now Toronto's deputy mayor.
As early as 2008 and 2009, when he and his brothers would sit in a Deco office talking about Rob's chances in a mayoral race, they saw the same pattern repeating. Not a single prominent conservative, save Jim Flaherty, was lining up to support Rob. They were shunning the family again. Doug would "personally leave millions on the table" to drop his role at Deco and enter politics. It didn't seem worth it.
Rob knew better. "He's like a walking pollster," says Doug of his younger brother. "Just imagine calling 80 to 100 people from all across Toronto hearing what they have to say. He gets this city. It really bothers me when people say this or that about him....That guy is brilliant in his own way. Is he a brilliant speaker? Not all the time. Is he eloquent? Not all the time. But man, Rob's my hero. Rob's a political genius."
The grease in the mayor's wheel
Nowadays, Doug Ford may be down millions of dollars personally, but he's up some influential friends politically. He turns down phone calls from Mr. Harris and has rebuffed requests to run provincially from the same conservative establishment that once snubbed the family.
"He's not going anywhere, he loves his brother more than anything else," said Nick Kouvalis, who helped run Rob's campaign with Doug and acted as chief of staff for a spell. "You don't want to get between Doug and his brother. I've been there a couple times. It's hairy."
That's not to say Doug's running Rob's show. The rookie councillor is still green, and it shows in his frequent headline-making outbursts. "He's a very enthusiastic guy who has to learn to how to control how he acts and what he says a little bit," said Mr. Holyday, who has taken Doug aside on several occasions to offer advice on political comportment. "I offer him my thoughts here and there. Whether he heeds the advice, I don't know."
"The mayor's the boss, that's clear," said Mr. Kouvalis. "He approves everything. And the main brains belong to the chief of staff Amir [Remtulla] and Mark [Towhey, director of strategic planning]. Mark is the smartest guy in the office. I'd hire him in a heartbeat."
That leaves Doug in more of a COO role to Rob's CEO. He's the hands-on one who's swinging side deals and keeping the mayor's agenda in the minds of other councillors. "I think Doug makes Rob a better mayor," said Councillor Adam Vaughan, a vocal critic of the mayor. "I disagree with him a lot, but it's collegial disagreement. He's open to talking. I have two or three conversations a week with Doug. I've had more conversations with Doug this week than I've had with Rob in 10 years. I think he was quite amazed to come to council and realize we're not all the wide-eyed socialists his brother made us out to be. He's engaged in thinking about the future of the city, and that makes him a more complex person than his brother."
Doug says his chief role is trimming the size and cost of government. "My key goal is to focus on the finances," he said.
In particular, his eye is on financing the Sheppard subway and selling off idle portions of Toronto's $18-billion real-estate portfolio. "We shouldn't be in the real-estate business," said Doug, who sits on the organization responsible for liquidating city properties, Build Toronto. "There is a couple billion dollars sitting out there in the form of vacant buildings, not creating any value. We want to up-zone them and sell them and make a profit." As a major initial stage in that liquidation, Case Ootes, the one-man board at the helm of Toronto Community Housing, announced on Thursday plans to sell 900 homes for $400-million.
The mayor's Sheppard subway plan seems to some a pipe dream. Even Gordon Chong, the man the Mayor appointed to explore financing options for the Sheppard subway, has said the project may end up being unfeasible. But Doug Ford has a plan. He's heard a number of serious proposals already for financing the $4-billion line privately, including at least one from a Chinese firm. He insists the city should start digging with partial funding: accepting a few hundred million from the federal government, borrowing against future tax revenues (known as tax-increment financing) along Eglinton and Sheppard and diverting cash leftover from the $8.1-billion the province has promised for the Eglinton subway. "I know for a fact Eglinton won't cost that much," he said. "Let's just get the shovels in the ground," he added. "Even if we go a kilometre a year, just don't take those boring machines out of the ground once they start going."
Local councillors question the math. "Tax-increment financing is supposed to be used for local improvements," said Mr. Mihevc. "Why should people at Black Creek and Eglinton mortgage their future tax revenues for a subway way out on Sheppard East? The money isn't there. You might squeeze millions or maybe tens of millions that way, but definitely not billions."
As for that $774-million budget shortfall, he seems certain that the mayor's quiet request for 10-per-cent cuts from every city department will fill much of the hole.
"It's tough work, but I'm having the absolute time of my life," he said, as he sat up from an office table to meet with an Armenian delegation. Not such a good time that he'll commit to another term in office, however. "I can't answer that, I don't know," he said of running again. "I know one thing, I don't want to be reading my obituary in the newspaper, and this place may very well kill me if I go much longer."

Full text: 'China is coming - and it likes what it sees'
kgold@globeandmail.com
Late last month, a 153-unit condo development in New Westminster sold out in two and a half hours.
More than 400 potential buyers lined up for the sales day. For every unit sold, there was at least one backup offer made. There was nothing overtly special about the project, which will be completed by fall 2012.
The two-phase development, called Eight West, is located at 21 8th Ave. in the heart of New Westminster, a traditional-design and mix of town homes and condos starting at $168,800-standard mid-market housing for the Lower Mainland. But for reasons only understood by the increasing number of local realtors who have learned to target the Mainland Chinese market, it held an irresistible allure to the new Chinese buyers looking to invest their money in the Canadian housing market.
Bill Morrison, the marketer in charge of selling the project, says he realized halfway through his marketing plan that Chinese buyers were showing interest. Once he tweaked his focus to include Chinese-specific media, he had a buying frenzy on his hands, with a lineup around the block.
"I could have sold double that amount," says Mr. Morrison. "We had no idea that would be the result. There was a huge demand."
Of the 153 units sold, about 40 per cent went to Chinese buyers, and many of them would hardly be familiar with B.C.'s historic former capital city. A major marketing feature was the removal of the harmonized sales tax, and while that strategy appealed to locals, it didn't matter so much to the new Chinese buyer, says Mr. Morrison. They would have regarded the tax as little more than the cost of doing business, he says. And unlike their Hong Kong predecessors who made up the buying wave of the 90s in Vancouver, Coquitlam and Richmond, the Mainland Chinese buyer is more open to all regions of Metro Vancouver.
Earlier this year, the Bosa Sovereign hotel-condo tower in Burnaby sold out in two days, largely due to the new Asian market. And last week, people began lining up in the rain on Wednesday for a shot at one of the Quintet luxury condo towers being built in Richmond City Centre. Organizers handed out blankets and WiFi cards so the 80 people in line could stay warm and watch the Canucks game while they waited for the sales office to open Saturday morning. The builder sold more than 270 suites that day, with 30 suites held back for a later release.
Realtors looking to reap the rewards of this new market would do well to educate themselves on the specific needs of the new buyer, says Mr. Morrison, who's been in the business for 27 years. And to reap those rewards, the smart realtor will actively seek out these new buyers with target market strategies. It would be shortsighted to take a blanket marketing approach when it comes to the new buyers, he says.
"The difference between the Hong Kong Chinese and the Mainland Chinese market is immense," says Mr. Morrison. "We are dealing with a lot of people who have a lot of money for the first time. It's the first time some of them have been on an airplane. They buy a little slower than someone from Hong Kong, who's been here 20 years.
"There are so many levels and nuances within each market, you can miss out if you lump them together."
Landcor Data Corpo. compiles B.C.'s most comprehensive real estate statistics. President Rudy Nielsen had long known that Mainland China was driving the Vancouver market, but he had yet to prove it with numbers. In Landcor's first-quarter 2011 residential sales summary, one of Landcor's senior analysts, from Anhui province in China, examined luxury sales in Richmond and Vancouver's west side, and identified the number of buyers with Chinese names. The analyst found that in 2010, more than 74 per cent of buyers were most likely from Mainland China. It's imperfect methodology, but it at least lends some statistical support to a trend that has so far been based on anecdotal information.
"Yes, the realtors are correct," Mr. Nielsen concludes in his report. "China is coming and it likes what it sees.
"They're arriving with fortunes intact, especially in the Lower Mainland, eagerly buying their own bits of the good life and helping buoy up real estate prices."
Many do not want to live in the condos or even rent them out, say the realtors interviewed for this story. They want to have a safe haven for their investment in desirable Canadian cities, in a country that is economically and politically stable.
"You could almost say it's a 'land bank,'" says Mr. Morrison.
The Chinese are attracted to Vancouver, but Toronto has its enticements too. Vancouver marketer Cam Good recently helped sell out an Etobicoke development called Westlake, which, he says, was largely snapped up by Mainland Chinese buyers. Mr. Good has taken his marketing strategy one step further. He says he's the only Canadian realtor to open offices in Beijing and Hong Kong, directly marketing projects in White Rock, Squamish, and the Toronto area to Chinese buyers who want to protect their new found wealth by tying it up in Canadian real estate.
By opening offices in Hong Kong and China, Mr. Good aims to beat his competition to the source.
"In China, it's relationship based. The North American market makes buying decisions by looking for specialists, like appraisers, inspectors, realtors, whereas a Chinese person is more likely to make buying decisions based on trust," says Mr. Good.
Simeon Garratt heads up the Hong Kong office. He usually lives in Vancouver, but was raised in China and speaks Mandarin and some Cantonese. Mr. Garratt understands not just the language, but also the culture. Canadian real estate is simply a better deal.
"If you look at the cost per square foot here, it's a bargain to buy here in Vancouver," said Mr. Garratt, prior to leaving for Hong Kong.
"I mean in Beijing, you are going to pay over $1,000 a square foot for anything nice. And that price is top end in Vancouver, for the best you can get."
Dan Scarrow, vice-president of corporate strategy for Vancouver-based Macdonald Realty, believes that an office based in Asia is more useful for getting listings than selling condos.
"Having an office there is more a ploy to get listings with developers," says Mr. Scarrow, who speaks Mandarin. "You are not going to sell many units in China. The Chinese are like any other buyer. They need to see the project to buy it."
He also believes that the new Chinese buyer is fuelling the Vancouver market because they believe in the appreciation of real estate.
"A large number of Chinese people who've come over recently, their experience with capitalism is that everything goes up forever, because it has for the last 20 years in China, so they have that mentality. "

Abstract: Antigua - Find your sea legs and get a taste of what it's like to crew a bona-fide, around-the-world ocean racing yacht at Jumby Bay Resort. Guests at the swank private island resort can climb aboard a 40-foot sailboat and take part in a two-hour group regatta. This hands-on nautical outing is not as adrenaline-filled as the America's Cup, and previous racing experience is not mandatory (the yachting pros at local sailing outfitter Ondeck Ocean Racing teach you the ropes).

Antigua - Find your sea legs and get a taste of what it's like to crew a bona-fide, around-the-world ocean racing yacht at Jumby Bay Resort. Guests at the swank private island resort can climb aboard a 40-foot sailboat and take part in a two-hour group regatta. This hands-on nautical outing is not as adrenaline-filled as the America's Cup, and previous racing experience is not mandatory (the yachting pros at local sailing outfitter Ondeck Ocean Racing teach you the ropes). If you'd prefer a more leisurely ride, find a perch on the bow with a glass of champagne and let a professional crew take you on a sunset cruise instead. Participating in the regatta costs $115 (U.S.) a person. The sunset yacht cruise costs $490 (U.S.) for a maximum of six passengers.

Farm to truck, en français
Quebec - The mobile food truck phenomenon has found its way to the remote winelands of Île d'Orleans. Panache Mobile, above, an offshoot of Quebec City's Panache restaurant, has set up its gastronomic wheels on the estate of Sainte-Petronille Vineyard with a gourmet menu that is bound to tempt even the fussiest foodies. With the St. Lawrence
River, Montmorency waterfalls and acres of lush vines in view, this is not your
typical grab-and-go dining experience. Linger over lobster hot dogs, organic Charlevoix sausages and Angus beef tartare with truffle vinaigrette, paired with a local Sainte-Petronille vintage. The farm-to-truck menu also features Louis d'Or cheese and dishes made with vegetables and herbs that are grown not far from the vineyard. Panache mobile is open on weekends only until June 23 and every day from June 24 to Sept. 5.

Retro-chic seashore
Massachusetts - Provincetown's dusty Cape Inn has reopened as the Harbor Hotel, marking its transformation from bland motel to retro-chic crash pad. The extensive gutting and redesign project resulted in 129 bright, modern guestrooms (most have views of the water, and pet-friendly suites are available upon request), a new restaurant and bar, any-weather indoor/outdoor lounge spaces, and a fire pit where guests can while away their evenings sipping cocktails on an Adirondack chair. The real draw, however, is the hotel's coveted Cape Cod location. Grab a bicycle, order a picnic basket and spend the day loafing on nearby beaches or conquering the area's scenic coastal trails. Introductory rates start at $89 (U.S.) a room through June. harborhotelptown.com
A tent on the hotel terrace
Virginia - Take the family camping without sleeping in a tent yourself. This summer, Kimpton's Lorien Hotel in Alexandria is pitching tents and rolling out sleeping bags for its younger guests. While the kids are on the terrace, star-gazing, watching camp-themed movies and telling ghost stories (battery-operated lanterns, telescopes and constellation maps are provided), parents can enjoy a grown-up evening in their room with a complimentary bottle of wine. A campfire cookout would be a fire hazard in these surroundings, so room service is equipped to deliver hot dogs and s'mores. The Kids Camp-Out package starts at $500 a night (make sure to book a room with a terrace) and are available until Oct. 30.

Full text: Carpet tile maker Belletile was formed from the wreckage of the recession and a closed factory. By specializing in a product Asia has yet to copy, the factory is hiring and expanding, joining a list of entrepreneurial Canadian manufacturers claiming their spot in the global supply chain
When Rahumathulla Marikkar's customers order a "double double," they don't want coffee. And when they inquire about "home and native land," the national anthem is not on their minds.
They want carpet tile from Belletile Inc. , a startup manufacturer that Mr. Marikkar has deftly wrapped in the Canadian flag with those two brands and another called "far and wide."
If not for a series of events that began with the Great Recession of 2008, Belletile, which has been producing carpet tiles since February, would not exist at all. In early 2009, Mr. Marikkar's job as head of technology and environment at the Canadian operations of Interface Inc., the world's largest maker of modular carpet, vanished along with those of about 90 other employees when the company closed its operation in Belleville, Ont.
Mr. Marikkar took a big risk. At a time when thousands of manufacturing jobs were disappearing every month across the country and factories sat idled and shuttered by the recession that felled Interface's plant, Mr. Marikkar put together the funding to launch his own business.
Two years on, he's hiring and expanding.
Mr. Marikkar has found a sweet spot: a high-value product that low-cost producers in Asia have yet to figure out how to make. His carpet tiles are designed to meet stringent North American requirements for high-traffic offices and are made through a process that requires engineering know-how. The niche product has allowed him to escape - so far - the kind of competition from lower-cost producers overseas that has battered so many other companies in Canada's manufacturing sector.
As the new company emerges from the restructuring of Interface, so is Canada's manufacturing industry being transformed after the crisis that devastated forest product companies, heavy equipment makers, the auto parts sector and hit virtually every company or factory in Canada that makes something.
For Canadian manufacturers, the financial crisis was the culminating event of years of pain caused by the explosion of competition from China and other low-cost countries, the rise in the value of the dollar and soaring costs for raw materials. A quarter of a million manufacturing jobs were lost in 2008-09 alone. Total employment in the sector shrank back to its 1997 level of two million from an average of 2.3 million between 2002 and 2004; its contribution to the country's economic output fell to a low of 12.4 per cent from around 20 per cent earlier in the decade.
But beneath the grim statistics that seem to attest to a sector in decline, another set of lesser-known numbers are starting to tell the story of a renaissance for Canadian manufacturing. An analysis of factory output data by Statistics Canada shows that Canada's manufacturing industry has two faces: one gloomy, the other hopeful. Among 20 industry subgroups, half showed sales declines from 2000-08, while sales in the other half are on the rise. The "expanding group" offers hope because it is made up of companies that are well positioned to exploit the growth areas in the world economy, such as petroleum, chemicals and food. The "contracting group" includes textiles, computers and electronics, and automobiles.
The finding highlights how growth is likely to come from nimble, more flexible companies, whether they are in subsectors that are expanding or contracting. Companies that develop expertise essential to global customers, that build the heft to take advantage of low-cost regions abroad while retaining highly skilled work at home, or are an essential link in a global supply chain are now finding themselves able to compete.
Rising from the ashes are companies such as Belletile, which has exploited engineering acumen and geography; electric-motor maker Elettra Technology Inc. of Hamilton, which produces complex and unique motors; "green" manufacturers in Saskatoon, Calgary and Kelowna, B.C., that are turning out components and pieces for solar and wind energy; and a surge of startup companies in Ottawa, where former employees of fallen giants Nortel Networks Corp. and JDS Uniphase Corp. are instilling an entrepreneurial spirit in a city better known for bureaucracy.
These smaller, more entrepreneurial companies now have an opportunity to tap into any number of supply chains, as makers of complex finished goods all over the world farm out the production of everything from the fabrication of components to the assembly of the final product.
But the competition for this work from lower-cost producers overseas will be fierce, and maintaining a vibrant manufacturing industry in Canada will be an uphill battle. The fastest-growing markets are no longer in Canada's backyards - they are overseas in Asia, Latin America and Africa. Tapping those opportunities will require doing business in new languages and adjusting to different legal systems and cultural habits.
The success of these companies - and ultimately the sector - matters because manufacturing remains an engine of growth, particularly in Central Canada, and a source of well-paying jobs that are key to supporting a prosperous middle class.
At stake is Canada's ability to maintain a diversified economy that is better able to weather cyclical downturns in demand and create jobs.
The jobs Mr. Marikkar fought so hard to create - and the ones he has yet to create - will be at risk if he can't continue to compete.
"I am trying to help the people whom I've known most of my life in Canada," the native of Sri Lanka says of his decision to start Belletile. "This project is my legacy."
The factory death knell
Manufacturing is far from the only way for an advanced economy to generate wealth - some economists even argue that an economy based entirely on services could grow to be as wealthy as one with factories at its core. But with the possible exception of Singapore, few have: Indeed, the world's strongest economies have a significant manufacturing base.
In Canada, the manufacturing sector had long been a key engine of economic growth and source of well-paying jobs, especially for workers lacking post-secondary education. For generations of Quebeckers and Ontarians, assembly line work offered a middle-class lifestyle and the promise of a decent pension in retirement.
Just a few years before the economic downturn, it looked as though Canada would escape the relentless decline that had ravaged such manufacturing powerhouses as Europe, the United States, Japan and Australia. Factory employment here actually grew in the early part of the 2000s, averaging about 2.3 million jobs between 2002 and 2004, compared with two million in 1997. But that growth was temporary. Factory jobs fell to 2.11 million in 2006, and continued to decline.
Then, the Great Recession hit.
For the factories so long-regarded as a key to Canada's economic health, the global downturn of 2008-09 looked like a death knell.
Across the country, one-industry towns were left hollow versions of their former selves, as factories were idled and shuttered, and lower-end assembly jobs vanished, many of them migrating to Mexico and Asia. Between August, 2008, and December, 2009, job losses in the sector averaged a staggering 14,500 a month. Manufacturing as a percentage of Canada's gross domestic product slipped from 14.5 per cent at the end of 2007 to as low as 12.4 per cent.
In the cascade of catastrophic economic news that battered North America through the winter of 2008-09, the closing of a Belleville carpet maker created barely a ripple beyond the eastern Ontario city that is home to 49,000. The decision by Atlanta-based Interface to shut down Belleville was just one among scores of other plant closings across the country, most of which were dwarfed by what appeared to be the imminent collapse of the auto industry.
As the recession deepened in the last weeks of 2008 and lenders tightened the screws on even the most creditworthy businesses, Interface, like thousands of companies around the world, sought to slash costs. Since the collapse of the U.S. real estate market was one of the causes of the recession, the supplier of carpet to the office and residential construction industries was hit particularly hard.
Five days after Christmas, 2008, Interface lowered the boom on Belleville, the company's smallest plant, as part of a restructuring that eliminated 530 jobs across the company, or 14 per cent of its global work force.
For Belleville, a small city near the eastern end of Lake Ontario, the Interface closing coincided with cutbacks at a number of other manufacturing plants, notably auto parts makers. But Belleville was spared the kind of total collapse that swept other manufacturing-heavy cities, especially in Ontario.
"In the auto sector, we had plants that were running at less than full capacity or companies that had more than one plant and cut back to one or two plants as opposed to running two or three plants in the city," Mayor Neil Ellis says.
At Interface, about 80 per cent of the laid-off employees had worked at the plant for 15 to 20 years, putting them squarely in the Canadian demographic most affected by the meltdown in manufacturing during the recession.
"I was out for eight months," recalls Kevin Taylor, a 55-year-old mechanic. Unable to get a full-time job, he found work doing odd jobs at a local electrical contractor. "It was pretty hard. I worked steady graveyard [at Interface] so I had to get my life back [even] to trying to figure out when to sleep properly."
Overall employment in Canada has returned to pre-recession levels, but thousands of the manufacturing jobs that vanished have not been recovered. The number of manufacturing jobs declined again last year.
Dealing with workers whose worlds were upended by the decline in manufacturing employment remains one of the most important challenges facing federal and provincial governments. Most of these people are in their 50s - a purgatory that leaves them a decade or more from being able to collect retirement benefits, yet lacking the education and skills to persuade an employer to select them over younger candidates.
Belletile rolls the dice
When he learned that Interface was planning to shutter the Belleville facility, Mr. Marikkar, now 60, had put in 19 years.
"I had job offers from other places. Much easier jobs; I would have made good money," he says. His wife and three daughters urged him to take one of those jobs.
But Mr. Marikkar decided to work with a couple of colleagues from the Interface plant to set up their own carpet tile business. He was convinced he had some critical competitive advantages over both older, bigger manufacturers such as Interface and lower-cost producers churning out carpet halfway around the world. As he weighed starting his own business, Mr. Marikkar and his colleagues were spurred on in part by customers looking for a local carpet tile supplier that would be able to deliver orders in time.
Demand for carpet tile - a market of between $90-million and $100-million in sales annually in Canada and $900-million in the United States - is growing by about 4 to 6 per cent a year as developers replace standard broadloom with carpet tiles. Pulling up one or two pieces of carpet tile allows access to a subfloor to install or repair wiring.
Any number of countries - Iran, China, Brazil, Thailand - can produce carpet tiles at a much lower cost. But Belletile, like many of the Canadian manufacturers that are now driving the sector's recovery, has found a specialized area of its market where it is able to add value.
In this higher-end market, "the developed countries have maintained a lead," Mr. Marikkar says.
To meet stringent North American smoke and fire regulations and to inhibit the buildup of static electricity, Belletile makes the tiles out of nylon fibres. This material is more readily available in North America than in developing parts of the world.
Belleville's location near the eastern end of Lake Ontario and proximity to the big commercial real estate markets of Montreal and Toronto gives it an edge against bigger rivals farther away that face higher transportation costs. The list of competitors includes Interface, which now supplies Canada out of its U.S. plants.
Shortening the distance to customers is critical to Belletile's bid to capitalize on the growing trend of developers putting up commercial buildings that meet the criteria for LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification, which include reducing energy use for transportation.
To get started, Mr. Marikkar and his colleagues secured a $2-million (Canadian) loan from the city of Belleville and spent $1-million of it on equipment to set up an assembly line. The Ontario government came up with a grant of $2.8-million.
Mr. Ellis, the mayor, says the Interface plant was one of the "flagship industries" of the city. When Belletile showed the city its business plan, Mr. Ellis says he had confidence that Mr. Marikkar's plan would help to protect the jobs at risk - and highly skilled jobs at that.
Mr. Marikkar and his colleagues found creative ways to get up and running quickly so they could start taking orders. The group built a new production line in a matter of months, not the usual two or more years it takes to establish a carpet file factory. They were able to do that in part by buying some equipment that had been used to make seat covers for automobiles and modifying it to make carpet tiles.
The plant has been set up to minimize waste, both of the materials in the tile itself and the chemicals needed to suppress smoke and flame. It was also designed so that the line can be stopped as soon as there is a problem, another step in reducing waste.
The customers who urged Mr. Marikkar to set up shop followed through with orders. There are now 17 employees running tufting and cutting machines, including Mr. Taylor, the 55-year-old mechanic who was unemployed for eight months after Interface closed.
Some of the former Interface employees offered to work for free. They're not; the minimum wage in the plant is $17.50 an hour.
As Belletile works on signing up dealers and selling to customers, the production line is running a couple of days a week. By next month, Mr. Marikkar hopes to be rolling carpet tiles off the line five days a week. By next year, he plans to employ 31 people.
Eventually, he aims to have 80 people working on his assembly line at the warehouse he found in a small industrial enclave sandwiched between a leafy residential area and Belleville's main CN rail yard. It's just three kilometres away from the old Interface factory, which sits idle in the north end of town.
Fighting for a nicheI
In his push to grow, Mr. Marikkar has a window of opportunity, because low-cost producers in Asia have yet to figure out how to make what he's making.
Many other manufacturers who count themselves among those quietly driving the sector's rebirth have found similar opportunities - and say the key to survival increasingly depends on the design and construction smarts of employees.
Joe Aiello started his electric-motor business much as Mr. Marikkar started Belletile. When Westinghouse closed its Hamilton electric motor manufacturing business in 1994, throwing 280 people out of work, Mr. Aiello and his co-owner Carlo Di Pietro took it over. Today, they employ 38 workers. Elettra motors propel tunnel boring machines, power pumps at the Bruce nuclear power plant on Lake Huron and drive fans in wind tunnels, such as one in Britain where Mercedes-Benz tests Formula 1 racing cars.
One of the lessons he has learned is that trying to compete with motor makers in China and elsewhere that can mass produce them makes little sense. He urges other Canadian manufacturers to follow his lead and find a niche.
"We make motors that nobody else wants to make," Mr. Aiello says. "It's complex, it's difficult, it's one-of-a-kind and thereby we're successful."
Others have looked to production for a competitive edge. E.H. Price Ltd., a Winnipeg company that makes ventilation equipment, has steadily shifted production to plants in Georgia and Arizona - where wages are cheaper - while keeping its headquarters in Canada; Transformix Engineering, which makes automation equipment for assembly lines, is assembling products in Kingston, Ont., with parts imported from around the world.
And the textiles industry, which was written off years ago as a dying sector, is attempting a renaissance as businesses become smaller and more technology-based. Cambridge, Ont.-based MW Canada, which began life in 1963 by making apparel fabrics, now manufactures materials used in window shades among other specialty products. It is experimenting with nanotechnology to make blinds that can collect enough solar power to recharge items like cellphones, laptops and iPods.
"There is a lot of structural change going on," says Philip Cross, Statscan's chief economist and the author of the study that broke manufacturing into expanding and contracting groups.
Mr. Cross's analysis shows that sales in the expanding group of manufacturers rose 44.8 per cent, or an average of 5.8 per cent a year, between 2000 and 2008 when the recession hit, compared with a 32.8 per cent drop, or an average of 4 per cent a year, for the contracting group.
Sales in the expanding group peaked in July, 2008, at $36.5-billion. In March, sales in the expanding group had recovered to $32.4-billion after growing in each of the previous 12 months. (Sales in the contracting group were $15.1-billion in March, compared with $16.5-billion in February, 2008.)
More important, the companies in the expanding group are plowing money into their businesses. Starting in 1998, investment by the expanding group outpaced that of the contracting group every year through 2011, an important indicator of future growth. Companies in the expanding group said they will spend $12.1-billion this year, which would match the pre-recession peak. But will that be enough to keep them ahead of the global competition?
The history of industrialization shows that countries start by assembling cheaper products and slowly work their way up. China, India, Brazil and other nations are now moving beyond their industrial beginnings as the assemblers of mass-market commodities to challenge for higher-end products that remain the domain of Canada, the United States, Germany, Japan and other developed economies.
That means Canadian companies will need to continue redefining their role in a world. "Competition over the next decade is going to go up and our concern is that a lot of Canadians don't seem to see it coming," says Jean-René Halde, CEO of the Business Development Bank of Canada. "It is so frustrating because they could be taking steps today to start doing things."
The BDC, which has lent and invested $33-billion in 60,000 Canadian businesses over the past 15 years, has been pushing companies to set up advisory boards of more experienced entrepreneurs - business owners "who have been there, done that, and have a few scars on their backs and can say 'Hey, wake up, because unless you make the following three moves, you're going to get clobbered.'"
At Belletile, Mr. Marikkar is far from worried about competition from China. In early 2010, he visited two Chinese carpet tile manufacturers. He found that their supply chains and raw materials do not match those of North American manufacturers.
"They are decades away from catching up and by the time they do it, the technology will likely change in the developed world," he says.

Hunter Milborne takes in the spectacular view from the roof of the old Imperial Oil building at 111 St. Clair Avenue West. The handsome limestone-clad office tower with its lobby mural by York Wilson is being transformed into the Imperial Plaza, "the gold standard in luxury living." Glass-walled penthouse suites just went on sale for between $5.1-million and $8.4-million.
What sort of people will buy these cloud palaces? Mr. Milborne, the grey-haired dean of Toronto condo salesmen, smiles. "Rich people."
There seems to be no shortage of them. Dozens of urban aeries like the Imperial penthouses are going on sale in Toronto, catering to a new thirst for high-end, high-rise living. A 9,000-square-foot, 55th-floor penthouse at the Four Seasons project in Yorkville just went for $28-million, a Canadian record. Aura, at Yonge and Gerrard, which is to be Canada's tallest condo tower, is flogging a 75th-floor unit for $17.5-million.
Names like the Shangri-la Toronto, the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton and the Trump International Hotel and Tower all lure buyers with a vision of cosmopolitan downtown living. "Imagine a life so perfect it could well be a fairy tale," says the Ritz-Carlton's online come-on.
It's hard to not to feel a bit nauseated, or at least amused, at the Bonfire of the Vanities excess of it all. The bespoke Italian kitchens. The valet parking. The spas that would make Nero blush. At the Imperial Plaza, top-floor residents have their own express elevator because (says a representative) "people who buy these private residences don't want to be mixed in with just anybody."
Still, the flowering of top-floor luxury has to be a good thing for Toronto, a visible symbol of its rise as an international city. Toronto has the biggest condo market in North America, with one unit sold every 13 minutes. April high-rise condo sales set a record for that month. The recent action at the high-end is just the latest development in a maturing market that now offers a huge variety of prices and living styles, from downtown cubbyhole lofts to glittering waterfront high-rises.
Some of the luxury buyers are wealthy foreigners who see Toronto as a good place to hang their hat or to invest in real estate. "They've done their due diligence, they've looked around the world, and they're choosing Toronto," says developer Paul Golini, executive vice-president of Empire Communities. "That's an endorsement of the political, economic and social environment we provide."
The prices attract them, too. Compared to New York, where luxury apartments can go for $10,000 to $12,000 a square foot, the $2,000 to $3,000 that luxury units here are fetching is a bargain.
But, according to Mr. Milborne, the vast majority of luxury buyers are well-heeled locals - business owners who are trading in hard-to-maintain mansions in Rosedale or Forest Hill for a concierge and a rooftop terrace. Their success reflects Toronto's. A city that looked to get whacked in the global recession - its manufacturing base eroding, its economic pre-eminence under threat from Western up-and-comers such as Calgary - has bounced back smartly.
The Imperial, for all its pretensions, is a neat project. The developers are celebrating the building's heritage as "a masterpiece of mid-century International Style modernism." The wonderful glassed-in lobby is being preserved and spruced up. Units on the lower floors start in the $300,000s - but, sorry, you have to ride the elevator with everyone else.

Vacation property market mired in downturn

Full text: REAL ESTATE REPORTER
When Ed Romanowski bought Solara Resort and Spa out of receivership last year, the Canmore, Alta., vacation property cost about $500 a square foot - roughly the same as a nice new condo in downtown Vancouver.
The high prices were a relic of the prerecession era, when investors flooded the resort market and drove prices upward while demanding increasingly larger properties and a growing list of expensive amenities.
Unlike the broader housing market, which has been on a record-setting tear since the end of the recession, the vacation property market is still mired in a downturn. The industry is coping by slashing prices on condos, timeshares and cottages to levels last seen a decade ago, and planning to build smaller units to attract families instead of investors.
"Investors have completely abandoned the market," said Mr. Romanowski, chief executive officer of Calgary-based Bellstar Hotel and Resorts.
"We've thrown out our designs to make product that actually appeals to buyers; they want smaller, more efficient spaces that they will actually use themselves. That is a major shift."
Solara's Canmore properties are selling for half of last year's prices, and are drawing muted interest. It's not a problem that's specific to the resort: Prices are down across the country and developers are considering new ways to attract buyers.
For developer Peter Freed, for example, a changing market has spurred a reconsideration of his Muskoka Bay Club project in Gravenhurst, Ont. Originally conceived by the developer as a place where owners could lounge in high-end timber cabins, he now focuses on units that are meant to accentuate the city-chic lifestyle that has found him success in Toronto.
"We've reduced the size of the units and we're focusing a little more on families now," Mr. Freed said. "We used to really focus on the world-class golf course, and it's great. But not everyone plays golf."
Inventory built before the recession is a major problem for the recreational property industry, particularly because there is no way to know how much is actually outstanding. With an estimated 7,500 new Canadian vacation properties sitting empty from coast to coast, to say nothing of all the resale properties on MLS and a wealth of U.S. properties selling cheap, buyers are hard to find.
Bellstar has also formed a residential real estate brokerage to help eat through the inventory of property it has sitting idle on resorts in B.C. and Alberta. It has $150-million in listings in the two provinces, and has hired 12 agents to move the properties.
The company hopes to do an end run around big city agents who can sometimes hurt sales by not understanding each property's features, and who often encourage resort-property owners to sell for less than what Bellstar feels is fair, thus driving down the value of neighbouring properties.
"Co-operation will be key; we can't turn off local realtors by saying they just don't understand," Mr. Romanowski said. "But we need to educate them - we don't want them giving a bad reputation to a project simply because they don't understand."
Royal LePage chief executive office Phil Soper said one of the challenges of selling the inventory of properties is the lack of information about available product. He relies on reports from his brokerages to get an idea of the market's health because there are no industry stats to check.
Anecdotally, he said, this spring marked the first burst of activity in the market since 2008 when the financial crisis caused many potential buyers to reconsider their priorities.
A Royal LePage survey found that 89 per cent of recreational property owners and prospective buyers nationwide believe such properties are a good long-term investment, and that 50 per cent believe they would generate better returns than the stock market.
"This is a very discretionary market," Mr. Soper said. "It may be hard to convince a cottage owners that what they own is a luxury because those who are into recreational properties see them as essential as water, but the fact is it's the first property decision to be delayed when people get worried."

Abstract: Do you build it at eighteen and a half thousand or fifteen? For those who hadn't been in retail, you build eighteen and a half. For those who hadn't spent time with [Steve Stavro] [who made his fortune in the big box grocery business], you build eighteen and a half. But the important thing is the customer experience. Yes, we have a smaller rink and I still tell people it's too big in my opinion. More seats would have cost more money and you have to fill them. It's not the Bell Centre.

Full text: Though he gained a love of the sport from his father, David Thomson insists the Winnipeg move is a measured business decision
sbrunt@globeandmail.com
David Thomson tells a sentimental story about watching hockey with his old man, a near-universal for his generation, even among those whose dads were not the second Lord Thomson of Fleet.
"I think that hockey was a sport that, through my father, I came to love," says the 53-year-old co-owner of Winnipeg's new NHL franchise. "My feelings for my father were extraordinary. We rarely played sport together, but hockey was something that we did share."
Watching a game at Maple Leaf Gardens - Ken Thomson was a close friend of former Leafs owner Steve Stavro - David Thomson recalls that it was dreary night for the home team, that the visiting Florida Panthers were winning 6-0, and that by late in the third period, much of the crowd had already headed for the exits.
His father, though, stayed to the bitter end, and moved right down front. He told his son that he had never seen the ice from that perspective before.
"I sat there for the next few minutes looking at him and not the game," David Thomson says, "and realizing that I had to be the luckiest human being on earth."
A question naturally follows: given that his father who so loved the game was among the wealthiest people on earth, given that his grandfather, Roy Thomson, sat on the original board of directors of the Los Angeles Kings and that the family company has held minority positions in both the Leafs and Montreal Canadiens, did the Thomsons ever consider buying a hockey team of their own?
"Neither one of us could have ever imagined having that occurring," Thomson says.
Why not?
"How would it ever happen? It had always been assumed that anyone with a hockey franchise just bled to death. You just wrote cheques. It was the London Times, times 50. As an aspiration, it would have felt good, but it just couldn't have been justified."
There is the riddle at the heart of David Thomson's Winnipeg quest. He is a sentimentalist when it comes to the sport. He cares deeply about what the new Winnipeg team means to the community, and to the country. He is, according to Forbes, currently the 17th richest person on earth, whose family wealth is estimated at $23-billion, so he certainly could afford an expensive plaything, could afford to do this simply because it feels good.
But that's not the story - or at least not the whole story. The bottom line matters very much matters here. It is a calculated business proposition. Thomson is not in this to write cheques in order to make people happy. He absolutely expects to make money.
So perhaps it is appropriate that from Thomson's perspective, the tale begins not with a misty-eyed dream of reviving the Jets, not with a nostalgic memory, but with real estate. A bit more than a decade back, Thomson's company acquired the portfolio of a Dutch pension fund, which included a shopping centre in Toronto, an office building in Montreal, and the former Eaton's property in downtown Winnipeg.
Thomson grew up in Toronto and in England, but says he felt a connection to the Manitoba capital because of a summer spent there while working for the family-owned Hudson's Bay Company in 1980, which included extensive travel in the north. "It was one of the seminal moments of my life," he says. "Manitoba resonates in my memory bank."
And of the city itself: "I've always felt a deep admiration. The word that for me always comes out is 'arterial' - the sense that it was always the centre of commerce and the meeting place of rivers and tributaries and traders."
The plan to build a hockey rink on the Eaton's site, which would become the MTS Centre, was less about the long-shot prospect of luring an NHL franchise to Winnipeg than about enhancing the value of that property by putting up a building which could be a stand alone profit-centre, with the American Hockey League Moose as its main tenant, and with a busy schedule of concerts and other events.
It was through the arena project that Thomson first met and entered into partnership with local businessman Mark Chipman to establish True North, the company that is in the process of relocating the Atlanta Thrashers to Winnipeg.
The NHL board of governors is expected to approve the deal on June 21.
"We have weathered many storms together rather successfully," Thomson says. "If one has an ideal partner, it is Mark Chipman. Integrity, intelligence, determination, curiosity, bravery. Those are fine attributes."
One decision in which it appears Thomson had a very direct hand was the choice to scale the arena at 15,000 seats - to some minds, too small to house a contemporary NHL franchise - again, he says, drawing on his time with HBC.
"Do you build it at eighteen and a half thousand or fifteen? For those who hadn't been in retail, you build eighteen and a half. For those who hadn't spent time with Steve Stavro [who made his fortune in the big box grocery business], you build eighteen and a half. But the important thing is the customer experience. Yes, we have a smaller rink and I still tell people it's too big in my opinion. More seats would have cost more money and you have to fill them. It's not the Bell Centre. It's not the ACC. But for Winnipeg, I think it's the right size."
Acquiring an NHL franchise was a possibility, albeit in the early days a remote one. Chipman spearheaded the pursuit, quietly courting the NHL hierarchy - and in the beginning, being quickly brushed aside as the league pursued United States expansion locations. Still, they persevered, and as the business of the NHL changed, as some U.S. teams floundered while the Canadian dollar grew in strength, finally opportunity and readiness converged.
"It may not make any sense to you," Thomson says, when asked when he knew they'd get their team, "but I never really wanted to be that certain. ... You had to be able to focus and not be hurt, not have to sustain a loss. Also you don't ever want to be in a position where the organization of the NHL and Gary Bettman have been compromised in any way. You have to just wait patiently and be ready."
When the moment finally came and the deal was made official, Thomson experienced something unique in his personal and business lives.
"The citizens that waved, that smiled, that put their thumbs northward. It made me as proud as I ever have been in my life," he says. "It told me that if anything, the course that we had embarked upon would be one of the great journeys of both our lives and that we could help, maybe, to leave something that was remarkable not just for Winnipeg, but for hockey. And as Canadians did we not deserve to have such an outcome? I could not have imagined ever feeling that vast array of sensation in such a short order of time and in such meaningful form and expression."
Which sounds ... well ... romantic, not like a real-estate deal, not like a calculation, not like the bottom-line proposition Thomson insists it is.
What he explains is that it can be both.
"It would please me to no end to have everyone believe that it's romantic," he says, "because it would take a tremendous amount of pressure off. At the end of the day, if you take the right course from the heart, and it's intuitive, you have all the capacity to work through all the aspects of a business - to measure opportunity, to take risk. I can assure you, my friend - as romantic as Mark and I are, we accept the challenge of making the business successful, because in the end it will only reinforce the purpose. And what a splendid outcome - to have the romantic foster a business model that's not only successful, but leaves behind a challenge for other organizations. ...
"If the purpose is right, if there's a passion, if there's a determination, if there's a resonance that runs so deep that every time you look at an opportunity, you think of your father, you think of your grandfather, you look back [to a string of Thomson family businesses], to the Hudson Bay, or CTV, or Thomson Reuters, you look back to North Sea Oil and to the Times and the Sunday Times and you can go on and on and on, and you take elements of all of those and you just figure out which ones work and which ones don't work. It's just so exciting.
"Yes, it's romantic. And thank goodness it is."

Full text: Toronto Real Estate Board tries to placate Competition Commissioner by increasing amount of information available to clients
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Toronto home buyers could be browsing websites containing enhanced real estate listings within weeks, as the Toronto Real Estate Board scrambles to avoid a prolonged fight with the federal Competition Commissioner by improving access to data for tens of thousands of real estate agents and their customers.
While some of Canada's 101 real estate boards already allow agents to set up password-protected sites for their clients, the largest board in the country does not.
What TREB decides to do next will set a national precedent for the way in which home buyers research the biggest purchase of their lives, because other boards are expected to adopt the same policy once it's instituted.
In a bid to head off a protracted battle with the Competition Bureau, TREB is turning to a 2008 deal struck between the U.S. Department of Justice and the National Association of Realtors that opened the data taps for U.S. real estate brokerages and led to the creation of popular house-hunting websites such as Zillow.com and Redfin.com.
"This is a document that the board has used, consulted and adopted in a significant way with necessary amendments while developing its own policy," said TREB spokesperson Mary Gallagher. The board is showing the new policy to stakeholders, and will vote on its implementation June 23.
The U.S. settlement stated that any information an agent could provide in person could be distributed via the Internet, and led to the creation of agent-created websites that give buyers more information about the local market and a home's history than a simple MLS listing.
The Competition Bureau launched a lawsuit against TREB in May, arguing that it prevents brokers from sharing information with their customers via the Internet. It's the latest move in the protracted fight between the bureau and real estate agents, who have come under increasing scrutiny as their commission-based payments have grown along with the price of Canadian homes.
While the Toronto board allows agents to provide information - such as the number of days a house has been on the market and previous selling prices - by hand, telephone or e-mail, they are not allowed to create websites where customers can look up the information on their own.
In a strategic review last August, led by TREB president Bill Johnston, the board listed the creation of an online system similar to that in the U.S. as one of its priorities for the next 12 months. But Competition Commissioner Melanie Aitken said she hasn't seen any signs of progress. Restricting the information agents can put on the Internet stifles competition, she said, and makes agents less productive, ultimately keeping prices higher than they need to be for consumers.
"All I can say is, we met with them several times over the last year and felt it necessary to move ahead this way," Ms. Aitken said.
Mr. Johnston said the Toronto board's executive will vote on a slightly modified version of the U.S. settlement, tailored to meet Canada's privacy laws.
The U.S. system allows homeowners to opt out of having their listings appear online, and does not require that listings be made available to the general public. U.S. real estate boards are also allowed to pass on "reasonable costs" to any agent who downloads their data.
While the U.S. settlement led to a proliferation of richly featured websites for the general public to browse, Canadians won't see a Zillow equivalent any time soon. That's because the data being pushed out of the Toronto Real Estate Board, or any other, will be available only to home buyers who have an established relationship with a broker.
"We really do think it's important that there is a relationship established," said Mr. Johnston.

Hang ten in Halifax

Author: Bird, Geoff

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/hang-ten-halifax/docview/870161215/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: In between Halifax's main surf breaks, there are dozens of lesser-known waves. But you'll have to put in some time to earn an invite from the locals. In the meantime, pack a lunch and head to Martinique, a classic East Coast beach break. Sprawling white sand, small, grassy dunes - it's just 45 minutes, but a world away, from downtown Halifax.

Full text: Globe Travel wants to set the record straight: Hawaii and California may get more attention, but the Nova Scotian capital has waves that will surprise - and challenge - even experienced surfers. From beach breaks to point breaks, Geoff Bird offers an insider's guide to the best spots within half an hour of downtown
By day
Hartlen Point
The nearest wave to the city, Hartlen Point is a picturesque cobblestone beach outside of Halifax Harbour's eastern edge. This fickle wave is not for beginners or the faint of heart. Unfortunately, the quickest access route involves trespassing over military property, so law-abiding surfers should park before the golf course and take the slow route along the shore.
By night
Obladee Wine Bar
1600 Barrington St.
Obladee is a much-needed touch of sophistication leading Halifax's downtown revival. Great atmosphere and a long wine list make it a must-see après-surf spot.
By day
Cow Bay
Halifax's home for wave variety, with at least five point breaks that peel both left and right. Beginners should head to a wave called the Moose, aptly named after the massive animal standing in the parking lot. Cruise down Cow Bay Road: If you pass a moose statue, you've gone too far.
By night
Tom's Little Havana Cafe
5428 Doyle St.
Tucked away on a back street downtown, Tom's is a great low-key locals' spot to quench your thirst with friends. It's a cozy space with soft, relaxed lighting - just what you need after a day of pounding surf.
By day
Lawrencetown
The East Coast surf hot spot, Lawrencetown is a beautiful sandy beach 25 minutes from downtown. Hook up with local pro Nico Manos, who runs the East Coast Quiksilver Surf School, for lessons and rentals.
By night
Brooklyn Warehouse
2795 Windsor St.
Fine dining and drinks in a relaxed, casual atmosphere in the city's edgy North End. Brooklyn uses many locally sourced ingredients and its Caesar is a perennial award winner.
By day
Seaforth
This spot is home to a racy right-hand point break. It's for experienced surfers only: When Seaforth is firing, it attracts a crew of skilled surfers who don't take kindly to rookies choking their valuable aquatic real estate.
By night
Rogue's Roost Brew Pub
5435 Spring Garden Rd.
Head to this microbrewery after the novelty of drinking Keith's in Nova Scotia wears off. Rogue's has a proper India pale ale, as well as several other tasty brews and good food.
By day
Martinique
In between Halifax's main surf breaks, there are dozens of lesser-known waves. But you'll have to put in some time to earn an invite from the locals. In the meantime, pack a lunch and head to Martinique, a classic East Coast beach break. Sprawling white sand, small, grassy dunes - it's just 45 minutes, but a world away, from downtown Halifax.
By night
The Lower Deck
1869 Upper Water St.
Rowdy crowds, thumping Celtic music, worn-in wooden floors and a permanent faint smell of beer: The Lower Deck is a quintessential Maritime cliché.

How Mr. McCormick went to Ottawa

Author: Edwards, Frank B

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/how-mr-mccormick-went-ottawa/docview/869784147/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Through the 1980s, the McCormick's Country Store, generally known as "[Larry James Earl McCormick]'s," expanded in width, breadth and height, as it added fresh produce, a gardening centre - and apples. Hauling a gigantic trailer behind his pickup truck, McCormack cruised the back roads picking up bushels of fruit and vegetables from local farms long before "Eat Local" became a trend. One of his farm suppliers was future federal minister of agriculture Lyle Vanclief in Prince Edward County.

Full text: Considered 'almost too decent' to be a politician, he never became jaded when it came to helping others
In 1993, small-town entrepreneur Larry McCormick gave up the gas pumps and lunch counter of his village store in a sleepy corner of Eastern Ontario to enter federal politics. A lifelong Liberal in the heart of a century-old Conservative stronghold, he beat the four-term Tory incumbent by 13,000 votes.
McCormick went on to win two more elections and served the sprawling rural riding of Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington until 2004.
Fellow Liberal MP Wayne Easter from PEI recalls him as "an absolutely wonderful guy" and laughingly suggests that he was "almost too decent a man to be in this brutal world of politics."
Regarded by former prime minister Paul Martin as "one of the nicest guys on Parliament Hill," Larry James Earl McCormick died on May 3 at the age of 71 after a long struggle with heart and kidney disease, complicated by liver and lung cancer.
Until politics took him to Ottawa, McCormick never strayed far from the picturesque Napanee River Valley where he was raised. He was born on Jan. 4, 1940. His father, Orville, was a cookie salesman and his mother, Helen, ran a general store in Yarker, a village 30 kilometres northwest of Kingston.
Upon graduating from high school in the late 1950s, McCormick - nicknamed Buzzie for his nervous energy - dreamed of becoming a long-distance trucker. Instead, he settled for a job at CIL's Kingston-area chemical plant.
He dabbled in real estate, sold education courses and, for a while, drove a truck for a concrete block company before going into business with his parents in the tiny crossroads community of Camden East, a few kilometres down the road from their home. In 1967, the McCormicks tore down an old hotel and replaced it with a small wood-frame store and gas pumps.
During his early retail years, McCormick met Reta Pauls, who had moved to Kingston with her parents as a teenager from Mose Ambrose, Nfld. She taught Sunday school in Camden East at the United Church, where McCormick sang in the choir. They married in 1969.
The McCormick family gave up the business in 1969, but the young couple bought the store back in 1971 and gradually transformed it into the heart of their community.
True to his nickname, McCormick buzzed around the pumps, behind the lunch counter and throughout the store, gabbing to customers, constantly in motion. "He was always moving," recalls his wife of 42 years.
As the business grew, so did the couple's generosity. Their annual Canada Day celebrations, complete with grand-finale fireworks, attracted up to 2,000 spectators. If the police didn't show up at the end of the day, McCormick directed traffic himself to untangle the knot of cars.
Each winter there was a full-scale nativity scene that included the donkeys he kept in the village for the amusement of himself and local children. He created mini traffic jams along his riverside street with elaborate Christmas decorations every December.
When the local school closed down, he helped finance a non-profit, tuition-free community school. The store was the first stop for every local fundraiser - and for every kid looking for a part-time job.
In the 1970s, one of McCormick's regular customers was James M. Lawrence, a young newspaper reporter who would eventually launch the nationally acclaimed Harrowsmith magazine with his wife, Elinor. During his newspaper days, he found McCormick a genial and useful source of information, often gleaned from police officers chatting at the lunch counter. In 1976, when the fledgling Harrowsmith set up offices above the village library, a building without a bathroom, McCormick gave the magazine staffers their own keys to his restrooms across the street.
"Larry was over-endowed with optimism," recalls Lawrence. "He was the centre of the community."
McCormick proved his generosity again in 1981 when a custody battle between the Lawrences over control of the magazine resulted in a surprise shakeup that left Lawrence out of a job and cut off from the company bank accounts. He had been about to launch Equinox, a glossy geographic magazine about Canada.
"I was in a daze trying to figure out what to do," says Lawrence, who remembers how McCormick unexpectedly came to visit him at home that weekend and literally saved the magazine from collapse. "He said, 'Pay it back when you can,' and handed over a roll of bills ... it was $9,000."
McCormick discretely helped out struggling families, occasionally forgave overdue accounts and offered a discrete cheque-cashing service for customers on payday.
Through the 1980s, the McCormick's Country Store, generally known as "Larry's," expanded in width, breadth and height, as it added fresh produce, a gardening centre - and apples. Hauling a gigantic trailer behind his pickup truck, McCormack cruised the back roads picking up bushels of fruit and vegetables from local farms long before "Eat Local" became a trend. One of his farm suppliers was future federal minister of agriculture Lyle Vanclief in Prince Edward County.
In 1993, McCormick surprised many in the community by selling the store to enter politics, running for the Liberals against long-time Conservative MP Bill Vankoughnet. Geographically, the riding of Hastings, Frontenac and Lennox-Addington was huge, but McCormick approached it with the same energy he brought to his store.
With Reta in tow, he shook hands and knocked on doors, genuinely happy to meet voters. His wife was less enthusiastic. "I told him no more campaigns after that first one," she says, acknowledging she stuck with him through three more elections and 10 years of community events.
McCormick treated everyone on the Hill as if they were a neighbour. He was genuinely interested in their lives and seemed oblivious to their politics.
Parry Sound's Andy Mitchell, a future Liberal cabinet minister, arrived on Parliament Hill as a rookie MP alongside McCormick and was struck by McCormick's genuine down-to-earth personality.
"He brought a bucket load of common sense with a large amount of human decency ... he had the perspective of the small-business owner and really 'got' rural Canada." The Liberals made him chair of its 50-member rural caucus shortly after his election.
His understanding of farm issues won him the position of parliamentary secretary to the minister of agriculture and agri-Food in 2000, working for Vanclief, his former pumpkin supplier. He lobbied hard against protectionist U.S. farm bills, but one of his favourite duties was visiting farm communities across the country.
Both prime ministers Jean Chretien and Paul Martin sought his opinions on agriculture issues regularly.
"Larry McCormick was one of the most popular Members of Parliament," says Martin. "His knowledge of agriculture was encyclopedic. Long after we both stepped down from government, I would call Larry to get his opinion. He never let me down ... indeed he never let anybody down."
McCormick never lost his small-town ways. He greeted everyone effusively whether they were backbenchers, cabinet ministers or security guards.
McCormick's political career came to a halt with an election loss in 2004 when his riding was merged with that of Lanark-Carleton Conservative incumbent Scott Reid's.
After 10 years of living out of a suitcase, shuffling between an Ottawa hotel and Camden East every weekend, McCormick returned home in poor health. He suffered heart attacks before and during his political years and, later, kidney disease.
His funeral service packed both the village church and its hall. Eighteen years after he sold the store, the locals still call it McCormick's.
McCormick leaves Reta and their daughter, Kayla McCormick-Fearon.

The architectural shot heard 'round the world

It could have been called "Clam House."
Also considered were "C-Section," "Shade House," and "PHNOSS," which stands for "Passive House New Orleans Shotgun Style."
Today, despite the agreed-upon and somewhat pedestrian moniker of "Low Cost/Low Energy House," this design by local good guys sustainable.TO can also be called No. 1 with a Bullet. Announced last month, the young firm - with the experienced "green" hands of principal Paul Dowsett at the helm - was awarded first place in an international competition hosted by websites DesignByMany.com and ArchDaily.com.
The task was to design an inexpensive single-family dwelling for residents of New Orleans' hardest-hit Lower Ninth Ward. In addition to being cheap to build and conforming to post-Hurricane Katrina building codes (which states that houses be raised five or more feet above grade, among other things), the home would also conform to the Passive House Standard, "the world's most rigorous building energy standard" according to the DesignByMany website. This meant that it would be airtight, super-insulated, contain no thermal bridging (i.e. exterior building materials cannot transfer heat or cold into interior spaces), and harness the free power of the sun.
It should also use the vernacular "shotgun" form, built from the Civil War era to the 1920s: A long, narrow, corridor-less floor plan with doorways that line up in such a way that "when you open the front door and you open all the doors to the other rooms, you could fire a shotgun through the house and not hit anybody," says Mr. Dowsett with a chuckle.
Oh, and do all of this in just two weeks: "It was a very short time frame," agrees the 49-year-old, LEED-accredited architect. So, after a Friday briefing where the competition guidelines, shotgun typology and the New Orleans climate were explained (Mr. Dowsett has spent a lot of time in New Orleans), the five-person staff was sent home to doodle out ideas.
Back at sustainable.TO's Leslieville offices on the Monday, the team presented its ideas, and the best of each were incorporated into a "mash-up" design. "And every step along the way from that point forward was just a process of simplifying and simplifying ... we as a group agreed that the winning entry was likely to be one of the most simple," says Mr. Dowsett.
And it is simple, but brilliantly so: The gently pitched roof, north wall and floor combine to form a "C" shape. Cradled underneath the deep overhangs of this Galvalume-clad C (self-venting, corrugated Galvalume not only lasts a half-century, it reflects heat away) is a cypress-clad box with a three-sided porch. On the south, the porch is faced with a series of sliding panels which, when used in conjunction with the various sliding doors in the living/dining space of the home's mid-section, achieves incredible seasonal adaptability. To give the shotgun model a modern twist, bedrooms have been placed on either end of the floor plan.
Instead of raising the home the standard five feet, the team raised it to seven so "you could drive a car under there, have storage under there [and] have shaded outdoor living space ... because, in New Orleans, as long as you're in the shade, there are some temperate periods that are really nice," says Mr. Dowsett.
A radiant concrete floor helps with heating during inclement periods - both active heat from the imbedded tubes and passive heat from concrete's ability to trap the sun's rays - and with cooling in summer, since when shaded by the roof overhang the concrete stays cool, which in turn keeps bare homeowner feet refreshed.
"We relied on using design first to solve problems, and the simplest technology we could find second," Mr. Dowsett explains. This highly considered yet simple approach resulted in the surprise grand-prize announcement a few weeks later: "We were thrilled, there's no other way to put it."
Unfortunately, that thrill might not carry over to watching their design get built, since that's not a promise of competition organizers.
However, with the endorsement of the Canadian Passive House Institute (CanPHI), the networking power of the judging panel (which included a University of Louisiana architecture professor and a co-founder of the Passive House Institute United States), and the fact that the design was showcased at the American Institute of Architects' 2011 National Convention last month, it's not a stretch to suggest that Brad Pitt's Make It Right Foundation might decide to make it real; since the Toronto-based television personality Mike Holmes has been involved with Mr. Pitt for some years now, there is perhaps an even greater chance.
With the Low Cost/Low Energy House win, it's my hope that these critical ideas of how to build cheaper, smarter and with the least amount of harm done to the earth will be the architectural shot heard 'round the world.

Franchise value in eye of beholder

Author: Grange, Michael

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/franchise-value-eye-beholder/docview/869556807/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The reality is, the value of the franchises these days is totally a reflection of the individual team being sold, not the league as a whole," the source said. "Sometimes, owners are valuing based on the relative cost of filling up their building for an additional 40 or 50 nights. Sometimes, it's being valued like any other business based on cash flow.

Full text: The NHL has returned to Winnipeg; that was made clear when commissioner Gary Bettman stepped to the lectern at The Forks on Tuesday to make it so.
But cloudier than ever is the true picture of what an NHL franchise is worth these days.
Two thriving businesses, the Vancouver Canucks and Boston Bruins, began battling for the Stanley Cup on Wednesday.
League revenues were up in 2009-10 to $2.9-billion (U.S.), with the expectation that revenues will top $3-billion for 2010-11. The league recently inked a 10-year U.S. television deal valued at $2-billion and the last team that sold in Canada, the Montreal Canadiens (along with the Bell Centre) went for more than $500-million two years ago. It was an NHL record and nearly double what the package sold for in 2001.
All this and now Bettman can boast of adding David Thomson and his $23-billion fortune to the NHL's ownership stable. (Thomson is a partner in True North Sports & Entertainment Ltd., which purchased the Atlanta Thrashers and brought them to Winnipeg. Thomson's family company also owns The Globe and Mail.)
Not bad. But the successes can't gloss over that NHL teams - at least some of them - seem to be getting cheaper all the time.
The transaction to bring the Thrashers to Winnipeg is valued at $170-million, with $60-million of that a relocation fee the new owners will be paying to the league. The result is a price tag on the franchise itself of about $110-million.
"I can't believe that the guys in Atlanta got that much for it," one NHL insider and former league governor said.
The franchise had been for sale since 2007, but no local buyers could be found - at least at the price True North was willing to pay, which was consistent with the reported $93-million in cash paid by financier Jeff Vinik for the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2010. The Tampa price tag was about half what had it sold for previously - and that price includes 51/2 acres of real estate surrounding the St. Pete Times Forum.
"The reality is, the value of the franchises these days is totally a reflection of the individual team being sold, not the league as a whole," the source said. "Sometimes, owners are valuing based on the relative cost of filling up their building for an additional 40 or 50 nights. Sometimes, it's being valued like any other business based on cash flow. And sometimes, it's being looked at as a vanity investment - what is a wealthy individual willing to spend to spend on a toy?"
The Buffalo Sabres sold for $170-million, plus the assumption of about $20-million of debt in February. With as many as a half-dozen other franchise apparently for sale and with a limited pool of apparent buyers, some industry experts feel Bettman has done well to maintain a floor of about $100-million in a league where owners will have to spend a minimum of $45-million on salaries next season.
"There's no doubt that some of the these teams have traded at prices below what the league would like them to be, but to me, each situation is different," long-time NHL player agent Tom Laidlaw said.
The Thrashers sold for a steep discount to the $135-million they were pegged at by Forbes Magazine in their most recent ranking of NHL franchises. That mark had them 29th overall, ahead of only the Phoenix Coyotes at $134-million.
The Coyotes' eventual price tag would seem to be lower than that - the NHL bought them out of bankruptcy for $140-million in 2009, and suffered a reported $37-million in losses in 2010-11. A deal to sell the team, in which the City of Glendale was going to front $100-million of the apparent $170-million purchase price for Chicago businessman Matthew Hulsizer, has fallen through.
"There are certainly cases right now across the league where franchise values have plummeted but, really, franchise value is a mutually exclusive thing," University of Ottawa sports management associate professor Norm O'Reilly said. "It really depends.
"You're talking about the Toronto Maple Leafs and [parent company Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment] being worth somewhere between $1.5-billion and $2-billion. The Philadelphia Flyers are appreciating, the Boston Bruins are appreciating, the Vancouver Canucks are appreciating, and then these other ones are going down in value," he said.
"You have to look at it on an individual basis of the market, the teams and the players. We've shown there are 48 different factors that have been shown to influence the value of a franchise and its business success."

hootsuite
Before it became one of the most popular social media management tools out there, HootSuite was nothing more than an internal tracking tool - a way for a single marketing agency to find out how much bang it was getting for its social media buck.
Vancouver-based Internet marketing firm Invoke Media launched HootSuite late in 2008 and spun off the company a year later. The software is a kind of superpowered social media dashboard. It lets users monitor what people are saying about them and their companies on networks such as Twitter and Facebook. Over time, HootSuite has also come to include various analytics and scheduling tools, allowing users to automatically send social media messages at prescheduled times, or to figure out just how many people are responding to those messages. "We're looking at helping give better visibility into the effectiveness of how people spend time on social media," says Ryan Holmes, HootSuite's CEO. By giving users detailed metrics on what people are doing online, he adds, those users can get a better sense of the return on their social media investment.
HootSuite runs on a "freemium" business model. About 97% of the software's users download the free version of the product. The remaining 3% - most of them enterprise customers - pay for a more powerful, full-featured version.
In addition to adding more features, HootSuite's staff have focused their energy on getting their products on as many devices as possible. The software is now available for desktops and various mobile devices, including iPhones, BlackBerrys and Android-powered phones. (The team is also working on a version for Research In Motion's PlayBook tablet.) HootSuite has also launched several versions in other languages, and even has its own service that shortens website addresses so that they don't take up too much space in Twitter posts.

power soccer
Liam Power would love to tell you that his million-dollar company is the culmination of months of careful market research - putting together a glossy business plan and meeting financial benchmarks quarter by quarter, the whole story unfolding like a banker's entrepreneurial fantasy. "There was no grand plan," he admits. "I kind of fell into this."
"This" is his eponymous soccer-skills academy, Power Soccer, which teaches the nuances of the beautiful game to Toronto-area kids, aged four to 16, through clinics, winter soccer schools and holiday camps. Its flagship elite development academy, an invitation-only program, trains athletes nearly year-round with an eye toward prepping them to play soccer at the collegiate level, internationally or even in the professional ranks. But the 46-year-old Irishman and professional footie player isn't entirely accurate when he says he didn't delve into the market before starting up.
Power came to Canada in 1988. His accent and soccer expertise - he spent two seasons as a reserve player for Galway United in the League of Ireland first division - quickly earned him coaching gigs with competitive clubs around Toronto. It was then that he realized there was a broader demand for what he was doing. "I kept having parents of the kids I was coaching offering to pay me to coach their other kids," he says.
He started in a gym training a group of 14 players in 1996, and grew quickly enough that he could leave his career in sales and marketing a couple of years after that. Today, he's planning Power Soccer's 15th anniversary.
- Michael Grange
Lessons learned
1. Branding matters. Since he was blessed with a catchy surname, figuring out what to call his business wasn't difficult. But Power wishes he'd been able to focus sooner on creating a logo. With a background in sales, however, the company's early promotional materials were high quality, which helped distinguish his business
2. Quality control counts. Power believes soccer is best learned in a high-tempo, game-oriented environment. Everything from fitness to strategy is taught with a ball at the foot of each student. It requires creativity and skills on the part of the instructional staff, which is why Power has resisted offers to branch out: He wants to hold the instructional experience to his standard.
3. Exploit competitive advantages. Finding quality field space is a challenge in an urban, northern climate centre like Toronto. The parent of one of Power's students had an in at Upper Canada College, a local private school, and helped Power get time on its new artificial turf field, which is domed in winter. Crescent School, which considers soccer to be a magnet sport for its international students, allows Power Soccer to use its turf field as a way to boost its footie cred.

ocean nutrition
The long list of uses for Ocean Nutrition's fish oil makes the Maritime company's star product sound more like snake oil than entrepreneurial gold. A glance at the company's books should convince even the toughest skeptics otherwise.
Ocean was co-founded in 1997 by East Coast entrepreneurs and food industry veterans Robert Orr and John Risley, of Clearwater Seafoods fame. Since then, the Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, company has ballooned from a four-man operation into a global heavyweight that's showing no signs of giving up its stranglehold on the world market for fish oil-based omega-3s. These fatty acids are necessary for human health, but since the body can't make them on its own, they must be consumed. "Billion-dollar ingredients only come along every 10 to 20 years," says Orr, the company's chairman, "and omega-3s have the potential to be a billion-dollar ingredient worldwide."
Key to Ocean Nutrition's success has been its pioneering refining process that removes the fishy taste from the oil. That, plus a stellar marketing strategy, has made Ocean Nutrition's supplement a sought-after ingredient for food companies producing everything from orange juice and margarine to bread, high-end chocolate bars, yogurt and milk.
- Jessica Leeder
Lessons learned
1. Customers and competition are global. Ocean Nutrition has achieved global dominance despite the fact that sales in Canada are minuscule and likely to remain so, due largely to Ottawa's regulatory system for certain foods.
2. Ignore conventional wisdom. "If I had a dollar for everybody who told me we couldn't do what we wanted to do, then I'd be retired," says Orr. "But we wouldn't have a business today."
3. Add value on multiple fronts. The secret to Ocean Nutrition's success, says Orr, lies in its ability to communicate the value of its product to clients, and helping those food companies get the word out to their customers. "We work to create value for our food customers not just by selling an ingredient, but by selling them a whole batch of services."

kerr smith
What do you get when a branding and communications genius marries an industrial design guru? If you guessed a whole new breed of creative studio, you probably already know Nigel Smith and Helen Kerr. The two first met in the elevator of the Toronto building where they both worked - he was the creative director of Hahn Smith Design, a graphic design agency on the 10th floor, and she was the president of Kerr & Co., an industrial design firm on the ninth. Small talk led to coffee, which led to dinner, which led to a wedding - and to increasing collaboration between their two companies.
In 2010, after 10 years of marriage and countless projects together - from furniture to cutlery to potato peelers - Smith and Kerr merged their companies into a unique hybrid they hesitate to call a design company. "Our areas of expertise are research, design and solutions," says Kerr. "Those are the things we do, but our goal is really to help companies broaden their world, to innovate and offer real solutions that may or may not be design." It's not uncommon for a client to walk in wanting a new website, and walk out with binders full of ideas to rethink their entire business.
In other words, Kerr Smith is in the business of skyrocketing its clients to next-level success, and the team will turn the office upside-down to do it - the walls are perpetually covered in photos and paper printouts. For one project - designing a line of health-care chairs for hospitals - Kerr Smith filled an entire room with prototypes. "We work in a very visceral way, and wall space is very important to our process," says Smith. "We have a lot of war rooms where the walls just get covered in paper. Creativity is messy, and we go through many, many, many iterations of things - some people think we're crazy to spend so much time and energy on this stuff, but I think it's that level of obsession that distinguishes us."
- Nancy Won
Lessons learned
1. Not everyone needs us, and that's okay. "We're interested in doing transformative work, and we love working with clients who have an appetite for that," says Kerr. "We work best with companies that have, or have the seed of, a culture of innovation. It's hard to impose change on a company that's not open to it. I don't think that's our job."
2. Innovation is risky. "Creativity is about going forward and doing new things, so there is a kind of leap of faith involved in what we do," says Smith. "We're always moving into the unknown and dealing with things that are intangible, so failure is a real possibility. It's important to manage and communicate that risk, because in creative services nothing is ever guaranteed."
3. Prototype everything. "Although we live very much in the world of ideas and process and research, we temper all of it with real life," says Kerr. "A fundamental part of what we do is to try stuff out. We have a 700-square-foot workshop where we produce prototypes of everything we're working on. It's so important to understand how a human being will react to something before it becomes real."

cocotte
When Patric Meunier's wife, Jasmine Lachance, started Cocotte in 1993, her goal was to create well-designed bags for some of her bike messenger friends. An outdoor enthusiast, she understood the need for durable and functional carryalls. Her satchels would be heavy-duty and water-resistant, with sturdy padded straps that could be easily adjusted while also absorbing considerable weight.
Meunier came on board four years later, as Lachance - a costume designer - began spending more and more time working at a local college. It was Meunier who realized that his wife's bags had the potential to reach a market beyond the narrow niche of bike messengers. But even as the business grew, he insisted that the manufacturing remain local; five employees (more during peak times) continue to work out of a second-floor space above a plumbing shop in the heart of Montreal's Plateau-Mont-Royal neighbourhood. "Part of our philosophy is to make a well-designed, long-lasting product that can be manufactured here in Montreal and offered in stores at competitive prices," says Meunier. "And we can do that as long as we take the time to do it well."
Today, Cocotte (French for pine cone) has a certain street cred among film crews, students and even businesspeople that's born from its authentic image coupled with its sustainable values. The bags - easily recognizable thanks to their solid colours and golden logo - have fans in Australia, Japan, Europe and the U.S.
- Amy Verner
Lessons learned
1. Simple design is key. Meunier sources premium nylon that "won't break, it won't let you down, it's good with the elements and takes abuse." But he also points out that the company has fine-tuned its product range. Initially, Cocotte offered other outdoorsy items for tree planters. Instead, says Meunier, "we chose to concentrate on what we do best."
2. Know your limits. Meunier once entertained the idea of a Cocotte shop, but decided against it. "I couldn't deal with the idea of being open seven days a week," says the father of two. "And opening a store is involving in terms of expenses." But six years ago, Cocotte added e-commerce to the site, which has broadened the brand's customer base. "It's effective and it's inexpensive," says Meunier. "It is the easiest way for a small business to get known across the globe."
3. Word of mouth rules. "The bag sells by itself. We did try advertising a few times, and [nothing] ever got us results. The better result would be when we get it to end users and reviewers," he says. "I cannot sell this like I would sell chewing gum or pizzas."

cuco resources
Malik Talib was looking for a new idea. The Vancouver tax lawyer-turned-entrepreneur had made money in technology, publishing and real estate. But in 2007, he found himself in the unruly and often violent environs of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the African country where he was born, talking with Chetan Chug, an old family friend and a veteran businessman in the region.
Together, they hatched a plan: to stake out claims in the country's rich copper-cobalt belt near the southern border, in Katanga Province. Leveraging Chug's local savvy, the duo secured about two dozen permits, several of them sidled up against giant Freeport McMoRan's now-prolific Tenke Fungurume mine.
CuCo Resources Ltd.'s early exploration success led to a $10-million (all currency in U.S. dollars) financing in the summer of 2008. Soon after came the financial collapse, however, and with the company's bank account hurtling toward zero, CuCo gambled on a small-scale plan to quickly mine some cobalt to drum up cash. That meant putting off its real goal of going after more valuable copper. Industry veterans, and Talib's own investors, were skeptical. "Not being from the mining industry, I could ask the really stupid questions," says Talib. "It saved us."
CuCo Resources has since turned its small cobalt operation into a larger mine - and copper is set to come out of the ground later this year. With Talib expecting to have revenue of about $20 million in 2011, investor skepticism has eased. In February, CuCo raised $45 million in financing, ahead of a planned IPO this fall, when Talib expects the company to drum up another $50 million, and as much as $100 million - so long as copper remains as hot as it has been.
- David Ebner
Lessons learned
1. Work with the right people. Malik Talib's partner intimately understood the nuances of doing business in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The company also signed on a geologist who'd spent four decades exploring, building and operating mines in Africa, and later installed an African mining engineer as its chief operating officer on the ground.
2. Money talks. CuCo's access to capital made a good idea on paper a reality. Backed by enticing prospects below ground and an able team above ground, Talib was able to persuade Macquarie Bank to put up half the original $10-million financing. "You can have the best plan in the world, but it's useless unless you can bring in the investment," he says.
3. Understand your market. The DRC is scarred by decades of dictatorial rule and ongoing tribal warfare. "When you're in a country like the DRC, you want to be on the lookout to make sure you're not going to get in trouble," Talib says. "The second thing is having confidence that you know how to do business there. The people there are no different than people in other parts of the world. They want to be respected. They want to get value from their resources."

imris inc.
David Graves heard about a cool new invention at the National Research Council's Institute for Biodiagnostics back in 2005. The technology was designed to help surgeons get up-to-the-minute images of a patient's brain during a neurological procedure, using a high-field MRI scanner in the operating room. Graves liked the idea so much, he decided to buy the patent, and Imris was born.
Today, the Winnipeg-based company - started with about $10 million of Graves's own money - is actively marketing two other products, for cardiovascular and neurovascular procedures. Graves doesn't like to waste time when it comes to getting new developments to market, and so Imris is also plugging away at two potential new products. One is for radiation therapy; the other is a surgical robot, currently in clinical trials, that can perform operations while a surgeon guides it from a control room.
Imris did an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2007, raising roughly $40 million. It followed that up with a listing on Nasdaq last year, raising another $50 million. Its sales force, which is looking to sell the products to hospitals, is organized around three key geographical markets: North America, Europe and the Middle East, and China.
Graves is no stranger to young companies. Having previously founded Broadband Networks Inc., a wireless telecommunications systems developer, and having also served as the CEO of venture capital firm Centara Corp., Graves has the benefit of experience to guide him. - Tara Perkins
Lessons learned
1. Assemble a team of skilled professionals. "I think it's extremely important that our company is not managed only by the engineers that started it," says Graves.
2. Gain credibility by launching a product that's a raging success right away, but don't take too long. "Markets don't wait for you. If you take your time, you'll be the last guy to show up. Go quickly and spare no expense in making it right."
3. Don't just build a better mousetrap. "Don't rely on innovation. You have to identify a market where you have some open space."

clearly contacts
It was the 500% markups that put Roger Hardy over the edge. He'd worked for a contact-lens manufacturer and watched consumers get gouged. Boxes of brand-name products would be sold to optometrists for $12.50, he says, and then resold to patients for $60 to $75.
To break what he calls a monopoly, he set up an online contact-lens retailer that attracted early adopters who like trying out new businesses. A few years later, he expanded into prescription glasses. "Your iPhone should not cost less than your pair of glasses," he says. With gadgets, "there's intellectual property, there's patents, there's technology, there's electrodes...versus two little pieces of plastic, two little screws and two little pieces of glass."
Hardy initially thought contacts could never be sold online. "We fell into the same sort of hocus-pocus that opticians and optometrists tell everyone," he says. " 'Your eyes are so unique, you need to come and see me. I'm the only one who can care for you.' "
- Tim Kiladze
Lessons learned
1. Listen to early adopters. "If you want to make the jump to the mainstream market, you've got to wow early customers with more than just price," Hardy says. To figure out how, he reached out to his customers by calling them at home. That was 2000. Fast-forward 10 years and communities such as Facebook groups make outreach much easier.
2. Speed and ease of use matter. "We didn't go out like the average dot-com and raise $100 million and spend it all on marketing in two years," says Hardy. "We were fairly prudent in getting our offering correct and letting customers be our sales force." The company sank $8 million into manufacturing equipment, and has increased its inventory from $10 million to $25 million. "It's easier to serve an existing customer than get a new one," says Hardy.
3. Make it so easy they can't say no. To make ordering glasses as simple as buying contacts, the company has a no-questions-asked return policy. Customers can also order a few pairs at a time to try out different styles. "We don't want anyone to have a reason that they didn't try it," Hardy says.

buzzbuzzhome
Matthew Slutsky knew he was on to something good with BuzzBuzzHome, a listings site for new home development based in Toronto. But it wasn't until a complete stranger showed up at the BuzzBuzz office - expensive coffee machine in hand - that he understood he'd created something incredibly unique.
The man had stumbled on the company's website while searching for a place for his daughter to live while she attended university in the city. Using the site's listings - which contain photos, floor plans and neighbourhood information - he found a condo for his kid without incurring any expenses. The coffee maker was his way of saying thank-you to the company that guided his search. It was a pivotal moment for BuzzBuzz. "It was validating something that I believed in all along," says Slutsky. "It really demonstrated the power of the site and the reach it could have."
Slutsky (left, with co-founder and co-president Clifford Peskin) got the idea for BuzzBuzz while working as a vice-president in the development industry. He noticed that there wasn't a single source for people looking to buy a new property. The Canadian Real Estate Association has the resale market locked up with its Realtor.ca portal, but the new-home market was woefully underserved.
With more than 100,000 unique visitors each month, the site has turned into a social media hub, where real estate professionals and potential buyers mingle on message boards, and share photos and stories. "It's more than just a site now," he says. "We've actually created a pretty vibrant community."
While the site doesn't sell traditional advertising, the heart of its business plan rests on selling developers special status and placement on the home page. For a fee, builders can ensure their listings appear on the main page and across the site, and contain the kind of bells and whistles that turn browsers into buyers.
The site was initially focused on the Toronto market, but is now turning its attention westward, toward Vancouver. Its owners are also considering allowing an outside investor to take a minority stake in order to help finance the expansion. "There's so much we want to do, and we may need to get some help to make that happen faster than we could do it ourselves," Slutsky says. "But we're being very careful to do things on our own terms and in a way that makes us comfortable."
- Steve Ladurantaye
Lessons learned
1. Don't sell to venture capital investors or anyone else too early. "If you have a good idea, hold off as long as humanly possible," says Slutsky.
2. Hire some talent. "If you are starting up a technology company and don't know how to code, you'd better get the best engineer around."
3. Don't do it alone. "Find an amazing partner with skills that complement your own."

quickplay media
When the CEO of one of Canada's communications giants had his light-bulb moment, he was looking at QuickPlay's product. BCE Inc.'s George Cope said he truly understood the power of mobile video when he watched the 2010 Winter Olympics on a Bell phone. It was one of the things that led to his company's purchase of Canada's largest private broadcaster, CTV, in a deal that helped transform the country's media industry.
QuickPlay is a Toronto-based company that's playing a big role in the emerging world of mobile TV. Its data centres have a capacity for millions of videos, and its software allows them to run on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Its focus is on premium content, such as live-streamed FIFA matches and Nickelodeon shows that parents can stream on their iPad to keep kids quiet in the back seat. "I'm not saying we're going to trump TV...But the convenience of being able to watch what you want is valuable," says QuickPlay CEO Wayne Purboo.
Clients include heavyweights such as Rogers, AT & T, RIM and, of course, BCE. Media customers and partners include major networks like ABC, Global, CBC, CBS and MTV, plus a major Asian media company that has yet to be announced.
QuickPlay is making a big push into Asia, where mobile data is cheap and broadcast TV has been available on phones for a long time. But as Purboo puts it, "the quality isn't there yet." That's where he hopes QuickPlay will come in.
According to Purboo, there is a respect for Canadian engineering that helps him sell to international clients. "People think you can't do this from Toronto, that you have to be in Silicon Valley," he says. "We definitely have the talent here."
- Susan Krashinsky
Lessons learned
1. You never have enough money to do everything you want. Get used to it.
2. The customer is not always right. It's been hard for QuickPlay to say no to clients when they're some of the biggest names in the business, but a push to do more YouTube-like user-generated content, to use one example, wasn't in line with the company's strategy. "We could have made a lot of money - there were big customers asking for that," says Purboo. "Our market is in premium content."
3. Agility is more important than vision. For high-tech start-ups, much is made of the need to be visionary, but the industry is changing too fast to get set on a large-scale vision too early. "At best, you can see two years into this market," Purboo says.

Full text:   Federal watchdog launches lawsuit over consumers' access to information over the Internet
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
The Competition Bureau is picking a fresh fight with the real estate industry, this time over how crucial market data is being kept away from consumers by the country's largest real estate board.
The federal watchdog has launched a lawsuit against the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB), arguing that it prevents brokers from sharing information with their customers over the Internet. The challenge is the latest salvo in the bureau's battle with the nation's real estate agents, who have come under increasing scrutiny as their commission-based payouts have grown along with the price of homes.
The Toronto board allows agents to provide their customers with all sorts of important data about a home that are not available on the public website Realtor.ca, such as the number of days a property has been on the market and previous selling prices.
The information is essential for any home buyer, because it tells a deeper story about the local market and the home's history than a simple listing.
While some of the country's real estate boards have no problem with this, the Toronto board has resisted making the material available online, citing privacy concerns. Toronto agents are allowed to send the information via fax, hand it to the customer in person or zip off an e-mail.
Some brokerages want to go further and set password-protected websites that would allow customers to access the data from their living rooms. But TREB won't allow the brokerages to pull the data from the Multiple Listing Service that they need in order to fill the sites with information. In a court filing, the Competition Bureau argued that the policy stifles competition.
"The restrictions are a practice of anti-competitive acts, the purpose and effect of which is to discipline and exclude member brokers who use non-traditional methods," the Competition Bureau's court filing states. "If a broker does not abide by the restrictions, TREB can terminate the broker's access to the TREB MLS system - and has done so."
The filing refers to a 1997 decision by the board to deny access to a brokerage after it downloaded listings from the MLS server to provide to its customers on a password-protected site.
Competition Commissioner Melanie Aitken said that decision has scared other brokers away from attempting to set up similar services. If those services were allowed, it would mean "their customers could conduct their own searches for information relevant to the purchase and sale of homes in the GTA without the personal assistance or direct intervention of a broker." This could lead to "significant savings" for consumers, she said.
"This is simply about allowing consumers to gain access to information in innovative ways rather than the traditional way," Ms. Aitken said. "We told them about our concerns and have talked to them since February, but we can't let them continue to violate the act so we had to move."
TREB sees it differently, arguing that having that information on a website that could be accessed by anyone with a password is an invasion of privacy. The association, which represents about 31,000 agents, has been working on a system that would allow such sites to operate, yet address privacy concerns, said Bill Johnston, the board's president.
Mr. Johnston said he had met with Ms. Aitken's "underlings" earlier this year and felt blindsided by the decision to go ahead with a case to the Competition Tribunal.
"We thought we were on the right track and then she threw us a curveball," he said. "This smacks of career building on her part, and is a waste of taxpayers dollars. It's a low blow that shouldn't have happened, and I can see no other legitimate reason for doing this other than to grab headlines."
The two sides can either come to an agreement, or meet at the Competition Tribunal - which has the power to impose a solution and issue fines.
The country's real estate industry is made up of 101 individual boards, which are organized geographically. Each runs its own Multiple Listings Service, which all feed into the Realtor.ca site that is run by the Canadian Real Estate Association. They can set their own rules on how their data is used.
Other boards have allowed brokers to offer the information that TREB is denying its members.
Bill McMullin has invested "several million dollars" into Viewpoint.ca, a site that legally pulls data from the Nova Scotia boards and repackages it for its clients. He has taken it a step further, adding additional data sets that allow users to see information on things such as lot sizes and recent assessments.
"Everything you see on our site is made possible because we have access to that MLS data," said Mr. McMullin, who wants to expand into Toronto but can't get the data from the Toronto board.
This is the second time Ms. Aitken has taken aim at the real estate industry. Last year, she accused the real estate association of blocking its members from posting flat-fee listings, instead requiring consumers to hire an agent for the entire sales process if they wanted their house listed on MLS. That case led to a settlement that opened the door for flat-fee brokerages to list houses on the system.

Full text:   Changing weather patterns and wild shifts in commodities and currencies have created a disaster for Colombia's coffee producers. As prices surge and millions around the globe continue to clamour for their favourite morning brew, the struggle of the Juan Valdez growers is part of a growing challenge for the industry. Shawn McCarthy reports from Buenavista, Colombia
On a mountaintop estate in the rugged coffee-making region of Quindio, Colombia, Juan Pablo Villota is at war with the weather.
For three years, abnormally wet conditions have caused massive flooding in the county's flatlands and damage to his crops. Even the road to his 40-hectare plantation gives testament to his fight: The swollen La Vieja river is a muddy torrent that has forced lane closings along the twisting two-lane highway.
For coffee producers like Mr. Villota, those three years have been a constant battle. Without enough sun, coffee plants don't grow the berries that are harvested for their beans. And too much humidity creates ideal conditions for coffee rust, a disease that stunts berry production. Some farmers have seen a 70-per-cent drop in yield, although his San Alberto estate has limited the damage to a 20-per-cent decline.
"It has been a disaster," said Mr. Villota, whose grandfather bought the picturesque estate in 1972. "Three years of heavy rains with very low quantity of sun hours has decreased Colombian production ... All the growers have been suffering."
The painful struggle of Colombia's coffee producers is part of a growing global challenge for the industry. Changing weather patterns have wreaked havoc on coffee supply, particularly the Arabica strain, which is grown in the Americas and Africa and which makes the best coffee.
Brazil and Colombia are the top two producers of Arabica, but experts say the crops are not keeping up with skyrocketing demand in emerging markets like China, India and South America, as well as among consumers in Europe and North America.
In the face of strong demand, coffee inventories have fallen to their lowest levels on record. A decade ago, coffee-making countries had stored some 55.1 million 60-kilogram bags. Last year, stocks fell to 13 million bags. The industry's supply-demand balance is so bleak, in fact, that a scientist rocked trade forums last year by warning that the world is veering toward "peak coffee" - the point at which producers can no longer increase production to meet the world's rising taste for the drink.
The squeeze is already being felt in grocery stores and cafes around the world. In North America this week, Starbucks Corp. raised the price of a one-pound bag of beans by 17 per cent at its U.S. stores and 6 per cent in Canada. And J.M. Smucker Co., which sells the Folgers and Dunkin' Donuts brands, announced its fourth increase in a year for a total hike of 38 per cent.
And while the weather hits inventories, some are blaming the rising cost of coffee on speculators - institutional investors who are pouring money into commodities such as coffee, oil and sugar in search of big returns. Starbucks president Howard Schultz has blamed speculation, rather than supply shortages, for the doubling of coffee commodity prices since last May.
Whatever the truth, the story of peak coffee is one that spans growers, sellers, traders and the global economy.
The problem begins with a coffee tree.
The supply problem
The typical Colombian coffee grower farms a 1.8-hectare plot with his family and belongs to a local co-operative that is allied with the national Coffee Growers Federation. Some market their production directly to middle men or even directly to foreign buyers, while the federation also sells coffee both domestically and internationally under Colombia's iconic Juan Valdez brand.
Farmers typically have to cut back their coffee trees every five years in order to rejuvenate the production of berries, and then replace the trees after 15 years as yields decline precipitously.
But many farmers, especially smaller growers, are extending those timelines to take advantage of the current price spike and because they don't have the resources to reinvest in their field, even at the prices, which have been offset by the rise in the Colombian peso.
"It's a poverty trap," the federation's communications director, Luis Fernando Samper, said in an interview at its headquarters in Bogota. "People are not willing to uproot their trees when they still get cherries from the trees, and so every year they get less cherries."
Largely because of the weather, Colombia's production has fallen to 9.5 million 60-kilogram bags last year from 12 million bags in 2007, the last year before the particularly nasty version of the weather pattern known as La Nina brought the rain.
At the same time, many farmers are encouraged to move out of coffee production as other agricultural products - from plantain in Colombia, to sugar cane in Brazil - soar in price, and land costs rise.
Colombia's production troubles are shared by other coffee-making countries, including Brazil. Production in Central America and East Africa has been stagnant or down in the past few years, while global demand keeps growing at a rate of about 2.5 per cent a year.
Agricultural experts are warning that the ability of growers to respond to higher prices by increasing supply will be limited by the continuation of poor growing conditions resulting from changing weather patterns and by competition for land use in exporting countries that could limit coffee production.
Growers need to be prepared to adapt to climate change, said Peter Baker, a senior scientist with CABI, a British agricultural institute.
"Is it climate change or not?" Mr. Baker asked of the changing weather patterns. "It's extremely difficult to say but this is exactly what you would expect to happen: That we're going to get more extremes in the weather like this."
Arabica coffee - which must be grown in equatorial zones between 1,200 metres and 1,800 metres of elevation - is particularly susceptible to bad weather, and the extremes of wet and dry lead to more infestations of rust and an insect known as the coffee borer.
Mr. Baker noted that there has been virtually no growth in the production of Arabica coffee in the past 20 years, while countries like Indonesia and Vietnam are boosting production of the Robusta variety. Robusta is favoured in some developing countries and for blends and instant coffee.
The agricultural scientist raised the spectre of peak coffee last year in a speech at a meeting of the International Coffee Organization, which prompted discussion throughout the industry.
In an interview from London, he complained that it is difficult to known the exact status of production and yields because the industry has extremely poor data. But it is clear that growers are having trouble responding to challenges because they tend to be small farmers with little opportunity to invest in higher-yielding varieties.
It takes three years for a new coffee plant to produce a harvest, and many Third World farmers are unwilling to gamble that prices will remain high, especially when they can reap immediate returns from other crops.
"In principle, these prices should make planting more attractive but planting takes a long time to come on stream," said Jose Sette, executive director of the London-based International Coffee Organization.
Meanwhile, as production has failed to keep up with demand growth, the industry has been reducing its inventories of unroasted beans that sit in warehouses around the developing world.
The speculators
With inventories falling to record lows this spring, the price was bound to climb. But many in the industry say coffee price fluctuations - like those of many other commodities - are compounded by speculators.
"Through financial speculation - hedge funds, index funds and other ways to manipulate the market - the commodities market is in a very unfortunate position," Starbucks' Mr. Schultz told reporters in London this spring. "This has resulted in every coffee company having to pay extraordinarily high prices for coffee."
Coffee prices - which went through a prolonged slump between 2000 and 2006 - have doubled since the middle of last year, with Arabica topping a 34-year high of $3.08 (U.S.) a pound earlier this month before selling off with the rest of the commodity market. Arabica now sells on future markets for $2.65 a pound, compared to less than 50 cents a pound at its nadir a decade ago.
"There are certainly fundamental issues - the problem with supply and demand is a real issue," said Ric Rhinehart, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. "But there is also a speculative component to it."
The futures market is a critical tool for buyers and sellers to hedge positions, particularly given the long supply lines that exists between equatorial growers and North American consumers. Growers can lock in prices even before they harvest the berries, while buyers can assure not only the price but the supply in an extremely volatile market.
But in recent years, the financial players have overwhelmed the industrial traders. As a result, the coffee market has behaved much as the broader commodity complex, driven by a combination of growing emerging market demand, a lower dollar and pools of capital looking for a home.
Like crude oil or silver, the trading pattern of coffee futures is closely linked to the U.S. dollar. When the greenback falls, the commodities priced in dollars rise, as producers seek to recoup their costs in revalued local currencies. This month's recent pullback in prices was mirrored by a rally in the U.S. dollar.
Meanwhile, the U.S. financial system is awash in liquidity as a result of the Federal Reserve's extraordinary "quantitative easing," as much of that money has found a home in commodity markets.
"There is really next to no regulation any more in commodity markets, and that is a real issue," Mr. Rhinehart said. "A lot of money is pouring into commodities because it can't find a better risk/reward equation right now."
But he added that speculators are betting on commodities because of underlying factors, and in the coffee market, that means the inability of producers to keep up with demand growth.
Seeking a solution
The key to avoiding the peak coffee scenario is boosting productivity, and many growing countries are attempting to increase yields by replacing old coffee trees with disease- and pest-resistant varieties.
Brazil is one country that has succeeded in raising production in recent years, as its coffee production comes from larger, more mechanized flat-land farms. But in Africa and Central America, coffee producers remain under pressure. In Colombia, the Coffee Growers Federation has established a loan program to encourage its 553,000 members to rejuvenate their fields by cutting back old plants and replanting with disease-resistant varieties.
Even as Colombian producers struggle to boost production, they are working to meet the changing demands of global coffee consumers, who increasingly want high-quality "specialty" grades and certifications like the "fair trade" socio-economic seal or the Rainforest Alliance environment program.
Overall demand is growing, but demand for high-end "specialty coffee" is climbing even faster, especially as growing countries like Brazil and Colombia develop a more refined taste for their own product.
Brazil is soon expected to overtake the United States as the largest buyer and Colombians used to joke that you had to leave the country to have a good cup of Colombian coffee, but now Juan Valdez coffee shops are sprouting up in all its major cities.
Canadian coffee drinkers are considered among the more discriminating in the world, in terms of demanding high-quality coffee. Canadian consumption has continued to climb through the recession, while it has been stagnant in major markets like the U.S. and Europe.
Specialty coffee chains like Starbucks and Second Cup are competing with new arrivals like Ottawa's Bridgehead, which boasts that it sells "fairly traded, organic and shade-grown coffees from small-scale farmers," and Vancouver's Forty Ninth Parallel, which emphasizes a gourmet approach to coffee as an "experience for the senses."
But with prices so high, producers are less interested in jumping through the hoops to obtain "fair trade" or Rainforest certificates. Mr. Samper, of the growers' group, said such certifications can be extremely expensive for small growers to maintain and the premiums paid.
Even the higher prices haven't deterred Canadians from indulging in their morning "double double" or non-fat latte. In the past five years, Canadian coffee consumption has climbed 17 per cent, and 40 per cent in the past decade. "That's significant and well out of step with the other traditional importing markets where you are seeing very low rates of growth," said Sandy McAlpine, president of the Coffee Association of Canada.
It's no wonder then that Mr. Villota is looking to expand his sales to Forty Ninth Parallel, which has recently began purchasing his "Quintuple Selection" San Alberto premium coffee. He is also exporting his branded product directly to buyers in South Korea and Sweden.
His family invests heavily in the business - to rejuvenate the crop with new disease-resistant plants, to maintain the use of fertilizers and pesticides, and to expand its marketing including attracting the growing tourist trade with guided visits and a terraced coffee bar with a spectacular view.
But while prices have climbed in U.S. dollar terms, the Colombian peso has climbed dramatically against the dollar, limiting the upside to farmers in their local currency, while yields are down and costs are skyrocketing. As a result, many small growers can't re-invest and Mr. Villota questioned the viability of the 1.8-hectare family farm.
"Even though the price is high in U.S. dollars, they are just surviving," he said. "In my opinion, it is not sustainable for them."
*****
'JUAN VALDEZ'
Before Pablo Escobar came to personify Colombia's deadly cocaine trade, coffee icon Juan Valdez presented North Americans with a more peaceful, even bucolic image of the South American country.
For more than 50 years, "Juan Valdez" has been the face of Colombian coffee - promoting the country's reputation for quality coffee and, more recently, flogging a brand marketed by the National Federation of Colombia Coffee Growers, which represents more than 500,000 producers.
Last month, the iconic farmer - clad as ever in his Panama hat, leather satchel and serape - travelled to Vancouver to launch his brand at a chain of London Drugs stores in the B.C.'s Lower Mainland.
The Colombian delegation - complete with a local stand-in mule for Juan's Conchita - had a number of media interviews, including a radio session at Rock 101 in the downtown TD Tower. Both "Juan" and the mule - which came with its own human pooper scooper - boarded the elevator to the station's 21st floor studio.
On air, the mule brayed on cue, the unilingual Juan Valdez bid a buenos dias to listeners, and the federation's communications director, Luis Fernando Samper, took over the microphone to extol the virtues of Colombia coffee.
The Juan Valdez brand is one of the most valuable in the world. In a 2005 Advertising Week poll, consumers voted the Colombian character the most popular advertising icon in the U.S., outpolling Geico Corp.'s gecko and Ronald McDonald.
Juan Valdez is, in fact, the 1959 brainchild of a Madison Avenue advertising agency to promote Colombia coffee in the U.S. market. The original character was not even Colombian but a Cuban-American actor named Jose Duval.
Previously selling to wholesalers, the federation in 2002 launched its own in-house Juan Valdez brand, first to chain coffee shops and then to retailers. It has also developed a network of Juan Valdez cafes across Colombia.
When Juan II - Colombian Carlos Sanchez - decided to retire in 2006, the federation launched an extensive, two-year search for his replacement from among its legions of coffee farmers.
The process was akin to American Idol, Colombian-style. Hundreds of candidates signed confidentiality agreements, were interviewed, competed in contests, and were encouraged to grow mustaches or dye the gray out of them where necessary.
The winner was Carlos Castaneda, a third-generation coffee grower from Antioquia who farms a 10-hectare plot with his wife and two sons.
Mr. Samper said the new Juan embodies the virtues of honesty, hard work and pride.
"Despite his campesino outfit, Juan Valdez is still relevant to consumers."

Full text:   It's already the biggest auto market in the world - and it's only just begun to realize its potential
jcato@globeandmail.com
China. The doors are officially open. Some might argue they are car doors.
Guo Wei, general manager of the Automobile Sales Centre of Beijing Boruixangyun, certainly thinks so. We're standing in the middle of her Audi dealership in I guess what you'd call suburban Beijing. This store is bustling and buzzing like no car dealership I've ever seen.
Guo Wei, who studied for five years in Montreal and speaks very good English, tells me she expects to sell 3,500 new Audis this year - while servicing as many as 200 a day for matters big and small. A solid Canadian Audi store sells 800 new cars a year.
"Ten thousand? Can I sell 10,000 in a year? Maybe," she says with a huge, broad grin. "I work every day, 24/7. I sleep over there," she says pointing to a second-story apartment across the street, "and come to work every day. Every day. No time off."
With that sort of work ethic, and given China's new-car boom, she just might sell 10,000 a year. Keep in mind, vehicle sales in China soared by 32 per cent to 18.06 million units in 2010, according to data released by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Passenger-car sales in 2010 reached 13.8 million units, 33 per cent ahead of 2009's total. Growth of the vehicle market will be around 10 to 15 per cent this year, CAAM has said.
How big is China's car market? The biggest in the world and it's projected by many in the know to reach 30 million in sales a year by the end of the decade. Some say 30 million by 2020, but others say 40 million.
Yet even if the Chinese market only grows by 10 per cent this year, that's 1.8 million additional units.
These are mind-boggling numbers to a Canadian.
Our new-vehicle market runs between 1.5 million to 1.6 million units sold a year, with about 100,000 of those premium cars. China's premium market is 10 times that and growing.
"China is on its own trajectory," Thomas McGuckin, Pricewaterhouse Cooper's Asia Pacific leader, told just-auto.com. "It's truly breaking away from the rest of the world."
In China, Audi and many other auto makers talk about a lack of capacity to meet demand, as well as a dearth of new-car dealerships. Audi, for instance, is opening a new dealer in China every week and plans to increase the number from about 175 to 400. Other foreign brands, like Ford, are opening dealer networks at a pace of two a week. As for brands, GM unveiled a new China-only brand just recently and Ford is considering the same. So is VW.
"We just can't move fast enough," said Joe Hinrichs, Ford's president of Asia Pacific and Africa, in an interview earlier this year. "It's this incredible mix of opportunities, risks and complexity."
What I saw in China mostly was growth. It's everywhere. New roads, new buildings, new everything. The energy on the streets is electric. Over and over, I heard Chinese workers talk about "getting along with my life." That means moving ahead economically and quickly.
The right to vote? Don't bother trying to discuss that. No one wants to go there. But work, and travel and real estate and consumer goods from cars to big-screen TV and smart phones - my Chinese acquaintances were more than willing to go there in conversation.
After a few days in Beijing, I headed to Changchun, a gritty industrial city of about five million in northeast China. As I stood in front of the first auto factory dedicated by Mao Zedong himself in the early 1950s, I watched a long string of workers in uniforms heading back to work. They were laughing, though clearly disciplined and prepared to work.
That was the old. The new auto industry in China was just a 180-degree pivot away. There facing the old plant is the headquarters of FAW, or First Automobile Works. It represents a joint venture with Volkswagen and its biggest luxury brand, Audi.
The FAW complex is something along the lines of Toyota's Toyota City in Japan. It is massive, a small city unto itself. Hundreds of thousands of new vehicles are built in joint-venture factories every year.
FAW itself is part of the two main blocks of players that define the auto industry in China: on the one hand are the giant Chinese state-owned auto makers that include Shanghai Automotive Industries Corp. (SAIC), partnered with General Motors; on the other are independents such as Geely, which owns Volvo Car Corp.
The joint ventures control about two-thirds of the Chinese market, though China's government would like to see local nameplates control 44 per cent of sales. This drive to create a more independent auto industry stretches the length and breadth of the car business in China and it includes an increasing level of locally based research, development and design expertise. I visited one software design centre where engineers were deeply immersed in refining and testing infotainment systems. These sorts of centres are popping up everywhere.
And it's all quite shocking for a Westerner who arrived in China with biases and preconceptions. I expected to find a country of copycat car designs, where reverse engineering and the theft of intellectual property were commonplace.
Obviously some of that is happening, but what I saw mostly was a country of people committed to growing China's economy and standard of living. Sure, China's government is a totalitarian oligarchy - a leadership committed to economic growth in a climate of suppressed human rights - but the nature of China's government is not something that impacts on the everyday lives of most workers.
Politics and human rights aside, what's happening in China is nothing short of amazing. In the auto industry, we're talking 10 years of feast with no hint of famine. Consider: in 2002, the year the car market suddenly started to accelerate, just-auto.com notes in a report, annual sales reached 1.2 million. Sales were more than 10 times that last year.
The explosive growth brings its own problems. That's why Chinese cities are introducing measures to restrict car sales. The local road infrastructure is struggling to cope with traffic congestion, therefore cities such as Beijing are using lotteries to limit the number of sales each year. China Daily reports that Beijing city authorities announced they would only allow 240,000 new-vehicle registrations this year - roughly one-third of 2010's total.
Here's the problem: the National Bureau of Statistics says China had 79 million cars on its roads in 2009, but officials at China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology predict the roads will need to absorb 200 million cars by 2020.
Many of those cars are built in Changchung, where Audi's FAW joint venture produced A4 sedans and Q5 SUVs for what I was told are status-conscious Chinese consumers. Ownership of an authentic prestige brand such as Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz is a sign of status, I learned. There is also a market for "copy" cars, a just-auto.com report notes. As a result, there is a market for domestic-brand designs that look very similar to real foreign designs - "knock-offs," in the vernacular.
After a week in China, I left convinced the auto industry is real and growing and impressive beyond anything I had imagined. During this decade we're going to see China reshape what has for 125 years a Western-dominated industry. What might just emerge is not merely an eastern or western car business, but a global one.
Astonishing.
*****
THE GREAT STALL OF CHINA
Here's the question: When will Chinese auto makers begin to make a dent in the North American new car market?
We've certainly seen the promise. Chinese manufacturers from Brilliance to Geely, Great Wall and BYD Auto have displayed vehicles at the Detroit and Los Angeles auto shows. We've seen news releases announcing plans to sell China cars in the near future, too. But nothing in dealer showrooms.
Still, the promises. BYD says its plug-in-hybrid car from China is on track to reach the United States in spring 2012. We'll see. We've seen similar promises before.
In 2006, Brilliance said it would start selling its cars in the United States by 2009. None yet.
In 2006, Nanjing Automobile Group, which bought the assets of the bankrupt MG Rover, said it wanted to be the first Chinese car maker to build vehicles in the United States. Nothing so far.
Geely bought Volvo last year, and before that showed small sedans at the 2006 and 2008 Detroit auto shows. But Geely has not yet certified cars to meet North American safety and emissions standards.
The conclusion: it's one thing for established auto makers to break into the Chinese market with joint ventures. It's quite another for Chinese to crack the ultra-competitive North American market, analysts say.
If Chinese car companies hope to sell in North America, experts say they must first determine which part of the market to attack.
Compact cars? Perhaps, but the competition in small cars here is fierce and profit margins are slim.
Gasoline-electric hybrids?
"Because consumers are wary about electric vehicles and their driving range and batteries, they are even more likely to go with more established companies like GM and Nissan," Mike Omotoso of J.D. Power and Associates told the New York Times.
So far, the Chinese auto industry is growing, but it's not yet exporting to North America and may not for some time yet.

The box office has been boffo at the new Theatre District condominiums, a 47-storey tower that will rise from a narrow parking lot next to Toronto's Royal Alexandra Theatre.
Nearly 70 per cent of the units have already been sold in the project just across from Roy Thomson Hall. "It's been remarkable how popular the building has been. It's our fasting selling project ever," says Brad Lamb of Lamb Development Corp., which partnered with Niche Development and Harhay Construction Management Ltd. to develop the infill site.
"There are no other empty parking lots along King Street West, from Parliament to Dufferin. This is the last piece."
Given the premium location of the condominium at 224 King St. W., it will offer several areas that tourists, locals and homeowners can enjoy, such as a treed park with benches, a divot pond and waterfall right off of King Street.
"We created this to allow Roy Thomson to stand out ... and it would also be a meeting place for people going to the theatre or symphony," says Mr. Lamb.
Set further back by the entrance to the 234-unit building, there will be a patio, public bar and lounge with 22-foot-ceilings and windows overlooking the park.
To escape the masses, diners wanting privacy - such as celebrity actors, artists and politicians - can head to a high-end restaurant with elevator-only access and 25-foot ceilings.
"There's no dining facility or bar facility like this," says Mr. Lamb. "We want a world-class dining facility here that would be equivalent to any five-star hotels in New York, Hong Kong, Paris or London."
On the 10th floor, residents will have the privilege of their own fitness and party areas, as well as a rooftop terrace with a pool facing south.
"It has all the trappings that boutique, high-end hotels would have, except the facilities are only accessible to the owners," says Mr. Lamb, who notes that this may not be the case for some hotel-condominium projects nearby.
"The prices are about 40 to 50 per cent less than the prevailing competition in the area."
Some of the best views in the glass tower, which will be playfully bound by white 'ribbons,' will be reserved for owners as most suites start from the 10th floor. "You're higher than any of the buildings in the area," adds Mr. Lamb.
The smallest and largest models are sold, but buyers still have a wide range of two-bedroom plans with or without dens and three bedroom suites.
Typically, plans will have linear and galley kitchens and open principal rooms with nine-foot ceilings, walls of windows and sliding doors to balconies with gas hookups.
European-style kitchen cabinetry, quartz counters and stainless steel appliances will be standard, as well as flooring in engineered wood, porcelain and ceramic tile.
On the highest floors, there will only be two or four units per level. These larger units will have 10-foot ceilings, master bedrooms with private bathrooms and walk-in closets, or even two-sided fireplaces between living and dining areas in some cases.
Monthly fees will be 50 cents per square foot, plus utilities. Parking will cost $39,900 and a locker $4,500.
Occupancy is projected for February, 2014.

Landing on the green in a changing Cuba

Author: Sher, Julian

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/landing-on-green-changing-cuba/docview/868621733/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Novelist Jose Lorenzo Fuentes, who was [Fidel Castro]'s personal correspondent, was ordered one morning in 1962 to a black sedan, where the Communist leader and his economic expert Ernesto ([Che Guevara]) Guevara awaited him. "Fidel looked at me and said, 'Today we're playing golf, and I'm going to give you the headline for your story,'" Mr. Fuentes told Golf.com in 2009. "It will say, 'I could easily beat Kennedy at this game.'"

Full text:   With a plan for a lavish resort built around a spectacular oceanfront golf course, Julian Sher reports, a Montreal company led by a Kahnawake Mohawk is bringing the game Fidel once mocked back to a country anxious to move its tourism industry up-market
As a boy growing up on the Kahnawake Mohawk reserve outside Montreal, Vincent McComber developed a passion for golf at a nearby private course, caddying for duffers such as Jean Chretien. But he could never afford to join a club like that.
Four decades later, Mr. McComber is making up for it: He wants to build a $410-million golf resort in Cuba.
Hoping to finalize a deal this August to create a joint venture with the communist country, Mr. McComber is proposing a 36-hole course, a beachfront hotel, spas, shopping centres - and, in a first for the island, villas owned privately by foreigners.
His company, Standing Feather International, is one of several foreign concerns - including Vancouver real estate developer Leisure Canada - bringing golf back to a country desperate for foreign capital and tourism dollars.
Cuba has not been much of a golf destination since the early days of the revolution, when Fidel Castro and Che Guevara famously donned military fatigues and combat boots to play a round at a Havana course and thumb their noses at the elites their insurrection had defeated.
But this month in Havana, Tourism Minister Manuel Marrero Cruz said the government plans to partner with foreign investors to lure those elites back to the Caribbean country, building luxury golf resorts as part of what the Communist official delicately called "a strategy of diversification."
The prospect of opening Cuba's greens to gringos has foundered more than once before, but Mr. McComber is confident he will be luckier, in part because of his aboriginal roots.
"The Cubans and first nations people view things in the same light," said Mr. McComber, who ran a licensed tobacco retail outlet on a native reserve for years. "We're do-it-yourselfers. Life is hard, but not impossible."
Chris Nicolas, the managing director of Standing Feather, recalls securing his first business contracts with the Cubans two decades ago by waving around Mr. Castro's 1992 speech about native rights on the 500th anniversary of Columbus's "extermination" of the Indians.
"So start buying our stuff," he told them as he marketed native-made software - and it worked.
When the Cubans asked Mr. Nicolas if he knew anything about developing golf courses, he and Mr. McComber reached out to Graham Cooke, a world-renowned golf-course architect from Quebec who has built a number of courses on native land across the country.
Mr. Cooke - an avid amateur golfer who was inducted into the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame last year - was intrigued by the sharp cliffs and panoramic views he saw on trips to the proposed location, near Guardalavaca Beach in eastern Holguin province where Mr. Castro was born.
"It's a great site that has drama with the land itself," he said. "There is still a mystique to Cuba - and this is like a new beginning for a country that needs a tourism boost."
Standing Feather even recruited Mark Entwistle, a former Canadian ambassador to Havana, to promote the project.
Still, negotiations with the Cubans have been arduous and took almost a decade.
"There were many times we felt it would come apart at the seams," said Mr. McComber.
A major sticking point has been the prohibition against the private ownership of land. But last year Cuba instituted a flurry of free-market reforms, including one permitting foreign investors in partnership with Cubans to lease government land for up to 99 years.
That was important, because Standing Feather wants to go beyond resort-based tourism and expand into selling vacation properties to Westerners willing to plunk down capitalist dollars in the socialist paradise.
"We'll be able to offer Caribbean real estate for sale to foreigners in Cuba for the first time in over half a century," said Mr. Nicolas.
Meanwhile, Leisure Canada of Vancouver is also aiming for an upscale tourism market not usually associated with Cuba by building hotels, bungalows and villas linked to three championship golf courses on an oceanfront property between Havana and Varadero.
"We're moving ahead quickly," said president Robin Conners, reached in Havana where he is finalizing plans with his local partners. "The Cubans are very entrepreneurial and astute. They realize these higher-end consumers tend to be more loyal to a destination."
For his part, Mr. McComber, who recently placed second in an amateur tournament on Cuba's single and far-from-fancy existing golf course, has a more personal goal in mind.
He said he eventually expects to get away from Montreal's winter for six months of the year, living on a splendid Caribbean course he can not only play on, but that he partly owns.
"It's the ultimate golfer's dream," he said.

Che's Day
The day Fidel lost to Che
Novelist Jose Lorenzo Fuentes, who was Fidel Castro's personal correspondent, was ordered one morning in 1962 to a black sedan, where the Communist leader and his economic expert Ernesto (Che) Guevara awaited him. "Fidel looked at me and said, 'Today we're playing golf, and I'm going to give you the headline for your story,'" Mr. Fuentes told Golf.com in 2009. "It will say, 'I could easily beat Kennedy at this game.'"
Mr. Castro won the first hole and repeated his boast as the competitive pair moved to the second tee. Soon enough, though, Mr. Guevara overtook his comrade, and all went downhill. "They both tried hard, but Che played with a great passion," said Mr. Fuentes, a former war correspondent who covered some of Mr. Guevara's battles. "In the end, it wasn't very close."
After the round, the president asked Mr. Fuentes what he planned to write. "I said, 'The truth - that Che won.'"
"Make sure you note that Che has more experience [at the game] than me," El Jefe replied.
Mr. Fuentes ended up the real loser of the match. Two days after his story ran in the national newspaper, Mr. Fuentes was demoted to a lower government post. Already persona non grata with the regime, he was imprisoned in 1969 and served a three-year sentence, falsely accused, he said, of working with the CIA.
"The day I was sent to prison was the day I lost faith in the revolution," said Mr. Fuentes, who later moved to Miami. "But looking back, the golf game was an early indication of the government's relationship to the truth."
The fateful day may also explain why golf is significantly less popular in Cuba than baseball. One Havana course was turned into a military academy, the other an art school.

Busting the myths of Vancouver real estate

Abstract: No, say Mr. [Bob Rennie] and other specialists like Mr. [Dale McClanaghan]. But it's the same affordability problem of other large cities, made somewhat worse by the fact that Vancouver doesn't have the kind of room to grow or pro-supply policies that a city such as Calgary does. Both say the region has to keep working on strategies to ensure that middle-range housing continues to get built for the local market of middle-income households.

Full text:   Vancouver: Not really as unaffordable as you think it is.
Also not being bought up by wealthy offshore buyers from China who are speculating on real estate.
That's the anti-conventional-wisdom message that the city's best-known marketing guru, Bob Rennie, is promoting, with numbers to back him up.
Mr. Rennie, who commissions research on real-estate trends for an annual talk to the industry, said that once the skewed prices paid by a small group of mostly mainland Chinese buyers in Richmond and the west side of Vancouver are removed, housing prices are comparatively reasonable. As well, the numbers indicate that only about 1 per cent of those high-end buyers are non-resident investors.
"When you're looking at the numbers, you have to build a fence around the west side, where there are external forces operating that have nothing to do with local forces," Mr. Rennie said.
Yes, he said, the sale prices on those houses have increased dramatically in the past year.
But that top one-fifth of the market operates in its own world and has almost nothing to do with what is happening with real estate in the rest of the region that is connected to the local-buyer market, he said.
Some expressed disbelief in Mr. Rennie's assessment when it was delivered last week.
But people who specialize in housing affordability in the region say their statistics also indicate that the perception of Vancouver's affordability problem is distorted by high prices in some places.
"It's concentrated in a few areas and it's concentrated in single, detached homes," said Dale McClanaghan, a housing consultant who works with local governments to design affordable-housing policies.
Mr. McClanaghan said in an interview this week that while house prices in Richmond and west-side Vancouver increased by 18 per cent last year, according to real-estate board figures, increases in the rest of the region were only about 4 per cent. Apartment-price increases were also low, and prices have declined in some areas.
Does that mean Vancouver doesn't really have an affordability problem at all?
No, say Mr. Rennie and other specialists like Mr. McClanaghan. But it's the same affordability problem of other large cities, made somewhat worse by the fact that Vancouver doesn't have the kind of room to grow or pro-supply policies that a city such as Calgary does. Both say the region has to keep working on strategies to ensure that middle-range housing continues to get built for the local market of middle-income households.
But Mr. Rennie noted the average condo in Metro Vancouver sold for a mere $313,000 last year after the most expensive condos in the top fifth of the market were taken out.
Similarly, single-family homes in the top fifth of the market average $1.72-million. But once those high-end sales are removed from the price-averaging mathematics, home buyers in the rest of the region paid an average of $632,000.

Abstract: "It's a prediction based on what I think is very sound reasoning, and I agree with it," says Brent Toderian, director of city planning for the city of Vancouver. "I think we're going to see a change in globalization because of energy costs. Cities that have preserved their flexible job-space land and lands for industrial uses are going to be the more resilient, successful cities in the future."

Full text:   Once industrial engines, city waterfronts have been colonized by condos, worrying some that urban economies will be stifled
It's the new norm for the waterfronts of Vancouver, Montreal, Toronto and other cities: Lands once used for shipping and industry are morphing into cities of the future, with winding promenades lined by tree-filled parks, lux condos, and buildings occupied by trendy retailers and fashionable offices.
Many argue this is a promising new use of tired, underutilized and highly valued land. With the exit of the manufacturing economy lining the water, why not house the chic information workers of tomorrow there?
Not so fast, say commercial property insiders and urban planners.
With gas prices spiking and businesses seeing bottom lines hit dramatically by transportation costs, a theory abounds - and it is only a theory at this point - that the future will see an increasing need for downtown industrial lands, particularly on waterfronts, as manufacturers and light industrial players seek shorter routes to market for their products.
"It's a prediction based on what I think is very sound reasoning, and I agree with it," says Brent Toderian, director of city planning for the city of Vancouver. "I think we're going to see a change in globalization because of energy costs. Cities that have preserved their flexible job-space land and lands for industrial uses are going to be the more resilient, successful cities in the future."
In Mr. Toderian's view, many cities have surrendered their waterfront industrial lands for mixed use projects (and he's quick to point out that, to a certain extent, Vancouver is the poster child for this phenomenon) without asking a critical question: Is the industrial land really not viable?
"Too many cities are jumping to that conclusion just because it looks like there isn't as much activity on these lands as one might expect," he explains.
"We found through detailed survey work of our industrial lands in Vancouver that they represent a very robust economy."
Mr. Toderian and his team determined that just 10 per cent of Vancouver's downtown land is currently used exclusively for industrial activity, such as manufacturing, warehousing or distribution. And yet the space is responsible for 50 per cent of the city's jobs.
The phenomenon isn't unique to the West Coast. According to Raphael Fischler, director and associate professor of McGill University's School of Urban Planning, Montreal's
Griffintown and other areas along the Lachine Canal have seen major redevelopment in recent years as working-class neighbourhoods with strong industrial footprints have become high-end condo developments, largely thanks to their proximity to the water.
"Local residents were angry that job opportunities were being removed," Mr. Fischler recalls. "It's important for a city to maintain cheaper places where start-ups or smaller companies can actually continue to function without having to go to the suburbs."
Mixed-use waterfronts look better in postcards than gritty industrial ones. And cities gentrifying their waterfronts also hope to increase their tax bases.
Paul Morse, Toronto-based senior managing director of commercial real estate brokerage Cushman and Wakefield Ltd., says industrial buildings typically have a net value of between $5 and $6 per square foot, compared to condominiums that carry values of between $10 and $13 per square foot. That makes the introduction of the latter a more lucrative short-term proposition for city tax departments.
But those figures are deceiving, says Mr. Toderian. "You can't and shouldn't chase higher taxes because with residential and mixed-use comes higher demand for the services that taxes pay for."
Joe Berridge, a partner with Toronto-based urban planning consultancy Urban Strategies Inc., says Toronto has maintained a commercial presence on its waterfront with the introduction of Corus Entertainment's new headquarters there, as well as a new campus for George Brown College, while still preserving an active industrial presence at the iconic Redpath Sugar refinery and in the port-lands area to the east.
It's in those highly-industrialized eastern port lands that he says provide evidence of companies in some industries which have opted to stay close to downtown to shorten their supply routes. In this case, he says, concrete manufacturers have set up shop there to put themselves within close proximity of the city's numerous condo and commercial developments.
He's quick to note, however, that industry hasn't necessarily been chased from waterfronts such as Toronto's, but rather left in search of better transportation routes in the suburbs and a closer proximity to the 400-series highways.
Although Mr. Berridge isn't convinced gas prices will have significant impact on where industry wants to situate itself in the future, he agrees that an industrial footprint will remain vital to Toronto's commercial mix and should be maintained to preserve jobs in the downtown core. Still, he sees that industrial complexion evolving to better suit the city's needs, with more recycling and construction-material supply firms continuing to establish their presence in Toronto's eastern waterfront.
"I think you're likely to see that contingent of people continue to be at the back of the waterfront and there's no inconsistency with having that and condos, parks and office buildings and universities in the more public parts," Mr. Berridge says.
According to Mr. Morse, demand for industrial space on Toronto's waterfront remains as robust as ever as more light industry seeks downtown space.
"There's a real need for light industrial warehouse, distribution and storage space," he says. "We have two industrial listings for 20 acres of land for sale and there's significant interest from investors in the area."
In Vancouver, areas such as the Southeast False Creek Flats and South Vancouver Industrial Lands have seen a recent influx of green manufacturers producing environmentally-friendly components such as hydrogen fuel cells and solar panels, according to Mr. Toderian. He adds that industry arrived in search of three things: Cheap land, cheap taxes and cheap building costs.
As he puts it, commercial developers and many downtown residents need to change their view of what industrial space means to a city. "In the context of this incredibly strategically important land, it's the residential that's the nuisance, not the industrial," he says. "The job space is critical to our sustainable, complete city model."

Full text:   Ranks as third most expensive in English-speaking cities, topped only by Hong Kong, Sydney
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Surging real estate prices in Vancouver are pushing ownership costs into uncharted territory, putting it in the top ranks of the world's most expensive cities and triggering fears the market is poised for a fall.
Housing costs for the average two-storey home in Vancouver today eat up the equivalent of 80 per cent of a typical family's annual pretax income, according to new research, putting ownership out of reach for most.
The last time housing accounted for such a high percentage of household income in the city was in 2008, just before prices tumbled in a recessionary swoon. The city's real estate market has since recovered and gone on to set new records, but the recent climb has market watchers worried that the gains are unsustainable.
Across the country, homeowners are putting a larger portion of their earnings toward their homes, and interest-rate increases are likely to put further pressure on homeowners in the coming months, the Royal Bank of Canada said in its quarterly affordability index.
The problem is especially pronounced in Vancouver, where the bank estimated families must now dedicate 72 per cent of their household income to pay the mortgage, property taxes and utilities on a bungalow. In Toronto, it would take 47.5 per cent.
With so much income tied to housing costs and some homeowners forced to take out home equity to cover living expenses or utilize other forms of credit, Royal Bank of Canada warned the Vancouver market is "becoming increasingly disconnected from local demand conditions and vulnerable to a painful correction."
"What's happened this year in British Columbia is puzzling," said Robert Hogue, an economist at the RBC. "The increases we are seeing just aren't justified by market fundamentals. I feel like this is something we have to flag."
The average home price in the Vancouver area was $622,991 in April. That's 5-per-cent higher than April, 2010, as the sale of multimillion-dollar homes boosted the average.
The city now has the third-highest housing costs in English-speaking cities worldwide, according to the Frontier Centre for Public Policy, with only Hong Kong and Sydney more expensive. That means people in Vancouver direct more of their money to housing costs than people in London or New York.
"This is money that households do not have for purchasing other goods and services, the result of which can be to diminish job creation and growth in commercial sectors, such as retailing," said Joel Kotkin, who authored the study for the organization.
But even as economists worry, houses continue to sell briskly in the Vancouver area.
When Terry Vato listed a two-storey house in Burnaby late last month, he knew the sticker price would attract hundreds of prospective buyers. At just under a million dollars, the 87-year-old, four-bedroom home was a bargain compared to houses 20 minutes away in Vancouver, the Re/Max Central agent said. He was right. A week and one open house later, the property sold for $1.5-million - 50-per-cent more than the owners were asking.
"Some people hear this and say 'Wow, what a crazy price,'" he said. "But I think the new buyers will do very well in coming years. This area has been undervalued."
The bank's affordability index shows the proportion of median pre-tax household income required to pay the principal and interest on a mortgage, property taxes and utilities. The figures assume a 25-per-cent down payment and a 25-year loan at a five-year fixed rate.

Full text:   Councillor Mihevc wants to commemorate the city's past with castle-based exhibits sure to leave no tourist undazzled
This week, the City of Toronto announced a historic deal to reshape Casa Loma into a tourist attraction that will, in the words of Councillor Joe Mihevc, "tell the story of Toronto." At last, tourists can partake in this city's gripping history and bask in its captivating character. Herewith, a sneak peek at some of the attractions coming to a big medieval castle near you.
Upper Canadian Rebel Without a Cause
Located in the Oak Room, this incredibly realistic historical experience lets visitors take part in Toronto's most thrilling act of political insurrection. The place: Montgomery's Tavern, 1837, scene of the Upper Canada Rebellion. You are a disgruntled youth fed up with the governing Tories, who have ignored reformist grievances for too long. All day, you sip pints of flat ale and listen to your leader, William Lyon MacKenzie, fulminate against the colonial oppressors.
Join MacKenzie's unruly throng as they gather for their march down Yonge Street. Smell the puffs of gun smoke as Sheriff William Botsford Jarvis fires his artillery, then join in the full-fledged panic as the rebellion suffers its first of a string of ignominious defeats.
100 Years of a Toronto Kitchen
Situated on the second floor, this two-room diorama with wax figures shows the same midtown kitchen separated by a century, thus telling story of a city, its people, and the food they love.
In the 1911 kitchen, a family eats boiled salt pork and carrots while an Irish maid scrubs pots and pans. See the plucked snow goose sitting on the counter? That's being saved for Thursday, when the Reverend Atkinson is visiting.
The 2011 kitchen, by contrast, is a modern-day fantasy of Italian cabinetry, German appliances and granite counters - only the placement of the window remains from 1911. A young girl in a private-school uniform, whose parents are at a fundraiser, sits at a counter and stares at a flat-screen TV. A Filipina housekeeper microwaves an organic frozen lasagna.
The Christie Pits Riot - In 3-D!
On August 16, 1933, as the final out was called in a baseball game between Harbord and St. Peter's, a flag bearing a swastika was unfurled, thus kicking off what one local newspaper dubbed one of the "worst free-for-alls ever seen in the city," featuring Jews and Italians on one side and "Anglos" on the other. This specially made 3-D film - screened every 20 minutes in the Conservatory - is replete with clenched fists and broken bottles whizzing past your head while recreating a lost Toronto of flappers, hep cats and pre-MMA punches to the head, a bygone era when it was still possible to be white and a visible minority all at the same time.
Eighties Toronto: The Video Game
Too young to remember Toronto before it was the T-Dot? Then enter the Windsor Room and try your hand at the arcade video-game sensation that brings the eighties to life for the iPhone generation.
You are standing in Remy's drinking a bottle of Molson Dry when your analogue Motorola flip phone rings. Score 1,000 points for yelling, "Buy more shares!" before snapping it shut. A blond Cantel sales rep in a black miniskirt accepts your invitation to dinner - 2,000 points. You drive your white Ferrari Testarossa to Yonge and Eglinton - 5,000 points - where you order the poached skate wing in cilantro vinaigrette at Centro - another 5,000 points. You go to the bathroom to snort coke - new high score! - but when you return your date is at the bar flirting with Gary Leeman - lose 10,000 points. You go to the bathroom to do more coke and miss a call from your real-estate agent, who's calling to tell you the condo market is tanking. Game over.

Full text:   Georgian Bay dwelling was reconstructed from the ground up using wood from a 19th-century barn in Streetsville
THE LISTING
Asking price: $1.050-million
Taxes: $3,797
Square Footage: 2,000
Lot Size: Approximately two acres, with a 285-foot frontage shouldering Crown land.
Agent: Lisa-Marie Doorey, Sotheby's Realty Canada
The back story
About 20 years ago, Mark Ferguson took a country drive around Streetsville and discovered an old 19th century barn that had recently been put up for sale.
With his wife Diane, the local businessman purchased the 1846 farmstead for $10,000, with the thought of using the hand-hewn timbers for a cottage on a piece of land he owned on Georgian Bay, a 20-minute boat ride from Honey Harbour. To do it, he hired area Mennonites to dismantle the barn that they would later reconstruct according to its original design once the wood was transported by land and water to Cognashene.
Assisting this team of barn experts were school friends of Mr. Ferguson, each of whom had likewise purchased land on Georgian Bay after falling in love with the area following a teenaged trip they had all taken there, together.
"To me it's a Big Chill story," says agent Lisa-Marie Doorey, who has photos of the men spending their weekends resurrecting the barn as a family cottage on a forested lot with views of the lake. "These guys grew up together as kids. Georgian Bay is where they still meet up."
What's new
The house this community of friends built is spacious enough to accommodate them all. Built by hand from the ground up, it features a large custom reclaimed pine kitchen with a 9 by 5-foot granite island, a great room that easily seats 20 at the dining room table, a 30 by 9-foot screened-in porch and two tiered sun decks overlooking the beach and bay.
Best feature
This property is beautiful, both in terms of its location and the craftsmanship that has gone into giving this newly built recreational property a feeling of history and home. Identifying a single best feature here is like being forced to choose a favourite colour in a Georgian Bay sunset. But ask Mr. Ferguson and he says it's the dry-laid stone fireplace that tugs most at his heart.
"It's made from rocks from Pointe au Baril [in nearby Muskoka], and put together without mortar. We asked the person who made it for us to make it look like it had been built in the 1800s, and it does. It's definitely the focus of gatherings of friends and family. We'll be really sad to sell it."
Why sell a dream project?
"We've found another parcel of land," Mr. Ferguson says. "We loved doing this one so much we want to build again."

LISTING AGENT
Lena Preje, Re/Max Ultimate Realty Inc.
The Action: Just over a two month period, there were quite a few visitors to this custom residence in North York.
What They Got: About four years ago, a local builder bought a bungalow on a 135-by-200-foot ravine lot and constructed a pair of two-storey homes. Some land was also given away to expand the adjacent conservation area.
* A 63-by-185-foot plot was allocated for this luxury residence, which the builder occupied, complete with five bedrooms, six bathrooms and multiple entertaining areas with walkouts to a south-facing yard and flagstone patio.
* The main floor is bright with pot lights and large windows in the dining room and fireside living and family rooms, as well as skylights and walkouts to a party-sized deck off the eat-in kitchen.
* Upstairs, the largest bedroom features coffered ceilings, one of four gas fireplaces and a six-piece bathroom.
The Agent's Take: "It's a very family-oriented street where most people have children and dogs," says agent Lena Preje. "The park is just steps from this house and it's a very quiet street with no traffic, so it's child-safe."
Other assets include the home's "ravine view" and grand appointments, such as a spacious walk-in closet in the master suite. "It's the size of a master bedroom in a downtown condo."

A client once told me that they could hardly remember how long their project took to complete, or even how much they'd actually spent, but they loved the result. Now that the cottage I built for my family is finally done, I can tell you, I definitely know how painfully long it's taken - and every single penny I've spent! I set myself a $1-million budget for the three buildings and docks; it has cost over $1.5-million.
I also have vivid memories of moving the furniture across the lake on two barges in a cold rain. The six movers were a great crew, though there was some grumbling about empty stomachs. Maybe I should have packed them all a lunch - and brought some dry socks. I just smiled and asked who was in charge. Surprise - I was! I just told myself: I've got to keep positive.
I suppose that's true of the whole project. The process of designing, building and decorating the cottage on an island in Stoney Lake has been a long but ultimately rewarding journey. It may have taken longer and cost more than I first thought, but in the end I achieved the level of quality I wanted and the functionality I required, and I feel truly satisfied. I stood out in the rain overlooking the rocky, pine tree-dotted landscape now sprinkled with new blue buildings and I could have broken out in song: "I am Woman, Hear me Roar!"
The new cottage feels like a breath of fresh air. The interiors are a sparkling bright white, which makes my furniture pop and complements the deep blue trim of the windows and doors. The blue lake and the 360-degree views truly take your breath away. Each time I visit, I almost have to pinch myself.
So why did it take longer than planned to get to this point? For one thing, I was without my usual crew, the time-tested professionals I count on to execute my projects in the city. But I also had to contend with the slower pace of things in cottage country. Up here, getting help in ice fishing season is like trying to round up workers in Toronto during the World Cup.
But going in, I knew some of the problems I might face. The fact that the property was located on an island was certain to complicate the project, and milder than normal temperatures might interfere as well - we were counting on being able to drive to and from the building site over the frozen lake for most of the winter. Sure enough, mild weather cut into our schedule. I also increased the level of detail in the interiors which again slowed our progress.
And what caused my budget to max out?
Well, I am a firm believer in investing in design and materials; if you spend more now, you won't have to rip it out and start again later. I also know that compromises have to be made and that you can't always spend your budget at will.
In cottage country, you're pretty much at the mercy of the local trades. They are crucial during construction, but you will continue to have to count on them for maintenance and emergencies. You've got to think ahead to that fluke storm years from now when you'll have to make a late-night call to a local tradesperson to go and check the cottage. It's in your own interests to keep relationships positive and make sure that when you need to make that panicked call there's someone who will answer the phone.
It is hard to control costs in that kind of a dependent situation. I'm not naive - this is my second cottage at Stoney Lake and I know I'm seen as a city person. I'm treated differently. But it's important to look at the scope of work and the context. At the end of the day, everyone shakes hands and is proud of the job done.
A perfect example is my kitchen countertops. The massive island that our millwork company constructed had to be built in three parts. As the job grew more complicated and detailed, it became clear that the amount of Caesarstone required was becoming too costly. At that moment, I realized that my main contractor was planning on bringing in his fabricator from the city anyways. So to make the gorgeous island more wallet-friendly, I brought in my guys from the city and used a more affordable Bianco Carrara.
Even though we have now moved in and are ready to enjoy the cottage this summer, I know that I will be evaluating certain elements of the cottage and will add more details down the road. Take the pergola for instance. Right now the heavy stone columns and douglas fir beams provide a structured yet airy feel. I may toy with the idea of thickening up its presence with added purlins. I really can't help myself - I only know it is done when my eyes tell me so.
The window treatments are another unfinished project. The views are just so beautiful that I could not bring myself to cover them up just yet. Maybe I'll take a cue from my mother who loves to live with the "living landscape," as she calls it.
But right now, I can take a moment to sit back and enjoy my new summer home and be thankful for the opportunity to create a lasting legacy for my children, a fifth generation at Stoney Lake. Then, it's back to work. There's the landscaping to attend to, then there's the boathouse to fine tune, and then, well, we'll see.

Full text:   Deerhurst Resort's Summit Lodges may be an inexpensive way to own a piece of local history
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
Sometimes, the Muskoka mystique becomes tangible: Jagged slanted rocks, sparse tall trees bending in the wind, and a pungent forest scent all come together at once. That's why generations have come here, and why the Group of Seven painted its pleasures more than any other; in fact, the Group almost called themselves "The Algonquin School."
When the Group of Seven had their first exhibition in 1920, the lodge that would become Deerhurst Resort had been in operation for almost a quarter century. Opened in 1896 by Englishman Charles W. Waterhouse on a four-acre site on Peninsula Lake, it sported 18 bedrooms and a smoking lounge. Under the stewardship of two more generations of the Waterhouse family, it would continue to grow until it boasted 780 acres by the 1990s. While much altered, that original lodge building - where Shania Twain got her start in the 1980s - still stands.
Because of the slow expansion, a decision to add private condominium residences to the mix (starting in the 1970s), various ownership changes over the past two decades, and the piecemeal selloff of small parcels of land to private developers, Deerhurst possesses an organic, haphazard charm that a built-at-once resort could never provide. Which is why, when ownership changed yet again to Gil Blutrich's Toronto-based Skyline Hotels & Resorts a few months ago, there was reason for trepidation.
Deerhurst works, in my opinion, because it doesn't feel too planned or obsessively manicured. While there are two top-notch golf courses and a pavilion large enough to hold an indoor swimming pool, two restaurants and the G8 Summit, there are also forested areas and rough-looking buildings in need of paint. It's where you drag a Muskoka chair to the water's edge rather than being told where to sit. And my guess is people like it that way.
A few weeks ago, I met with Skyline sales and marketing director Harley Nakelsky. Whether walking through the pavilion or driving to the various sites (such as the private airstrip or the sugar shack where they make their own maple syrup), that Deerhurst is unique because of these qualities kept coming up in conversation; when Mr. Nakelsky spoke of a future indoor waterpark or the recently opened outdoor paintball area, he stressed that these (ad)ventures were meant to add variety to the roster rather than being quick money-making schemes. When talking of possible expansion, it was on out-of-the-way lots near the Highlands golf course rather than at the more valuable water's edge.
Perhaps most interesting is Skyline's plan to transform the five, pre-existing "Sport Villa" buildings - just steps away from the main pavilion - into private, fully furnished condominiums. Not only are these where the G8 leaders hung their hats last summer, the 120 units (each approximately 550 square feet) already have fireplaces and private decks.
Starting at $149,900, it's an inexpensive way to own a private piece of Muskoka history. "No one believes that it's whole ownership," said Mr. Nakelsky of the newly christened Summit Lodges. "I still get people who register at our website and say the same thing: 'This is time-share, right?'"
Although some of the suites were renovated for the G8 leaders last summer, even those will be redone by The Design Agency to reflect a more traditional Muskoka vibe. Barnboard headboards and bedside driftwood lamps in bedrooms and woodsy graphic wallpaper, casual furniture and chunky log tables in living rooms will encourage a more relaxed pace. In the currently empty, cavernous three-storey atrium in each building (where I'm told 1970s and 80s hot tub parties used to take place) there will be an amenities space with a large dining area and prep kitchen; on the other side of a floor-to-ceiling, double-sided fireplace a lounge area will be set up.
If that weren't enough, purchasers will be automatically enrolled into Skyline's "Skylife" rewards program, which offers discounts at other Skyline properties, including Horseshoe and downtown Toronto's Cosmopolitan and Pantages hotels.
Since I've never been much of a camper or cottager, this no-fuss escapism appeals to me: I'm at a resort but I can paddle someplace Group of Sevenish if the mood strikes, and if I need more civilization than Deerhurst's restos, bars and spa can offer, I'm only a few minutes from Huntsville. "You're not buying a cabin in the woods," agrees Mr. Nakelsky. "You're right in the centre of everything, but it kind of feels like you're in a cabin." A cabin with cable TV, natch, and when I'm in the city the unit makes money via the rental program. It's ready-made Muskoka for busy urbanites, without the angry bears.
Despite the increase in tourism and development, Muskoka, to me anyway, seems perpetually trapped somewhere between 1920 and 1950. Here, the Canadian Shield acts as chastity belt to thwart overzealous developers, which is why it continues to win accolades: National Geographic recently ranked it at the top of its "10 Best Summer Trips of 2011" list.
As a result, it will continue to offer the kind of quiet solitude that painters and poets use to feed their muses for generations to come.

Full text:   The Frits de Vries-designed, LEED Platinum-certified home of builder Nick Kerchum is a first for Western Canada
On an unsuspecting part of West 21st Avenue, a few blocks from Vancouver's Endowment Lands, Western Canada's first LEED Platinum-certified house basks in the spring sunshine. But the custom-built green home, designed by Frits de Vries for Natural Balance Home Builders founder Nick Kerchum, radiates an understated beauty. It's clean modernist lines distinguish it from surrounding arts-and-crafts style homes with their pitched roofs and gables, and yet with its perfectly proportioned massing and scale, it feels right at home in the Dunbar neighbourhood.
The house has won multiple awards including the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC), Award of Excellence, Green Building, Honourable Mention; it was the 2010 National SAM Award winner, Green Home Category (Awarded by the Canadian Home Builder's Association) and the 2010 Georgie Award Finalist in three categories (nominated by the Canadian Home Builder's Association of British Columbia).
But for the 32-year-old Kerchum, it functions as a home office, a show home for his company, as well as the first residence for his young family. It's also a model for many young people like Mr. Kerchum, who grew up in the neighbourhood, and want to come home again, not to fusty 80-year-old houses full of nooks and crannies, but to open, modern spaces.
"It's a funny thing," muses Mr. de Vries, who emigrated from Holland several decades ago to marry a Canadian, "that in Vancouver people are accustomed to modernist design downtown, but when they come home, their expectation is for traditional arts and crafts-style homes."
But what Mr. de Vries and Mr. Kerchum have created here is a beautifully crafted home whose open, flexible and streamlined spaces are well suited to the modern family. "Some people think that building green means giving up on style and design, and living in a box" says Mr. Kerchum, who became a builder after studying international relations at UBC and marrying a fellow student from Uzbekistan. "But our whole approach is about harmony between form and function. In the end, its about experiencing the space."
The house is inviting as you approach the entrance, the slightly graded site offering a welcoming path inside and introducing the subtle interplay of textures and levels that permeates the design. The front façade is a mix of reclaimed granite from an old Thirties-era downtown bank, stained cedar soffits that allow light in during the winter and provide shade in the summer, stucco, and aluminum-clad wood framed glazing. Solar hot water heating tubes peek out from an upper-floor balcony, and everything is oriented and designed for passive solar usage. Everywhere landscaping (irrigated by collected rainwater and designed by Claire Kennedy) blends native, drought resistant plants and long grasses with pine and Japanese maple trees that offer shading and privacy to the triple glazed high performance windows.
The first floor is dominated by a large living/dining area, offset by a front room that could function as a home office space or guest room. The indoor/outdoor aesthetic is key here as north-facing, 12-foot glazing brings in views of the backyard, garden and mountains, while south-facing windows bring in light. To achieve the seamless effect - a blending of indoor and outdoor space and materials like walnut flooring morphing into heat absorbing basalt tiles - was no mean feat, explains Mr. De Vries. "Designing modern spaces means that everything has to be perfectly aligned - if not mistakes are more glaring than in a more traditional design where you can hide them with ornament or mouldings," he says.
But the overall effect is one of intimacy. "Having one big space, rather than separate rooms or alcoves" Mr. Kerchum says, "means the family comes together more. "And flexibility is key - especially since the original plans did not anticipate the birth of Kerchum's one-year-old daughter. Yet her large playpen filled with stuffed animals now delineates the dining and living areas quite naturally.
Some safety features - like glazing in the open light-filled floating stairwells leading to the upper levels - were necessary, of course. And an upstairs room overlooking the backyard - originally envisioned as an Uzbek-style room full of floor cushions - was quickly converted to a changing table/nap area. Otherwise, the open spaces and flat surfaces, not to mention the natural non-toxic materials, make this the perfect baby-makes-three abode.
Mr. De Vries' clever interplay of levels - the west side of the house has three floors while the east side has four - creates a dynamic sense of movement. It also allows for a stunning roof deck on the west side, that takes in views of the surrounding forest and a more distant one of the city. Throughout, he juxtaposes open and airy spaces with more private areas, connected by the central stairwell.
A basement with a separate entrance - which could eventually become a tenanted apartment since neighbourhood bylaws have recently changed - now functions as the HQ of Natural Balance. It feels much bigger than its 800 square feet, partly because a south-facing, deep-set patio brings in light and absorbs heat with a Mediterranean flair.
But it's the north-facing elevation that really brings it all together. Here, a zigzagging effect is created by the split levels, framed by the interplay of steel and stucco and given textural body by three roof gardens. Although the house is grounded in the local by West Coast elements like cedar and indigenous greenery, it has the feel of an international modernist villa, whose flexible spaces could work in many different environments.
"What we're trying to do here," says Mr. Kerchum, who is working on a number of projects with Mr. de Vries, "is lead by example." The two anticipated that bylaws would change on secondary suites, for instance, when building the basement, and the roof gardens, only recently allowed by city planners, required careful negotiation.
"We're trying to be on the cutting edge," explains Mr. Kerchum. And in design conservative yet naturally beautiful Dunbar, the two have done an impeccable job of creating a residence that is both ingeniously green and surprisingly stylish.

Mortgage rules take wind out of house sales

Full text: Homes sold sink 14% after Ottawa ends 35-year amortizations as a financing option, leaving first-time buyers with bigger payments
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
The Canadian Real Estate Association blamed new mortgage rules for taking first-time buyers out of the market, as it reported sales slipped 14 per cent in April from a year ago.
The new rules brought in by the federal government, which took effect at the end of March, eliminated 35-year amortizations as a financing option. The trade association said that likely caused people to beat the change as they looked to lock in lower monthly payments.
"Changes to mortgage regulations that took effect in April, 2011, likely sidelined a number of first-time home buyers," said Gregory Klump, the association's chief economist.
CREA said seasonally adjusted sales activity decreased 4.4 per cent in April from March. The declines were largest in the more expensive markets such as Toronto and Vancouver.
The national average price for homes sold in April 2011 was $372,544, up 8 per cent from the same month last year. That's a slight gain of 0.33 per cent from March's $371,286.
The association said comparisons with April, 2010, are difficult because of "several transitory factors artificially boosting sales" in that month.
"This included the impending tightening of mortgage rules, speculation about higher interest rates and the looming introduction of the HST in some provinces. This year, additional measures to tighten mortgage rules were implemented in March and the other transitory factors were absent," Mr. Klump said. "This makes it difficult to compare the two months in order to reliably gauge the impact of the latest round of mortgage rule changes."
BMO Nesbitt Burns economist Robert Kavcic said that once the one-time distortions are taken out of the equation, the pace of sales and the price gains are running close to the historical average.
"These statistics exaggerate the year-over-year declines," he said. "The market is very balanced, once you smooth things out. If you look at sales versus new listings, we're bang on the long-run average for Canada right now."
That ratio stood at 56.5 per cent in March, which is considered balanced territory by economists because the balance of buyers and sellers is fairly equal.
"Based on [the ratio], more than half of local markets in Canada could be considered balanced in March, with two-thirds of the remaining markets considered to be as sellers' markets," CREA said.
Meanwhile, the number of houses for sale remained unchanged in April, at 5.6 months. That's how long it would take to sell all of the houses, at the current rate of sales.
"Almost half of all local markets saw the number of months of inventory shrink compared to the previous month," CREA said.
The report of slower sales comes about a week after the association raised its annual forecast for 2011, saying strength in Vancouver would buttress the national average sale price and that sales across the country have been stronger than expected.
The association said the average national resale price will gain 4 per cent by the end of the year because of high prices in Vancouver. CREA also added that sales would also be stronger than it expected in 2011, although still slower than 2010.

Abstract: Analysts are ranked according to how well the stocks they pick perform against a benchmark for their industry. To do the comparisons, StarMine creates a portfolio for each analyst based on his or her recommendations. For each "buy" recommendation, the portfolio is one unit long the stock and simultaneously one unit short the benchmark.

Full text: GMP's Ryan Savage wins StarMine's award for his timely picks in the large-cap international energy sector
INVESTMENT REPORTER
In just over a decade, Ryan Savage transformed himself from an Australian surfer dude into Canada's top stock picker during 2010.
His journey began when the native of Cochrane, Alta., took a year off to travel after first-year studies at the University of Calgary and reached a peak with several smart picks in the oil and gas sector last year.
Mr. Savage follows large-capitalization international stocks in the energy sector for GMP Securities LP, where he landed almost two years ago after several years in research at TD Securities Inc. During 2010, his picks delivered a better return against his benchmark than those of any other analyst, winning him recognition as the top stock picker in the 2011 StarMine Analyst Awards.
StarMine, a service of Thomson Reuters, recognizes top analysts in several categories. In addition to honouring the 10 top stock pickers, it celebrates 10 analysts for being tops in earnings estimate accuracy. Others are recognized for stock picking and earnings estimate accuracy in different industry sectors.
Mr. Savage's ride to the top is not as circuitous as it might sound. More than two decades ago he started studying stocks and market patterns in his high-school library. He decided that working in equities one day would make for "a cool job."
When he went travelling after his first year of university, Mr. Savage wound up in Australia and after several months of enjoying sun and surfing, decided to enroll at Bond University in Robina, Queensland, where he earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree. He had planned to stay in Australia's surfer's paradise after graduation, but a Canadian romance brought him back home to Calgary, where he joined a small accounting firm and later a boutique investment firm.
At 33 years old, Mr. Savage is one of the younger equity analysts in Canada and his clear assessment of what it takes to be good at the job probably helped his rapid rise: a passion for numbers, a competitive spirit, high energy, the ability to thrive in a stressful environment and a respect for others - especially veterans of the industry.
"If you're not a competitive person, this industry is just not for you," he says. "In equities, the classic battle between bulls and bears defines the market."
To win, Mr. Savage works 70-hour weeks and immerses himself in numbers, starting with a company's financials and extending to the economics of specific countries, their tax policies and political situations. His research involves endless reading. It also involves travel to remote areas of the world.
"You must go and see the country and see the assets and get a feel for what's going on on the ground. Everyone says oil and gas is below the ground. But what you want to see is how far away these sites are from infrastructure, how difficult it is to get the trucks in," he says.
A while back in Tajikistan, Mr. Savage sat down for a mid-afternoon lunch with village leaders. His Western appearance was a novelty for some of the locals as he tried to understand the relationship between a big energy company and the regional leaders. "Do they perceive Western encroachment as positive, do they want a share in it? ... I want to get a feel for where their heads are," he explains.
International energy plays offer diversification for North American investors and the opportunity for some huge wins, especially with new technology being used to tap existing sites. But the sector carries many risks. "You can nail it and get multibagger returns, or you can miss and see some horrible returns," he says. "I've had plenty of sleepless nights in my time. It's an intense job."
Mr. Savage goes into overdrive calculating not just financials but also data to reflect what he calls "qualitative risk." These risks can include a country's political climate and a region's track record for supporting foreign investment.
Early last year he pushed hard at GMP for investment in Colombia. One of his top picks was Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp., a Toronto-based firm that produces oil and gas in the South American country.
It was a tough sell. Colombia faced a federal election and the possibility of an ultra-left party getting elected. So Mr. Savage's analysis included popular sentiment in the country and various scenarios around taxes and royalties under different governments. At the end of the year, Pacific Rubiales had an annual gain of 124 per cent.
Looking forward, he thinks China and India will wield huge influence as they seek security of supply, and Canada's oil sands remains a key target for them both.
Generally, the tipping point where investors will question a lot of the international projects Mr. Savage follows is when the price of a barrel of oil dips to about $70 (U.S.) or $75, he says.
With oil prices still close to $100 a barrel, "for new projects the economics are potentially pretty robust," he says. "But the thing you do have to watch is with a high commodity price environment, what happens if the commodity turns against you. There can be huge swings."

THE METHODOLOGY
The annual StarMine analyst awards for Canada are part of a global program that spans 15 regions, including Canada, the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Asia and Australia.
Thomson Reuters' StarMine rates equity analysts by measuring their performance based on the return of their stock recommendations and the accuracy of their earnings estimates.
Analysts are ranked according to how well the stocks they pick perform against a benchmark for their industry. To do the comparisons, StarMine creates a portfolio for each analyst based on his or her recommendations. For each "buy" recommendation, the portfolio is one unit long the stock and simultaneously one unit short the benchmark. The result gives the analyst credit for the amount by which the stock outperformed the benchmark. "Strong Buys" get a larger investment of two units long the stock and two units short the benchmark. "Holds" invest one unit in the benchmark, for an excess return of zero. "Sells" are the reverse: long the benchmark and short the stock. "Strong Sells" get a larger investment of two units long the benchmark and two short the stock.
To qualify for an award, analysts must beat the benchmark for their industry. They also must have covered at least five stocks in a given industry. If an industry has fewer than 15 stocks, an analyst must have covered a minimum of three stocks or one-third of the stocks in the industry, whichever is greater.
The 2011 awards for Canada are based on the 2010 calendar year. For a full list of all winners and more on the methodology, please visit tgam.ca/starmine

Full text: 'Go west' policy is expanding economic activity away from coast in inland mountain city of Chongqing
ASIA-PACIFIC REPORTER
Chongqing has a serious taxi problem.
Join the queue at one of this bustling city's taxi stands and you could wait as long as an hour for a hack.
Residents say most taxi drivers are new to the region and stick to areas they know or close to where they live - creating a dearth of cabs in the pricey downtown core.
But there needs to be a lot more than taxi drivers flocking to Chongqing. An explosion of manufacturing and construction activity draws as many as 500,000 new residents to the inland mountain city each year. The municipality of Chongqing covers an area the size of Switzerland, and is by some estimates now the largest in the world, boasting a population close to 33 million people.
Welcome to the boomtown.
The strong growth in rural and inland areas such as Chongqing is a crucial element to China's continued economic success. While coastal regions have been the main drivers of growth for the past two decades, their expansion is slowing and so-called second and third-tier cities in the interior must pick up the slack. As policy makers attempt to rebalance China's economy to become more driven by domestic consumption, income levels in the less developed but heavily populated west will need to rise.
Chongqing is undergoing a radical transformation from a dusty industrial outpost to a city brimming with opportunity. The shift began in 1997 when the region was carved out of Sichuan province as a standalone municipality and economic zone under control of the central government.
Under the leadership of the ambitious and controversial local Communist Party secretary Bo Xilai, Chongqing has cracked down on crime and corruption and slashed corporate taxes in the municipality to 15 per cent in a bid to attract business.
Upgrades to the city's logistics infrastructure have spurred a gaggle of foreign and Chinese companies to set up operations in the city where the Yangtze and Jialing rivers meet.
Spiking labour costs in China, caused in part by a shortage of migrant workers in the traditional manufacturing hub coastal cities, is proving a boon for Chongqing. Businesses here can draw on a massive labour pool, not only from Chongqing, but also from the 80 million people living next door in Sichuan province.
Labour costs in Chongqing are (at least for now) as much as 30 per cent cheaper than in Guangzhou or Shenzhen.
Known for its spicy cuisine and stifling summer heat, the city has traditionally been a centre for engine, motorcycle and automobile manufacturing. But that's not the future envisioned for Chongqing.
Major electronics manufacturers including Foxconn, Hewlett-Packard, Asus and Acer are now setting up shop here. By 2015, government officials predict that Chongqing will be the world's top producer of laptop computers.
"Chongqing is not going to be Detroit," says Zhou Shulin, the vice-director for the Chongqing Logistics Co-ordination Office.
"That's why we have introduced PCs to Chongqing," he adds.
As a city and economic zone, Chongqing is ground zero for the Chinese central government's "go west" push. The program aims to shift economic expansion from China's fast-growing eastern coastal regions to the rural western interior.
The strategy, if successful, will reverse 30 years of labour migration patterns in China. Traditionally, China's manufacturing labour force has been drawn from a massive, young and poor population from the west who migrated east for jobs where they were housed in dormitories and temporary facilities for factory workers.
While that model has worked very well for the past few decades and been instrumental in China's ascendance to become the world's fastest growing major economy, a host of problems have also begun to emerge. In the coastal manufacturing hubs, factory owners must scramble every year to replace workers (anywhere from 10 per cent to 20 per cent) who choose not to return to their jobs after going home for a family visit during the annual Spring Festival.
Taiwan's Foxconn, which produces Ipads, Ipods and other Apple products in China, was hit with a raft of employee suicides last year that were blamed in part, on the difficult working conditions endured by migrant workers living thousands of kilometres from home.
In response to these emerging social issues, a series of labour strikes and a worsening worker shortage, wages for factory workers in places like Guangzhou have spiked, rising as much as 30 per cent in the last year.
For manufacturers, inland areas like Chongqing offer a respite to many of these challenges. Workers are paid less, but reside much closer to their families, and the cost of living remains far cheaper than on the coast.
In addition to electronics makers, the Chongqing region is attracting other manufacturers including BASF, Nokia and Ford Motor Co., who are setting up or expanding. Despite its inland geographical location, Chongqing offers many options for producers to get their goods to market.
Products can be loaded onto a ship and sailed down the Yangtze river to coastal ports where they are then transferred to vessels heading to Europe, North America or other parts of Asia. They can be sent by directly by rail to those same ports. Or, in a new option, whose economic viability has yet to be proven, they can be loaded onto rail cars in Chongqing and shipped directly to Europe through a series of rail line transfers that cross Central Asia, Russia and finally into Western Europe.
Edmonton native Adam McWhirter moved to Chongqing four years ago, drawn by the city's rising fortunes. It's a decision that appears to have paid off. While one of the friends he came to China with is still teaching English in Shanghai, Mr. McWhirter is now a partner at a property and investment company called Maxxelli Real Estate. The firm boasts annual revenue of more than 1 million yuan.
"This is an area in China where the growth is simply more noticeable. With the central government's whole "go west" policy, this was where I wanted to be," Mr. McWhirter says.
Property prices in Chongqing have been among the strongest in China's piping hot real estate market. Housing prices have increased about 300 per cent in the past four years, Mr. McWhirter says. Apartments in the central business area that used to cost between 6,000 and 8,000 yuan per square metre now command 15,000 yuan per square metre. In response to the soaring prices, Chongqing has implemented a property tax and limited buyers from outside the region to just one property.
Mr. McWhirter predicts that Chongqing's skyline and business growth will rival Shanghai's within five years. But he also expects Chongqing will always maintain the bulk of its more rural personality traits.
"You can change the face but you can't change the heart," he says.

Full text: The Canucks' playoff showing aside, the team's owner hopes to score big outside the rink as well -with a new vodka cooler. And guess what? It's actually good
wine@globeandmail.com
People often tell me they wish they had a job like mine, getting paid to drink and all. So I like to remind them of the drawbacks. For example, having to taste coolers. Neon-coloured cocktails in a bottle, they're usually a blend of spirit, sparkling water and enough sugar to topple a front-end loader. I'm not a fan. But of course the point of coolers is not to please wine critics. It's to bring merriment and brutal hangovers to young people.
At least that's what I believed before I tried Bassano Hard Soda. It's the first cooler I would actually buy. Created by Francesco Aquilini, the real-estate gazillionaire who owns the Vancouver Canucks, and his beverage-business partner, wine-industry veteran Barry Olivier, Bassano is based on the old-school Italiansoda playbook. It's less sweet than most of the competition and tastes like real fruit -because it's made from real fruit.
The new brand is bottled in Ontario by Brick Brewing using premium, triple-distilled vodka and water from a spring-fed aqui- fer in Formosa, Ont. Available in all provinces except Quebec and Newfoundland, it comes in two flavours: raspberry pomelo and lemon sanguinelli. Pomelo is a type of grapefruit, while sanguinelli is a blood orange.
I'm usually no more than two sips into a cooler before slapping myself on the forehead and thinking, "Wow, I could have had a beer!" But on a recent warm day I found these clear refreshments hard to put down.
Testimonials from other geezers are pouring in, including Chad Kroeger, lead singer of Nickelback. "We delivered four cases... to his studio because he said, 'I love this, I've got to have this,' " Olivier told me. Another fan is Bob McKenzie, the hockey commentator, who recently enthused to his 140,000 Twitter followers: "Secure as I am in my masculinity, I have found my new summer drink. Bassano Hard Soda. New vodka cooler but not as sweet/tangy as most." It was brave given hockey's beer demographic.
"When a big, macho hockey guy says that, it's kind of cool," Olivier said.
Ironically, you can't order Bassano at the Aquilini-owned Rogers Arena, home to the Canucks. Mark Anthony Brands, which controls cooler behemoth Mike's, is a long-time arena sponsor and has another year in its concession contract. Olivier said it's not the Acquilini family's style to go sour on a loyal business relationship. Better to kick butt on the ice than in the stands, I guess.
****
Bassano Hard Soda Lemon Sanguinelli
(Ontario)
SCORE: 91 PRICE: $9.95
to $11.99 for a 4-pack At just 5.5-per-cent alcohol, the quality vodka flavour still comes through without delivering too much bite. I love the soft effervescence, natural flavour and smartly tuned, sweet-bitter balance -Grey Goose in a three-way flirt with a lemon and blood orange in a Milanese cafe. It could even pair with food. Think grilled calamari topped with lots of salt, pepper and lemon or a chili-citrus vinaigrette. The raspberry pomelo flavour is very good, too.
Naia Verdejo 2009
(Spain)
SCORE: 90 PRICE: $18.95
Made from the aromatic verdejo grape in Spain's northern Rueda region, this white is silky and medium-bodied, with a lemon-drop core, floral overtone and crisp finish. It would pair well with butter-seared scallops or cod fillets.
Planeta Rosé 2010
(Italy)
SCORE: 90 PRICE: $16.95
Here's a deliciously dry, orange-pink rosé from sunny Sicily. It tastes like it was squeezed from summer berries. Ripe and silky, it gets a lift on the back end from crisp acidity. Serve it with grilled fish or all by itself on a warm day.
Quartz Reef Methode Traditionelle NV
(New Zealand)
SCORE: 92 PRICE: $29.95
One of New Zealand's stellar pinot noir producers, Quartz Reef in the southern region of Central Otago excels with this Champagnestyle bubbly. Mediumbodied and zesty, it delivers sweet lemon, brioche and red-apple flavours. It would stand up admirably against fine Champagnes costing twice as much.
Moris Morellino di Scansano Riserva 2006
(Italy)
SCORE: 91 PRICE: $32.50
Morellino is a local name for sangiovese in the Maremma district of coastal Tuscany. You can almost taste the salty air in this medium-fullbodied, bone-dry red. Bitter cherry plays with spice, herbs and earth while fine, furry tannins coat the palate. Try it with medium-rare steak. To my knowledge, it's available only in Quebec.
Domaine Jaeger Defaix Rully Premier Cruc
Rabourcé 2007 (France) SCORE: 91 PRICE: $27.95
Medium full-bodied and silky, with a floral bouquet, this elegant chardonnay from southern Burgundy offers up flavours of toasted bread, orange zest and, in a good way, gruyere cheese. It would be splendid with fish cooked in butter.
Osoyoos Larose Le Grand Vin 2006
(British Columbia) SCORE: 90 PRICE: $45
Winemaker Pascal Madevon has sculpted another cellar-worthy, Bordeaux-inspired red from the southern Okanagan Valley. A blend of merlot, cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, petit verdot and malbec, it's full-bodied and earthy, with notes of mineral and underbrush running through a core of dense dark fruit. Ultra-dry, angular tannins, even at five years of age, make it a tough go now, like eating peanut butter with a spoon. Age it for another five to eight years if you can or decant it and serve it with rare beef.
Morgante Nero
d'Avola 2008 (Italy) SCORE: 89 PRICE: $14.95
Also from Sicily, this fullbodied red has a sort of wine-gum flavour, plummy and tangy, with a note of spice and dusting of fine tannins. A good value, it would pair well with grilled lamb.
Tenuta S. Anna Millesimato Brut
Prosecco 2009 (Italy) SCORE: 88 PRICE: $16.95
Unusual for a prosecco, this is a vintage-dated sparkling wine made from a single year's harvest, rather than blended from several. Translation: It's serious, not simply cheap and cheerful. The substantial, oily mid-palate supports flavours of lemon and red apple and a hint of mineral. It starts vaguely sweet but finishes crisp and dry.
Fifth Leg Semillon Sauvignon Blanc 2010
(Australia)
SCORE: 86 PRICE: $15.95
Moderately silky with a tropical-fruit nuance, this crisp, light medium-bodied white from cool Western Australia also shows zesty citrus zest and herbs. Good for outdoor sipping and paired with grilled shellfish. The price is $17.99 in B.C.

Ford campaign expenses to be audited

Author: Lorinc, John

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/ford-campaign-expenses-be-audited/docview/866393785/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Mr. [Ford]'s lawyers now have 15 days to apply for a judicial review of the committee's decision. "It is an option that has been exercised in a number of these cases," Thomas Barlow said. Ms. [Adrienne Batra] said the mayor hadn't yet been briefed on the committee's decision and couldn't say whether he'd fight the audit in the courts.

Full text: Mayor required to pay for his own lawyers, accountants, while city picks up tab for audit
City council's compliance audit committee unanimously voted Friday to order a full audit of Rob Ford's campaign expenses, marking the first time a sitting City of Toronto mayor has had to undergo this kind of scrutiny.
The decision came in response to allegations that provincial elections laws were breached, made earlier this month by Toronto residents Max Reed and Adam Chaleff-Freudenthaler in a 17-page filing. None of the allegations have been proven. In their requests for a compliance audit, they alleged that Mr. Ford may have exceeded his statutory spending limits and relied on unorthodox financing arrangements - the Ford family's holding company paid over $77,000 in early campaign expenses.
Three requests for an audit were filed in response to a Globe and Mail investigation into the mayor's campaign filings. One was withdrawn and the committee deemed the other to be moot.
Mr. Chaleff-Freudenthaler, who ran unsuccessfully in last year's election as a school trustee, said there could be "very serious consequences" if the audit concludes the mayor ignored the rules. "I think the entire gamut of consequences should be considered," he told reporters after the morning-long session.
Adrienne Batra, Mr. Ford's spokeswoman, said the mayor has said previously that his campaign acted in accordance with the rules and welcomes the scrutiny.
Other members of council preferred to duck questions about their response to the news. "I have no other reaction than 'wow,'" said Josh Matlow (St. Paul's).
Mr. Ford's lawyers now have 15 days to apply for a judicial review of the committee's decision. "It is an option that has been exercised in a number of these cases," Thomas Barlow said. Ms. Batra said the mayor hadn't yet been briefed on the committee's decision and couldn't say whether he'd fight the audit in the courts.
The city will pick up the tab for the audit, but Mr. Ford, and not his campaign organization, must hire lawyers and accountants out of his own pocket.
The two-hour meeting frequently had the feel of a judicial proceeding as lawyers for both the mayor and the applicants debated fine points of election and procedural law, and submitted to grilling by the three-person committee.
After Mr. Barlow failed to have the audit requests pushed off for several months, the committee members focused intensively on the role played by Doug Ford Holdings Inc., the federally incorporated holding company that owns the family-owned printing company Deco Labels and Tags.
DFH, whose four shareholders include the mayor, his two brothers Randy and Doug, and their mother, paid for several costly expenses early in the race, including Mr. Ford's kick-off event at the Toronto Congress Centre.
According to documents prepared by Mr. Barlow, the campaign repaid the $77,722.31 owed to the firm on March 25, 2011, which was also the date when the campaign organization reimbursed Mr. Ford himself for the $200 nomination fee.
Mr. Barlow said DFH was simply a campaign vendor and subcontracted other services. Like other suppliers to Mr. Ford's election bid, DFH had to wait to be repaid until the campaign erased its deficit earlier this year, he added.
Stephen Chan, who is Deco's chief financial officer and also served as the campaign's CFO, told the committee that DFH owns and manages a portfolio of real estate and also functions as an investment firm. Both he and Mr. Barlow said the holding company relied on its network of business contacts to help get the campaign going. Mr. Chan also claimed that DFH, because of its size, was able to negotiate better prices on some supplies, including printing expenses.
But while Mr. Chan said he's worked for Deco for 10 years, he acknowledged in response to questions from the panel that he didn't know if DFH had played a similar role in Mr. Ford's three previous campaigns for council.
The committee members questioned the Ford camp's characterization of DFH's role. They wanted to know how the company, if it had been acting as a supplier, would not have applied a mark-up or charged interest on outstanding receivables. "I've never seen a vehicle such as this used," said chairman Douglas Colbourne.
Committee member John Hollins, who once ran Elections Ontario, pressed Mr. Barlow to explain whether there was any kind of a formal arrangement between the campaign and DFH. "Where was the decision-making taking place?" he asked, adding that it appeared to him as if DFH was "just a through-put of cash. I could be wrong. Maybe this is very different."
Noting that DFH took "verbal direction" from the campaign organizers, Mr. Barlow also said the companies subcontracted by DFH to provide campaign services were paid by DFH.
According to the Municipal Elections Act, one of the duties of a candidate is to ensure that "all payments for expenses, except for a nomination filing fee, are made from the campaign accounts."
The clerk must now hire an auditor through an open procurement process.
After the external review is complete, the auditor will make a recommendation to the committee about how to proceed. The committee then has the right to commence legal proceedings if warranted. The penalties for breaking municipal elections laws run from fines to being barred from seeking public office.
*******
COMPLIANCE AUDIT COMMITTEE BACKGROUND
Who makes up Toronto's compliance audit committee?
Douglas Colbourne, the chairman, is a chartered accountant and arbitrator who held the post in the last council, as well as for the Toronto District School Board. He is also a planner and served for several years as the chair of the Ontario Municipal Board.
John Hollins ran North York's elections office for a decade and then took over with the amalgamated city in 1998. From 2001 to 2008, he served as CEO of Elections Ontario, during which time he helped build a permanent electors registry.
Virginia MacLean, a veteran municipal affairs lawyer who practises in Oakville, has worked in legal services for the provincial government and the City of Mississauga. She also serves on the compliance audit committees of other municipalities, including Oakville, Aurora, East Gwillimbury, Georgina, Richmond Hill, Whitchurch-Stouffville and the Township of King.
Have other GTA politicians undergone compliance audits?
Challenges to mayoral campaigns are not unheard of. In 1996, former City of Toronto mayor Barbara Hall faced calls for a compliance auditor over allegations that her 1994 campaign had received thousands of dollars in undeclared donations from the members of a local trade union. The complaints didn't lead to an audit.
In 2007, the committee rejected a request for an audit of then-mayor David Miller's campaign. Vaughan's former mayor, Michael Di Biase, faced an audit in the wake of a bitter 2006 election fight with Linda Jackson, who was also subject of a probe into her campaign finances.
Perhaps the most high-profile compliance audit case involved former Hamilton mayor Larry Di Ianni, a challenge that ended up in the courts in 2005. In that case, a voter asked for a compliance audit of several candidates in the 2003 election, including the mayor. The allegation focused on "over-donations" by several corporations who contributed more than the $750 allowable amount to Mr. Di Ianni's campaign.
Under the rules that existed at the time, Hamilton Council had to approve a compliance audit request, but refused, prompting the trial judge to later remark that the politicians didn't want to be seen to be standing in judgment of their colleagues.
Council's decision was appealed to an Ontario appeal court, which ultimately ordered the City of Hamilton to conduct the audit. Mr. Di Ianni eventually pleaded guilty to violating the Municipal Elections Act.
Who can request an audit?
Any registered elector can request a compliance audit, which means the process has often served as a second front for simmering political rivalries, so much so that Queen's Park recently changed the rules. The committee, not council, decides whether to commence legal action against a candidate, based on the findings of the external auditor. The committee's decisions can be appealed to a Provincial Court.

Abstract: Now the company is eyeing expansion into regional dailies.

But NaiDunia ("New World" in Hindi) will have plenty of competition. Mumbai-based industry analysts predict regional Hindi papers will drive growth of nine to 15 per cent in each of the coming years.

Full text: It took 64 years for the revered Indian newspaper NaiDunia to reach a circulation of 500,000 - a figure that would make most North American publishers swoon.
That was two years ago. Since then, the paper's circulation has soared a stunning 62.5 per cent to 800,000 copies a day, and the publication's owner, NaiDunia Media Pvt. Ltd, says that's just the start.
By 2016, the company aims to reach a readership of 15 million - nearly triple the circulations of the three biggest U.S. dailies, USA Today, Wall Street Journal and New York Times, combined.
The market for newspapers is on fire in India, where household spending and government investment fuelled the second-fastest economic growth among advanced countries last year, behind only China. That growth has given rise to a new, more literate consumer class - and the payoff for print media has been huge. The country's print industry, now worth about $4.5-billion U.S., grew by an estimated 10 per cent in each of the last three
years.
The owner of NaiDunia is among several companies looking to take advantage of that remarkable growth. In 2008 it set up an office in Delhi and went national, with new local editions in several mid-size cities and a fat Sunday edition, including a glossy magazine, distributed across the "Hindi belt" states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Bihar.
Now the company is eyeing expansion into regional dailies. Editor-in-chief Alok Mehta rattles off 12 cities with populations under 10 million where the company's "quality content and smart design" will lure new Hindi readers. But NaiDunia ("New World" in Hindi) will have plenty of competition. Mumbai-based industry analysts predict regional Hindi papers will drive growth of nine to 15 per cent in each of the coming years.
Advertisers are seizing on that growth, targeting rural areas and small cities in their efforts to sell everything from real estate to consumer durables. Many of these readers have new money in their pockets, but there are limited ways for advertisers to reach them. They generally don't have televisions or use the Internet, and private radio is rare, said Smita Jha, who heads the media and entertainment consultancy with PricewaterhouseCoopers India.
Mobile-phone companies, for example, are placing targeted ads for their lowest-priced handsets in the pages of local-language, small-city dailies. While most of the traditional ad spend has been national - and focused on the elite, English-language dailies - a whole new cohort of local advertisers is developing to target the new consumers.
In India, print faces no immediate threat here from other media. Only seven per cent of Indians are regular users of the Internet. Cable TV news channels are ubiquitous, but the cost of a television, a cable connection and the electricity to run it (at about $1,000, all told) remains beyond the reach of a significant chunk of the market. Private radio stations have only recently been licensed - big newspaper companies are buying up many of the new licenses, identifying radio as a natural overlap with their existing infrastructure and brands.
Increased literacy is also playing a key role in the industry's dramatic ascent. This year's national census data shows an adult literacy level of 74 per cent, up nine per cent from the last census a decade ago. While much of that increase is attributed to literate young people who have been reached by an expanded public school system, the government is also doing extensive literacy outreach with rural adults.
"As soon as a person becomes literate, what they get is a newspaper - even before they buy a phone, it's the first luxury a man affords," said A.S. Raghunath, a veteran editor who now advises new entrants in the regional markets.
The daily paper, he added, retains an aura of respect in India - the newly literate like to be seen with a newspaper. And with a cover price of only one, two or at most four rupees (four rupees equal about eight Canadian cents), new-reading households will often subscribe to not just one paper, but two or three.
And while an English-language daily has an average of two to three pass-along readers, local-language papers have seven to eight, said Jha. "This is exactly where the opportunity is," she said - a national paper that starts a regional edition with a few pages of local news gets double the readers, and many happy new advertisers, for each copy compared to an English urban one.
Also fuelling the growth of print is the significant recent investment by the Indian government in infrastructure: Better roads, in particular, have allowed newspapers to broaden the reach of a product that has to be daily and timely.
New entrants to the regional markets are aggressive. Mr. Raghunath tells the story of one of his clients, Sakshi, a Telugu-language paper headquartered in Hyderabad that launched in 2008. Its backers brought in foreign investors and one of the world's leading newspaper designers from the U.S. They set up printing presses in 26 different cities, producing editions for Telugu-speaking populations in smaller cities as well as the metropolises of Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. They did intensive market research on what people wanted in a paper, then went door-to-door with incentive schemes and gift packages, and signed up more than a million readers - before they had ever printed a word.
"It used to be you would launch and slowly grow," Mr. Raghunath said. "Now a paper is planned on the drawing table, promotions are carried out, and the launch happens with the paper saying, 'What you want, we will give you.'"
NaiDunia, which was founded by a pair of freedom fighters in the weeks before Indian independence in 1947, has an editorial staff of less than 100 people. But that's enough, Mr. Mehta said, because he knows what readers want: breaking news and tough but balanced political coverage.
Every edition, Mr. Mehta assumes, will be shared among three generations in many households, so NaiDunia includes business news, education news, career and financial advice, religious content and Bollywood gossip.
Mr. Raghunath said the new newspapers he is advising also see the need for multi-generational appeal in a single publication, but he boils it down to something particular: "Just geared towards aspiration - you have to evolve a brand which meets their aspirations."
In 2005, the Indian government loosened regulations to allow up to 26-per-cent foreign investment in news publishing businesses. Three listed firms - Jagran Jaran Prakashan Ltd., Deccan Chronicle Holdings Ltd., and HT Media Ltd. - currently dominate the market and attract about 85 per cent of advertising. All three took advantage of the new FDI rules and are cash-rich. They are all making significant forays into Internet development, banking on returns in about five years, analysts say.
"If you are coming as a pure financial investor, there is a lot of scope in both national and regional dailies," said Ms. Jha. National dailies offer the chance to exit within two or three years, while the regional dailies will take longer to show a solid return, she added. But both have plenty to offer publishers fleeing the moribund Western newspaper market.

Republicans still yearning for white knight

Full text: Great week for Obama - bin Laden, jobs growth - topped off by weak lineup of GOP contenders at South Carolina debate
kyakabuski@globeandmail.com
There are few unequivocally great weeks in the life of any U.S. president, but Barack Obama just had one that could change the course of his country - not to mention his career.
Still basking in a post-bin-Laden bump in his approval rating, Mr. Obama woke up Friday to news that the long dormant U.S. economy created nearly 500,000 jobs in March and April - all of them in the private sector.
In between those high-five moments in the West Wing, there was the strange spectacle Republicans put on in South Carolina, where some of the party's most eccentric characters debated each other in the first encounter of the 2012 GOP presidential nomination contest. In the end, there was less talk about those who showed up for the vetting than those who did not.
The GOP race is suffering from a failure to launch. A third of all voters in an April 27 University of Iowa poll opted for "someone else" when asked to choose among the seven most oft-mentioned names, from former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney on through to Newt Gingrich, who is set to formally announce his candidacy for the nomination on Wednesday.
Have Republicans already forfeited the 2012 race?
Incumbent presidents are usually hard to beat. But the same polls that show a post-bin-Laden spike of 10 percentage points in Mr. Obama's overall approval rating also reveal deep dissatisfaction with his handling of the economy.
No president has won re-election with a jobless rate higher than 7.2 per cent. It's now at 9 per cent. Mr. Obama likely needs to see monthly job growth that at least matches the recent numbers between now and late 2012.
To have even a shot at beating the President, however, Republicans need to find a worthy challenger.
"Here's what I'm curious about: Jon Huntsman," retired real-estate agent Joyce Bridges, 63, said of the man who just stepped down as U.S. ambassador to China.
"He could be the fresh new face that I'm looking for."
Greenville's Ms. Bridges is among the 93 per cent of GOP voters who, according to a recent CBS News poll, said they did not know enough about Mr. Huntsman to form an opinion about him. But the yearning for a white knight that she expresses is all too common among Republicans.
Mr. Huntsman, 51, is a dashing former Utah governor to whom Mr. Obama awarded the Beijing post in 2009, in what was widely seen as a ploy to keep a potential rival occupied beyond the 2012 election. It didn't work.
While Mr. Huntsman did not take part in Thursday's debate, he provided more evidence that he is moving closer to a presidential bid with a weekend trip to South Carolina. He delivered a graduation speech at a local college, met privately with Governor Nikki Haley and hobnobbed with Republicans at a state GOP convention.
Like Mr. Romney, who came fourth in the 2008 GOP primary in South Carolina, Mr. Huntsman is a Mormon. And no candidate has gone on to win the nomination without winning the South Carolina primary, in which conservative Christians typically loom large.
But the state's new GOP governor, herself the daughter of Sikh immigrants, insisted that race and religion are no longer obstacles to political success in South Carolina.
"This [primary] will be very much like my election," Ms. Haley, 39, said in an interview. "It doesn't matter whether you're male or female or black or white or what your religion is. The person that best communicates and reaches out to everybody will win."
Ex-U.S. ambassador to Canada David Wilkins, a former state speaker who led Ms. Haley's transition after she won office in November, added that the biggest factor for South Carolina Republicans in choosing the party's 2012 nominee remains the $14-trillion (U.S.) federal debt.
"It's 'What are you going to do about the deficit? How are you going to curtail spending?' " Mr. Wilkins explained. "That is the dominant issue in South Carolina and, I believe, everywhere."
Outside Greenville's Peace Center, the site of the GOP debate, Lenna Neill, 58, demurred, insisting that where the candidates stand on abortion and gay marriage is as important to her as their economic policies.
"Right now, Rick is the leader for me," she said of Rick Santorum, a strident social conservative who lost his Pennsylvania Senate seat in 2006. "I want to hear about Christian values. My core is my core and I'm going to stand for that."
She is not alone. Mr. Santorum came first with 150 votes in a straw poll of 408 taken at the state party's Silver Elephant dinner on Friday. Mr. Romney trailed with 66 votes. Mr. Huntsman got only four votes.
Those are long odds for Mr. Huntsman, or any other white knight, to overcome. Not to mention icing on Mr. Obama's cake of a week.

In London, a real estate revival

Author: Reguly, Eric

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/london-real-estate-revival/docview/865181743/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Will London's good fortune last? Mr. [Mark Preston], Mr. [Henry Overman] and Mr. Damesick all agree that severe supply constraints of both residential and commercial property could keep the party going for a while. Mr. Overman said Britain had 120,000 housing completions in 2010, the lowest level since the 1920s. By his estimation, that's half the level required to meet demand.

Full text: Rebound in commercial and residential markets a sharp contrast to the situation elsewhere in Britain
The sixth Duke of Westminster, Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, might have the sweetest real estate deal on the planet.
Through Grosvenor Ltd., the family real estate company, he has perpetual and exclusive ownership of most of Mayfair and Belgravia, the ultra-posh London neighbourhoods where a BMW is considered a lowly grocery getter. Buying a house or apartment in either place is exceedingly difficult. That's because the properties, which came into the family in 1677 and cover about 300 acres, are almost always occupied on leases that can range from a few years to a century. When the lease is up, the duke (or his heirs) takes back the keys.
And thanks to the extraordinary rebound of the London property market in the past year or so, the property values and lease prices attached to them are rising, pumping up Grosvenor's profits. John D. Wood & Co., a London property agent and manager, tracks values and found that large houses (more than 3,500 square feet) in the prime parts of central London fell about 40 per cent between 2008 and mid-2009. Since then, they have recouped almost all their losses - one of the sharpest and quickest comebacks in recent decades.
By North American, even Manhattan, standards, the cost of accommodation in West London is outrageous. Example: The asking price on one three-bedroom, 3,000-square-foot apartment on Belgravia's Eaton Square is £7-million ($11-million). For that, you get 16 years. The lease price works out to $58,000 a month.
No wonder the Duke of Westminster is ranked by The Sunday Times Rich List as the wealthiest Briton (if not resident), with an estimated 2010 worth of £6.75-billion. If the London market keeps rising, the next tally will no doubt pump up the figure. Last year. Grosvenor Ltd.'s pretax profit was £394.8-million, against a loss in 2009 of £235.8-million, and its net asset value rose 9 per cent to £2.78-billion.
Mark Preston, Grosvenor's chief executive, says the rebound in residential and commercial markets, notably the latter, has been remarkably strong.
That's quite a change since 2009, when there were endless predictions that all things real estate faced a long and brutal downturn as British unemployment soared, the national budget deficit exceeded Greek levels and the government resorted to nationalizations to save the banking system. On top of that, a few of the rare healthy banks, such as HSBC, threatened to skip town in retaliation against the threat of higher taxes and tougher financial services regulation.
Mr. Preston credits supply constraints as one of the prime drivers of both the residential and commercial property revival. During the recession, construction all but collapsed, "so there is very, very small supply now," he said. With two- to three-year lag times between a project start and occupancy, he thinks values could keep rising.
He also thinks London achieved a greater degree of safe-haven status in the past year or so. Political turmoil, such as the Arab uprisings, convinced wealthy foreign investors - from billionaires to sovereign wealth funds - to diversify. "In times of crisis or uncertainty, investors flood to gold and London property," he said. "One of the great attractions of the London market is liquidity. The market is transparent and investors can get their money out if they want to."
Henry Overman, the director of the Spatial Economics Research Centre at the London School of Economics, thinks the bank bailouts contributed to London's bounce back. The nationalizations and other support measures saved the weak banks from almost certain destruction and helped the stronger ones muddle through the downturn.
Most of the banks are based in London and most of their jobs were preserved. Employment in financial services has actually been rising in London.
Commercial space is, once again, in short supply. Peter Damesick, chief economist for Europe, the Middle East and Africa for CB Richard Ellis, the world's biggest property adviser, said 15 million square feet of commercial space was leased in London in 2010, the highest level since 2000. The long-term average is 12 million square feet a year.
The residential market has also regained some strength, making even modest homes costly. The average London home price is now almost £337,000.
London's property revival is all the more impressive when you consider what's happening elsewhere. Outside London, the housing market is still firmly in recession. The latest figures from the U.K. Land Registry office show that of the 11 regions measured in England and Wales, London was the only one in positive territory in the year to the end of March, with a 0.8-per-cent average house price increase. The worst-hit areas were the North East (down 9.3 per cent), Wales (down 7.2 per cent) and Yorkshire and the Humber (down 5.3 per cent).
London home prices are well more than three times the value in the North East and twice the value in the South West. The slow recovery beyond London helps to explain the extreme price gaps.
Jobs are still being shredded in Britain's secondary cities, in good part because of the brutal public-sector spending cutbacks as the national and local governments try to balance their budgets. This comes as a blow to cities such as Cardiff, Swansea and Liverpool, which had had some success in replacing lost industrial jobs with government jobs, only to see austerity programs take them away at an alarming rate. Relatively speaking, London has fewer public sector jobs than most parts of the country.
Will London's good fortune last? Mr. Preston, Mr. Overman and Mr. Damesick all agree that severe supply constraints of both residential and commercial property could keep the party going for a while. Mr. Overman said Britain had 120,000 housing completions in 2010, the lowest level since the 1920s. By his estimation, that's half the level required to meet demand.
The shortage is particularly acute in London, which is ringed with a greenbelt, has many protected heritage neighbourhoods and whose mayor, Boris Johnson, dislikes high rises.
Mr. Damesick thinks the banks are the biggest single potential threat to London's enduring recovery. If the euro zone debt crisis takes a turn for the worse, all of Europe's banks could face monster losses and job reduction. Higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy could trigger an exodus from London. Taxes have indeed been rising, but few businesses, aside from a few hedge funds, have left town.

Full text: Go house-hunting across Canada and you might be shocked at what it buys you - or doesn't
A two-level home with a four-car garage and an oceanfront view, or a 1,070-square-foot loft? Either British Columbia residence can be bought for $600,000, proving the adage that when it comes to real estate it's all about location, location, location.
The house that $600,000 will buy from coast to coast is as variable as the weather. House prices depend not only on the property and residence, but on conditions in the local market and, obviously, location.
For many homeowners, squeezing every dollar out of the investment they are making in their house has never been more important. Canadians are spending a greater proportion of their income on their homes than they historically have, and housing is expected to take up an even bigger chunk of families' budgets once interest rates start rising.
While some buyers aren't able to choose where to live based on home prices, they might be tempted. Housing affordability actually improved in most provinces during the final quarter of 2010 (the last period with solid data), but a standard two-storey house became less affordable in Ontario and Quebec, and condos became less affordable in Quebec and the Atlantic region, according to RBC Economics.
Indeed, Quebec and Saskatchewan are becoming more expensive, although they remain below the national average. Alberta and Manitoba have been a bit more affordable than normal.
Borrowing costs, including mortgages, are expected to climb over the next two years, putting a damper on price appreciation. "The era of rapid home-price appreciation of the past 10 years has likely run its course overall in Canada, and we believe that we have entered a period of very modest increases," said a recent RBC Economics research report.
A general rule of thumb is that home buyers should keep their mortgage below four and a half or five times their gross family income, said Peter Majthenyi, a mortgage planner at Mortgage Architects in Toronto. So where do you get the best bang for your buck?
Most experts agree on one thing: not Vancouver. "We've never been in the camp that says there's a housing bubble in Canada, but if we were to pick one market that we want to see scrutinized more closely it would be that one," said Robert Hogue, a senior economist at RBC.
Toronto would be next on the list, but the situation there is not nearly as worrisome, he added.
An unscientific country-wide search on the Canadian Real Estate Association's multiple listing service of houses that are listed for $600,000 tells the story.
That's the price tag on a 1,070-square-foot, one-bedroom, one-bathroom loft condominium on Vancouver's Beach Avenue that has a partial water view. It's also the listed price of a two-bedroom, one-bathroom, 793-square-foot condo in Vancouver's west end, near Robson Square.
"Vancouver has always been the most expensive market in the country, and it continues to be the most expensive, not only in terms of housing prices but in terms of mortgages," said Jim Murphy, chief executive officer of the Canadian Association of Accredited Mortgage Professionals.
With that same $600,000 you could hop across the Strait of Georgia to Parksville, on Vancouver Island, where you could buy a 3,008-square-foot, three-bedroom, four-bathroom house with an ocean view that sits on 9,148 square feet of land.
What about the country's most populous city? For $600,000 you could buy a three-bedroom, three-bathroom townhouse condominium in Toronto's Cabbagetown, with walkouts on three levels. If you pony up an extra $900, you could get a one-bedroom, one-bathroom, 826-square-foot condo on King Street West, in the heart of downtown.
"The Toronto-area market sustained a rebound in activity in the latter part of 2010, following a steep decline in the spring and early summer from unsustainably high levels last winter," the RBC Economics report noted.
Take your $600,000 to Hants Border, N.S., and it will buy you a three-bedroom, three-bathroom, 2,824-square-foot home on an acre of land with water views that change along with the Fundy tides. If you're looking for a recreational property, $600,000 is the price of a three-bedroom, three-bathroom ski chalet on roughly an acre of land in Saint-Sauveur, Que.
Or you could head a bit west of London, Ont., to Komoka, a town best known as a railway crossing, and your money will buy a four-bedroom, three-bathroom clay brick house on 2.74 acres of land. Three hours east, in the scenic town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, the same amount is enough for a four-bedroom, three-bathroom, 2,300-square-foot house that's been featured on garden tours and dates back to the 1800s.
In Calgary, $600,482 will secure a two-bedroom, two-bathroom 1,364-square-foot, one-year-old two-storey condo in Eau Claire, near the Bow River. Housing industry experts say Calgary has become one of the country's more rocky markets, where prices have fluctuated. "There was a bit of a downturn there, but prices are coming back," Mr. Murphy said.
Indeed, RBC Economics believes that the prolonged slump that has afflicted Calgary since 2007 is drawing to an end. While home prices continued to weaken in the fourth quarter, resales have rebounded. But the weakening prices have helped bring housing in the city to its most affordable level in nearly six years.
"We believe that attractive affordability will support further increases in demand as the local economy picks up steam in the year ahead," the report said.
If so, that two-storey condo might not be going for $600,482 for long.

LISTING AGENT
Julie Kinnear, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
The Action: In a decade-old building set alongside a ravine in Hoggs Hollow, this two-bedroom plus den corner suite lingered on the market for four months last fall.
But once re-listed with another agent, Julie Kinnear - who increased its market exposure and changed furnishings and window covers for maximum appeal - it sold quickly in a bidding war between two buyers earlier this year.
What They Got: On the ground floor of one of three luxury mid-rises in the Hillside community, this spacious 1,176-square-foot model features nine-foot ceilings and full-height windows facing south and west.
* By the entrance, there is a large foyer, laundry room, full bathroom and second bedroom. The master suite on the opposite end of the unit has a walk-in closet and private bathroom.
* For casual entertaining, there is a central dining area and living room with an exit to a terrace that can also be reached from the enclosed den off the eat-in kitchen.
* The unit comes with a locker and two parking spots.
* The monthly fee of $903 covers cable and utility costs, 24-hour concierge and gatehouse security. Residents can utilize hotel-style amenities in the building and an adjacent clubhouse, including a lounge, party and billiards rooms, gym, pool, and putting green.
The Agent's Take: "It was big and on the main floor with outdoor space, so it was good for somebody downsizing from a house," Ms. Kinnear says.
A lot of interest also came from locals wanting to stay close to the shops, subway and upscale restaurants like Auberge du Pommier. "It's a pretty cool little spot," Ms. Kinnear says of the area.

Full text:   Forgery of documents would have required years of elaborate effort
The paper trail leading to whoever helped Osama bin Laden during his years of seclusion includes sheaves of land-registry documents filed with local authorities in Abbottabad, now kept secret by order from Islamabad.
Government officials have been instructed to avoid discussing ownership of the mysterious compound where the terrorist leader apparently lived for five or six years, but one local administrator confirmed that the property was listed under the names of two brothers from the rugged border province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Documents identify the brothers as Arshad Khan and Bashir Khan, both the sons of Naqab Khan, the administrator said. The brothers said they were originally from the village of Khattak Korona in Charsadda district, north of the bustling frontier city of Peshawar where Mr. bin Laden started his career as a jihadi in the 1980s.
Those names sound roughly similar to the way neighbours in Bilal Town, a suburb of Abbottabad, referred to the reclusive men who lived next door.
Pakistani sources have told journalists the land-registry documents are worthless because somebody obtained them with a faked identity card. If the Khan brothers did invent their names, however, such forgery would have required elaborate effort: building contractors in Abbottabad said the process of purchasing land, obtaining permits and hooking up basic utilities, requires months, or even years, of approvals.
It's even harder to get the necessary papers in a cantonment area such as Bilal Town, where homes are built on military lands.
"The process gets more strict when it comes to the military," said Saqib Jadoon, 46, co-owner of Dawn Builders, one of the biggest construction firms in Abbottabad. His company built at least 25 homes in Bilal Town, though none so large as the hulking, high-security compound where Mr. bin Laden lived.
Mr. Jadoon estimated that an average project would require the purchaser to prove his identity at least seven times, usually with a Pakistani national identity card. Pakistan's National Database & Registration Authority, which administers the card program, says on its website that any citizen can confirm the validity of an identity card by contacting the authority.
Mr. Jadoon said that buyers and sellers don't usually investigate each other when making real-estate deals in Abbottabad.
"If his photo looks right on the card, okay," Mr. Jadoon said. "We don't research his background."
It's not clear whether such a relaxed approach also applied to the cantonment board, usually chaired by an active-duty colonel. The board meets once a month and approves all details of planned construction on military lands.
"When I built my house, that paperwork took two or three months and they were very careful about the blueprint," said Israr Sahad, 28, who lives in an adjacent neighbourhood. "When you are finished building, they come and visit you to make sure everything is exactly right."
Even after construction, Mr. Sahad said details such as electricity and gas lines can require further months of paperwork and proof of identity, tax status and land ownership.
The 36,000-square-foot property where the bin Laden family lived was probably worth only $80,000 when first purchased about eight years ago as an empty field, Mr. Jadoon said, but would now fetch about $500,000.
A labourer working the rows of vegetables outside the compound walls smiled broadly when asked about the Khan brothers.
"They were polite," said Mohammed Qasim, 20. "They seemed like rich men, but they had no fancy clothes, no expensive watches or cellphones."
Mohammed Abid, 12, idly swatting at weeds with a badminton racket, seemed less sure about his neighbours. "We often heard children crying inside," Mohammed said. "They should have allowed them outside for games, but we never met them."

Back to the future in an ancient city

Author: Chiose, Simona

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/back-future-ancient-city/docview/864775301/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Mr. [Maria Tosatti], a young Italian artist and curator, used vacant buildings to house exhibitions when he worked in Harlem three years ago. When we found him in Pigneto's pop-up gallery, he was just blowing up transparent balloons for the next week's instalment. He talked passionately about the work while our five-year-old son ran up and down the building's long hallways.

Full text:   A modern-art pilgrimage in Rome uncovers extraordinary sights in ordinary neighbourhoods
My purse was laden with receipts. Cappuccinos, cornettos, gelatos, pizza al taglio and more pizza al taglio. And hanging in front of me on the wall of Rome's contemporary art gallery MACRO Testaccio was another one. This bill was consumer ephemera rendered beautiful in a corn and red-coloured tapestry. Woven by Mexican-born Gabriel Kuri, it was an oversized version of a receipt from the boulangerie Le Pain Quotidien.
I stood admiring it for a long time. What better place to see the ordinary become eternal than in Rome? A wander down the city's streets is an immersion in 2,000 years of history and architecture, each generation competing with its predecessor to leave its mark on history.
The latest gambit comes from the high-profile opening of the MAXXI modern art museum last spring. Rome is seizing its momentum to attract locals and tourists who would rather seek out the contemporary city than wait in the Colosseum lineup.
But as I meandered around this other Rome, the one better known to locals who last saw the Sistine Chapel on a high-school trip, I discovered that the success of the modern-art venture is uncertain.
We travelled to Via dei Trei Orologi, a street with major status in Rome's social and real-estate markets, to visit the Brancolini Grimaldi photography gallery. But it was closing, and only a lone Georgie Hopton picture stood propped up against a wall. The gallery was packing up and moving to London. The locals were too traditional to bite, an assistant said, and the tourists never came.
More often, though, the modern-art pilgrimage uncovers not only the preoccupations of today's Italians, but also ordinary neighbourhoods where office workers have lunch and parents take their kids to the park.
The MACRO Testaccio is a perfect example. The ratio of tourists to locals in the city's historical centre has been estimated at 30 to 1. Testaccio, on the other hand, is located in an area where a majority of residents were born in Rome. The gallery is housed in a former slaughterhouse and menacing, shiny meat hooks still hang from its ceiling. This week, young Romans flock to its arts festival, an event that mixes art with dance, theatre and interactive performances that last well into the morning.
Across from MACRO, the Nuevo Mercato Testaccio, a major city building project, will soon be finished. The "new market" - which takes up several city blocks with open-concept, glass and metal buildings - will include modern artists' work spaces, eateries and designer shops.
For now, the action is still enviably old-fashioned. The Testaccio market caters to locals and self-catering tourists, while the renowned Volpetti deli vacuum packs and ships your prosciutto di Parma home. Unfortunately, its tavola calda, the hot buffet,cannot be exported. A half-chicken with potatoes, green beans from the mercato , and sole baked with artichokes all tasted as though, yes, an Italian mama with a liberal hand on the olive oil was in the kitchen.
Foodie delights were harder to find on a rainy (pouring, miserable) visit to the brutalist MAXXI modern art museum by Zaha Hadid in the Flaminio district. A vision in white concrete on the outside, the MAXXI is divided by an undulating staircase that separates its gallery rooms.
The exhibitions match the building's daring design. In Stanze , wartime Italy is remixed with the current immigration debate in an art film shot in an army barracks in Turin. Now used as housing for refugee claimants, it was the fascist police headquarters during the Second World War. In the film, the asylum-seekers read testimony from resistance members who had been jailed in the building.
The plan had been to see the MAXXI and then, before dinner, cross the Tiber at Ponte Milvio, an area that is becoming known as a smaller and much less crowded version of Trastevere. But the rain put a damper on those plans.
So, to really feel like local art hounds, we headed to Pigneto, a half-hour bus ride south of the central Termini bus station. The neighbourhood's treasures don't lie on its main via del Pigneto , but on its back streets. Formerly a working-class district, Pigneto is now one of the last refuges of artists who want to live and work in Rome, and it's rich in unusual art spots like empty auto mechanic shops. It was in one such space that the exhibition Reload Pigneto had set up its temporary wares. Running for two months, the show gave one curator a week to organize an exhibit in a 33,000-square-foot former factory. The property's owner had been unable to rent it and, hoping for some good art vibes, called Gian Maria Tosatti.
Mr. Tosatti, a young Italian artist and curator, used vacant buildings to house exhibitions when he worked in Harlem three years ago. When we found him in Pigneto's pop-up gallery, he was just blowing up transparent balloons for the next week's instalment. He talked passionately about the work while our five-year-old son ran up and down the building's long hallways.
The collaboration between the artists and the factory owner , Mr. Tosatti said, showed that art could produce value with "zero money," a requirement at a time when Italian artists can no longer count on once-generous public funding. The European debt crisis hurt private foundations, which have become skittish about funding smaller projects with uncertain returns. But the value of independent art was visible all around.
Aside from the Reload festival, Pigneto was alive with more contemporary art. White Cube Pigneto, a tribute rather than an offshoot of the famed London institution in Shoreditch, was showing work arguing against social exclusion in Europe, a video collective was operating out of a storefront and two men were painting a hyper-pigmented portrait of Italian screen legend Anna Magnani on a garage door that was home to Pizzeria Ciak (a pizzeria where not just the food was art).
We followed the heaviest stream of traffic. As it turned out, the scooters were heading to the restaurant Necci dal 1924 on a street called Fanfulla da Lodi. Behind the tall wrought-iron gates, the tables in its two-tier garden were almost spilling onto the sidewalk. Inside, Necci is the prettiest London-style bistro in Rome, with white tiles, chandeliers and pots of its own apricot jam and marmalade beckoning on shelves. The restaurant is owned by Brit chef Benjamin Hirst and Umbrian Massimo Innocenti, who have had the place since 2007.
What I didn't know until weeks later was that Necci is truly " dal 1924." It started out life as an ice cream shop and bar and was at the centre of the neighbourhood. By the time legendary Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini discovered Pigneto, Necci had become more tavern than gelateria : It was in Necci that Pasolini shot the café scenes in 1961's Accattone , his first film and a good intro to the "street life" of the time.
By trying to run away from history and discover the here and now, I stumbled onto a place that had married the two. In Rome, the contemporary is only a moment in the flow of time, and perhaps because of that, all the more fascinating.

Competition Bureau asked to settle new fight over MLS listings

Author: Ladurantaye, Steve

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/competition-bureau-asked-settle-new-fight-over/docview/864186283/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "They created the illusion of allowing mere listings and every time we try to do something we get letters from lawyers telling us we can't," said Propertyguys.com director of partnerships Walter Melanson. "Now we're stuck pulling down all these listings on 24-hours notice, and these listings are from normal people who just want to sell their houses. It's not right."

Full text:   REAL ESTATE REPORTER
A fresh fight is brewing in the home sales industry, as the associations that represent real estate agents try to enforce restrictions on new, lower-cost competitors in an effort to prevent them from doing business across provincial boundaries.
The competitors offer low-cost, flat-fee listings on Realtor.ca, and were under the impression they would be able to accept clients from across the country after the real estate industry settled a case with the Competition Bureau last year that allowed them entry to the market.
Several of the companies say they are being forced out of business by real estate boards who are interpreting provincial legislation in a way that prevents them from competing with commission-based agents, and they are calling on Competition Commissioner Melanie Aitken to step back into the fray.
"You had to know that the real estate industry would try and find a way to shut this down completely," said Joe William, an Ottawa-based broker who posts listings on the Multiple Listing Service for $100 and has previously accepted listings from several provinces. "I'm getting requests from people all over the country every day, but I'm holding off until the rules are clarified."
The complaints illustrate there are still some issues to work out after the Canadian Real Estate Association and the Competition Bureau hammered out a deal last year that made it easier for real estate agents to create alternative business models.
At the centre of the fight is a deceptively complex question - are flat-fee agents trading in real estate, or simply posting a listing to an online forum? If they are indeed trading, provincial regulators require them to be licensed in a province before accepting a listing.
But they insist that what they are doing is no different than taking out a newspaper ad or posting on Craigslist. Once the posting is made, the homeowners are handling the sales themselves.
Mr. William said he received a $50,000 fine from the Quebec regulator two weeks ago, with a note stating that he was contravening the province's rules.
Mr. William would be required to pull his Quebec listings posted from his Ottawa-based Best Value Real Estate. He plans to fight the fine, but has pulled his listings from the province.
He was also recently chased out of Manitoba, with an e-mail from the Manitoba Securities Commission that read: "Brokers or individuals registered in other jurisdictions wishing to transact in real estate in Manitoba must obtain a license in order to so. This process involves several steps including passing a challenge exam based on provincial law."
"I did hundreds of these listings before they became a problem," Mr. William said. "All we do is post the listings online. Why would we need a licence to do that?"
A handful of flat-fee companies appeared after an October agreement between CREA and the Competition Bureau that allowed brokers to post listings on the MLS on behalf of people selling their own homes.
Prior to the agreement, anyone who wanted a listing on the Realtor.ca hub needed to hire a real estate agent and pay them to handle all portions of the deal - from the initial listing through to final negotiations and sale. It's estimated that 90 per cent of all home sales go through the listings site, making a posting an integral marketing tool for anyone looking to sell.
The flat-fee companies operated on the assumption that they could suddenly post listings from anywhere in Canada. So a homeowner in Winnipeg who wanted to handle their own sale could contact a flat-fee company in Ottawa to have their house listed on the national MLS.
But real estate is regulated provincially and there are more than 100 local real estate boards who are allowed to set their own rules as well, leaving flat-fee brokerages with a mish-mash of rules and interpretations to try and understand.
Allan Johnston, the registrar of the Real Estate Council of Ontario, said nothing changed when CREA settled with the Competition Bureau - agents have never been allowed to place listings from one province to another, but the system runs on a complaints basis so it wasn't likely a big issue prior to the introduction of flat-fee brokerages.
"In that sense this is business as usual and nothing has changed," he said. "Some people may have thought this would open the door to a national system, but it did not."
Harvey Real Estate Co. Ltd. is a Hamilton, Ont., brokerage that handles listings for the for-sale-by-owner company PropertyGuys.com. It was told Thursday by the Realtors Association of Hamilton Burlington to remove 100 listings in Prince Edward Island and Alberta within 24 hours.
The brokerage sent a letter to Ms. Aitken asking her to intervene.
"They created the illusion of allowing mere listings and every time we try to do something we get letters from lawyers telling us we can't," said Propertyguys.com director of partnerships Walter Melanson. "Now we're stuck pulling down all these listings on 24-hours notice, and these listings are from normal people who just want to sell their houses. It's not right."
While Ms. Aitken wouldn't comment on the case specifically, her office said it would investigate any complaint that arrives on her desk.
"We take all allegations seriously, including those that a consent agreement has been breached. Breach of a consent agreement is a criminal offence. If we find any evidence that this has occurred, we will not hesitate to take appropriate action," the office said in a statement.

Full text:   How do you compare scientists to business people? Humanitarians to entrepreneurs? By the impact they have on their chosen fields and on the larger community, says Avo Oudabachian, partner, The Caldwell Partners International.
Established in 1995 by Doug Caldwell, the Top 40 Under 40 awards annually celebrate the achievements and leadership qualities of young Canadians. In whittling down the 1,000 nominees to the final honorees, the company's partners and members of an independent advisory board gave equal weighting to five categories: vision and leadership; innovation and achievement; impact; growth and development; and community work.
"You can be the smartest scientist or make a lot of money, but if you are not involved in the community or helped someone grow and develop, you are not going to be in the Top 40," says Mr. Oudabachian.
"These are the people, who, in their chosen field, are bringing about change that has a huge impact."
The awards, which honour recipients who were under 40 in 2010, are this year sponsored by WestJet and The Globe and Mail. The profiles of the Top 40 Under 40 honorees for 2010 were written by: Chris Atchison, Cathryn Atkinson, Moira Dann, Augusta Dwyer, Marlene Habib, Elizabeth Howell, Marjo Johne, Diana McLaren, Becky Rynor, Michael Ryval, Craig Saunders, Rosanna Tamburri and Christina Varga.

THE DISASTER RESPONSE GURU
KIRSTEN JOHNSON, 39
Kirsten Johnson, 39 Assistant professor, faculty of medicine, McGill University, Montreal
Imagine being in your 20s, never having camped before and suddenly being dropped into the middle of a disaster zone and being tasked with helping survivors. This is what Kirsten Johnson aims to avoid by preparing humanitarian aid workers.
Dr. Johnson studied biochemistry at the University of Victoria and medicine at the University of Calgary, and then went to McGill for a program that combined emergency and family medicine. She followed that with a master's in public health at Harvard University.
She is currently an assistant professor in the Faculty of Medicine at McGill, as well as an affiliate faculty member at McGill's Institute for Health and Social Policy.
She's also an affiliate at the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative (HHI) and Program Director of the McGill Humanitarian Studies Initiative (HSI).
The HSI is where Dr. Johnson teaches humanitarian aid workers the nuts and bolts of disaster response. The program trains graduate students and mid-career pros in the "core competencies" for critical scenarios.
Dr. Johnson says two-thirds of the personnel sent to help in Haiti were under 30 and for 90 per cent, it was their first mission. "That kind of humanitarian response requires skilled co-ordination ... We shouldn't be sending kids who don't know how to manage in a crisis - it's inexcusable." And counterproductive to effective aid delivery.
Mother to a two-year-old boy, Dr. Johnson also recently started her own company, The Humanitarian Training Initiative, which provides training to academics, aid workers and non-governmental organizations.

THE CHARITY FOUNDER
FREDERICK DRYDEN, 39
Frederick Dryden, 39 Executive Director, Liberty for Youth Hamilton, Ont.
Shunted between abusive relatives after his father was laid off and unable to support eight children, Frederick Dryden found himself running with the rougher crowd at a young age.
It wasn't until the Jamaican-born young man "connected with the church" in Hamilton that he found a sense of purpose, eventually becoming a financial planner.
As his church involvement grew, he joined their prison-visitation program and realized he could use his difficult youth as a beacon of hope.
"With the support of my wife, I walked away from my job," he said.
It was 2003, and Mr. Dryden had two young children to support when he and a small group of supporters formed Liberty for Youth, a program to reach out to troubled teens in Hamilton.
He sold chocolates and took out a line of credit to keep his charity afloat. When he realized the youth needed constant support to stay clean, he renovated his own basement and took a few of them into his home.
"My resources were drained ... but I just kept going on and on," he said.
In 2006, the Department of Justice Canada provided Liberty for Youth's first grant: a $96,000 boon.
"That project - we helped 165 youth who are at risk and for that, I won a national Me to We award. So that created exposure."
And from there, corporate and volunteer support followed. Liberty for Youth has served nearly 200 youth leaving prison, with an 87-per-cent high-school-graduation rate.
The organization has also provided $35,000 in post-secondary scholarships to youth who have not re-offended.

THE DIGITAL WHIZ KID
LEEROM SEGAL, 31
Leerom Segal, 31 President and CEO, Klick Inc. Toronto
Mr. Segal was only 16 years old when he became chief technology officer at marketing agency Motion Works Group in Toronto.
"There were a lot of individuals who were frustrated to be reporting to a 16-year-old," Mr. Segal acknowledges. "But I was also lucky to be surrounded by people who had more experience than me, and I had incredible mentors who supported and motivated me."
When he ventures out of his office to play, Leerom Segal likes to go for the crazy stuff, like extreme skiing or scaling Mount Everest.
"In my personal life I tend to do the things that really scare me," says Mr. Segal, president and CEO of Klick Inc., an interactive communications agency in Toronto that provides Web solutions, e-learning systems and marketing services to big-name companies such as Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. "I seem to gravitate towards such crazy shenanigans."
But when it comes to his business, Mr. Segal is all business, spending hours planning the company's next moves in minute detail and working out any potential risks. For him, it's all about making sure everything needed to serve Klick's customers is in place at the company he co-founded 14 years ago with a high-school buddy and a former client.
Today, Klick is among the largest marketing services agencies in Canada focused on the pharmaceutical industry, says Mr. Segal. What had started out as a company that provided technical services that helped pharmas put their business online is now a full-service digital marketing agency.
Mr. Segal was only 12 years old when he and a high-school friend started The Byte Doctors, a company that assembled computers - mostly for friends and family, he says.

SEAN O'REILLY, 36 / COMICS AND ANIMATION
The CEO of Arcana
Animator wields pen of steel
Sean O'Reilly credits a "misspent youth" with propelling him to where he is today.
"I've always loved comic books," says the 36-year-old owner and operator of Arcana, Canada's largest comic book company. "My mom would give me money and say, 'Don't spend it all on comic books.'"
He mostly did anyway, parlaying his guilty pleasure into becoming one of Canada's most prolific comic book writers, a publisher, a feature film producer and co-owner of Luximation, a 3-D animation studio.
He started out by producing one 22-page comic book - Kade - in 2004 for $3,500. The Arcana library now boasts 150 graphic novels and 750 comic books, distributed in numerous countries and languages around the world.
"I've always loved genre material, whether it's science fiction, horror, action-thriller, the hero stories, that's kind of been my inspiration," he says.
Mr. O'Reilly also acquired two publishing houses, although he says diversity will be the key to Arcana's continued success.
"Over the past couple of years publishing has become a very difficult objective, with margins literally paper thin," he jokes. "We haven't painted ourselves into a corner with just printing. The company focuses on creating original ideas, known as intellectual properties, telling the stories and branding them."
He is now frequently invited to give guest lectures at North American universities, such as Harvard and the University of British Columbia, on the creative process behind these "branded story worlds."
Mr. O'Reilly has also produced five feature films, writing the stories for three of those. Luximation's first feature film is the stereoscopic 3-D animated feature film, The Clockwork Girl , a character co-created by Kevin Hanna.
Mr. O'Reilly has four children, with his wife Michelle. They live in Coquitlam, B.C. He credits his kids with changing his motivation and inspiration.
"My focus has shifted from the muscle-bound, buxom women into more of an all-ages ... entertainment vehicle. ... They appeal to the young, the old, the male, the female."

DEIRDRE HORGAN, 38 / BOOK RETAILING
Executive vice-president and chief marketing officer, Indigo Books & Music, Inc.
With a love of reading inspired by her teacher mother, coupled with an economics degree, Ms. Horgan found herself the perfect challenge: to be in charge of strategic planning for Indigo Books and Music at a time when traditional media are competing with the digital realm.
Even when she goes on vacation, "The first day is spent picking out books," she said. But these days, she doesn't just love the printed version.
"When I'm travelling, I love booting up my Kobo," she said about the company's electronic reader.
The Kobo is an example of how the company is rising to the challenge of digital reading. Indigo is also expanding into toys and lifestyle items to complement books and Ms. Horgan's team is charged with marketing the evolution of the brand to consumers.
Ms. Horgan studied economics at the University of Western Ontario. Her first job was with management consultants The Boston Consulting Group. She wanted to try working on the client side and was seconded to Indigo for a year to create an online strategy. When it launched, she was asked to stay on full-time and she ended up responsible for overall marketing, brand management and overall strategy.
"Right now, with digital reading on the rise, these are exciting times."
For instance, her team has worked on launching a new rewards program called Plum Rewards that will include personalized recommendations based on readers' preferences.
She is married and has a son, Dylan. She helped create Indigo's Love of Reading foundation, which has raised more than $10-million to bring new educational materials to high-needs schools.

MUHAMMAD MAMDANI, 39 / PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY
Associate professor, University of Toronto and Director, Applied Health Research Centre, St. Michael's Hospital
How do we as a society decide which medicines make sense for us? Dr. Mamdani helps policy makers make such decisions by evaluating the risks and costs of drugs.
Dr. Mamdani got a Doctor of Pharmacy at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and then studied at Wayne State University in Detroit for a master's in economics.
From there it was on to Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., for his master's degree in public health, in biostatistics and epidemiology.
He was recruited to the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences in Toronto, which has several administrative health-care databases with anonymous data that can be used for research. He was interested in using the databases to look at the effects of different drugs on patients' health and how resources are used, allowing for better decisions about health-care delivery.
Dr. Mamdani's research has provided insights on issues such as what sorts of doses lead to opioid-related death by overdose from prescription narcotic drug use. He was appointed Director of the Applied Health Research Centre of the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of St. Michael's Hospital in 2007. The centre's aim is to help clinical researchers to design, fund and run studies by providing skilled personnel and technologies.
Besides his research work, he is an associate professor in the department of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation of the Faculty of Medicine, and the Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Toronto.
Dr. Mamdani was born in Dhaka, Bangladesh and moved to Guelph, Ont. with his family when he was 5. His community service includes setting up communal health insurance in northern Pakistan, which allows people living on pennies a day to have basic health care and immunization.

SOM SEIF, 34 / FINANCIAL SERVICES
President and CEO, Claymore Investments, inc.
Som Seif started talking with an American client about building an independent investment house in 2005. Today, he is president and CEO of Claymore Investments, Inc., with more than $6-billion in assets under management.
After graduating from the University of Toronto as an engineer in 1999, Mr. Seif went into investment banking at RBC Capital Markets, but it wasn't quite what he wanted.
"I always wanted to be an entrepreneur. I had this itch inside of me," he says.
At 27, he founded Claymore Investments. The company, at the time, was just him and his laptop, working out of his house.
"The industry was one where I felt there was a lot of room for innovation and improvement," he says. The idea was "to create a better investment management business focused on the client with cheaper, low-cost, intelligent solutions."
What the company created was a system of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that use the sort of disciplined approach found in indexed funds, but with some of the advantages of active management. And they've consistently out-performed the indexes, Mr. Seif says.
Mr. Seif is a competitive water polo player. He also sits on Sunnybrook Hospital's Cancer Campaign Cabinet fundraising committee.

ANDY MCCREATH, 35, AND CHRISTIAN DARBYSHIRE, 35 / PUBLIC EVENTS
Partners, tinePublic Inc.
'We wanted to produce events for young professionals," says Andy McCreath. "The people who were producing events, a lot of time it was dinners that cost $300 or $400, which priced young people out of the market."
Friends since the age of 12, Mr. McCreath and Christian Darbyshire started off in 2005 with a conference for young entrepreneurs in their hometown of Calgary. With speakers as diverse as hockey player Kelly Hrudey, politician Peter MacKay and Donald Rancic - the first winner of Donald Trump's popular show, The Apprentice - their newly minted company, tinePublic Inc., sold 1,800 tickets.
Since then, they've continued to draw huge crowds to high-profile events across Canada - more than 200,000 spectators in total, says Mr. McCreath. Some of their biggest 'gets' include former United States president George W. Bush - making his first public appearance after leaving office - as well as former British prime minister Tony Blair, former U.S. president Bill Clinton, former governor of Alaska Sarah Palin and, most recently, former governor of California and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, whom they had been pursuing for years.

NORIE CAMPBELL, 39 / GENERAL COUNSEL
Senior vice-president and assistant general counsel, TD Bank Group
As assistant general counsel to the bank, Norie Campbell oversees the Canadian legal department and its 60 lawyers, which serve business and corporate functions at Toronto-Dominion Bank from its Bay Street headquarters in Toronto. She also directs legal support for the bank's corporate development side.
"We've been on quite a growth tear. We now have as many retail branches in the bank in the United States as we do in Canada. These were all transactions I've worked on," she says. This includes looking at legal issues that might be part of any purchase by the bank.
She sees her role as guarding and improving a 150-year-old Canadian institution, and passing it on in good shape to the next generation.
Ms. Campbell and her husband, also a lawyer, have a three-year-old and a seven-month-old. She is currently on a graduated return from maternity leave and is preparing to take on a new role at TD Bank Group, as general counsel of the entire bank, starting in November.

GLORI MELDRUM, 37 / SEXUAL ABUSE PREVENTION
Founder and Chair, Little Warriors
Fighting a hidden menace
Glori Meldrum knows first-hand the horrors that victims of child sexual abuse face. So she dedicates much of her time and energy to helping those who have suffered the same fate and to ensuring it doesn't happen to others.
Three years ago, Ms. Meldrum founded Little Warriors, an Edmonton-based non-profit agency that works to prevent sexual abuse. "I was one of those kids," Ms. Meldrum says. "I'm a little warrior myself."
The organization offers a three-hour program to teach participants how to recognize the signs of child abuse, how to prevent it from occurring, and what to do if they know a child has been abused. Since its founding, the group has trained more than 4,000 adults across Canada. It also works to raise awareness about the prevalence of child sexual abuse and provides information about support services.
For Ms. Meldrum, the horror started when she was eight years old. For almost two years she was abused by a family member. The situation was made all the worse when she, with the help of her mother, reported the crime to the authorities, but their pleas were dismissed.
By age 12, she was having thoughts of suicide. "There's nothing easy about being a survivor," she says. "You have lots of shame and not a lot of self-love."
Later this year, Ms. Meldrum hopes to launch an integrated healing centre for victims of child sexual abuse on a ranch in Alberta. The centre, she says, will treat up to 300 children and 300 adults a year and will also offer support programs for spouses and families of victims. She says the facility will be the first of its kind in North America.
Ms. Meldrum was born and raised in Miramichi, N.B. She graduated from Dalhousie University in 1995 with a Bachelor of Commerce degree and then moved to Edmonton, where she founded g[squared], an advertising and marketing agency. She and her husband Gary also own a website design and development firm and a commercial-property management company.
It was her success in business that gave Ms. Meldrum the confidence to speak out about her past. She now spends much of her time on philanthropic work, mainly through Little Warriors. She is also writing a book about her experience to help others who have been abused. "The biggest thing that survivors want to know is that there's hope to get better and to understand how they can get there," she says. "Even though you may have had a traumatic life, which I did, you can still be happy."
Ms. Meldrum has two young daughters and an adopted son from Ethiopia. She and her husband travel to Ethiopia once a year to do volunteer work. "For me, it's about making a difference," she says. "I love being of service and I love helping people."

MICHELE MOSCA, 39 / QUANTUM COMPUTING
Deputy director, co-founder, Institute for Quantum Computing, University of Waterloo
The simple fact is, most people don't understand what Michele Mosca does. But what he does will greatly affect how we live, touching on everything from banking and sending e-mail to applying for a passport.
Dr. Mosca is a founder and deputy director of the Institute for Quantum Computing, an interdisciplinary facility dedicated to figuring out how quantum theory can be applied to create exponentially more powerful computers and programs.
A math graduate from the University of Waterloo, which today houses the institute, Dr. Mosca went to Oxford University for graduate studies in quantum computer algorithms. "I was interested in it because I'd be able to join a leading classic cryptography department," he says. "When I left Canada in 1995, there were major funding cuts. It wasn't clear I'd be able to come back to Canada and have a job."
That funding problem began to turn around in the late-'90s. He was lured back to the University of Waterloo by the opportunity to set up a new quantum computing department. He set out to re-create the environment he'd loved at Oxford.
"If you want to do quantum computing, you have to be interdisciplinary," he says. "We use tools from math, physics, chemistry and engineering to make the whole. I wanted to not only work on the mathematical aspects, but also to apply them and work with the physicists. At Oxford I benefited from the broad range of experts around me."
In addition to establishing the institute, Dr. Mosca recently helped set up a new, collaborative graduate program. This allows, for example, a student to earn a PhD in computer science with a specialization in quantum information, a program that is attracting students from around the world.

MATTHEW CORRIN, 29 / HEALTHY FAST FOOD
Founder and CEO, Freshii
In his first week of business, Matthew Corrin's chef sliced his finger, the kitchen manager broke his nose when he fainted from the sight of the blood and an employee broke in and stole the takings. Not the most auspicious of beginnings for Freshii Inc., but Mr. Corrin never wavered from his goal: changing the way people eat.
Just six years later, there are more than 80 locations that follow Mr. Corrin's recipe for fast, healthy meals served in biodegradable packaging, spread across North America, in Austria and even in Dubai.
A media relations graduate from University of Western Ontario who flunked his business class - "I didn't understand it," he says, "and found it stressful," - Mr. Corrin has become an entrepreneur determined to revolutionize the restaurant industry.
Indeed, Mr. Corrin says his non-traditional business model has helped lead such rapid growth. While he continues to open new locations, he also works with like-minded business people who develop markets in their regions and bring his holistic concept to new markets where vegetarian options may be limited. He makes sure his partners are philosophically aligned.With two little girls, Mr. Corrin finds himself juggling the grueling travel of his job with fatherhood. Wife Kate was the staffer who stepped in to help him do food prep when his chefs were taken off in an ambulance. "That's why I married her," he jokes.

KEVIN LI, 39 / INVESTMENT BANKING
Managing Director, Head of Diversified industries and Co-Head of TMT Investment Banking, CIBC
Kevin Li cut his investment banking teeth on big mergers and acquisitions across industries during the first nine years of his career, but now his plate is happily full of clients in the giant media and telecom sector.
Which role does he prefer? It's a toss-up, says Mr. Li, who has been with CIBC World Markets for most of his 17 years in financial services. He started after graduating with a BSc in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, then moved on to Morgan Stanley for three years before returning to CIBC World Markets in 2003.
While in his current position he manages the investment banking relationships for clients in the media, telecom and diversified industries, advising companies on raising money or buying and selling assets, "those formative years in mergers and acquisitions were extremely important," says Mr. Li.
"I consider both M & A, and what I do now equally important. The work is very rewarding and it's an honour to be advising the CEOs of Canada's leading companies to help their businesses succeed."
He prepares himself for everyday work pressures by leading a balanced life, spending a lot of time with his wife and nine-month-old son, getting exercise and volunteering with Second Harvest and the St. Michael's Hospital Foundation.

MARIE-PIER ST-HILAIRE, 33 / BUSINESS TRAINING
President, AFI
Two MBAs, a house full of kids and a flair for business
When Marie-Pier St-Hilaire was 10, she wanted to earn money on her own, so she got herself a paper route delivering Quebec City's Le Soleil. Three months later, she had three of them - and had hired her brothers to work for her.
As the founder-president of training and business consulting company AFI - which stands for Academie de formation informatique in French - she still likes the creative part of being an entrepreneur best. "I'm the person who has all the ideas for a project, and then I find [someone] to take care of them," she laughs.
Ms. St-Hilaire was just 21 and still completing her MBA at Laval University when she set up her own business in 1997. Yet even then her goal was "to change the face of learning in Quebec," she says. Most business training courses, she notes, were something people signed up for to impress the boss or burnish a resume. "I wanted to make the training budget more efficient and strategic," she says. "So instead of training being tactics, or another social advantage, we use the training to help the organization grow and keep their focus on their mission."
She also wanted her company, which offers 900 courses, coaching in change and knowledge management, and communications strategies for business leaders, to be woman-centric. For her, AFI's employees are its most valuable resource and she encourages clients to think about their workers the same way. "So when we talk about family and business and how to keep good talent and still be a mom, we have a lot of programs for that kind of woman here," she points out.
Growing up in a business family, she got good coaching in her early years as company president from her father, who runs an IT business. With 85 employees and another 32 exclusive partners, AFI is now three times larger than his, "so my dad did a really great job," she jokes.
She devotes time to organizing charity fundraisers, with a focus on golf, her favourite sport. And aside from adding an Owner/President Management Program MBA from Harvard to her resumé, she and her husband are about to see their family of four expand to five.

Leonard Brody says he enjoys supporting "passionistas" - people with community-based interests or passions - through Clarity Digital Group and its website examiner.com.
"Passionate about recycling, about fishing or mountain biking or cooking. What we do is about passionistas, not about breaking news."
Examiner.com is a media and information source that is currently in 245 markets across the U.S. and Canada. "It's kind of like the reinvention of local news, in a way. It is a huge network of trusted insiders in local markets that talk about the things they are passionate about," says Vancouver-based Mr. Brody. It employs 70,000 local journalists and attracts roughly 20-25 million hits a month, making it a Top 100 site in North America.

NAMAN BUDHDEO, 38 / TRAVEL
Chief executive officer, FlightNetwork.com
In 2005, Naman Budhdeo started online travel agency FlightNetwork.com with a single part-time employee.
"It was nothing tremendously innovative, but in 2005 it was fairly unique for online transaction for travel. At the time I didn't think of it competing with Expedia, but more with the bricks-and-mortar travel agencies," Mr. Budhdeo said.
But the company flew far higher than he expected. FlightNetwork.com is now the second largest online travel agency in Canada, with 5-per-cent market share. Mr. Budhdeo puts it down to investing in online advertising and the new-media business model. Mr. Budhdeo has also created a software company, FareMatrix, a lead-generation company called Booking Navigator, and angel-invests in new companies.

BRIAN COOMBES, 36 / MEDICAL BIOCHEMISTRY
Associate Chair, Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, McMaster
Dr. Brian Coombes runs a lab in the Michael DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University, where researchers are looking at pathogenic bacteria, the kind that enter the human body and cause serious havoc. The focus is on countermeasures those pathogens have evolved to defend themselves and withstand our immune system's attempts to kill them off.
New virulent bacteria have proven to be unfazed by existing antibiotics. With $345-million in sponsored research, Dr. Coombes's goal is to some day reach a point "where we could potentially have an opportunity to improve people's health through the creation of new knowledge ... but also new antimicrobials, new ways to combat the evolution of infections."

KAREN BAKKER, 39 / WATER MANAGEMENT
Director, Program on Water Governance, and Associate Professor of Geography, UBC
Canadians have taken water for granted for too long, warns Karen Bakker, one of the country's foremost experts on water governance.
In some parts of the country, including the prairies and B.C.'s Okanagan Valley, "the squeeze is already being felt," she adds.
Dr. Bakker was born in Montreal and raised in Ottawa. She completed her undergraduate studies at McMaster University in Hamilton. She was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship in 1995 to study at the University of Oxford in England.
It was there that she turned her attention to the study of water management. "I felt that it was likely that some of the most pressing challenges we would face politically and environmentally in Canada over the next few decades would be related to water," she says. At the same time, the water crisis in many developing countries was also becoming apparent, she adds.
After completing her doctorate in 1999 and then a postdoctoral fellowship, also at Oxford, Dr. Bakker took up her post as a geography professor at the University of British Columbia in 2002. Three years later, she founded the university's Program on Water Governance, an interdisciplinary research centre that conducts research on water sustainability, security and management. She remains the centre's director.
The Vancouver resident also holds a Canada Research Chair in Political Ecology and is an associate of UBC's Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability, which focuses on environmental research. She has written extensively about water governance and security, including three books. has served as an adviser to numerous national and international agencies, including the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Conference Board of Canada, the United Nations Development Program, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and several government departments.
She is married and has two young daughters, both budding environmentalists.

DOMINIC GIROUX, 35 / UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATOR
President and Vice-Chancellor, Laurentian university
Dominic Giroux's unconventional background was exactly what the university he became president of was looking for.
"I became a school board trustee at 19, was elected school board chair at 21, and appointed assistant deputy minister at age 29," says Mr. Giroux, an Ottawa native who became chairman of Ottawa's French Catholic school board two years after being elected as trustee, and later caught the attention of a senior civil servant at Ontario's Ministry of Education.
Mr. Giroux's background was a perfect fit for Laurentian: a young bilingual Francophone who was familiar with the aboriginal community and could revitalize the university's image. Mr. Giroux has two degrees from University of Ottawa (social sciences and education) and an MBA from école des Hautes études Commerciales in Montreal.
Since his arrival, Mr. Giroux can point with pride to double-digit increases in enrolment. "We also have a brand-new medical school and are about to launch a school of architecture," says Mr. Giroux, who fetches his two children from school each day.

NICHOLAS JOHNSON, 38 / ENERGY M & A
Managing Director, and Co-Head, Corporate Finance, FirstEnergy Capital Corp.
Despite the fact that Nicholas Johnson has spent 14 years in the energy sector and his department has executed more than 320 deals exceeding $30-billion of capital raised since 2006, he laughs off the notion that he has oil and gas in his blood. "I don't see myself as an oil-and-gas person," says Mr. Johnson, an Edmonton native who graduated in 1993 with a bachelor of commerce from University of Alberta. "I'm a finance person."
In 1997, he was hired as FirstEnergy's first analyst, a job that entailed 70-80 hour weeks, and worked his way up the ladder to become managing director in 2006.
In the meantime, the industry grew, too, as crude oil prices moved inexorably upwards.
FirstEnergy is a Canadian energy sector underwriter and employs 140 people.
"The thrill in this business is helping clients build their companies," says Mr. Johnson, adding that, besides arranging financings in Canada, his team has executed M & A deals for companies with assets in North Africa, Australia and South America.
Currently, his 13-person department handles six to eight deals at a time. They vary in complexity and size, with some projects as small as under $10-million, and others over $500-million.

BRADLEY SCHWARTZ, 39 / MEDIA
Senior vice-president and general manager, The MUCH MTV Group, CTV Inc.
Canadians who want their MTV can thank Bradley Schwartz for giving it to them. In the fall of 2005, the Toronto native returned from New York, where he had been working for MTV Networks as director of global marketing, to start the wildly popular music video channel in Canada.
Within five years, MTV Canada has grown exponentially in ratings and revenue, says Mr. Schwartz. A number of the shows it has produced - such as The After Show , Peak Season , 4REAL , and 1 Girl 5 Gays - have found their way to global audiences.
Later, Mr. Schwartz became senior vice-president and general manager of the Much MTV Group. This put him in charge of both MTV and MuchMusic plus other media properties that included MuchMore, MTV2, PunchMuch, MuchVibe, MuchLOUD and MuchMoreRetro.
Mr. Schwartz says he has had many surreal moments over the past five years.
"It's amazing, walking into the building every day and walking by the studio where U2 has been, where Madonna and Lady Gaga have performed, and to be able to meet basically every major artist," he says.
At the end of March, Mr. Schwartz left Much MTV to become senior vice-president of programming and operations at FUSE, a New York-based network with programming similar to Much MTV.

CODY CHURCH, 39 / INVESTMENT
Managing director, TriWest Capital Partners
Cody Church is the co-founder of Calgary-based private equity group TriWest Capital, one of the first such firms to focus on investments in sectors other than oil and gas in Alberta.
Mr. Church's family has been part of the fabric of the province for generations, and his large extended family still live in the region. Mr. Church and his family live on a ranch outside Calgary, raising a commercial herd of 400 cows.
He began as an investment banker on Wall Street in the mid-1990s after graduating in economics from Harvard University. He returned to Alberta in 1997 and started TriWest Capital, with the partners buying controlling interest of 22 companies in 12 years. Investors have seen a 29-per-cent return on investment in 12 years, he said, because the company stuck with what it knew, which wasn't oil and gas.
Mr. Church is proud of his company's "family approach." "I get to work with exceptionally talented, high-integrity people, who make all sorts of contributions to the communities they are in."

KYLE JEWORSKI, 36 / / GRAIN HANDLING
Vice-president, Grain Merchandising & Transportation, Viterra
As an executive at Viterra, one of the largest Canadian grain handlers and food processors whose operations span 50 countries, Kyle Jeworski sees his job as helping to feed a growing world.
"We supply ingredients to the world, so we play a very important role in some businesses that manufacture food products," says Mr. Jeworski, a Regina native. Formerly known as Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, the firm markets an annual average of about 45 per cent of the grain in Western Canada, handling 16 million metric tonnes.
Mr. Jeworski has seen many corporate changes since he joined. The organization went from a co-operative to a publicly-listed company and hit a turbulent patch in the late 1990s, when CEO Mayo Schmidt led a drastic restructuring. "We were on the brink of bankruptcy and forced to go back to the basics," recalls Mr. Jeworski, part of the restructuring team. "We had really strong leadership and were able to take the company from where it was to the huge success that we're seeing today."

When the recession hit in 2008, it was bad news for most. For Natasha Sharpe, however, it opened a door.
Dr. Sharpe had spent a decade working in corporate finance and risk assessment at Bank of Montreal. Recession-hit insurance companies realized they needed better risk assessment. Last year, Sun Life Financial hired Dr. Sharpe as its first chief credit risk officer.
Her job is to create risk policy for the company's $110-billion in managed assets and lead a new department in an institution with joint ventures around the world. "This is a big, conservative organization and for the past 150-odd years they've managed by taking conservative bets, investing in AA and AAA rated companies. The credit crisis changed all that," she says. Dr. Sharpe is also chair of the board at Kensington Health Centre, a 350-bed long-term care facility in Toronto. Dr. Sharpe first earned a PhD in bioethics from the University of Toronto, but then took an MBA at Rotman and went into finance.

SURESH NARINE, 39 / BIOMATERIALS
Professor and director of Trent University Biomaterials Research Program
Seeds hold the secret to brand new materials
Much of the materials we use are made from non-renewable and environmentally harmful petrochemicals.
Dr. Narine's lab aims to change that by using chemistry and physics to turn renewable plant resources into safe edible, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and industrial products.
The work of the Biomaterials Research Program he directs at Trent University is focused on oil seeds. "We take oils and fats and convert them into a wide variety of materials, including food," he said.
But, he cautions, "It's not okay to just do scientific research and make whiz-bang products. It has to be coupled with social and business considerations."
So his program looks at the bigger picture and works with other groups, for instance on how to benefit rural communities by expanding the use of what they grow beyond food. There are also issues like not supplanting food crops with biofuel crops and taking into account water and land use. And the group is working with other countries, including Israel, India and in South America, to commercialize products.
We only use about 20 to 30 per cent of crops, he says, adding that much can be done with what is now considered waste.
One of the lab's group of patents is around making zero trans fat margarines and confections with significantly lower saturated fat than existing products.
They also have patents on using the plant oils to make polyurethanes to replace the synthetic version that can range from foam to seals and adhesives.
The group also created the technology to produce the next generation of lubricants, such as engine oil, from plant oils.
In the area of biomedicine, the lab has developed bio-based plastics that can be used for things like joint replacements and dental implants.
Dr. Narine is from Guyana and came to Trent University to do his undergraduate and master's degrees in chemical physics. He then went on to do his PhD in food science and materials physics at the University of Guelph.
After a stint in industrial research and development in the United States, the University of Alberta recruited him and he spent nine years doing research on biologically derived materials. Then Trent came knocking.
"I was always interested in going back but I didn't know how to help Guyana," he said.
But through an agreement with Trent, he has been volunteering since 2005 as the director of the National Institute of Applied Science and Technology in Guyana and commutes once a month.
One of the issues Guyana has is that it imports all of its fossil fuels, but has arable land, water resources, low population density and available labour.
So the institute developed local technology for biofuels and there's a community in the hinterland that has been operating solely on biofuels produced from palm oil since 2006, employing 120 people, he says.
"Our society is grappling with a never-ending list of things that threaten our survival. We have to have a different way of dealing with all the crises we face, and appropriate technology is more important than high technology," he said.
Dr. Narine is the father of triplets and plays Indian drums. He is also an avid motorcyclist.

ANGELA SANTIAGO, 39 / FOOD SERVICES ENTREPRENEUR
CEO of The Little Potato Company
Small potatoes, big dreams
Angela Santiago was finishing up her BA at the University of Alberta when she got the potato bug. Now the CEO of The Little Potato Company in Edmonton, Ms. Santiago found the inspiration for her business future close to home.
Her serial entrepreneur father, Jacob Van der Schaaf, had grown up in the Netherlands with a love of agriculture. He perceived a niche for the high-quality produce grown by his father - specifically potatoes - and in 1996 decided to plant a field and see whether there would be any interest in the product.
"He convinced me to help him market small potatoes - one acre's worth - harvest it by hand, wash it in the bath, and we delivered them to restaurants. Then the Banff Springs Hotel showed an interest in it," said Ms. Santiago.
Next year, they grew a few more acres and approached a retail company. An interview took place in the stairwell at the company as the pair arrived to talk about being a potential supplier.
"We didn't even get in the office. ... After just a few minutes, the company said they would take everything we had," Ms. Santiago said. "With Little Potatoes, sales is never an issue; it's the growing of enough product. Timing was everything."
The Little Potato Company is now a multimillion-dollar company, with $32-million in annual sales - almost doubling every year since starting - with 5 to 8 per cent of sales currently going to the United States.
Ultimately, says Ms. Santiago, the company speaks to consumers' need to buy nourishing, convenient food at a good price.
"There is a huge trend to eating more healthily but we still want it quick," she said, adding the potatoes are "healthy, the skin is still on, you don't have to peel them, you throw them in a pot."
Another aspect of the product she thinks appeals to consumers is the act of feeding their families: "We still want to participate in our meal making."
Ms. Santiago is married to a husband she says has been very involved in the home and supportive of the business, and they have four children.
A recent health scare with breast cancer has caused her to review her priorities, and Ms. Santiago says she was able to take advantage of "the great team at Little Potato" for support.
The disease was caught early, and Ms. Santiago says she sees the episode as a blessing.
"You figure out on your own what you need to have to balance your personal and work lives, or the universe will tell you."
She is on leave for a little longer, spending time with her children and travelling. But she also has her eyes on future plans for Little Potato, with plans to hit $100-million in sales, with the majority of sales being in the United States.
"I love what I do and the people we work with. I love coming to work. I think, 'What's more humbling than being able to create food?'" she said.

Inside the heated sale of Lord Beaverbrook's legendary estate

Author: Adams, James

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/inside-heated-sale-lord-beaverbrooks-legendary/docview/863526961/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Faced with rising insurance costs on its art holdings, the need to cover costs for the Cherkley Court renovation and the demands of other charities it had long supported, the foundation hit upon the idea of selling what it came to describe as "a number of paintings" in the Fredericton gallery.

Full text:   Investors plan to build a golf course and hotel at the site, with proceeds of the sale expected to go to an N.B. gallery as part of the settlement in a long legal fight, James Adams writes
The storied English estate at the heart of a legal battle between New Brunswick's Beaverbrook Art Gallery and a British charity has been sold to a consortium that wants to convert it to a hotel and golf course.
Representatives of the Beaverbrook U.K. Foundation, headed by one of the grandsons of the first, Canadian-born Lord Beaverbrook, confirmed the sale last week of Cherkley Court, but declined to say whether it realized its asking price of more than £20-million ($32-million).
One hundred years ago, Ontario-born, New Brunswick-raised press baron Max Aitken bought the approximately 160-hectare rural Surrey property shortly after his knighthood by George V. Before Beaverbrook's death there in 1964, Cherkley saw a steady stream of important visitors, including Sir Winston Churchill, Rudyard Kipling, W.B. Yeats, David Lloyd George, H.G. Wells, even Adolf Hitler's foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, as well as Bonar Law, the first only Canadian-born British prime minister.
An unspecified portion of the proceeds from the sale is expected to go the Beaverbrook gallery as part of an out-of-court settlement reached last fall by the gallery and the U.K. foundation. Its details, worked out after two disputed arbitration hearings, are secret. But it is known the Fredericton-based gallery obtained clear ownership of 85 artworks valued by some at more than $100-million, including paintings by Thomas Gainsborough, J.M.W. Turner and Lucian Freud. The foundation, for its part, gained ownership of the 48 other, largely lesser artworks in the dispute.
The site's new purchaser, Longshot, a consortium of 14 English investors, has indicated wishes to convert the estate's park and farmland to a members-only golf club (including the construction of a club house) and the manor house and adjacent cottages to a luxury hotel. The purchase price is expected to be revealed later this spring when the new owner registers title.
But these developments require approval from the local planning commission and council. Organizations such as the Campaign to Protect Rural England already have said they'll oppose Longshot's plans. For one, they argue, Surrey is already home to 141 golf courses and does not need another venue that would take agricultural land out of production. An earlier application by a Singapore developer to build a golf course on the site was denied in 1995, resulting in the Beaverbrook U.K. Foundation buying it back as a registered historic property in 1998. It had been home to the first Lord Beaverbrook's wife until her death in 1994.
Cherkley Court became a bone of contention between 2002 and 2004 when the U.K. foundation, headed by Maxwell Aitken III - a grandson of the first Lord Beaverbrook - decided it would spend millions upgrading the estate. It planned to convert it to a Beaverbrook museum and library and also make it a venue for corporate events and weddings. The estate's gardens and fountains also were to be renovated and opened to the public, with the expectation they could draw 50,000 visitors annually.
But how to finance it? At this time the foundation and its sister philanthropy, the Beaverbrook Canadian Foundation, believed it owned outright more than 200 works housed in the Beaverbrook gallery in Fredericton. The gallery had been established as a gift to New Brunswick in 1959 by the first Lord Beaverbrook and provisioned by him with an eclectic selection of paintings, drawings and sculpture. But the U.K. foundation believed the artworks were simply loans, recoverable at any time. It was particularly interested in The Fountain of Indolence , an 1834 canvas by Turner, and Freud's Hotel Bedroom , from 1954 - paintings that, if sold at auction, likely would fetch tens of millions of dollars.
Faced with rising insurance costs on its art holdings, the need to cover costs for the Cherkley Court renovation and the demands of other charities it had long supported, the foundation hit upon the idea of selling what it came to describe as "a number of paintings" in the Fredericton gallery. In addition, it planned to hang some of the gallery's canvases at Cherkley Court "on a rotational basis." To sweeten the deal for the gallery, the foundation said it would donate a large portion of the realized sales to the gallery's endowment. However, the Fredericton board, fearing it would be denuded of some of its most valuable holdings, balked at the proposition and decided to determine once and for all just what were gifts and what were loans. By spring of 2004, with renovations to Cherkley Court well under way, both sides were gearing up for the legal fight that would consume them for the next six years.

THE MASTERPIECES
The dispute to claim the artworks
Last September, an out-of-court settlement determined the ownership of 133 paintings and drawings housed in Fredericton's Beaverbrook Art Gallery. Still in question though is the ownership of 78 works in the vaults and on the gallery walls.
The Beaverbrook Canadian Foundation is claiming ownership. The group is headed by New York-based Timothy Aitken, one of the first Lord Beaverbrook's grandsons and the cousin of London-based Maxwell Aitken III, who is head of the Beaverbrook U.K. Foundation. It was Maxwell's foundation that signed the out-of-court accord giving the Fredericton gallery title to 85 of the 133 works the foundation claimed it owned. The remaining 48 were deemed the foundation's property.
The works claimed by the Canadian foundation - including a large, classic Cornelius Krieghoff winter scene from 1860 called Merrymaking and J.W. Morrice's Concarneau Cirque from 1910 - are considered less valuable than the other 85 that the gallery obtained title to last year. Two of those alone - J.M.W. Turner's The Fountain of Indolence and Lucian Freud's Hotel Bedroom - were deemed by the gallery in 2004 to be worth between $22-million and $34-million in total.
Since last year's settlement, the U.K. foundation has been selling its most valuable Beaverbrook gallery holdings at auction. The hope is to help cover litigation costs and continue its support of other charities.
In January, Sotheby's New York, for example, realized more than $7-million, including buyer's premium, by hammering down the jewel of the U.K. foundation's collection, Claude-Joseph Vernet's A Grand View of the Sea Shore in the Mediterranean (1776).
Last fall, the foundation also put Cherkley Court, the Surrey estate the first Lord Beaverbrook purchased for £25,000 in 1911, on the real-estate market, with an asking price of more than £20-million ($32-million). Before last year's settlement the foundation had poured tens of millions of pounds into renovating the property, partly in the hope of drawing at least 50,000 visitors a year. But a Surrey newspaper reports the estate had only 13,000 visitors in 2008, 16,000 in 2009.
Meanwhile, the Beaverbrook Canadian Foundation is still on record as wishing to realize its claim through the New Brunswick courts. However, it's known that the foundation and the Beaverbrook Art Gallery have been participating in closed-door "settlement conferences" supervised by David Smith, Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench of New Brunswick, most recently last week. More meetings are expected, but none has been scheduled.

THE ESTATE
The fight for the land: All manor of details
Acquired by Lord Beaverbrook in 1911.
Was his home until his death in 1964.
Lord Beaverbrook used it to entertain guests including writer Rudyard Kipling and then and future British prime ministers Bonar Law, Herbert Asquith, Harold Macmillan and Winston Churchill.
An important centre for Lord Beaverbrook's activities in the Second World War as minister for aircraft production and a key member of Churchill's War Cabinet.
Set in 150 hectares of park and woodlands. Includes 6.5 hectares of landscaped gardens.
The main house has five reception rooms and six bedroom suites, including one referred to as "Churchill's Room."
The service wing contains staff accommodations and offices. There's also an orangery and indoor swimming pool.
The secondary house on the estate has six bedrooms.
There are two cottages and a former stable block, which now comprise the gardener's cottage and a range of garages, offices and stores.

THE VOTE
The battle over arts funding
The arts haven't been an issue in the federal election, except perhaps in Fredericton, where Conservative incumbent Keith Ashfield is up for re-election. It's also home to the Beaverbrook Art Gallery.
When the gallery embarked on the first phase of a renovation and expansion campaign, Mr. Ashfield, the Minister of National Revenue, provided assistance from Ottawa in the form of a $3.4-million cheque.
As a result, Mr. Ashfield has come under attack from a member of his own party, Bernard Valcourt, a candidate in Madawaska- Restigouche. Expectations are high that Mr. Valcourt, a Mulroney loyalist and former MP will prevail on May 2. If so, some observers think he might strive to be as big a player as Mr. Ashfield.
A press report last weekend says that at his nomination meeting, Mr. Valcourt complained about "'millions of dollars" being funnelled to art galleries while parts of the province suffer from economic woes.
Mr. Valcourt's stand is echoed by Liberal candidate and Ashfield rival Randy McKeen who claims that "millions and millions" of public money, much of it from the province, has been spent on the gallery's disputes. Adding that sum to the $3.4-million in federal funds for the renovation, Mr. McKeen suggested New Brunswick taxpayers have benefited the gallery too much.

Finding the small truths and 'weird layers' of Vancouver

Author: Lederman, Marsha

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/finding-small-truths-weird-layers-vancouver/docview/863364047/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: [Zsuzsi Gartner] deals with the truths of Vancouver living through implausibility. The city's obsession with real estate - and real estate's impact on nature - are satirized with a monster-house-swallowing mountain. Gartner nods to the city's history with eco-terrorism by creating a support group for recovering terrorists.

Full text:   Imagine a city where people get paid to display election signs on their lawn. Such a scenario, as described in Zsuzsi Gartner's short story Once, We Were Swedes , would have the potential (were it expanded to include federal elections) to transform the Vancouver neighbourhood where Gartner lives, where currently you'd be hard-pressed to find an election sign for a candidate other than a New Democrat. Welcome to Commercial Drive. And welcome toBetter Living Through Plastic Explosives , Gartner's new short story collection - very much grounded in her East Vancouver neighbourhood, with a hyperrealist twist.
"The city is organic to the stories, I would say, for a great many of these," Gartner says in one of the many coffee shops dotting the Drive, as it's known to locals. "It's inextricable."
With one exception, each story is set on the West Coast - most of them in or just outside Vancouver - and so are rooted in the truths and little details of the city: almost-suburban North Vancouver cul-de-sacs backing onto forested areas; White Spot French fries; hipsters tacking up posters on Commercial Drive telephone polls.
"I've become less frustrated with Vancouver," says Gartner, 50, who has lived in the city for 20 years (she was born in Winnipeg, grew up in Calgary and has also lived in Toronto and Ottawa). "The city really lends itself to this kind of examination because of all the weird layers."
Gartner deals with the truths of Vancouver living through implausibility. The city's obsession with real estate - and real estate's impact on nature - are satirized with a monster-house-swallowing mountain. Gartner nods to the city's history with eco-terrorism by creating a support group for recovering terrorists. There's also a kidnapping marmot mascot, which Gartner is quick to point out she came up with before VANOC ever introduced Mukmuk, the Olympic mascot sidekick modelled on the endangered Vancouver Island marmot.
"When they actually picked the marmot ... I was thinking people are not going to realize how unbelievably prescient I was," she says.
Eleven minutes into the interview, though, Gartner changes the subject away from Vancouver: "You haven't asked the why 12 years question."
Gartner's debut short story collection, All the Anxious Girls on Earth , was published in 1999 - to great acclaim. Better Living is her follow-up, yes, a dozen years later.
The short version of the answer is: It's complicated. It involved the birth of her son Dexter a few months after Anxious Girls came out, and later the diagnosis and treatment for a severe anxiety disorder.
"I was doing a real face plant, with issues around food phobias and around the safety of my child that got really, really, really bad until it reached a nadir and I had to get help and deal with it."
Once she did - she saw a psychiatrist and eventually went on medication - she had the clarity to be able to write again.
"All of a sudden I realized oh my God; all that time spent agonizing, angsting, and wasted in so many ways, feeling crappy and not writing ... So I'm all for speaking out about mental health."
In the two-and-a-half years after emerging from her mental health crisis, Gartner was extremely productive, writing or completing seven of the 10 stories in her collection, editing the anthology Darwin's Bastards: Astounding Tales from Tomorrow ; teaching at the University of British Columbia, and being intensely involved in the life of her son, who's now 11.
But, a self-described "gross perfectionist," she needed a final push to get going on the book. That push came in her own backyard, three months after going on medication, while having lunch with fellow Vancouver writer Caroline Adderson. Gartner was talking about her desire to write the book and Adderson told her to go for it, offering Dexter a Twix bar for every day that long weekend he didn't interrupt his mother's writing.
"That Victoria Day, I just sat down and said I'm going to do this," Gartner says. "And I just did it."
Gartner was also able to use her anxiety - she remains an anxious person - to fuel her writing. While the title story (about a former eco-terrorist who worries karma will present itself in the form of harm to her child) and that marmot story (where the mascot kidnaps a child) are not at all autobiographical, Gartner does imagine them set in her Commercial Drive neighbourhood, and she did draw from her own anxieties.
"I think there's something to be said in fiction for writing about what you fear: the abducted child, and the kid [in Better Living ]. I feel kind of terrified and jinxy when I write about these things. You can tap into that terror."
But while the anxiety may have enhanced the writing, the writing process did not ease her anxiety.
"Writing's not therapy," she says. "I would never have been able to write that story [ Better Living ], that ending, if I hadn't been treated. No, never."
Zsuzsi Gartner launches her book
at W2 Storyeum in Vancouver
on Wednesday and will read at
Harbourfront in Toronto on May 4.

Rising prices underscore foreign investment

Author: Ebner, David

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/rising-prices-underscore-foreign-investment/docview/863124031/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: While Mr. [Bob Rennie] says prices in some areas such as the west side are "pretty frothy," he leans on an exhortation common among realtors: In a city bounded by mountains to the north, water to the west and the U.S. to the south, hot neighbourhoods with spacious homes are rare. "Even if it slows down, where is the supply?" Mr. Rennie said. "It's not like we're producing mansions."

Full text:   Overseas buyers buoy the country's hottest market, realtors say
On a recent trip to Vancouver, Jin Wang, a Chinese businesswoman, toured a large home - six bedrooms and seven baths - listed at $3.6-million in the British Properties, a wealthy enclave on the north shore overlooking the ocean and the city.
Ms. Wang and her husband, Hui Huang, made their money in the import and export of electronics, leveraging government connections in Beijing to do business in Shanghai. The Chinese nationals also expanded their business to domestic real estate in China.
Now, they're looking to invest more heavily in Vancouver real estate. Three years ago, the couple first bought a $2.1-million home on Vancouver's west side and rented it to a local family. Its value has since hurtled past $3-million. Back this month to scout more buys, Ms. Wang closed a deal for a $3-million home on Chartwell Drive in the British Properties and mulled the additional $3.6-million home on the same street.
Investments by Chinese buyers such as Ms. Wang and Mr. Huang are playing a role in helping to buoy the hottest real estate market in Canada, according to local realtors. Canadian realtors do not tally data on foreign investment in residential real estate, unlike the national realty association in the U.S., but widespread anecdotal reports from local players suggest investment cash from China is a small but significant factor, especially in the market for expensive homes. The additional demand may be helping to underpin a market whose prices seem to impossibly levitate above the typical local incomes in the region.
And it may increase, as more affluent Chinese aim to move, as well as invest their money abroad. There are nearly 600,000 high-net people worth at least $1.5-million in China this year, according to the consultancy Bain & Co. About 10 per cent of them have already left, another 10 per cent are planning to apply for immigration, and about 30 per cent are considering it, according to results based on Bain's survey of 2,500 rich Chinese released last week.
The method of exit is to qualify abroad as an "immigrant investor." In Canada, that means an immigrant must have a net worth of $1.6-million and make an $800,000 investment - figures that are twice what they were last year. The Vancouver region has already welcomed about half of 10,000 or so immigrants who come to Canada annually under such programs.
Yolanda Chen and Simon Yang arrived earlier this year as immigrant investors. The couple, and their six-year-old daughter, came for the same reason cited by a majority of people from China: a better education system. Ms. Chen, who was a television executive in Shanghai, has purchased a $2-million home in White Rock, south of Vancouver. "It's a better, and healthier, life here," she said.
While realtors cite the influence of rich immigrants and investors on markets such as Vancouver, data suggest that the absolute number of buyers in such categories is small.
In the U.S. the most recent figures show that foreigners are a factor in real estate markets but not a massive one.
Foreigners spent $41-billion on U.S. real estate from April, 2009, to March, 2010, about 4 per cent of the American market. Canadians accounted for about quarter, roughly $10-billion, of that total. Buyers from China counted for $3.3-billion, behind Mexico and the United Kingdom.
Of the properties purchased, half of them were bought as a primary residence, with only about a quarter for investment purposes.
The U.S. figures are the result of a survey by researchers at the National Association of Realtors. In Canada, there are no comparable numbers, "because there wasn't demand for us to collect these statistics," said Pierre Leduc, a Canadian Real Estate Association spokesman.
But the U.S. market results echo what realtors in Vancouver are seeing. Ian Gillespie, head of Vancouver developer Westbank Projects Corp., just opened a Shanghai office. In the company's last major project, the $450-million Fairmont Pacific Rim luxury condo-hotel tower completed last year, Mr. Gillespie said about one-third of the apartments went to people with roots in China, largely for residences, not investments.
"They're not coming in to speculate, throwing money at things. They're not trying to flip. They probably flip less than anybody," said Mr. Gillespie.
Ms. Wang - who was scouting another home in the British Properties - buys for investment purposes, and although she and her husband don't plan to move to Canada, the desire for a stronger education is a factor: Ms. Wang's 17-year-old daughter lives in Vancouver, where she attends private school.
"The weather is good, the scenery is good, and the education is good," said Ms. Wang, speaking in Mandarin in an interview. "For the next generation, Canada is a more fair country."
Last year's Winter Olympics has sparked additional interest from overseas, said John Lichtenwald, whose Metro Vancouver Properties sold $3.7-billion of residential real estate in 2010 under the Re/Max banner. He estimated that about of a sixth of his firm's buyers are foreign, led by those with China roots. "The Olympics was a great advertisement program for all of Vancouver, it really helped," he said.
Quickly rising home prices have led conservative commentators to point to the role of foreign buyers, though there is no evidence investment money is a primary fuel for the hot market. Peter Ladner, a business leader, recent mayoral candidate for the city's conservative-leaning party and former city councillor, this month suggested foreign ownership of local real estate should be restricted to discourage "overseas property speculators." The high cost of living hurts businesses looking to attract workers, he said.
The price of a "standard" two-storey house in the city and on the north shore jumped 10 per cent to $1.1-million in the first three months of 2011, according to research last week by real estate agency Royal LePage. The figure puts Vancouver at triple the national rate for a typical two-storey residence - a $379,000 average, up 4 per cent in the past year.
The city's most recognizable real estate face, the condo marketer Bob Rennie, insists Vancouver has become a multipart market. There are some neighbourhoods, such as the west side, that can't be judged on traditional metrics such as income to house price.
And while Mr. Rennie says prices in some areas such as the west side are "pretty frothy," he leans on an exhortation common among realtors: In a city bounded by mountains to the north, water to the west and the U.S. to the south, hot neighbourhoods with spacious homes are rare. "Even if it slows down, where is the supply?" Mr. Rennie said. "It's not like we're producing mansions."
It is a message embraced by Guo Tai Sun, a 48-year-old who works in real estate and building materials in Guangzhou near Hong Kong. In April, he came to visit friends who had moved to Vancouver and to look at real estate investments. He's not moving here but made an offer on a $2.5-million home on the city's west side.
"They told me it was a beautiful city," Mr. Sun said. "I look at the potential of a city. I think Vancouver has great potential."

Full text: The restaurants that have signalled the turning point of a nondescript-neighbourhood-turned-trendy
Toronto, of late, has been sprouting fashionable neighbourhoods in the unlikeliest places, as real-estate prices push trendsters farther afield. There was a time, in living memory, when Ossington Avenue was a strip of wine wholesalers, car mechanics and restaurant supply stores. There was nary a red-lit boîte to be seen; the only music thumping on the street came from a passing car, gliding along a cushion of purple neon ground lights. Now, of course, that's all changed. Pizzeria Libretto sees hour-long lineups. Businesses catering to a demographic of good-time kids and nightlife gawkers have begun metastasizing onto Dundas Street West, a shift that even five years ago would have seemed unthinkable.
A city neighbourhood grows in stages: First the coffee shops and cafes move in, then come the chefs. Suddenly, people from all over the city are visiting new parts of town and spending money there. Here is a look at some restaurants that were the catalyst for big change in their respective 'hoods.
Leslieville & Riverdale
Gio Rana's Really Really Nice Restaurant
1220 Queen St. E.
416-469-5225
2002
This Italian joint brought rustic class to a strip that had embraced the former too heartily and forgotten the latter completely. Says owner Gio Rana, "I was looking at the space here and lots of people thought I was out of my mind. It was a very rough area. But after we opened, people thanked me for increasing their property value." A chef named Edward Levesque came in one day looking for a job. Mr. Rana told him to open his own place and Edward Levesque's Kitchen was born. A few years later and Patrick McMurray started smoking Irish salmon over peat moss at Ceili Cottage, followed shortly by Lynn Crawford and Lora Kirk dishing up luxe comfort food at Ruby Watchco. Now first-time restaurateur Richard Henry has opened a bistro, Le Rossignol and gastro-pub, Le Canard Mort, a few blocks away.
Don Mills
mcewan in the Shops at Don Mills
38 Karl Fraser Rd.
416-444-6262
2009
Not a restaurant or a bar, but a grocery store in a mall. Much more than the sum of its parts, this collaboration between Cadillac-Fairview and Mark McEwan has changed the face of Canada's model modernist community. Fabricca's Chef, Rob LeClair, was excited to get in on the scene early, joining other restaurants already in place, Linda, Joey and Glow. "The population out here is so under-serviced," he says, adding, "It would be great to be part of the buzz that starts a revolution, that would be really exciting."
With two new condo towers going up, four-bedroom bungalows selling for less than $500,000 and a team of crack chefs from Mr. McEwan's ranks behind the stoves at Fabricca and the eponymous grocery store, expect to see big changes in the next few years.
The Junction
Cool Hand of A Girl
2804 Dundas St. W.
416-832-1076
2006
Lunchy, brunchy joints such as Cool Hand of a Girl have paved the way for the Beet Organic Café, Crema Coffee Co., the Junction Eatery, Littlefish and Junction Fromagerie and they are slowly changing the unkempt feel of this part of town. Grocer Digs Dorfman, owner of The Sweet Potato, has watched the progress. "In 2008 it was still quite seedy, there was no foot traffic." He hopes to see what has happened to the Leslieville restaurant scene happen here. "We need some more restaurants. With those, the neighbourhood will really blossom."
Parkdale
Cowbell
1564 Queen St. W.
416-849-1095
2007
2007: Enter Mark Cutrara, a young chef nobody had heard of, but one with an ace up his bloodstained sleeve. A stint working at the Healthy Butcher, breaking down whole beasts, had planted a seed in his carnivorous brain - he was ready to hang up a shingle and bring Tamworth lardo to the masses.
Soon, Mr. Cutrara was wowing Parkdale with plates of lamb sweetbreads and pig snouts. Zoomers, hipsters and foodies braved the crackheads to line up for his ever-changing chalkboard menu. The strip was shortly hit in quick succession with the opening of Local Kitchen, Yummy Stuff and Parts & Labour. "We've had customers come in and thank us for opening in this area. There was nothing here before," says Michael Sangregorio, owner of Local Kitchen and now Bar Salumi with chef Fabio Bondi. EnRoute named Local Kitchen one of the best restaurants in Canada.
Ossington & Dundas
Sweaty Betty's
13 Ossington Ave., 416-535-6861, 2004.
Black Hoof
923 Dundas St., 416-551-8854, 2009.
Betty's magic 'it' factor was a hit with the American Apparel crowd from Day 1. Says owner Pol Christo-Williams, "This was a ghost town lit up with the occasional shooting." He saw the bars such as Crooked Star and the Dakota Tavern open; the restaurants soon followed. "This street is awesome now. I haven't had a break-in for two or three years."
Max Rimaldi opened Pizzeria Libretto at 221 Ossington Ave. in '08. "I had lived in this area for a long time. When Foxley and Delux opened, I saw it slowly turning into a restaurant-friendly strip."
He is looking to open more locations. "I've been offered spaces in commercial malls but we need a neighbourhood. Like Queen East, it has that intangible 'something' we're looking for."
Around the corner, on Dundas, Grant van Gameren took the charcuterie revolution to eleven and decided to let them eat cake - sticky toffee pig's blood cake - at the Black Hoof and the soon-to-be-opened Black Hoof and Company. The neighbourhood is now home to Enoteca Sociale, Brockton General, the Atlantic, Campagnolo, Provenance Cuisine and the insanely popular Porchetta & Co.
"This is going to be the next Ossington but without the bars, more food-focused," says Porchetta & Co.'s chef-owner, Nick auf der Mauer.

THE INSIDER
Steampunk fantasia
Back to the future, indeed. The Difference Engineers is an exhibition up and running under its own steam at the Ontario Science Centre. A collection of whimsical images, speculative timelines and fantastical gadgets and garb (often using brass, leather and cogs), celebrates the counterculture subgenre known as "steampunk," a term used to describe retro-speculative fiction set in an alternate version of 19th-century Earth. Think of the wheezing, cranking gadgetry of the 1999 film Wild Wild West .
Produced by the tinkering students of the museum studies program at the University of Toronto, the gizmos and cyborgish paraphernalia use the science and materials available in the steam-powered era. It's a fanciful extrapolation.
The Ontario Science Centre is open daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. $16 to $20. 770 Don Mills Rd., 416-696-3256.

Full text: Global recovery slams into a bottleneck in Shanghai as striking truckers protest soaring costs of fuel and transportation
ASIA-PACIFIC REPORTER
At the world's busiest container port, China's inflation problem is becoming an obstacle to global trade.
Incensed by spiking fuel costs and consumer prices, truck drivers hauling goods to and from the Port of Shanghai went on strike Wednesday, triggering a confrontation that drew hundreds of police after truckers reportedly blockaded the entrance to a local logistics company.
Even as the crackdown turned violent, the truckers vowed to continue their protest at the port, which moved almost 80,000 containers a day in 2010 and overtook Singapore to become the busiest container port on the planet. The standoff, already making an impact on the flow of goods in and out of Shanghai, highlights the challenge that inflation poses to policy-makers in China.
Spurred by a 12-per-cent jump in food prices, China's annual inflation rate surged to 5.4 per cent in March, the highest in more than two-and-a-half years. The potential for runaway inflation is a serious concern for the Chinese government because, in the past, major consumer price increases have led to civil unrest. Inflation has become the hot-button issue among China's 1.3 billion citizens: many are struggling to make ends meet as the price of basic necessities such as food has skyrocketed following a frenzied run-up in real estate values.
At a shabby dining hall in Shanghai's Baoshan district on Friday, a group of truckers said the soaring cost of fuel, coupled with hefty transportation fees, have eroded their profits. "There is too much inflation," said one of the striking drivers, who agreed to be interviewed but declined to give his name out of fear for his safety. "We will continue to protest, thousands of us are on strike ... we are not transporting anything. We have stopped everywhere."
The government has made fighting inflation a top priority this year. It has raised interest rates and boosted reserve requirements for banks as well as slapping price controls on some consumer staples.
But China has been slow to take the step that would strike most directly at its inflation rate: allowing its currency to appreciate. China kept its currency artificially low to reduce manufacturer's costs and keep the country's massive export sector competitive. This requires China to continually buy U.S. dollars and issue more yuan, a policy that expands domestic money supply and fuels inflation pressure.
Rapid growth and inflation in China and other emerging markets also pose a serious challenge to policy-makers in advanced economies. Already trembling under the burden of mounting debt, many countries in the Western world are facing tough decisions over spending cuts sooner than they expected. China's slow efforts to keep a lid on runaway growth have so far only contributed to those problems, as that nation's inflationary pressures lead to more price increases around the world.
There are also dangers if China's slowdown comes too quickly: A significant curtailing of growth threatens to drive down commodity prices and foreign investment, pushing many advanced economies back into trouble. But those broader concerns are taking a back seat to the striking truck drivers, increasingly frustrated with the rising cost of living.
Reuters, citing witnesses, reported that as many as 2,000 demonstrators were involved in the protests on Wednesday.
"There is a strong feeling that the cost of living is rising and it's cutting into people's real gains from a growing economy," said Patrick Chovanec, a professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
"It's of great concern if it becomes part of a trend. There are localized protests nearly every day about all kinds of issues, but this is one where the pressures are likely to grow in intensity in the days ahead, and everyone - including the Chinese government - will be watching to see how people respond and whether frustration boils over," Mr. Chovanec said..
In a possibly related move, the yuan touched a fresh high against the U.S. dollar on Friday. China's central bank set the currency, which is also known as the renminbi, at 6.5156 per U.S. dollar, up from Thursday's 6.5205.
Amid the agitation, the Chinese government has moved quickly to quash any unauthorized public gatherings. Earlier this year, scores of uniformed and plainclothes police descended upon on the Wangfujing shopping district in Beijing after it was touted on websites as the site of a so-called "Jasmine Revolution" protest.
Last year, labour unrest rocked several foreign manufacturers operating in China, including Honda and Toyota.
Chinese authorities are already in the midst of the largest roll-back of freedoms in the past decade and have arrested a number of high-profile dissidents.
"The police beat us until there was blood," said another driver. The trucker said authorities had also blocked websites where his colleagues had posted information about the protests. Hundreds of trucks were idled as demonstrations continued on Thursday and Friday, according to reports from Reuters and AP.
A much stronger than usual police presence remained in Baoshan's port area on Friday. Cab driver Lei Chenxiao said police had blocked several roads earlier in the week.
"Before the protests there were never police here," Mr. Lei said.
However, Mr. Chovanec said that allowing the value of China's currency, the yuan, to appreciate would be the most effective measure to counter inflation. A stronger currency, however, would hurt Chinese manufacturers, which remain a critical element to the world's second-largest economy.
"As long as it maintains the peg, China has to run just to stay in place on inflation. Allowing the yuan to appreciate would relieve the pressure on the People's Bank of China to keep buying dollars and issuing more [yuan]. This is ultimately the solution," Mr. Chovanec said.

How China's 'crooked consultants' help the rich enter Canada

Abstract: Immigration Minister Jason Kenney confirms that "crooked consultants" in such places as India, Pakistan and especially China are a problem. "A lot of people," he said in an interview, "are willing to pay a lot of money to cut corners."

Full text: Wealthy would-be immigrants from China lacking proper paperwork - or trying to hide shady pasts - can fast-track the process with help from a black market that can manufacture personal histories for almost anyone
He is in his 50s and has spent his entire career in the quality-control department of a company owned by the Chinese government. His salary isn't much, but he has made millions on the side - he won't say precisely how - and now wants to emigrate to Canada.
There is a special program designed to fast-track immigrants with money to inject into the Canadian economy, but he doesn't really qualify.
He has the required minimum of $1.6-million in assets. What he doesn't have are the documents Canadian immigration officials want: neither banking and pay statements to show that his wealth has accumulated legitimately nor proof that he has paid taxes on it. He also doesn't have the necessary two years' experience in managing employees.
In China, however, manufacturing a personal history that will satisfy Immigration Canada is no problem for almost anyone willing to pay.
To overcome his obstacles, the well-off quality-control officer approached 22 China-based immigration consultants for advice. He soon found that his destination is so popular for wealthy people like him that a black market has arisen to generate the forged documents and massaged back stories that so many seem to need.
And the image doctors appear to be good at what they do: Several claim to have a 100-per-cent success rate. "If you make a fake," observed a consultant in the southern city of Guangzhou, "you should fake it real."
That admission was surprisingly frank, considering it was made over the telephone to a caller whose own identity was no more genuine than the one he wanted to have fabricated. In reality, the quality-control officer was a character invented by The Globe and Mail to see how far people will go to help someone leave China.
Disreputable consultants have long been controversial in Canada. Just before the May 2 election was called, Bill C-35 was read into law, making it illegal for anyone who isn't registered to charge a fee for immigration advice.
But a bigger threat may lurk abroad. More than 80 per cent of the companies The Globe's counterfeit client asked for help offered to sugarcoat the past, even if it includes a criminal conviction and time in jail.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney confirms that "crooked consultants" in such places as India, Pakistan and especially China are a problem. "A lot of people," he said in an interview, "are willing to pay a lot of money to cut corners."
Thorny relations
For years, China has been the No. 1 source of newcomers to Canada, and applying as an investor is the fastest route to permanent resident status. Permission to come is often granted within a year.
In 2009, about 2,000 investor immigrants and their families were accepted from China, most of them private citizens drawn by the promise of a better environment, education system and health care.
A report in Friday's Global Times newspaper found that among those Chinese with at least 100 million yuan (about $15-million) in assets, 27 per cent had already begun the process of emigrating, and another 47 per cent were also considering leaving the country.
Consultants in China say that those being fast-tracked also include public employees, who, like the quality-control officer, are surprisingly well off.
Ying Hong, a Guangzhou firm that bragged of its 100-per-cent success rate, made no secret of helping wealthy bureaucrats. "Many officials take foreign passports," the agent said, laughing. "But I can't tell you who."
China's relationship with Canada is often thorny, and one of its more charged issues is the claim that Ottawa provides refuge to at least 70 fugitives. Beijing says Canada turns a blind eye to immigrants' shortcomings if they have money - and then refuses to extradite those who stand accused of serious crimes.
At the top of the most-wanted list is Lai Changxing, who is suspected of masterminding China's biggest-ever smuggling ring and has been in Canada fighting extradition since 1999.
Although he entered on a visitor's visa and is trying to stay as a refugee, his case has demonstrated how reluctant Canadian courts are to deport people to China, where serious economic crime often results in the death penalty.
Canada, meanwhile, blames Beijing for not cracking down on those who profit by helping dodgy migrants cheat its system.
An estimated 400 firms based in China offer their services to prospective immigrants. Of the 22 approached by The Globe's fictitious client, no fewer than 18 advised fabricating documents to produce the required background.
Although many suggested he ask someone who owns a company to create the income and tax documentation, eight said they could produce the papers themselves. Two even offered to have a Canadian company speed the process by hiring the applicant, if only on paper.
The fees for all this ranged from 50,000 to 60,000 yuan ($7,500 to $9,000). "We are not charging you 50,000 for doing nothing," said a representative of Ying Hong, adding that "we have succeeded with clients who have several hundreds of millions in assets, a lot of money, that they can't report."
As a further test, The Globe's client claimed to have a relative who also wanted to emigrate but had an even bigger problem: Several years ago, he served time for stabbing someone in a fight.
Several firms called the jail sentence a deal breaker for immigration to Canada, but 12 of them suggested that a certificate attesting to a clean criminal record can be obtained if a person possesses the right guanxi, which means "relationships" or "connections."
If the relative were to persuade - bribe, if necessary - someone at his local police station to issue such a certificate, explained an agent at Kunpeng International, a Beijing-based firm, Canadian officials "can't come to China to check the archives" in person.
Attracting the wealthy
Last year, Immigration Canada doubled both the minimum assets investors need to qualify (from $800,000) and how much each must invest (from $400,000) in a bid to ensure, Mr. Kenney said, that Canada gets "adequate value" for fast-tracking an application.
The money is effectively an interest-free loan to the province in which the investor settles, and is later repaid in full.
However, China-based consultants reported no drop-off in either the number of applicants they were seeing or the pace with which the cases were handled by Canadian officials.
Quebec has its own immigration program, and was compelled to raise its standards when the federal government did.
Mr. Kenney said the government is reviewing the effectiveness of the new threshold - which still makes coming to Canada cheaper for an investor than going to Australia, the United States or Britain, all of which require an investment of at least $1-million, which isn't repaid.
But he defended the need to have a fast-track program: "Obviously, we do want to attract high-net-worth individuals. Our hope is they'll stay in Canada and be a positive force in the economy."
According to a report in a state-run Chinese newspaper, the 2,000 investors who emigrated in 2009 transferred almost $1-billion to Canadian banks.
The minister acknowledged that embassy officials struggle with the sheer volume of applications from China - which accounted for more than 32,000 of the 45,000 the program received in total last year.
He also described as "a challenge" attempts to have Chinese police co-operate in pursuing consultants suspected of fraud, but contended that relations
improved after he raised the issue in Beijing last year with Public Security Minister Meng Jianzhu.
John Ryan, chief executive officer of the Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants, agrees that, along with guanxi, the inability of officials to verify documents is at the root of the problem.
According to Mr. Ryan, who spent nine years as a consultant in China, staff at the embassy in Beijing - which declined to comment for this article - are "doing yeoman's work, but the time that they spend on any file is limited. They have limited time to look behind the file, unless there's something glaring, and those [Chinese immigration consultants] are sophisticated enough to know where the holes are."
No choice but to cheat
In their own defence, some consultants say they have no choice but to break the rules. Canada, they claim, asks for documents that even legitimately wealthy Chinese are unlikely to possess.
One official, whose company did not suggest doing anything illicit, complained that immigration officials demand a perfect background, something that is rare among those who have become wealthy during China's wild transition from socialism to a market-oriented economy.
Many of the nouveau riche , the consultant said, earned their money legally through stock trading or because real-estate values have soared. So they have the requisite assets but not all the paperwork.
Charles Qi, president of Beijing East J & P Star Consulting Co. and a member of the Canada-China Business Council, said that, if an applicant is determined to leave and knows his acceptance depends on documents he doesn't have, "he will fake them. What other choice do they have?"
Mr. Kenney rejects the notion that Canada has set the bar too high, saying it is still more difficult to gain residency in the United States and Britain, and that there is no good reason to falsify an application.
But a veteran consultant who divides his time between China and Canada argues that honesty has become a handicap. He said the investor system is now so rife with fraudulent applications that anyone who fails to add some "polish" almost certainly winds up at the back of the line.
"I kept silent for many years and tried to ... play by the laws, but I'm almost ready to close my company," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. (He fears being harmed for revealing what his competitors do.) Because he won't cheat, "I can't compete. People who come to me are unlucky people. They are the ones in danger of refusal."

Full text: After dazzling IPO, car-sharing pioneer needs to prove it can be a vehicle for investors
Zipcar Inc. is used to cult-like devotion from its customers. Now the newly public company is enjoying a similar love-in with investors - despite financial numbers that require a leap of faith.
The car-sharing pioneer was the darling of Wall Street last week, when its initial public offering went 10 times oversubscribed, sending the stock through the stratosphere in its Nasdaq debut. Priced at $18 (U.S.) a share - already well above the $14 to $16 that analysts had anticipated - the stock surged to $30 on its opening trade and quickly peaked at $31.50, before settling back to $28 at the close of its first day. (The stock lost 79 cents to $26.37 Monday, in a day of widespread losses on global equity markets.) All this for a company with an unorthodox short-term car-rental business that despite 560,000 customer-members in 14 major cities (including Toronto and Vancouver) and more than 230 university campuses has never turned a profit in its 11 years in business. Last year, despite expansion and a major British acquisition that helped boost revenues by 42 per cent to $186-million, the Cambridge, Mass.-based company posted a loss of $14.1-million - equivalent to 49 cents a share, according to its IPO prospectus.
"It's a cult IPO," said Scott Sweet, senior managing partner at Florida-based IPO research firm IPO Boutique. "A cult IPO is one where people like it so much that they say, 'I want it at any price.' "
Zipcar cautioned in its prospectus that it expects to lose money again in 2011, adding, "We do not know if our business operations will become profitable or if we will continue to incur net losses in 2012 and beyond."
Then there's the matter of debt - no small issue for a company whose growth requires up-front investment in fleets of vehicles and expensive downtown real estate on which to park them. The company had debts totalling about $95-million at the end of 2010 - although part of the IPO proceeds will be used to reduce that overhang.
Analysts said what's got investors so excited is an attractive business model that Zipcar could roll out to many more urban centres than it currently services.
The business offers member-customers the ability to rent vehicles by the hour - for as little as $7 an hour - with gas and insurance included. Customers can reserve cars over the Internet or smart phone and pick them up at local parking lots, using a pass card to get access to the vehicle.
IPO analyst Francis Gaskins of IPO Desktop said Zipcar has identified more than 100 major urban centres globally, as well as hundreds of campuses, as potential markets.
"Zipcar has an impressive track record of top-line growth and targets a large and growing market opportunity in the car-sharing space," wrote IPO research firm Renaissance Capital. "The company has posted two consecutive years of positive cash flow, and while it is investing aggressively in growth, its returns should scale nicely as increased membership drives higher vehicle utilization."
But Mr. Gaskins worries that Zipcar's current business structure offers "little room for bottom-line profits," and expressed concern about the company's high ratio of operating expenses to revenues.
At its current price, Zipcar is trading at a premium to other car-rental companies on both a price-to-book and price-to-sales basis. And it's those other car-rental companies that may present the biggest threat to Zipcar justifying those premiums.
IPO Boutique's Mr. Sweet noted that Hertz Global Holdings is already conducting a small-scale pilot of its own car-sharing program, and if it decided to get into the business on a large scale, it "could undercut Zipcar's price by half."
"[Zipcar] has no room in its income statement for price competition, because operating expenses are so high," Mr. Gaskins wrote.
And Mr. Sweet said that given the big vote of confidence investors have given Zipcar right out of the gate, the company is going to have to deliver on its promise or face a fall from market grace.
"Do I think it will stay at $26? If they ever miss their numbers, absolutely not," he said. "If they mess up, the stock is going to get hammered."

Full text: jaryan@globeandmail.com
Have you given up on career satisfaction? Still wishing you had gone to grad school, or at least obtained your real-estate licence? Are you wasting work hours wondering whether your job is really as good as it gets?
All those who are disenchanted with their work existence should spend a day in the gumboots of the crab fisherman toiling on Deadliest Catch (Discovery, 10 p.m.). It turns out the worst day fishing really isn't better than your best day at work.
Each day is harder than the one before it on Deadliest Catch , which launched in 2005 and still ranks among the most-watched shows on American television. When broadcast on the U.S. Discovery Channel last week, Tuesday night's seventh-season opener hauled in 4.3 million viewers - one of the higher-rated episodes of all time.
What makes Deadliest Catch different from most reality programming is that people aren't embarrassed to admit that they watch it. More documentary series than reality TV, the show has a no-frills premise that faithfully details the workday routine aboard vessels in the Bering Sea during the Alaskan king crab fishing season.
The new season begins on a sombre note with a farewell to Captain Phil Harris, certainly the best-known personality to surface since the show launched.
Hard-living and hard-working, Captain Phil passed away after a stroke last season at the age of 53. The first new episode opens with his burial service. All seven crafts in the crab-fishing fleet, including two new boats, gather in a circle for a memorial service, after which his ashes are sent out to sea.
Although the sendoff is clearly heartfelt, there's not a lot of sermonizing from Phil's sons or fellow fisherman. Anyone who has watched the show will know that Phil would have wanted it that way.
The old fisherman's departure sets up the tone for the upcoming season, which looks to be a competition between the crab-fishing veterans and the fresh-faced rookies.
As before, there is ample human drama on Deadliest Catch . The two new boats, the Ramblin' Rose and the Seabrooke, are helmed by Elliott Neese and Scott (Junior) Campbell, respectively. Both look like college students.
But these laddies know their jobs, and avail themselves of technology.
Campbell uses digital maps and other high-tech modalities in his search for the fattest king crabs. Only a few days into the month-long crab season, the Seabrooke has pulled in the biggest haul of any of the boats.
The baby-faced Captain Neese, meanwhile, is saddled with a crew even younger than himself, and none of them well-behaved. In one of the more uncomfortable scenes, he is forced to fire an irresponsible deckhand for getting wildly drunk.
But things aren't going swimmingly for the older fishermen, either.
Crusty Captain Johnathan Hillstrand frets about making his quota, likely because he took his boat, Time Bandit, to the same spot for the fourth year in a row. Old seadogs Captain Sig Hansen (the Northwestern) and Captain Keith Colburn (the Wizard) are also coming up empty in the early going.
The first episode also devotes significant screen time - too much, perhaps - to the attempts by Captain Phil's sons, Josh and Jake, to rebuild their father's ship, the Cornelia Marie. The legend continues and so forth.
In short order, the Cornelia Marie is ready for its first expedition without Phil at the helm. The sons hire a no-nonsense skipper, Derrick Ray, who reveals his plans to fish in an untouched the northernmost region of the Bering Sea. He also announces his intent to regularly test Jake's urine for drugs (his past addiction problems being a matter of public record).
None of which is likely to inspire anyone to take up a career in commercial fishing. Unlike most reality programming, Deadliest Catch does not gloss up the work routine of crab fishermen.
How could you possibly romanticize a job that requires you to slide around a frozen boat deck in roiling sea waters while handling live crustaceans - and all toward the cause of five-star restaurants bumping up their menu? Crab fishing is neither a job nor an adventure. It's work.
Check local listings.
John Doyle returns on April 25.

Enclave thrives with a mall, factories and - most importantly - reliable electricity

Abstract: "We're going to build generators," he said, as he drove around [Aino Mina] in his white Lexus, pointing out armies of labourers already laying the foundations for a multi-storey shopping centre and a sports complex. "And we have plans to build our own hydroelectric dams in the future."

Full text: The broad streets are paved. Tidy two-storey houses are tucked behind pastel walls and flower beds. Families picnic in the park and the strip mall boasts a pizza place, an Internet café and a bank.
If not for the 11 interior police checkpoints, the 180 armed guards and the passing military vehicles bristling with weapons, the sprawling housing development of Aino Mina on the outskirts of Kandahar would not look out of place in any Canadian suburb.
"This," said Tooryalai Wesa, the provincial governor, "is what the future looks like."
Utopian visions do not survive long in Afghanistan, particularly in the ramshackle and dangerous city of Kandahar where Taliban hit squads are assassinating local officials, most recently the provincial police chief. Security is precarious. Investment is scarce. Infrastructure, where it exists, is decaying.
But for the first time in years, a few sparks of hope for economic development are visible.
After dithering and debate among foreign donors, the American military stepped late last year to provide two powerful new generators for Kandahar. The second unit was installed just this month. Now the boost in the electricity output is helping fuel an improbable housing bubble and boom in property speculation.
Aino Mina is a prime example of the pent-up potential for economic growth, according to its developers and bullish Kandahar officials.
Sales of plots, going for $22 a square metre, have soared in the past two years and spawned a lively real-estate futures market, said Mohammed Gul Basha, the project's sales manager.
About 2,500 people have built homes and another 1,000 people have purchased contracts to build, putting down about 50 per cent of the sale price of the land. Many are now selling their contracts for major profits, he said.
The development, built on 9,000 hectares of land that once belonged to the Afghan Ministry of Defence, is owned by a company that includes two of President Hamid Karzai's brothers. The deal was controversial and called an illegal land grab by critics. But Kandahar's mayor, like the provincial governor, now raves about its economic benefits.
"There are hundreds of people working there building houses, roads, markets, everything," said Mayor Ghulam Haider Hamidi. Property taxes from Aino Mina homeowners, he added, essentially bankroll city services, providing $6-million of the city's $16-million budget.
The people who bought land in the first years of the five-year-old project were Afghans living abroad who wanted to help their Kandahar relatives. More recently, Mr. Bacha said, they are the local middle class.
They made money in the past few years selling equipment and services to the NATO air base. But they had no place to invest, since the lack of reliable electricity in the city has choked off any new business investment.
The American military, already the biggest generator of jobs and revenue in the province, is also largely responsible for the nascent housing bubble. In late December, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers flew in a new diesel generator and installed it on the east side of the city at the site of a lifeless industrial park filled with shuttered factories. Last week, the military delivered a second one for the city's western end.
The generators' combined output of 20 megawatts of power effectively increases the city's electrical capacity by 42 per cent.
Promises and plans for bringing power to southern Afghanistan, the Taliban heartland and the scene of the big NATO military surge of the last year, have been discussed by various donor countries for nearly nine years.
Development agencies argued against spending money on quick fixes like generators. Instead, they pushed for big-ticket projects like hydroelectric dams, new transmission lines and power substations to build a modern electricity grid.
But the centrepiece of those plans, the rehabilitation of the 1950s-era Kajaki dam in Helmand province, has been stalled by fierce fighting. A new effort, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, is now under way to refurbish Kajaki and its frayed transmission lines to Kandahar.
The new generators for Kandahar are seen as a quick but necessary fix to the city's chronic energy shortage. They were bought with money from the Commanders Emergency Response Program, the discretionary funds that American officers in the field can use for small "hearts and minds" projects to win over Afghans. CERP funds were also promised to cover the cost of fuel for the generators for the next three years.
The new generators will not solve the city's chronic power deficit. But their arrival, representing a $300-million investment in kick-starting Kandahar's moribund economy, has already encouraged some factory owners to reopen.
The lack of reliable electricity has been driving investment out of Kandahar.
Al-Haj Raheemdin, deputy director of the local Chamber of Commerce, said he invested $40,000 in equipment in hopes of starting a small factory a few years ago to produce cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. But the city's erratic electricity changed his mind. He ended up establishing the company in Kabul, where the power supply is more reliable.
"We have about 130 factories in Kandahar and very few were working because of the electricity problems," Mr. Raheemdin said. "Now they might start again. And if each one has 20 or 30 people working, they would be all day working and at night sleeping. No fighting. No stealing. No robbing."
Aino Mina is hooked into the city's power grid, but most homeowners who live there have installed their own generators, Mr. Basha said. As the development grows, though, so does his vision of a purring self-sufficient suburban lifestyle for down-at-the-heels Kandahar.
"We're going to build generators," he said, as he drove around Aino Mina in his white Lexus, pointing out armies of labourers already laying the foundations for a multi-storey shopping centre and a sports complex. "And we have plans to build our own hydroelectric dams in the future."

Back to the (farm) land

Author: Pitts, Gordon

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/back-farm-land/docview/862242057/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Originally, two [Tom Eisenhauer] brothers and an uncle came to Nova Scotia in 1753, and arrived too late to set up shop that year. It's said they spent the winter on a ship in Halifax harbour. After that, I believe the uncle and one of the brothers said, "Forget it. I'm out of here," and went to Pennsylvania. There was already a German community there and the family of General Dwight Eisenhower came from those origins.

He hails from an East Coast seafaring family, but Tom Eisenhauer is making his mark as a landlubber these days. The former investment banker and tech investor heads Bonnefield Financial Inc., a new Canadian entry into the rising investment market for agricultural land. Bonnefield expects to close its first fund at year-end, and has amassed a portfolio of 7,000 acres. While the global food-price surge helps his cause, Mr. Eisenhauer insists the payoff is long-term gains for investors and for farmers who lease back land from the fund.
Your family background in Nova Scotia doesn't suggest a future in farmland.
The Eisenhauer family came from Germany primarily as farmers in the 1700s. But they figured: "Farming in Lunenburg County? I think we'll go fishing." And my father was a habitual entrepreneur who was involved in shipbuilding and metal fabrication. So he made the processing equipment for fish plants and things like that. My brother now owns that company and has expanded it. I'm the black sheep because I'm the only male for generations who is not an engineer.
Originally, two Eisenhauer brothers and an uncle came to Nova Scotia in 1753, and arrived too late to set up shop that year. It's said they spent the winter on a ship in Halifax harbour. After that, I believe the uncle and one of the brothers said, "Forget it. I'm out of here," and went to Pennsylvania. There was already a German community there and the family of General Dwight Eisenhower came from those origins. It's spelled a little differently, but back then they probably couldn't spell. It's rumoured the one who stayed behind met a local girl and put down roots in Lunenburg - and that's the Canadian branch.
How did you end up in this business?
Back in 2008 I sold my [technology merchant banking] firm, and timing is everything in life - it was just pre-crash. The obvious thing was starting a new private equity fund, but no one was going to fund private equity in 2008-2009. So I was looking around at other assets.
So what was your eureka moment in farmland?
I do a lot of cycling, and my wife is from the Paris-Brantford area in Ontario. At that time, potash was going through the roof and everything, and I was riding around that area and seeing a bunch of farms for sale.
I thought: If I buy a farm and sit on it until I retire, it can't be a bad investment. That led to three months of research. I had no idea that farmland was such a huge institutional investment class around the world, but not in Canada. Over decades, it's had very steady-Eddie equity-like returns, extremely low volatility, and no correlation to public markets - at a time when markets were going crazy. I thought this is too good not to pursue.
But I realized I was this fishing-community guy from Lunenburg, who might get his head handed to him in farmland. I put the idea on the shelf but within days I had a call from a friend, Jan Kaminski, whose family has the Colonnade real estate group in Ottawa. They'd gone a long way down the road [thinking about land investment and lease-backs to farmers]. So we put together Bonnefield Financial.
Is everybody calling you now because farmland prices are soaring?
If I could take money from non-Canadians, I'd be retired by now. But we adhere to farmland-ownership restrictions in Saskatchewan and Manitoba which means all our investors must be individual Canadian citizens.
Farmland leasing is a concept that's been around internationally for generations, but it's so new in Canada. We're getting certainly a lot more phone calls here, but I get four calls from non-Canadians for every one from Canada.
Why are Canadians behind the rest of the world?
We tend to think of agriculture more as social policy rather than agricultural policy. Through the rest of the world, it's the industry of the future because of climate change, water shortage, population growth, food security. But we still have this image of the farm business as being grandpa with a cow and getting by. That's certainly not the kind of Canadian farmers that we're dealing with.
Is there much interest from farmers?
Overwhelming response. But our approach is different: We're not going into these small communities, perusing the MLS listings and buying up farms. If you do that, you make yourself really unpopular in the local Tim Hortons because invariably there's some farmer who's had his eye on that property for years. Then some guy from Bay Street shows up to buy it.
Instead, we've got a whole bunch of metrics to identify farmland that's attractively priced relative to productive capacity. Once we've done that, one of our partners, a former farmer, works through financial advisers and the local Farm Credit Canada guys to find young progressive people who are growth-oriented and we get introduced. Invariably the conversation starts with, "Let's do a sale lease-back on some land that you already own" and doing that cleans up the farmer's balance sheet.
The next conversation is about how they are leasing land from some retired guy down the road. With the amount invested in operations and equipment, if they lose access to that land, they're screwed. They come to us and say, "I'm afraid the owner is going to retire and sell the land to someone else, so I'll get you involved, and you buy it from him." Then they'll lease it from us on a long-term basis. It's the farmer leading us to the land, and not vice versa.
A farmer in Iowa just sold his place for $11,000 (U.S.) an acre. Does that high price scare you?
We look at what the farm can earn. As former techies, we were frustrated that we couldn't find any third-party computer models to help us assess the market, so we made our own. We bought a GIS map of Canada and layered into it a land map that tells us what soil predominates where, as well as climatic data, production data, yield data. It allows us to compare regions and find out where land at similar productive capacity is trading at a discount.
We put together what we call the Bonnefield indexes, which go right down to the municipality level. Then we came up with what amounts to a price-earnings ratio for farmland. We layer that information onto our GIS map, and areas identified in green, for example, look pretty attractive.
And what's the outlook for ownership deregulation?
There are not many other businesses where your only financing options are sweat equity and bank debt. You can't take in public capital. You can't take in venture capital money. There are no securitized assets. So why can't you just say Canadian farmland should be farmed by Canadians, but does it have to be owned by Canadians? Does there have to be restricted capital?
Behind closed doors, policy-makers understand that. They have a wall of retiring farmers coming at them. We did back-of-the-envelope numbers - not accurate, but in the order of magnitude - estimating that about $53-billion worth of farmland will have to change hands from retiring farmers over the next decade to decade-and-a-half in this country.
A lot of that will be intergenerational transfers but what if just 10 per cent has to be financed publicly?
Where do you fit in?
In the last six months I've been approached by two guys on Bay Street, both of whom grew up in the Prairies. Their dads farmed and, according to them, they would have liked to stay on the farm but there was no practical way to do it and earn the return that they wanted. They said, "Look, if I had your access to capital, I'd still be a farmer today." In one case, the guy loved our investment thesis so much, that he went back a few years ago and bought several sections that he now leases out to farmers.

Full text: The founder of a giant Texas development conglomerate that secured an $800-million deal with Waterfront Toronto to build a 2-million-sq.-ft. mixed-use complex on the East Bayfront says the Ford administration's threat to pull out of the revitalization effort would "shake our confidence" in the project.
"Who would be the entity we would deal with?" said Gerald Hines, who set up his privately held real estate firm in 1957. The Hines company now has properties in over 100 cities around the world, and controls $22.9-billion in real estate assets.
Mr. Hines, 85, was responding to disparaging comments made this week by Mayor Rob Ford and his brother Doug, who dismissed efforts to redevelop the waterfront as "a boondoggle" and a waste of money. The mayor said Friday the city's contribution to waterfront revitalization was under review.
But in an interview Friday from his office in Houston, Mr. Hines lauded the Waterfront Toronto agency as "an ethical and professional group" that has created incentives that attract international investors with deep pockets. "We have confidence that they'll execute their part of the agreement."
There's little doubt the agency reeled in a big fish when it finalized an agreement with Hines last summer. The firm has developed projects in cities like Paris, Milan and Barcelona, where it worked with local and state governments on a massive waterfront redevelopment complex involving 1,500 high-rise apartment units, three hotels, and a convention centre.
"Everyone in Barcelona said it would never work, but we now have the highest prices in [the city]," Mr. Hines said, adding that the chance to remake Toronto's waterfront presented a similar opportunity.
He's not the only major figure in the development industry to look askance at signals coming out of the mayor's office.
"If Waterfront Toronto was less effective, people will have to ask the question, where's the government's commitment?" says Andrew Barnicke, senior vice-president of DTZ Barnicke Ltd., the firm that negotiated the deal which saw Corus Entertainment move into the first new office complex built on the waterfront in over a generation.
Waterfront Toronto, Mr. Barnicke said, has succeeded in attracting capital investment to the area east of Yonge and dismissed suggestions that the agency has little to show for the $750-million it has spent to date. "Probably the most difficult thing in doing new district development is getting the planning right and doing the infrastructure. Building the buildings isn't so difficult."
Since 2008, the agency, which is jointly owned by all three levels of government, has approved three major development deals worth $1.3-billion. The Corus building opened last year, and construction on the new waterfront campus for George Brown College, a $175-million venture, is under way. Infrastructure Ontario is in the process of tendering a $700-million development deal to build 8,000-10,000 units of housing in the West Donlands for the Pan Am Games athletes' village.
According to the agency's figures, almost half of the funding provided since 2001 has come from the federal government, while Queen's Park has anted up $240-million and the city just $162-million.
During the coming nine years, the city has earmarked $193-million in capital spending on waterfront projects, including an LRT and new public spaces. Budget documents show the city anticipates an additional $106-million in operating expenses associated with waterfront redevelopment. But waterfront officials estimate that land development will increase property values in the East Bayfront and West Donlands by almost $10-billion, generating an estimated $136-million in additional annual property taxes.

THE LISTING
Asking price: $969,000
Taxes: $5,967 (2010)
Lot size: 25.17 by 102 feet.
Agent: Kim Kehoe, Bosley Real Estate Ltd.
****
The back story
He, Mark McLean, is a Toronto real estate agent.
She, Virginie Martocq, is decor editor for Chatelaine magazine.
Call it a marriage made in home-renovation heaven.
"Renovating and designing houses is fun for us," says Ms. Martocq on a recent tour of her so-stylish-it-hurts Little Italy home.
"For other people, it's work."
The amusement ride started in the summer of 2005 when she and her husband moved into their three-storey semi, built circa 1919, and located a mere stroll away from all the action on nearby College Street at Grace Street.
They didn't buy the house for its looks.
"It was ugly," says Ms. Martocq, not putting too fine a point on it.
"We saw it three times and we didn't have a strong emotional reaction. But we saw that it had big rooms and nice proportions and that it was bright."
As well, the four-bedroom, four-bathroom house was close to Pierre Elliott Trudeau School, whose French language program appealed to the bilingual mother of two who moved to Toronto from Aix-en-Provence in France at age 12, following the divorce of her Canadian mother and French father. In Canada, she got to know better her maternal grandmother, a noted interior designer (still alive at age 97) whom Ms. Martocq credits as having influenced her own career path.
"Interior design is in the blood," she says.
Even if it weren't, both her grandmother, who has already passed down an impressive contemporary Canadian art collection, and her mother, who sadly passed away earlier this year from cancer, taught Ms. Martocq design by example.
"My mom wasn't in the business but she was very creative," Ms. Martocq says. "We moved all the time when I was young and my mom was always decorating. I remember often coming home from school and the dining room would be in the living room and the living room would be in the dining room."
When she was 15, Ms. Martocq recalls bursting into tears when faced with another of her mother's home-renovation schemes.
It was a dilapidated house - "a total dump" - of which her mother was proud but which Ms. Martocq thought impossible to redeem.
"I didn't have the vision yet," she allows. But after her mother renovated the teardown, turning it into a gem of a home for herself and her two daughters. Ms. Martocq absorbed an important lesson that has guided her through to today:
"You don't look at a house for what it is, but for its potential."
It's an approach she took with this house that after a week on the market recently sold for $1.125-million, about 15 per cent more than the asking price of $969,000 as a result of a four-way bidding war.
"It already had a good roof and a good furnace, all the things you don't want to spend money on," says Ms. Martocq.
"So when we bought it we had money to play with. We could concentrate in just doing pretty things."
What's new
Prettifying the house involved transferring the kitchen from a back hall to the rear of the house where there was originally a staircase leading down to the now-finished basement.
This entailed a 50-square-foot addition with a wall of windows that floods the interior with natural light.
To get that light to reach into the basement, Ms. Martocq lined the walls of the new stairwell leading downstairs with mirrors.
On the second floor, she removed a wall to create an enlarged family room with fireplace. On the third floor, she took a small bedroom and enlarged it into a large master bedroom.
Best feature
The master bedroom, Ms. Martocq says, is what she considers to be the best feature of her home.
'"It's got a three-sided fireplace in front of the bathtub, and we each have eight feet of closets. I also have a built-in vanity where I apply my makeup and jewellery."
The master bedroom also has a window seat with views onto the CN Tower and a local church.
"My life is busy, my kids are busy, this is the place where I can get away," she says.
"It's me time. It's adult space."

Passive House is aggressively green

Author: Colihan, Mary Ann

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/passive-house-is-aggressively-green/docview/861973683/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: According to Ms. [Nancy Schultz], who is accredited to design and evaluate buildings for LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) certification, the Passive House designation is more difficult than a LEED rating because it is based strictly on the energy required to run the house - five BTUs per square foot. "One of the shortcomings of LEED is that there is no guarantee your energy model is the same as real-life operating performance," Ms.

Full text: This high-tech home has an ultra-low power drain. "It is hard not to love it ," says owner John Eckfeldt
A blizzard can rage outside in -40C weather but inside the airtight Passive Home it may as well be June. "If it gets too hot you have to train yourself to open a window in winter," says Dr. John Eckfeldt of his home in Isabella, Minn. "After all, you aren't paying for the heat."
In fact, Dr. Eckfeldt and his wife, architect Nancy Schultz, need to check the outdoor thermometer to dress for the weather. "It feels like you are in a thermos and outside elements don't have an impact," he says.
Isabella is nestled in the Superior National Forest north of Lake Superior near the Iron Range, where iron ore has been mined since 1884. It is one of the coldest regions in the lower 48 states. The Canadian border is 40 kilometres north over the pristine Boundary Waters Canoe Area.
The Isabella Eco Home, as it is known, is a certified Passive House. The Passivhaus concept was pioneered in 1991 by physicist Wolfgang Feist in Darmstadt, Germany and today represents the highest energy standard for commercial and residential buildings. To be certified you must slash heating energy consumption by about 90 per cent - an achievement precisely modelled and measured by the U.S. Passive House Institute.
Innovations of the Passive House include ultra-thick insulation, doors and windows engineered to withstand cold and walls that encase the home in an airtight shell to retain heat. The Isabella Eco Home has 12-inch staggered double wall stud framing, 30-inch heavy timber framing on the roof and a continuous air barrier to minimize heat loss.
Another critical component is the lungs of the home - a mechanical heat recovery ventilation system. "In most buildings you lose much of your heat by warm air moving out and cold air moving in - so the control of air movement is key," Dr. Eckfeldt says. According to the rules, the Passive House air-tightness pressurization test result must be 0.5 air changes per hour - a standard 10 times more stringent than the U.S. Energy Star program.
The Isabella Eco Home heat recovery system reminds Ms. Schultz, owner of Compass Rose - an architecture firm that specializes in sustainability planning - of a 20- by 20-foot waffle iron with corrugated baffles. "The warm air going out passes side by side with clean, cold air coming in and heat is exchanged efficiently," Ms. Schultz says. "You need a big surface area for a counter-current exchange."
Passive House is a deceptively gentle description for an aggressive project kicked off by Dr. Eckfeldt and Ms. Schultz, passionate environmentalists, in 2007. "We took on net-zero energy [the home's annual net use of energy is zero] in a cold climate to challenge ourselves and see if we could push the envelope," says Dr. Eckfeldt, vice-chair for clinical affairs in the Laboratory Medicine and Pathology Department at the University of Minnesota.
Passive House standards, like old-fashioned passive solar homes, use non-mechanical means, including south-facing site placement, to get optimal solar collection from their triple-paned windows. "This is your first line of defence," Ms. Schultz says. "Then your active systems can be smaller."
The Isabella Eco House collects energy through 92 solar heat collector vacuum tubes and a photovoltaic system on the garage roof.
One of their most acclaimed features is their experimental solar thermal storage system of 9,000 cubic feet of sand and taconite beneath the home's insulated slab. Dr. Eckfeldt calculated heat values in various metals and found taconite pellets, which are almost pure iron oxide, refined from a local low-grade ore, had three times the heat storage capacity of sand or gravel. They bought nearly 20 truckloads from a nearby plant.
They employ an electric boiler and wood-burning stove in the winter months, as required. When the boiler malfunctioned in December, 2009, for 10 consecutive days of sub-zero weather, the home still stayed at 10° C thanks to its energy-conscious construction. Their measurement and control system is industrial quality to integrate the complex medusa of tubes, thermostats, controllers, fans, pumps and monitors. To achieve net zero energy use, they sell power back to the grid in summer during peak demand to offset what they buy during Minnesota's "dark months."
According to Ms. Schultz, who is accredited to design and evaluate buildings for LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) certification, the Passive House designation is more difficult than a LEED rating because it is based strictly on the energy required to run the house - five BTUs per square foot. "One of the shortcomings of LEED is that there is no guarantee your energy model is the same as real-life operating performance," Ms. Schultz says. "The Passive House model is very prescriptive and gives you a baseline. Then they require you to test the performance once it's built. In LEED you can still have a leaky building depending on other points to offset - like rain collection."
The couple says their windows and doors are castle worthy - big, beautiful and amazingly engineered. Some weigh a ton each and sailed from Germany to Montreal, then overland to Minnesota by train and truck. Ms. Schultz and a German-speaking Amish friend did a factory tour prior to buying Mueller windows. "There were high performance windows in fibreglass but I did a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of sustainability and wood is best," says Ms. Schultz who laughs, "they are filled with krypton gas but they may as well have been kryptonite."
The couple recognizes their 2,134-sq-ft home, at $500 per square foot conservatively, may not have payback in their lifetime. Asked what she would do differently, Ms. Schultz did not hesitate. "I would make the design simpler. But it is hard not to love it - I did not expect the comfort level."
Christopher Straka, principal with Vert Design, admires the pioneer work of the Isabella Eco Home. Mr. Straka, an environmental designer, received certification early in 2011 for Canada's first Passive House, the Rideau Residences, in Ottawa. A key attribute is that the windows and heating equipment, made in Canada, kept costs to $235 a square foot. "That is comparable to a custom home at about $200-$225 per square foot," Mr. Straka says.
Mr. Straka notes that Canadian building codes lag, even with a tradition of field research that dates to the Saskatchewan House in the 1970s. He hopes the principles of passive energy efficiency can be more widely legislated. "The bottom line is - we pay for energy. The Passive House movement is the future of green building."

A step forward for comfortably backward Oakville

Abstract: In an interview last week, Mr. [Jim Neilas] told me he guessed OpArt buyers will be child-free, either because they are young and haven't gotten around to having a family, or because their children have flown the nest and they're now ready for an active post-kid existence. Affluent youngsters will probably have much to do with peopling this project, Mr. Neilas said, because the offspring of Oakville people like to stay in the old home town.

When thinking about what's visible in the Toronto suburb of Oakville, the first thing that comes to mind isn't modernism. This very posh place, with its faux-chateaux and storybook neo-Georgian mansions, looks and feels old-fashioned, and is more than a little stuffy. The town is also proud to be that way, and eager to stay that way.
But, ready or not, downtown Oakville is on track to get a jolt of modernist architectural electricity a few years hence when OpArt Lofts rises on a swatch of former industrial land near the corner of Shepherd Road and Kerr Street.
Developed by Torontonian Jim Neilas, and designed by architect Stephen Teeple - both known for their artistically adventurous inner-city Hogtown projects - OpArt will be composed of two white volumes perched atop a two-level podium. The profile of the building will be strict, compact and austere.
But the two mid-rise towers, across most of their bleached surfaces, will be spangled with black-framed windows in jaunty patterns. Hence the name of the complex - an allusion to the eye-popping Op Art painting style of the 1960s.
The aesthetics of Mr. Teeple's façade are interesting, and so is its structural engineering. The use here of a window-wall system - the cladding will be precast concrete - is a departure from the common fabrication of condo skins nowadays.
Affixing a curtain wall of sheer glass to a tall multi-storey frame is still the most popular means by which developers and their architects provide residents with light and views, despite the fact that this treatment is energy-wasting and aesthetically trite to boot. A new approach to tall-building fenestration is overdue - or, rather, it's time for a return to the older but more environmentally responsible strategy represented by window-wall construction. Mr. Teeple shows that a step backward in engineering history can also be a step forward in inventive design, and a valid artistic response to contemporary worries about conservation.
That said, the architect of OpArt is no fundamentalist: In some spots on his façade, the festive array of punched openings gives way to multi-storey expanses of floor-to-ceiling glass. The result of these moves is an attractive variety of surfaces and textures on the exterior of the building. And if the renderings are anything to go on, the end-product should be a fresh, chic updating of classical modernism's solid geometry - a refined, very contemporary play with the sturdy old architectural cube.
Inside the concrete-framed podium and pair of cubes will be 181 condominium apartments, each furnished with a 10-foot ceiling and a balcony. Unit sizes will range from 579 square feet in an average one-bedroom suite up to 1,172 square feet, again on average, for three bedrooms. Seven townhomes, each 945 square feet in area and featuring 20-foot ceilings and a garden, open the bottom of the podium. When OpArt goes on the market later this spring, the asking price will be about $500 a square foot. The interior design is by the Toronto-based international firm of Cecconi Simone.
Who are the prospective customers of this innovative Oakville project?
In an interview last week, Mr. Neilas told me he guessed OpArt buyers will be child-free, either because they are young and haven't gotten around to having a family, or because their children have flown the nest and they're now ready for an active post-kid existence. Affluent youngsters will probably have much to do with peopling this project, Mr. Neilas said, because the offspring of Oakville people like to stay in the old home town.
In other news from Neilas Inc., the firm's condominium project called Cube, in Toronto's Little Italy, will probably be ready for occupancy this summer. Some local wags said it would never be completed and, indeed, Cube has a checkered history that, at some points, seemed close to ending badly.
The story began some five years ago when Jim Neilas proposed a six-storey luxury condominium scheme called N-Blox for the College Street site. Designed by Roland Rom Colthoff and Richard Witt, then with Quadrangle Architects, the building had a dramatically asymmetrical façade that expressed the interlocking and overhanging units within. The best thing about the project, apart from exterior daring, was the size of its apartments, which were as big as houses.
The market for such large and expensive condominium dwellings, however, didn't materialize, and N-Blox was cancelled almost immediately after its launch. Mr. Neilas and Mr. Rom Colthoff soldiered on at the site nevertheless, and, despite the engineering and design problems that have several times halted construction, Cube is set to open at last.
Cube's units are smaller than those in N-Blox, and the structure doesn't have the flair of the earlier project. But for me, the Cube tale is an important reminder of some things that are wrong with Toronto's residential market: the unwillingness of families to put down roots in condominiums south of suburbia, for instance, and the unreadiness of everyone but the very few to pay the price for excellent architecture.

Property taxes won't rise to cover Village losses, city says

Author: Bula, Frances

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/property-taxes-wont-rise-cover-village-losses/docview/861388300/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: In the end, the city did not go after the Maleks's residences, one in West Vancouver, one in the Lumiere building downtown. Lawyers in London informed the city that it could not get cash for property in Iran, since the Maleks themselves haven't been able to do so since they left the country in the late 1980s.

Full text: The Property Endowment Fund to be tapped to cover shortfalls, leaving less money for future acquisitions
Vancouver property owners won't see an explicit tax increase to cover the $230-million loss on the Olympic Village, with the city saying it will use profits from other real-estate ventures to absorb the shortfall.
"No council would try to put in a tax increase to manage this," said Councillor Geoff Meggs, the Vision council's point person on the increasingly complex financial mess.
Instead, the loss will be filtered through the city's famous Property Endowment Fund, a huge real-estate holdings arm that is used to acquire land for social housing, libraries, and other city projects.
While Mr. Meggs and city staff didn't specify the effects on the billion-dollar fund, whose workings few people truly understand, but the $230-million loss ultimately leaves less money and flexibility for city acquisitions.
Those losses are the final chapter of a saga in which councillors, staff, and the public were told for years that the city couldn't lose money on the Olympic Village project no matter what because the private developer had pledged millions in assets.
But when it came down to it, the city got only $45-million from the now defunct Millennium Development's real-estate empire, with a possibility of up to $17-million more depending on how certain deals work out.
That will leave the city short about $230-million on the whole project.
There is still $178-million, including interest, owing for the land. And the city is preparing to write off up to $50-million of the $579.5-million owing on the construction loan.
"The previous council and our council believed the recoveries would be higher," said Mr. Meggs.
"We hoped there was more. But I would never raise my hand in favour of any deal like this again without oversight."
Mr. Meggs couldn't say what the original guarantees were from Millennium directors Peter and Shahram Malek.
Several councillors and others have said the Maleks pledged their personal property - some in France and Iran, and all of their local holdings - and there were assurances this could cover any losses at the village.
"The personal assets were also listed, but there was some question about whether the city could go after that," said former councillor Peter Ladner.
In the end, the city did not go after the Maleks's residences, one in West Vancouver, one in the Lumiere building downtown. Lawyers in London informed the city that it could not get cash for property in Iran, since the Maleks themselves haven't been able to do so since they left the country in the late 1980s.
And it turned out that the Maleks's real-estate holdings in Vancouver and Toronto had so much debt accumulated against them - some of it acquired after they were pledged as security for the Olympic Village loan - that only $45-million in value was left.
The city didn't attempt to get Millennium's Evelyn Drive property in West Vancouver because it is worth only $75-million and has mortgages on it for $116-million. The situation was similar for Millennium holdings in Whistler and at the Hermitage development in downtown Vancouver.
In the end, however, the city has acquired a collection of properties unmatched since it took over foreclosed buildings during the Depression of the 1930s - the foundation of the city's lucrative Property Endowment Fund today.
The city now owns the heritage Province building next to Victory Square, a site on Pender that staff identified as a possible housing location, big blocks of land in West Vancouver, Burnaby and North Vancouver that have significant development potential, and some residential units in Toronto.
The land sites are worth $83-million in total, but have $38-million in debt registered against them.
Finally, the city is hoping to get $5-million from the controversial tower the Maleks are still building in the West End at Bidwell and Davie, once two other mortgage holders are paid off. As well, it could get as much as $12-million from the value in the company the Maleks created to hold the Olympic Village property, through potential tax writeoffs.
NPA Councillor Suzanne Anton that it's clear now that "due diligence was not carried out on the worldwide assets."
But she's not surprised, given the time pressure staff were working under to finish the village, after its start had been delayed by the previous COPE council.

Second-tier cities don't always play second fiddle

Author: Atchison, Chris

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/second-tier-cities-dont-always-play-fiddle/docview/861388263/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "Fort McMurray is a frontier market, an absolutely terrific market for people in the commercial and residential real estate business to go into," Mr. [Terry Kilburn] says. "It's not an easy place to get established in because a lot of townspeople don't welcome people from the outside because they're used to doing things their way, but if you have foresight and vision, you'll probably be welcomed with open arms."

Full text: Vancouver and Toronto steal headlines, but plenty of money is being made in Canada's smaller cities, where commodities and niche markets drive demand and keep landlords happy
When commercial property watchers and investors think about hot Canadian markets, they tend not to think about cities such as Saskatoon and St. John's.
That could be a significant oversight, experts say. For instance, yields in secondary markets can be nearly as strong as those in larger markets, says Robin White, the Toronto-based executive vice-president of real estate brokerage Avison Young's investment group.
"Investors tend to look at the major cities because that's where they see the most growth, and if they can buy commercial buildings and get an acceptable yield from them, they feel comfortable," Mr. White says. "When they have difficulty finding assets in those markets, they step to the next tier of cities."
With that in mind, experts outline the hottest secondary commercial property markets in Canada:
Quebec City
Highlights: Quebec City has roughly 17.2 million square feet of office inventory with a vacancy rate of 5.8 per cent, virtually unchanged from the year before, says Louis Burgos, Montreal-based branch manager for commercial real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield. He adds that net rental rates for class A office space in new developments such as a planned 200,000-square-foot tower, set for occupancy in early 2013, are between $18 and $20 per square foot.
Why it's hot: "There's pressure in the marketplace for new stock," Mr. Burgos says. "Service industries like legal, accounting, insurance and engineering firms are an active component of this growth because it's a government town. We're seeing them out in the marketplace looking for space, so we expect market rates to creep up because the vacancy rates are so low."
Why it has a bright future: Mr. Burgos points out that with nearly half the available office space in the provincial capital occupied by government, critical cash flow stability remains an attractive lure for potential landlords. "I think the combination of low vacancy and upward pressure on rental rates makes Quebec City a good place to look for investors," he adds.
Kitchener-Waterloo, Ont.
Highlights: A recent report by global real estate consultancy CB Richard Ellis noted that Kitchener-Waterloo's office inventory in the fourth-quarter of 2010 logged in at 13,941,600 square feet with a vacancy rate of just 5.4 per cent - down from 6.4 per cent the year before. Class A net office rental rates stood near $12.30 a square foot.
Why it's hot: "There is a great deal of office expansion under way due to the high-tech industry and the expansion of local university and college bureaucracies," says Don Hughes, president of Ottawa-based Facilities Commercial Realty Inc. "Kitchener's downtown core, which used to be really depressed, is also being revitalized, with torefronts being improved and loft-style residential space being built."
Bright future: According to Mr. Hughes, increasing diversification and growing prominence of the high-tech sector will continue to drive demand for commercial office, retail and industrial space for the foreseeable future.
Saskatoon
Highlights: A recent report by Saskatoon-based ICR Commercial Real Estate noted that overall retail vacancy in the city notched in at just 3.3 per cent at the end of last year, with downtown rental rates hovering around $30 a square foot. On the industrial front, net rental rates range from $10 to $13 a square foot, while industrial vacancy rates were down to just 2.7 per cent at the end of last year from 3.8 per cent in 2009. Class A office space is renting for between $32 and $34 a square foot, with a vacancy rate of less than 1 per cent in some parts of the city.
Why it's hot: The province's thriving resource economy is largely centred here, with two of the province's three major potash companies, BHP Billiton and Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, occupying space in the city's downtown core, says Richard Jankowski, Regina-based managing director of Avison Young's Saskatchewan division.
Bright future: "Products like potash, oil, gas, uranium, precious metals, all of those things which are capital-intensive commodities and require long-term development, are prevalent here," says Mr. Jankowski. "(Saskatoon's) commercial property potential isn't a flash in the pan."
St. John's
Highlights: According to Cushman & Wakefield, the Newfoundland and Labrador capital boasts 2,772,717 square feet of available office space with a vacancy rate of 4.1 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Net rent on class A office space is around $17.86 a square foot. The city's 2,706,946 square feet of available industrial space rents for an average net rate of $8.65 a square foot, with overall vacancy rates of 4.1 per cent.
Why it's hot: "What's changed in the Newfoundland market is that it's now functioning very much like an oil economy," says Bill MacAvoy, Cushman & Wakefield Atlantic managing director.
He adds that two of the stronger influences driving this market are commercial property investors looking for second-tier cities with stable fundamentals, as well as well capitalized Newfoundlanders returning home and looking for investment opportunities after working in places such as Alberta's oil sands region.
Bright future: "I think St. John's' economy offers a level of diversification that will take a lot of the risk out over time," Mr. MacAvoy adds. "As a region, (Atlantic Canada) withstood a lot of the 2008-2010 challenge better than most of North America."
Fort McMurray, Alta.
Highlights: While commercial property statistics for the Alberta boomtown are hard to come by, Terry Kilburn, an Edmonton-based real estate consultant with Avison Young, says industrial space in the oil sands heartland typically hovers at between $30 and $40 a square foot, with office spaces at as much as $30 a square foot. Vacancy rates in supply-starved Fort Mc-Murray are between 0 per cent and 2 per cent on average, he says.
Why it's hot: "Fort McMurray is a frontier market, an absolutely terrific market for people in the commercial and residential real estate business to go into," Mr. Kilburn says. "It's not an easy place to get established in because a lot of townspeople don't welcome people from the outside because they're used to doing things their way, but if you have foresight and vision, you'll probably be welcomed with open arms."
Bright future: As Mr. Kilburn points out, the town is driven almost entirely by the oil and gas industry. With oil prices climbing, Fort McMurray's fortunes show no signs of souring.

Full text:   As the sun moves, winds shift and guests arrive, a Georgian Bay retreat transforms. For The Globe's Carolyn Ireland, it's a summer of endless discovery
At first, I breezed right past that clump on the forest floor. The small, mottled snake probably hoped I would mistake it for a pine cone or a cluster of moss and keep walking. And so I did - at first. But on second glance, I had no doubt. This was a rattlesnake.
Rattlesnakes are threatened in Ontario and have a reputation for being timid. So what was this one doing in the middle of a busy construction site on an island in Georgian Bay?
I tried to sound nonchalant when I mentioned it to the tradesmen building a cottage. They crowded in to have a look.
"Your wife has a good eye," the stonemason cheerfully told my husband, the architect. "She spotted a rattlesnake."
"That's for sure," the carpenter said to me. "I've been working on this island for a year and I've never seen one."
"You must be a snake magnet," they all agreed.
People wondered how we would cope with the isolation when James and I decided to spend July on one of the 30,000 islands along the eastern coast of Georgian Bay. James needed to be close to his work and I wanted to experience the landscape that has been endowed with mythical status in the paintings of A.Y. Jackson and other members of the Group of Seven.
We would have no electricity, no satellite television and no nearby neighbours. We would have only an old tin boat for transportation and the sun's heat for power. Our friends worried we would be bored. I worried about the snakes.
But, as James pointed out, the Georgian Bay islands in the summer are as beautiful as any place in the world. Today, the world's largest freshwater archipelago is a UNESCO biosphere reserve. It's also one of the only remaining habitats of the protected eastern massasauga rattlesnake and the eastern fox snake.
"I've been climbing all over these islands for 15 years and I've rarely seen a snake," James assured me before we left Toronto.
On the first of July, we arrived at the island to find a charmingly ramshackle wood cottage on a dramatic point of land. There were three picturesque sleeping cabins, stunning views and about four acres of unfathomable wilderness. The shoreline was so craggy that James had to climb down and rescue our golden retriever every time she went for a swim from the rocks.
It seemed to me that my first rattlesnake sighting had come awfully early in our stay. Still, I arrived back at our island feeling strangely exhilarated. "At least that's over with," I thought. "Encounters with rattlesnakes are exceedingly rare." I would go on to have four more brushes with snakes that afternoon. (Don't ask.)
The next day, we went for a boat ride with Don Scale, who is a resident of such long experience on the Georgian Bay islands that he became the inspiration for the character of Andy Grant in the novel Last Night in Twisted River by John Irving.
I told Don about one practical jokester of a fox snake that coiled around a log right beside my leg and buzzed like a rattlesnake. I didn't know if I saw one snake four times or many different ones. Was the one I met on the stairway at the rear of the cottage the same one that slid out from under the barbecue in front later that day?
It probably was the same one, he said. He explained that fox snakes roam over a wide territory when they are hunting. They are non-venomous, grow to about five feet long, are good swimmers, and sometimes vibrate their tales to mimic rattlesnakes. When they find a den they like, they will go back to it again and again.
I'll just stay on the deck.
But retreating to safety proved to be no solution: I had nightmares every night. In my imagination, it seemed that serpents were everywhere. Better to get off the deck and prove that they weren't.
To reprogram my brain, I took up birdwatching. If my eyes were focused on the trees, they couldn't be trained on the ground. I read Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time and followed our ecstatic dog down to the bay for endless sessions of fetch.
While James worked, I became obsessed with photographing the captivating beauty. I would be pulled off the deck to capture scenes that seemed transformed by each transition of the sun or shift in the wind. The slower life on the island became, the more keenly I noticed the vivid colours of lichen, the tiny rock pools teeming with life, the micro-gardens springing up in the crevices, the pine trees struggling to survive in the larger cracks.
One night, we were invited to a dinner party on a neighbouring island. Our lively hostess told us about venturing out in her tin boat with her three small boys. When she and the boys wanted to explore landlocked Mallard Lake, they climbed out of the boat and dragged it across a bridge of land into the marsh. I resolved to become more brave.
Meanwhile, endlessly fascinated friends from the city would phone with offers of artisanal bread and fresh reading material. We don't need anything, we told them: Just come.
"Will we be able to do our 10-kilometre run on Sunday?" the committed runners asked. "No, and don't bother to bring your bicycles," we told them.
Our island experience seemed transformed with each new set of guests. Baby Malcolm tasted blueberries for the first time after James picked them from bushes growing wild all over the island. Eight-year-old Graeme had no sooner arrived than he announced that he was going to kayak alone to the next island. The architects were amazed that a wood-frame cottage had withstood the ferocious storms and howling winds for 50 years.
It has to be said, I saw more snakes. I figure James thought that I was hallucinating until I led him by the hand right up to a northern water snake folded into the crease of a rock.
"I've been climbing all over these islands for 15 years and I've rarely seen a snake," James said, more feebly this time.
"Now we know that's because you can't even see them when they're pointed out to you," I parried.
Some time during the month, we slipped into island time. The dog had figured out pathways up and over all of the rocks and conquered her fear of the tin boat. We went for treks to every massive boulder along our shore and dove into the clear, bracing water. Our boating excursions led us through the evocatively named Hole in the Wall and the preternaturally green Hemlock Channel. We ventured to the eerily beautiful outer island of Kishkadena, where the rocks flatten out to create a barren and almost treeless landscape.
By the time we had to leave, we felt anchored to our chunk of rock.
"Packing up a cottage seems like the very definition of melancholy," my husband observed.
Only after we had arrived home did James confess how close he came to stepping on a rattlesnake. He was running down the path at dusk when he heard the warning buzz and saw the snake just as his foot was coming down.
Still, we all emerged unscathed. And we never did grow bored. I did not get over my fear of snakes, but I won't let it keep me from returning. The best way to learn to comfortably co-exist is to hang out with more snakes.
"That's the only way," Don Scale tells me. "You have to spend more time on Georgian Bay islands."
*****
FINDING A RENTAL
Landing an island cottage rental on Georgian Bay is a bit like winning the summer holiday sweepstakes.
You could spend hours trolling the usual rental sites, or you can take a tip from insiders and go right to the most-informed source - high-end real-estate agents, though even those in the know aren't necessarily going to give you the selection you're looking for.
"Luxurious high-end cottage rental wanted" is the plea that went out from one real-estate agent recently to everyone in her database. Clients are looking for a modern retreat with wireless Internet access and good cellphone reception on one of the coveted Muskoka lakes in Ontario's cottage country.
Occasionally a handwritten index card about a property available for rent appears on the bulletin board at Pointe-au-Baril's Ojibway Club, where the locals gather to play tennis and meet for breakfast. More often, though, renters learn about a property by word of mouth through friends or families in the area.
"There are families that have established themselves here for generations," says George Webster, an agent with Moffat Dunlap Real Estate Ltd. who specializes in properties on the Georgian Bay islands.
Webster says some of his clients occasionally rent out a cottage or an entire island if they're going to be away. He currently has two properties available for the summer of 2011: The Byng Inlet rental offers a 32-acre island with a 5,000-square-foot lodge and two guest cabins for $6,300 a week. Spindrift Cottage offers nine acres, one cottage and a protected cove on Sans Souci Island for $2,000 a week.
Cottage Country Travel Services (cottagerental.com) has a few rental properties on the Georgian Bay shore. One three-bedroom cottage with beach access - which means a walk of 100 yards or so along the road - rents for $1,600 a week in peak season. And, you can try these cottage country websites: moffatdunlap.com, desmasdons.com, atthecottage.com, spiritofthenorth.com.
Renters will also need a boat. At Desmasdons Boatworks in Pointe-au-Baril, an aluminum fishing boat with bench seats and an outboard motor runs $100 a day or $600 a week. A more comfortable fibreglass boat with 115-horsepower outboard motor is $300 a day or $1,800 a week. Boaters are required to have a Pleasure Craft Operator Card.

Full text:   Real estate developers have at least 12 towers under way to attract new residents
The canteen at TIFF Bell Lightbox is a popular place to roost on weekday afternoons. Student filmmakers jostle with downtown financiers for a place to set their laptops, while at the tables lining the windows along King Street West, cineasts hang out after a screening. In a couple of weeks, legions of small people will stream in for the Sprockets children's film festival.
This type of vibrant cultural scene has transformed the entertainment district since Hollywood director Ivan Reitman stood on the site of the former Farb's Car Wash and unveiled plans to build the new headquarters for the Toronto International Film Festival.
Art students are showing their work at OCAD University's Graduate Gallery on Richmond; well-heeled empty nesters are enjoying condo living in the Festival Tower above the Lightbox.
It all makes for a remarkable image makeover for the area since the 1990s when Toronto's club land was the largest in North America and NBA basketball stars often took to the dance floor. Local residents and business mavens clashed with the club owners, notorious shootings intensified the pressure and the police presence swelled.
Most of the clubs have been shuttered, but for City of Toronto councillor Adam Vaughan, the area's transformation has many phases to come. He has pushed for tighter restrictions on the bars and lounges that remain and pledges to return overcrowded sidewalks to the community.
Mr. Vaughan wants to encourage more families to move downtown in order to keep the schools, daycares, libraries and playgrounds in the core. Real estate developers, meanwhile, have at least 12 condo towers under way to accommodate new residents.
One of the pioneering builders in the area is David Wex of Urban Capital, who launched Camden Lofts back in the Whiskey Saigon days of the mid-1990s.
"Only 10 years ago it was a really derelict area," he says.
Mr. Wex and other developers have agreed to Mr. Vaughan's push to allocate 10 per cent of their new buildings to bigger units that can house families.
"It's a laudable goal," he says of the councillor's plan of bringing in more families. "It's not going to be an easy thing to achieve."
Mr. Wex says young professionals between the ages of 28 and 42 are his target market at Tableau. While smaller units have been selling briskly, only about 50 per cent of the three bedroom units have sold at Tableau, where prices range from $250,000 to more than $600,000.
"The three bedrooms will lag because they're more expensive."
Tableau's architecture will incorporate the brick warehouse that has served most recently as the Embassy nightclub and Mr. Wex would like to see more of industrial-era buildings in the neighbourhood preserved. "Those are the textures that we're building on. We infill but we don't start taking down the very buildings that were interesting at the start."
If he had his way, the continuing makeover of the area would include more parkland.
It's easy to find ...
Model suites : Victorian houses and brick warehouses are being replaced by glass high rises. In some cases they are being incorporated into the design. Some of the projects in the works include Bisha Hotel & Residences, Cinema Tower, M5V, Peter Street Condos, Pinnacle, Studio, Theatre Park, The Mercer and 300 Front St. Popular perks at various projects include screening rooms, party rooms, landscaped terraces with private cabanas and the chance to buy tickets to TIFF ahead of the masses.
Theatre & Music: The Royal Alexandra Theatre, Princess of Wales Theatre and Roy Thomson Hall provide more opportunities for cultural edification.
Transportation: The King, Queen and Spadina streetcar lines run through the area. A short walk east brings residents to the St. Andrew subway station and Union Station lies to the south. From there, VIA Rail and GO trains whisk travellers out of the city. The Toronto Island Airport is a short hop. But really, one of the pleasures of living in the entertainment district is the possibility of going everywhere on foot.
It's not so easy to find ...
Schools : Parents of little tykes won't find an abundance of schools to choose from, but the institutions that are here are long-established and welcoming to a diverse crowd. The little Phoebe Street School built in 1855 near Queen and Spadina has gone through a few transformations on its way to becoming Ogden Junior Public School. The school's primary language is English but it also offers Cantonese lessons to all students. The 125-year-old Ryerson Community School is a winner of the Ruth Atkinson Hindmarsh Award for excellence in community based programming. In 2008 the school claimed the Anne Hope award for its commitment to promoting social justice, human rights and anti-racist education. A little to the west, St. Mary Catholic School has been around since 1852. Today kids that attend classes from junior kindergarten to grade 8 list their backgrounds as Portuguese, South American, Filipino, West Indian, Asian and Central American. High school-age students head to Harbord Collegiate Institute, which offers the option of French Immersion.
Family friendly services: Opportunities to buy giant-sized boxes of cereal and play on the teeter-totter are not so plentiful in this neighbourhood compared with, say, getting a mani-pedi or buying a fixed-wheel bike.
Inner Peace: Buddhist meditation centres, trees and nature are harder to come by. You may be able to buy lots of outdoor gear at the various retailers here but you'll have to wait for your Himalayan trek to use it.
Parking : Asphalt is quickly being taken over by high-rises.
Harbingers of change
Mr. Vaughan says nightclubs will now be regulated as entertainment facilities rather than as restaurants. Stricter rules will be enforced, he pledges. Ruffians also have to contend with police cameras and security lights. The parkette and streetscape of Richmond Street will be redesigned, with work starting this year.
A new shelter for the homeless opened late last year at 129 Peter St. It includes an Assessment and Referral Centre and a 40-bed dormitory.
The Entertainment District Business Improvement Area has come up with a master plan that includes turning John Street into a pedestrian-friendly corridor of art and culture. With such cultural institutions as MuchMusic, the TIFF Bell Lightbox and the CBC Broadcast Centre along the way, John Street would provide a link from the Art Gallery of Ontario to the waterfront. And the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Toronto has opened its doors on Wellington Street West.
Market values
From $250,000 to a rumoured $13-million for penthouse at the Ritz-Carlton and every price in between. A little over $1-million will meet the asking price for a two-bedroom apartment with a view of the lake on the 32nd floor of the Festival Tower above the TIFF Bell Lightbox.

There's a lot riding on the C-Class, Mercedes-Benz's top-selling car. Since the launch of the first C-Class in 1982 - back then, it was known as the 190 model - Mercedes-Benz has sold more than 8.5 million vehicles from the C-Class family worldwide.
"The current model series alone has found more than 1.25-million buyers since its launch in 2007 - much more than its predecessor over the same period. As the biggest-selling model series in Mercedes-Benz's passenger car portfolio, the C-class sedan was the global market leader in its segment last year. ... We aim to continue this success story with the new generation," says Mercedes' Jurgen Kraus, at the press launch of the 2012 model.
Well, technically it's not a new-generation C-Class - despite more than 2,000 new components, it's a mid-life refresh. But the changes, inside, outside, and under the new aluminum hood, are welcome.
The new 2012 C-Class sedan goes on sale this July. You can choose between six trims - a C250 or a C350 in rear-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive configurations. There's also a C300 4Matic and a sportier C63 AMG up for grabs.
Despite having the same name, the C250 RWD and the C250 4Matic have two different engines. The C250 RWD gets a new, more fuel-efficient, 1.8-litre, turbocharged, four-cylinder engine, while the 4Matic version gets the same V-6 as the 2011 model year.
Mated to the engine is a new seven-speed automatic transmission. My tester is a C250 RWD sedan with 201 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque; it can hit 0-100 km in 7.2 seconds.
The ride and handling are excellent; it's solid and steady, especially along the winding roads of this Spanish volcanic island. But when pushed on the steep, twisty mountain roads, the engine growls, working hard.
The afternoon route proved no problem for the C350 sedan, thanks to its more powerful 3.5-litre V6 engine, which delivers 302 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. The fuel economy has also improved by 10 per cent compared to last model and the CO2 emissions have dropped, too. But unfortunately, unlike our European counterparts, innovative fuel saving technology, such as ECO stop/start, which kills the engine when stopped to save fuel and reduce CO2 emissions, won't be available on the C-Class in Canada, yet.
The C350 is powerful and fast; it'll hit 0 to 100 in 6 seconds. Tackling the hairpin turns and climbing the mountain peaks proved little challenge for the C350; the C250 was more at home amid the sandy volcanic beaches and wide-open roads.
Exterior design changes include an all-new front-end with active bi-xenon headlamps with LED turn signal indicators, a new rear-end with LED tail lamps, new rear bumpers with new rear diffuser design and all-new wheel designs.
The inside is more luxurious and spacious. Real wood sweeps across the dash, doors and centre console, sprucing up the cabin and making it feel more like an E-Class than a C-Class sedan. There's a new centre stack with revised vents and instruments and a row of aluminum buttons.
Replacing the previous pop-up navigation system is a new telematics unit, dubbed NTG 4.5, in the dash with larger screens and sharper graphics. The base model gets a 5.8-inch colour display; a larger 7-inch colour display with DVD audio/video and an SD-card slot is also available.
But the navigation system itself leaves a lot to be desired. Whenever we stopped to snap photos and restarted the ignition, a new route, often much longer than the previous one, would pop up. The navigation would also repeat instructions, sending us in circles on the same street before recalculating the route. We resorted to a map in the route book and asking for directions from locals to find our destinations. I'd ask in Italian, they'd respond in Spanish - believe it or not, it worked much better than the navigation system.
There are 10 new driver assistance features - features that you'd expect to find on pricier Mercedes-Benz vehicles. Adaptive high-beam assist automatically activates and de-activates the high beams based on the traffic as well as distronic plus proximity control, which automatically maintains a safe distance between you and the vehicle ahead.
You can also opt for a driver assistance package with blind spot assist, which warns you when a car is lurking in your blind spot and it's unsafe to make a lane change, and lane keeping assist, which warns the driver when you're unintentionally crossing the lane.
You can also add a number of other optional packages including a premium package on the C250 with climate comfort front seats, keyless-go entry, a rear-view camera and heated rear seats.
The C350 gets a premium rear seating package with three-zone climate control, a rear-window sunshade and roller blinds for the rear side windows. Prices aren't available, yet.
Mercedes-Benz is banking the C-Class will stay ahead of the pack with its refreshed sedan.

My perennial garden in the sky

Author: John Bentley Mays

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/my-perennial-garden-sky/docview/860865633/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The woman who enthusiastically answered the working boy's appeal - the lady famed outside her inner circle as Gertrude Jekyll (rhymes with treacle) - was accustomed to gardening on a somewhat grander scale than a window box. Her home plot in Surrey was big enough to keep a half-dozen gardeners busy year round. In her very long life, Ms. Jekyll would design, often in consultation with outstanding architects, nearly 400 gardens, large and small, for a galaxy of wealthy and less lofty clients.

In 1891, a young factory worker in Manchester ran an ad in a local paper, asking for help in planting a window box just three feet long and 10 inches wide.
As things turned out, the ad pitched up on the breakfast table of a portly, myopic, middle-aged Englishwoman known to her friends as Aunt Bumps, who decided at once to take the boy and his box in hand.
"The post brought him plants of mossy and silvery saxifrages, and a few small bulbs," Aunt Bumps recalled later. "Even some stones were sent, for it was to be a rock-garden, and there were to be two hills of different height with rocky tops, and a longish valley with a sunny and a shady side."
The woman who enthusiastically answered the working boy's appeal - the lady famed outside her inner circle as Gertrude Jekyll (rhymes with treacle) - was accustomed to gardening on a somewhat grander scale than a window box. Her home plot in Surrey was big enough to keep a half-dozen gardeners busy year round. In her very long life, Ms. Jekyll would design, often in consultation with outstanding architects, nearly 400 gardens, large and small, for a galaxy of wealthy and less lofty clients. She was gardening history's greatest master of painterly planting, with blossoms serving as dabs of bright pigment on her verdant canvas, and with sweeping floral beds as brushstrokes.
But, as she knew perfectly well, and as snobs never learn, creating a wonderful garden has less to do with money or great space than with rigorous attention to both detail and ensemble. It requires a thorough grasp of plant structure and behaviour, reverence for the genius loci , expressed in the suite of lights and shadows, weather and built context that makes every site, even the tiniest window box, unique. Gertrude Jekyll had it all - talent, exacting taste and commitment - and that made her the perfect guide for the young man in Manchester.
The good example of Ms. Jekyll has been on my mind lately, as I've been thinking forward to the time, fast approaching, when I can get back into my garden. This bit of unroofed architecture is small, only about 350 square feet, and is perched on the third level of my west-side Toronto apartment.
Shortly after moving into the converted tool-and-die factory where I still live, 20 years later, I set about turning the deck into a site suitable for a garden. I had water piped up to the deck, wooden planters constructed, trellises installed. And I had to learn some facts about how to get a perennial garden to flourish three storeys off the ground. Among these facts, for example, was that it's not freezing that kills plants over the winter, but a combination of thawing and refreezing. The boxes had to be doubly insulated, to insure that the roots of the plants stayed frozen in a block of ice from autumn to spring.
What I managed to build, then, was a place small enough to be manageable in the midst of a busy life, but quite large enough for someone to do something interesting there.
That someone, in this case, was the gifted garden designer Anne Gibson, who, several years ago, tackled the transformation of my south-facing roof deck into an urban refuge with verve and broad knowledge of what could work.
The result of her labour was a fresh and handsome perennial garden in the sky. One trellised wall was clothed by a stout climbing hydrangea, another wall by cascades of clematis and a pink rose, and a wood-framed bed was planted with dwarf lilacs and shrub roses. There was lively colour in every month of the Toronto summer, and the greenery produced an attractive sense of enclosure and sanctuary.
But living in a big city means, among other things, that it's altogether too easy to get distracted from good pastimes like gardening by work and other pleasures, and that's exactly what happened to me. Over the past couple of summers I have neglected the garden, with predictable outcomes. Unpruned, the lilacs grew enormous and jungly. The clematis vines, untrained on their trellis, got droopy and tangled and matted. The bones of Ms. Gibson's skilful design are still there, underneath the wrack and ruin, but what was once a place of green escape is no more.
So now you know my project for the spring and summer of 2011: to apply some Jekyllian fervour to the job of restoring my deck garden to what it once was. Garden artists, from the Victorian times of Gertrude Jekyll and her window box, down to the present of Anne Gibson and other designers, have greatly enriched the quality and temper of urban life. But now that April's here, the time has come - almost - to make good on their proposals, at least in the tiny corner of metropolis I call home.

A bridge to international markets for Quebec business

Abstract: "What we're offering is a value-added service to small- and medium-sized Quebec companies," explains Michel Lefebvre, the Caisse's vice-president for business development in the province.

Full text:   Pension fund manager the Caisse helped GLV in its watershed moment, part of a plan to move local companies on to the world stage
Richard Verreault and his management team at GLV Inc. had spent years hammering out a strategy to build a global player in the high-growth area of water treatment.
Governments and the private sector alike are increasingly spending on technology and systems to better manage the scarce planetary resource that water is becoming.
Montreal-based GLV was keen to tap into the boom in water-related spending. It sold off its mineral processing group in order to focus on two areas: pulp-and-paper processing and water treatment.
And water was to become the company's predominant business and main revenue generator.
To move to the next level in water treatment on the world stage, GLV knew it needed to make a splash on the acquisition front.
Austrian firm Christ Water Technology AG made for the ideal target - acquiring it would position GLV among the leaders in European water treatment, recycling and purification, as well as offering impressive growth potential in such key areas as the Middle East and Asia.
For much-needed financial help and expertise in making the deal happen, Mr. Verreault turned to giant public pension fund manager Caisse de depôt et placement du Quebec.
"This was our biggest acquisition. We approached the Caisse because we knew it would have the contacts and the know-how," says Mr. Verreault, GLV's president and chief executive officer.
The $153-million deal, which closed last year, helped boost the company's annual revenue to the $800-million range from $500-million.
The transaction - in which the Caisse invested $39.8-million - was no one-off event.
It's just part of a much broader strategy spearheaded by Caisse chief Michael Sabia to help small and mid-sized Quebec businesses conquer international markets.
"What we're offering is a value-added service to small- and medium-sized Quebec companies," explains Michel Lefebvre, the Caisse's vice-president for business development in the province.
The strategy represents a strengthening of the Caisse's mandate to contribute to Quebec's economic development, as well as finding the best investment returns for its depositors, which include the Quebec Pension Plan.
"We have investments and networks around the world, but we also have a good cross-section of companies in the province that have significant potential to expand in outside markets," Mr. Lefebvre says. "So we decided it was logical to put our global network at the disposal of Quebec companies."
Among other Quebec-based companies the Caisse has so far helped under the program is the world-renowned Cirque du Soleil. The fund invested $25-million last year in the entertainment juggernaut to help the Cirque create new shows and related products.
Acting as a bridge to foreign markets to help Quebec firms develop abroad is a key part of the Caisse's strategy, Mr. Sabia said in a business presentation last year.
He pointed out that only 30 per cent of the province's small- and medium-sized companies that export do business in Europe and only 16 per cent in Asia.
To add greater leverage to the program, the Caisse has teamed up with two partners: AXA Private Equity and HSBC Bank Canada.
AXA, a long-time private equity partner with the Caisse, brings its far-reaching global network across Europe and Asia. In exchange, the Caisse offers its extensive North American expertise to help AXA advise and finance European companies looking to this continent for expansion.
The agreement with HSBC is aimed at helping Quebec companies implement their growth projects abroad, including expansion, acquisition and investment activities.
Companies that qualify can get access to financing for projects - such as acquisitions or plant construction - of $10-million or more.
Quebec companies are also invited to conferences on global expansion that the Caisse has been offering throughout the province.
"We offer advice on how to make the shift to a more global mindset," says Luc Houle, vice-president of private equity investments at the Caisse.
"The idea is to get closer to business people. They don't only want financing. They are also looking for good business strategies and global networks to access."
On GLV's acquisition of Christ, for example, the Caisse was able to swing into action quickly to help clinch the deal thanks to its size and clout, Mr. Houle says.
"There were some wrinkles in terms of the regulatory environment in Austria that we were able to iron out in a short time period. "We have experience with these kinds of transactions."
***
ON THE CAISSE
The Caisse de depôt wants to play a larger role as a bridge to help small and medium-sized companies in the province take on global markets. Here's a look at the organization: Net assets (at end of 2010)
$151.7-billion, up from $131-billion a year earlier.
Investment outside Quebec * Equities: About 45 per cent
* Real estate: Roughly 55 per cent
* Private investments: 70 per cent.
Caisse clients
Companies that have received financial and strategic assistance from the Caisse include:
* Live entertainment powerhouse Cirque du Soleil
* GLV Inc., a Montreal-based water treatment and purification company
The challenge
* Only 30 per cent of Quebec's small and medium-sized export companies active in Europe.
* Only 16 per cent of such companies are active in Asia

Abstract: "We know we can't compete door-to-door," said Mr. [Jack Hicks]. "They have resources we don't. But we will make maximum use of e-mail and organize ourselves online. We have a Facebook page with 90 friends already from different communities - we hope to use that to identify people in other communities who may become supporters."

Full text:   With 25 far-flung communities spread over three time zones, Nunavut presents unique challenges for a vote-seeking politician
If newly minted NDP candidate Jack Hicks wants to go door knocking in his riding, he'll need to charter a plane.
With the federal election campaign a week old, the researcher and suicide prevention activist is scrambling to put together a strategy to upset Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq after committing on Monday to run.
It's difficult enough to take down a well-liked cabinet minister in the best circumstances, but the geographic challenges make it especially daunting to run a campaign in Nunavut, Canada's largest riding. There are 16,916 voters sprinkled across a land mass the size of Western Europe, although 20 per cent of them are in Iqaluit.
"You can run a traditional campaign in Iqaluit," said Mr. Hicks, who was approached by party representatives to be a candidate late last week and surprised himself by accepting. "But the other places are more difficult to deal with. We're asking ourselves if we know anyone in each community, whether we can do bulk mail drops through Canada Post, that sort of thing."
He's not the only one trying to piece together a campaign at the last minute. The Green Party announced late on Monday it would field Toronto real estate agent Paul Azzarello after its search for a local candidate fizzled. The Liberals, meanwhile, are without a candidate although they promise to have one by next Monday's deadline.
It's no wonder that potential candidates are loath to line up against the incumbent. Ms. Aglukkaq won the riding in 2008 in a tight race, but has since leveraged her role as Health Minister into a considerable advantage over her rivals.
Since the last election, she has used weeks away from the House of Commons to visit every community in the riding, no small feat considering that it covers three time zones.
This week, she's back in those communities trying to add to her support ahead of the May 2 election. Her staffers can't be sure where she is from moment to moment, and media outlets don't follow the day-to-day campaign twists because they don't have the budgets or bodies to cover the vast northern expanse.
"There are basically 25 communities candidates can visit and whatever they do when they are out there we can't cover," said Jim Bell, editor of the weekly Nunatsiaq News.
In tight races - Ms. Aglukkaq won the last election by fewer than 500 votes - that face-to-face contact can be enough to swing the riding. But candidates are wary of travelling, even if they can find the money. A bad storm could keep a candidate grounded in a remote community for days, taking vital time away from the campaign.
"People will visit here during the campaign and think it's quiet and nothing is going on, but in reality everything is happening on a door-to-door basis," Mr. Bell said.
Campaigning against an incumbent is also difficult because there are few opportunities for rivals to run advertising campaigns and raise their profile. Two weekly newspapers cover the territory, and the CBC North radio service is a crucial source of news for most residents.
"In the South, there are any number of private radio and television stations where you can buy advertising," Mr. Bell said. "But CBC doesn't sell advertising on the radio, and that's the main electronic medium for many people. It makes it very difficult to raise your profile."
One way to boost vote counts without putting in the kilometres is social media. Ms. Aglukkaq has a Twitter feed, although she doesn't update it often. Mr. Hicks is organizing the riding's NDP supporters into Facebook groups where they can discuss ideas and feel a sense of community.
"We know we can't compete door-to-door," said Mr. Hicks. "They have resources we don't. But we will make maximum use of e-mail and organize ourselves online. We have a Facebook page with 90 friends already from different communities - we hope to use that to identify people in other communities who may become supporters."

It's concocted hysteria v. 'bang, bang, bang' in the election-ad campaign. Neither's winning

Author: Doyle, John

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/concocted-hysteria-v-bang-election-ad-campaign/docview/859724935/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Next thing you know, there's a Liberal attack ad aimed at Stephen Harper: "He's gone Too Far." The conclusion is "Abuse," "Deceit," "Contempt," bang, bang, bang in red ink. Memorable only for including the photo of that Carson guy's alleged popsy.

It was 10 days ago, a Saturday. A busy day in my little life. It was half-time in the soccer game between Wales and England, a qualifying game for entry into the Euro 2012 championship tournament. It's a mini-World Cup for Europe.
In the midst of the car commercials and reminders about the upcoming Toronto FC game, it arrived - the first Conservative election campaign ad. The Snow Bird jets flying. The Flag. Hair in the Fridge Harper at his desk working on piles of paper (apparently a computer-free area, as usual). Honouring the war dead. A factory visit or some such hard-hat photo op.
It was a very ordinary commercial. Patriotism. We're in safe hands with the man-at-the-desk. We can all sleep better because he watches over us. He's working on the papers while flibbertigibbets are being irresponsible. Or something.
Mostly, election campaign ads are analyzed by advertising professionals. It's very predictable. There was one such analysis on CBC the other night. Self-consciously cool and self-important ad people cooing over the choice of some colour in a commercial to "soften" something.
This is a crock. These are the people who afflicted us with everything from "It's Patrick! He just bought life insurance!" to the crazy-as-a-loon Grey Power lady shouting at her car. And they still have jobs. Allowed to walk the streets and everything.
The truly interesting thing to you and me - people who watch TV (hey, call us "everyday Canadians") and see the commercials with at least part of the brain working - is that the opening Conservative ad had nothing to do with the campaign that duly unfolded last week.
After establishing that Harper is Canadian and in favour of Canada, the Conservative TV-commercial campaign became ceaseless attack ads. Reckless Coalition, Ignatieff didn't come back for you, tax hikes are looming under this guy who didn't come back for you. TV viewers were being shouted at, while trying to figure out if the guy with the mustache on NCIS did the dirty deed. (Probably, he did.)
It's said that attack ads are used because they work. Concocted hysteria succeeds, apparently. As someone whose job it is to assess television, I have my doubts about the long-term success, though. People tune out or skip ads that become so familiar they're irritating. And the attacks ads on Iggy have achieved that level of dreaded familiarity.
Later last week, along came Iggy in commercial ads to mock the attack ads. Go figure. The ad business must be thriving in Canada. Real-estate portfolios in the Caribbean are based on such things. Anyway, Iggy says: "Who's he kidding?" to Harper's attack ads. A good "gotcha" commercial. After millions being spent to demonize him, Iggy turns up smiling and -whaddaya know - Canadian. Nothing to be afraid of. Silly, silly Conservatives. (See "Concocted hysteria" in previous paragraph.)
But next thing you know, there's a Liberal attack ad aimed at Stephen Harper: "He's gone Too Far." The conclusion is "Abuse," "Deceit," "Contempt," bang, bang, bang in red ink. Memorable only for including the photo of that Carson guy's alleged popsy. Might have been better if it included: "This Harper guy looks like he keeps his hair in the fridge every night, doesn't he?" Or possibly: "Who does he think he is - Our Glorious Leader?"
What would I know, I'm only the TV critic. Bit of humour helps, though, raises the tone even in attack ads.
The NDP ads have been, well, a tad sad. There's Jack Layton in blue shirt and tie, sleeves rolled up and all managerial, sitting in front of a giant Canadian flag. Canada. Good management. We get it. Totally. A four-year-old could get it. Put-upon Canadians make an appearance, saying Ottawa doesn't work for them/help them. Geez, that's terrible. Exactly what Jack Layton can do about this is unclear. He's rolled up his sleeves already. A good start, one supposes. Or maybe the lack of clarity is just me, as I'm busy wondering if the ads are done by the same ad people who put Dalton McGuinty in a blue shirt, sleeves rolled up, looking like a nice manager.
The Green Party. Oh dear heavens, the Green Party. I've seen one ad. What's it selling? The Green Party is against TV attack ads. That's it. It's brilliant.
Anyone who watches TV is sold on the Green Party. The party wins the TV watcher's vote because, really, the other ads are dull, unadventurous and deeply irritating.

LISTING AGENT
Marty Pospischil, Dexter Associates Realty
The Action: This nearly century-old residence in Kitsilano sits on a 35-by-50-foot lot, which agent Marty Pospischil anticipated might work only for a small segment of buyers.
Utilizing an arsenal of marketing strategies, from publicizing the property on nearly a dozen websites to hand-delivering ads to local agents brought in hundreds of visitors before one family made an offer.
What They Got: In the past two years, this 2,149-square-foot house was revamped not just with two remodelled kitchens and three bathrooms, but also with new plumbing and wiring throughout.
* Stepping in from the covered porch, there is an entrance hall that opens into a living room and central dining area, which is adjacent to the rear kitchen.
The Agent's Take: "[It has a] small square lot with no yard, but it's a fantastic, three-level character home," says agent Marty Pospischil. "Primarily, it was perfect for those that were not interested in strata title living, but were not financially in the detached house price category for the west side of Vancouver."

Abstract: Jeremy Reid, who teaches the class of 30, said he came up with the idea as a way to persuade his students they could connect directly with the political system.

Full text:   All Mike Marsman wanted to know was why his MP had stopped following him.
The London, Ont., father of two has been using the microblogging service Twitter since 2007, and had been following his Member of Parliament, Ed Holder, for more than a year before the election campaign began.
But after he sided with a Twitter user who disagreed with the candidate, Mr. Marsman discovered the politician had unfollowed him. He sent a message asking why, and heard nothing in response.
"I am a bit of an undecided. It was a perfect opportunity to really win my vote, and he didn't," Mr. Marsman said on Friday. "His method of engaging online pretty much lost my vote."
It's being touted as the first social media campaign, but many political candidates trying to get elected on May 2 seem to regard Twitter as a soap-box rather than a conference call, using their 140-character limit to swagger or announce policy, but passing up opportunities to engage voters directly.
On Wednesday, Olivier Maurice, a Quebec real estate broker, sent a Tweet to party leaders Stephen Harper, Jack Layton, Michael Ignatieff and Gilles Duceppe saying he would vote for whoever addressed his riding of Brossard-LaPrairie first.
As of Friday, he hadn't received a single message in reply.
"I doubt any of them will answer," he said on Twitter. "I'm just 1 vote in a riding won via Recount!"
In Kamloops, a Grade 11 social studies class at Westsyde Secondary School started a Twitter feed under the name @BlueWave94 to ask questions of the leaders.
Jeremy Reid, who teaches the class of 30, said he came up with the idea as a way to persuade his students they could connect directly with the political system. But so far, no one has answered their questions, which focus on topics from the harmonized sales tax to the legalization of marijuana. "We aren't getting any responses, so we're trying a new strategy of sending the questions to our local candidates as well as the federal party leaders," Mr. Reid said. "We're hoping we'll get some answers that way."
His students post the questions using a large touch-screen computer mounted on their classroom wall, and will continue to do so throughout the campaign, he said.
"In the past, we could have mailed in a letter and get a form response back in six weeks. This is a little more instant."
But few candidates seem to have grasped the instantaneous connection possible through Twitter, or the impact it could have to communicate directly with voters in this way. Most seem to think they're in an echo chamber, rather than a digital rope line.
"I think if you set up a channel of communication and then ignore people speaking in it, it's a problem," said Jonathan Rose, a political science professor at Queen's University. "It creates expectations when none existed before."
And the parties stand to lose at least a few votes as a result.
A man in Halifax offered to vote for either Mr. Ignatieff or Mr. Harper, depending on who would "tweet at me first." If he didn't hear from either, he said he'd vote Green.
A West Coast user offered to vote for his Conservative candidate if he received a "retweet acknowledging the Canucks being Canada's team these playoffs!!!"
Of course, there are exceptions. Tory MP Tony Clement, long celebrated for his use of social media, has been responding to questions from constituents directly, as well as regularly thanking people for their comments and support.
Even Ed Holder, the Tory candidate who unfollowed a constituent, has been personally answering Twitter questions.
But Mr. Marsman said he is still disappointed at the level of political discourse he has encountered via the Twitter campaign, and surprised by the fact that any candidate would reject him online.
"It's like not shaking someone's hand. It really is," he said. "You wouldn't take your hand away walking by someone, whether you thought they were going to vote for you or not."

Where there's a malaise, we need a messiah. Hollywood is certainly in a malaise, with 2011's first-quarter box-office receipts down 20 per cent from a year ago, sagging under the weight of such expensive flops as Red Riding Hood , Mars Needs Moms and Battle: Los Angeles . Perhaps that's why there's been so much buzz over the past week about Superman: Man of Steel , a movie that won't even open until December, 2012.
In the last week we've learned that Amy Adams, fresh off her Oscar nomination for The Fighter , will play Lois Lane opposite English actor Henry Cavill in the muscular title role.
Moreover, we already know that brand-name stars Kevin Costner and Diane Lane have signed on as an attractive Ma and Pa Kent, and that the movie will start shooting in Chicago this summer with an estimated $175-million (U.S.) budget.
But there are major cracks appearing in the Fortress of Solitude. Last Sunday, Nikki Fink's scoop site, Deadline Hollywood, released part of a letter from the recently deceased Joanne Siegel, the widow of Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel (and inspiration for Lois Lane), imploring media giant Time-Warner not to pursue its current legal actions against her and her ill daughter.
The lawsuit, which The Hollywood Reporter called a "cartoonishly nasty" copyright battle between the company and the estates of Siegel and his Superman co-creator, Canadian-born artist Joe Shuster, was re-launched in November 2010, and is a story that can only get bigger.
The controversy is also a reminder that, for a dude wearing only a cape and a leotard, Superman carries a surprising amount of baggage. Ever since director Richard Donner was fired while filming the 1980 sequel to the original 1978 film, the franchise has been mishandled. After four Superman films and one Supergirl , the series was run into the ground by 1987.
For most the next two decades, the Man of Steel was left to rust in Hollywood development hell. A string of titles, including Superman: The New Movie , Superman Reborn , Superman Lives , Superman: Flyby and Batman Vs. Superman , were pitched but never fully produced. Tim Burton spent a fruitless year working on a Superman film. Potential Supermen - Nicolas Cage, Josh Hartnett and Will Smith - never made it to the screen.
Meanwhile, the superhero landscape changed. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins revived the genre by tapping into the post-9/11 discourse on heroism. Bryan Singer's Superman Returns felt dated when it was released in 2006, and although the film earned more than $390-million at the box office, Warner Bros. felt it underperformed. After a repeatedly delayed sequel, the studio decided to jump on the current "re-boot" mania and fast-tracked an entirely new Superman movie, based on a script by David S. Goyer ( Batman Begins , The Dark Knight ).
The company picked special-effects whiz Zack Snyder ( 300 , Watchmen ), a director whom the L.A. Times called a "polarizing" figure. Last weekend, Snyder's pet project, Sucker Punch , fizzled so badly it was out-drawn at the box office by Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules . That must have caused a few Warner executives to choke on their morning lattes before they went into damage-control mode.
To that end, Jeff Goldstein, the executive in charge of domestic distribution for the company, told the L.A. Times that Sucker Punch "brought out [Snyder's] core fan base," then added that the director "has a lot of potential, and with a bigger, broader title, he can attract a wider audience, as he has in the past." As a vote of confidence, that was almost enthusiastic.
So, long before the movie actually hits the theatres, much remains muddled and one thing is certain: The backstage story of Superman: Man of Steel should provide us with one of the liveliest dramas in Hollywood.

There's a new option for people looking to live in Mimico who don't want to settle for the high-rise suites or detached single-family homes that make up a large portion of the housing stock in the lakeside community.
Late last year, Davies Smith Developments held the grand opening for Eleven Superior, a modern nine-storey building at the corner of Lake Shore Boulevard and Superior Avenue.
"This is really the first condominium in at least 10 years that has been built in that part of town," says Graham Chalmers, who is a partner at Davies Smith Developments.
"It seems to be end users - people that are from the neigbourhood or close to the neighbourhood - who want to live there."
This 130-unit project will put residents at the centre of Mimico on the Lake, which is a pedestrian-friendly district home to local shops, restaurants and cafes, such as Café du Lac and Birds and Beans.
Outdoor enthusiasts will find several parks nearby, including the newly revamped Amos Waites Park where the builder completed Mimico Square.
"That area has good proximity to the lake and really good transit," adds Mr. Chalmers. "You can travel by streetcar right to Yonge and King or Yonge and Queen."
Additional attractions will also pop up around the site as the area undergoes revitalization as part of the city's Mimico 20/20 plan. Some initiatives entail the extension of Superior Avenue to the lake and addition of a waterfront bike path and pier, Mr. Chalmers explains. Move-in dates will begin spring of 2013.

The ROM meets its match

Author: John Bentley Mays

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/rom-meets-match/docview/859488170/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: In other words, Mr. [Rosario Varacalli]'s building will be a re-interpretation, in light of Mr. [Daniel Libeskind]'s various manipulations of space, of the tall-building form in an urban context. Instead of slipping politely into the surrounding city fabric, like a routine modernist skyscraper is supposed to do, Exhibit will stand out, assertively defining the streetscape just as the ROM does.

Full text:   Rosario Varacalli's design for the Exhibit condo tower brings a visual punch to complement the museum's flamboyant look
jmays@globeandmail.com
Ever since the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) switched its main entrance from Queens Park to Bloor Street West five years ago, the first thing a visitor has seen, when exiting architect Daniel Libeskind's controversial extension of the venerable treasure house, is the McDonald's across Bloor Street West.
It's long been the wrong outlet in the wrong place. The visual punches thrown by Mr. Libeskind's building, the handsome overhauls by Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg of the Royal Conservatory next door and the Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art around the corner, the establishment of this stretch of Bloor as the most upscale shopping district in Toronto: all these recent cultural transformations have made a dumpy fast-food joint in the midst of this high-style, refined activity increasingly irksome.
I'm happy to report, therefore, that the McDonald's outlet will soon be gone. It is to be turfed out and bulldozed to make way for a new condominium tower that will, if we're lucky, complement and further the ongoing renaissance of Bloor West.
Designed by Toronto architect Rosario Varacalli for a consortium of developers - Bazis, Metropia and Plazacorp - the 32-storey structure, called Exhibit, is the city's first building to engage in an active architectural dialogue with Mr. Libeskind's flamboyant monument across the street. (I mean creative dialogue, as opposed to the grumbling one still hears from local architects and the museum-going public about what Daniel Libeskind has visited upon the city.)
While the exterior of Mr. Libeskind's ROM addition is black and grey and metallic, for example, Mr. Varacalli's tower will be sheathed in white fritted glass. The Bloor Street façade of the ROM is all elbows and knees jazzily jutting out from the central volume. Mr. Varacalli expresses his personal futurism by stacking four big multi-storey slabs of architecture, one on top of the other, then smartly rotating each and sliding it sideways off the vertical axis of the composition. Exhibit, then, will totter and twist up into the sky, while the ROM, despite its angular commotion, hugs the ground.
In other words, Mr. Varacalli's building will be a re-interpretation, in light of Mr. Libeskind's various manipulations of space, of the tall-building form in an urban context. Instead of slipping politely into the surrounding city fabric, like a routine modernist skyscraper is supposed to do, Exhibit will stand out, assertively defining the streetscape just as the ROM does. And instead of retiring from the fray of big-city life behind dull, opaque cladding - the worst thing about Mr. Libeskind's ROM exterior - Exhibit will show a bright, light and translucent face to the street.
Exhibit's unusual shape dictates wide variety in the suite configurations: Mr. Varacalli told me that there are 40 different apartment layouts in this complex of just 200 condominium apartments. The size of units range from around 600 square feet to 1,500 square feet for two bedrooms and a den that can be converted into a third bedroom. Prices for available one-bedroom apartments start at $600,000, Mr. Varacalli said, while the largest suites are priced at around $2-million. The top two floors of Exhibit will be devoted to penthouses.
The views deserve special mention. The ones from the upper three rotating volumes will open, to the south, toward downtown and Lake Ontario over the low block of the ROM and the campus of the University of Toronto. To the north, they will open across the stable residential Annex neighbourhood. The building will present a set of protected views, that is - a rare asset in a city increasingly populated by view-blocking high-rises.
An adjoining garage structure will offer eight floors of parking. Because the subway runs directly beneath the building, there will be no underground parking or basement. On top of the garage, Mr. Varacalli will roll out a garden with trees and a reflecting pool. The garden will connect directly to standard high-rise interior amenities - a fitness centre, a private dining room and so on. The lowest two storeys of the tower will feature shops, as befits a building that fronts on to a retail street like Bloor West. The entrance to the residences, crafted by designers Diego Burdi and Paul Filek, will be a mere slot in the street-wall of retail.
Toronto clearly doesn't need striking tall buildings of this kind on every street corner. The city still requires much patient, gentle care, if its basic texture is to be spared and conserved. But a theatrical gesture like Exhibit every now and then, especially in a high-pressure cultural zone such as Bloor West, is and should be welcome.

Abstract: The owners, Dorothy and [Irving Stowe], held countless meetings in their living room. This was where the city's anti-establishment gathered - rebels and hippies, Quakers and Buddhists, draft dodgers and peace mongers, radical journalists and rainbow warriors. They came to save the planet, as well as to sample Dorothy's cooking. Tea and cookies were served at Greenpeace meetings. while joints were passed around on the deck.

Full text:   The Point Grey home of Dorothy and Irving Stowe, a gathering place for forward-thinking figures in the Sixties, is for sale
tomhawthorn@gmail.com
For sale: Family home on quiet corner lot; rear deck with city and mountain views; estate sale. A Vancouver Special in more ways than one.
An ordinary two-storey wood-frame house in Vancouver's tony Point Grey neighbourhood was put on the market this week, listed at $1.688-million. The price tag is less an eyebrow-lifter than the house's history, for it was here, at 2775 Courtenay St., that Greenpeace was born.
The owners, Dorothy and Irving Stowe, held countless meetings in their living room. This was where the city's anti-establishment gathered - rebels and hippies, Quakers and Buddhists, draft dodgers and peace mongers, radical journalists and rainbow warriors. They came to save the planet, as well as to sample Dorothy's cooking. Tea and cookies were served at Greenpeace meetings. while joints were passed around on the deck. Smoking was banned inside the house.
Talks about protesting against an underground nuclear test on Amchitka Island in the Alaskan Aleutians led to the formation of a group called the Don't Make a Wave Committee. This eventually became known as Greenpeace, the city's contribution to world politics.
For a few years, the group's original headquarters were based on the ground floor of the family home.
Some background on the house's story has been included as part of the staging for the sale. Looky-loos and prospective buyers can check it out during an open house to be held on Saturday and Sunday afternoon.
The house was put up for sale after the death last July of Dorothy Stowe, aged 89. Irving Stowe died of pancreatic cancer in 1974, aged 59.
The death of a parent brings with it responsibilities for handling the estate. For the Stowes' children, Robert, a neurologist and neuropsychiatrist, and Barbara, a writer, the listing of the family home has not been easy.
"It's excruciating for me," Barbara Stowe said. "We hope the next owner will appreciate the property's heritage."
The Stowes bought the house in 1968, not long after moving to Vancouver from New Zealand.
Irving Strasmich and Dorothy Rabinowitz, both from Rhode Island, took as their surname Stowe in honour of Harriet Beecher Stowe, the abolitionist author of Uncle Tom's Cabin . The couple spent their wedding night at a fundraising dinner for a civil-rights group.
Not long after moving in, the family played host to a party. The theme for the post-Summer of Love soiree: dress as hippies.
It was not long after that the house became a hangout for the real thing.
Irving Stowe, who had a strong interest in jazz and classical music, befriended the record reviewer of the Georgia Straight. Soon, the underground paper's hirsute staff could be found at the Courtenay Street home lounging on sofas and on floor cushions while grooving to the latest releases from the likes of the Grateful Dead.
In time, the Stowe living room became a second home to the Hunters (Robert and Zoë), the Bohlens (Jim and Marie) and the Metcalfes (Ben and Dorothy), all of whom would be instrumental in the founding of Greenpeace.
In 1970, the folk singer Phil Ochs accepted an invitation to dinner. He was to perform that night at a fundraising concert, along with Joni Mitchell and James Taylor. As Mr. Ochs dined on lasagna, yippie hangers-on raided the family liquor cabinet (poorly stocked, as it turned out, as the Stowes were not big drinkers) while Trotskyite agitators harangued Irving about the prohibitive cost of concert tickets. The ducats cost $3.
Over the years, ecologists made the pilgrimage to the house, as did many musicians. When Bono of U2 visited Vancouver about six years ago, he insisted on meeting Dorothy.
More recently, a pair of bamboo swivel chairs, as well as Irving's old roll-top desk, have been donated to the local Greenpeace office.
"Stuff that's just been sitting here," said Barbara Stowe, "becomes iconic to a younger generation of Greenpeacers."
Rex Weyler, an ecologist and journalist who wrote a well-received history of Greenpeace, thinks the Stowe house should become a historic site.
He'd like to see the home preserved as a testament to an era and to Vancouver's rich history of social activism.

These whites are like a little sunshine in a bottle

Abstract: Vinho verde, a sometimes delicately spritzy wine, can be a blend of various grapes. In this case, there's not much effervescence, but the wine could almost rise into thin air it's so light. Yet there's a vaguely silky quality to this charmer, owing to the trajadura grape, here blended with lean alvarinho (the Portuguese name for albarino).

Full text:   wine@globeandmail.com
George Harrison, the late Beatle, wrote one of the most uplifting odes to springtime, Here Comes the Sun . I plucked it feebly on the guitar last week as the blinding sun - now where it ought to be, on our side of the equator - managed miraculously to penetrate my grimy, south-facing window and fill the back room with happy light. There's a keen sense of sonic metaphor in the guitar work, arpeggiated riffs of crisply picked treble notes underpinning such lines as "it seems like years since it's been clear." It sure seems like years.
Wine flavours can be metaphorical too, I think - crisp, treble notes supplied by tangy acidity as well as herbaceous characters that can bring to mind green grass and even some of the local produce that will soon be poking up in many southern parts of Canada, such as asparagus and fiddleheads.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Harrison wrote his song while strolling around Eric Clapton's garden with one of the famous rocker's acoustic guitars. (I hope he had a glass of wine nearby, though I suspect that if any herbal flavours were going down, they were being smoked, not sipped.)
This is the season when lean white wines start to come alive. I think in particular of zesty sauvignon blanc and dry riesling. But I also look for more offbeat gems, such as and albarino and verdejo from Spain as well as vinho verde from Portugal.
If you're in the mood for a little sunshine in a bottle, I hope these selections, or offerings in your local market of similar description, help to fill the bill.
Domaine de Riaux
Pouilly-Fumé 2009, France
SCORE: 88 PRICE: $22.95
I don't hang around gun ranges much, but I'm guessing that those who do might recognize the slightest whiff of a freshly spent bullet in this smoky, flinty sauvignon blanc from the Loire Valley. For golfers, there's some fresh-cut grass too. The rest of us may simply appreciate its citrus-like core and elegance. It would match well with pan-seared or grilled flaky white fish.
Bernard Reverdy et Fils
Sancerre 2009, France
SCORE: 88 PRICE: $22.95
Light and understated, even for a Sancerre, this sauvignon blanc offers up suggestions of peach, lemon, herb and chalk. But, like most good whites from the Loire, it's more about elegance and subtlety than adjectives. Sancerres like this are consummate partners for asparagus, delicate fish dishes and goat cheese.
Caves de la Tourangelle
Grande Reserve Touraine 2009, France
SCORE: 87 PRICE: $14.95
Best for the two preceding wine styles, the Loire produces good renditions of sauvignon blanc without the high-real-estate premium of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé. Looking for value? Try Touraine. Light-bodied, with moderate acidity for a sauvignon blanc, this example serves up flavours of grapefruit, honeydew and grass.
Auntsfield Long Cow Sauvignon Blanc 2009, New Zealand
SCORE: 88 PRICE: $19.95
Some people associate New Zealand lamb with spring. I think of kiwi sauvignon blanc the same way. Assertively fruity and grassy, it's as though Sancerre had been force-fed bushels of passion fruit and Scott's Turf Builder. This one leans more toward the fruity side. It would pair well with shellfish.
Quails' Gate Dry Riesling 2010, British Columbia
SCORE: 91 PRICE: $16.99
Plenty of weight for a dry riesling, though still technically light-bodied, it has a fleshy, silky texture, flavours of green apple, peach and slate, with tangy acidity for lift on the long finish. It would pair well with poultry, fish or pork, and it's splendid as an aperitif. Available in the West, www.quailsgate.com.
Jacob's Creek Reserve
Riesling 2010, Australia
SCORE: 89 PRICE: $16.95
Bone-dry like most Aussie rieslings, it's a bushel of tart fruit, with a whiff of drywall dust and a finish as refreshing as a cold swim. Shellfish, including raw oysters, and sushi would make fine partners.
Leira Albarino 2009, Spain
SCORE: 88 PRICE: $16.95
The lean, bracing and elegant whites of Rias Baixas, a district of northwest Spain, are underappreciated treasures. The cool weather of Rias Baixas (REE-ahs BYE-shuss) locks in the natural acidity of the albarino grape. Light and silky, this one delivers a subtle note of cherry along with hints of flowers and mineral. It's sublimely delicate and perfect for shellfish.
Agricola Castellana Cuatro Rayas Verdejo 2009, Spain
SCORE: 86 PRICE: $14.95
The verdejo grape anchors the whites of the arid Rueda district northwest of Madrid. High-strung - like a guitar badly tuned by yours truly - with crisp acidity, this is a simple, straightforward Rueda, but it shows good balance, with a touch of bitterness in the clean finish. Good for shellfish and salads. A fine, widely available alternative: Marques de Riscal Rueda white, $10.95 in Ontario. In British Columbia, look for the excellent Telmo
Rodriguez Basa, $17.99.
Varanda do Conde Alvarinho Trajadura Vinho Verde 2009, Portugal
SCORE: 87 PRICE: $13.95
Vinho verde, a sometimes delicately spritzy wine, can be a blend of various grapes. In this case, there's not much effervescence, but the wine could almost rise into thin air it's so light. Yet there's a vaguely silky quality to this charmer, owing to the trajadura grape, here blended with lean alvarinho (the Portuguese name for albarino).
Expect notes of lemon and green apple in this baby's breath of a white. Pair it with oysters.

Golf courses are Murray's stage these days

Author: Rubenstein, Lorne

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/golf-courses-are-murrays-stage-these-days/docview/858760433/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "I have to tell you, I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have golf," [Anne Murray] said. "That's why I work so hard keeping my core strong."

Full text: Game keeps legendary Canadian singer busy in retirement, offers a theatre for her charity work
rube@sympatico.ca
Anne Murray's voice was clear and strong, but she wasn't giving a concert, having retired last year. Still, Murray, the winner of 24 Juno awards and four Grammys, who has sold 54 million albums, was on stage, in a manner of speaking. She was on the practice range at the Loxahatchee Club here on Saturday, warming up for a game on one of the area's finest courses. The Juno awards would be held Sunday night in Toronto, but that was another world, one she's left.
"Oh yes," Murray said, reacting to a pure 3-wood that she hit. She finished in perfect balance on her left foot. Murray, 65, is a snowbird who rents an apartment nearby during the winter. The apartment has views of the Atlantic Ocean on one side and the Intracoastal Waterway on the other, and she plays golf three or four times a week. Murray was in the middle of a particularly fertile stretch of golf.
She'd played with hockey great Bobby Orr, and had games set up for the first three days of the following week. One would be with Marlene Streit, the only Canadian member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. Orr and Streit will play in the annual Anne Murray Charity Golf Classic on May 17 on both courses of the Angus Glen Golf Club in Markham, Ont., in support of Colon Cancer Canada. Spots are still available.
"I'd been asked for years to put my name on a tournament, but it had to be the right one," Murray said. Her grandmother was a colon-cancer survivor and her long-time manager, Leonard Rambeau, was just 49 when he died of the disease in 1995. Colon cancer can be cured if caught early, and Murray wants people to know that they should have colonoscopies. She's had four, and emphasizes that the test isn't painful, despite what people fear.
It's no surprise that Murray has associated herself with a golf tournament, because she's passionate about the game.
She's a member at the Thornhill Golf and Country Club in Thornhill, Ont., and the Northumberland Links in Pugwash, N.S., where her cottage is one kilometre from the first tee. She rides the golf cart there that EMI Records gave her for being with the company for 25 years.
At Loxahatchee, Bill Swinimer, a fellow Nova Scotian who lives in Orillia, Ont., and Roy Kennedy, who lives in Fredericton, accompanied Murray, as did I. Murray, born in Springhill, N.S., first hit golf balls along the sand flats in Northport, N.S., when the tide was out.
"I chased the ball around with some rusty old irons we had at the cottage," Murray said after nailing her drive on the par-five fourth hole. But she really didn't take up the game until her late 30s.
There's water all along the right side of the fourth hole at Loxahatchee, a course that Jack Nicklaus designed and that Toronto real estate developer Gordon Gray founded with a fellow Canadian, Brian Magee. Murray had hit her drive down the left side, but found the water with her second shot.
"Stay down," Murray advised herself for her next shot. She did, and came up just short of the green. The par-three fifth hole is also over water. Murray checked the yardage with a GPS device. The hole was playing 115 yards, and a breeze was up.
"Oh, dear, I don't like that distance," she said. But she carried the water to the right fringe. "Be still, my pounding heart," Murray said, thumping her chest.
Murray has been a mega-celebrity. She played concerts all over the world for some 40 years, but has said goodbye to all that. Afflicted with scoliosis, she works out regularly at home and with a trainer in a local gym. She told her life story in her best-selling 2009 autobiography All of Me, written with Michael Posner of The Globe and Mail. She could probably write a book about her golf adventures alone. She tweets frequently about the game, and she follows it avidly on television.
"I have to tell you, I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have golf," Murray said. "That's why I work so hard keeping my core strong."
Murray has played in Scotland and Spain with friends. She and five women will travel to Ireland in September for golf. Meanwhile, her roots remain deep in Nova Scotia.
"I just love when I'm playing Northumberland and I'm on the back nine and I see the water and the link bridge," Murray said. She spends July through September in Pugwash, and she's on the course most every day.
Murray carries a 13-handicap. Her natural shot is a fade. She has a long line, or good extension, through the ball, with her full shots.
She does get a bit antsy over shorter shots, one of the scourges of the seasoned golfer.
"I used to lick my chops when I was within 100 yards of the green," Murray said after finding a greenside bunker from that distance on the 16th hole. But she hit a beautiful bunker shot from about 60 feet to within six feet of the hole. Her sand play was very good. Alas, she missed the putt.
Murray's interest in other people was apparent during the round; not all celebrities are like that. Murray engaged me in conversation about myself and my work and family throughout the round. Orr and Streit are the same way.
"It's the Canadian way," Murray said.
"She is such a sweet, sweet girl," her friend Kennedy said. "She's genuine, and she's generous to people."
Then, on the 17th green, Murray made a tricky, downhill par putt from eight feet. That brought a big smile.
"That will straighten my head," she said. "I'm not going to eat worms when I get home." She shot 92, and that was only because her short game wasn't sharp. The next morning, she sent an e-mail.
"Thanks for the game," Murray wrote. "That was great fun."
Oh yes, it was.
