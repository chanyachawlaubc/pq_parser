Abstract: In January came "the highlight" of Mr. [Felix Chee]'s career, when CIC opened a Toronto office with him at the helm as its chief representative. The world's fifth-largest sovereign wealth fund, with $332-billion of assets, snubbed larger capital markets by opening its first non-Asian office here, putting Mr. Chee in a unique position to help build the fragile economic bridge that links Canada's resource riches with the world's fastest-growing major economy.

Full text: China Investment Corp.'s man in Canada has spent billions here, but he turns away many more pitches than he entertains
Felix Chee appraises a platter of crisp, glistening fowl with a careful eye and then leans over the table to share a thought.
"The Peking Duck here is among the finest in the world," he says, falling back into a chair at Toronto's casually elegant Lai Wah Heen restaurant. "It is all about the freshness of the meat and the oil."
Mr. Chee has made a career out of finding winning combinations. Ever since he and his wife Margaret immigrated to Canada from Singapore in 1974 with two suitcases and $5,000 in their pockets, the 64-year-old businessman has shown a talent for marrying foreign knowledge and money with local institutions.
He rose to prominence on Bay Street in the early 1980s as an innovative financial manager at Ontario Hydro, which was among the first to import then-exotic derivatives to Canada to reduce interest rate and currency risks on the utility's bonds. More recently, Mr. Chee nudged China's sovereign wealth fund to its most successful direct investment ever, when he convinced China Investment Corp. to bet $1.5-billion (U.S.) in 2009 on embattled Teck Resources Ltd. That investment is now worth $5.4-billion.
In January came "the highlight" of Mr. Chee's career, when CIC opened a Toronto office with him at the helm as its chief representative. The world's fifth-largest sovereign wealth fund, with $332-billion of assets, snubbed larger capital markets by opening its first non-Asian office here, putting Mr. Chee in a unique position to help build the fragile economic bridge that links Canada's resource riches with the world's fastest-growing major economy.
Mr. Chee says the new office partly reflects the gratitude of officials at state-owned CIC that Canada "is a welcoming place" for its investments. "They don't want to be where they are not wanted."
But people familiar with the fund say the location of the new office is also a gesture of thanks to Mr. Chee, who temporarily left his home and family in Oakville in 2008 to move to Beijing to help build the Chinese fund. During that time, he pushed CIC's somewhat reluctant officials to shift their focus on resource investments from nearby Australia to Canada.
It was his persistence that is credited with overcoming resistance in China - and on Teck's board of directors - to a $1.5-billion equity investment that helped the Canadian mining company get out of financial trouble in 2009.
Mr. Chee, whose contract expires in 2014, said he has two remaining ambitions: He is on the hunt primarily for minority stakes in resource, infrastructure and real estate ventures that will deliver strong returns. But a bigger challenge is to dispel Western fears that CIC is a puppet of a centralized Chinese government seeking to control Canada's valuable resources.
"Obviously there is a perception and concern about China and the controlling of resources," says Mr. Chee. CIC, he says, is a "financial investor" and "it does not seek control" in any Canadian company.
Contrary to what some Westerners think, "China is not a monolith," he continues. CIC is one of several state-owned entities that answer to a variety of different officials and they have devoted over $100-billion to acquire long-term interests in foreign companies and securities.
"Actions will speak louder than words. Hopefully by the transactions we do, it will help people here, the government, regulators, businesses and investors understand CIC and China much more. What we do will also be a template for how Chinese companies can invest abroad by thinking of all stakeholders."
During a leisurely three-hour lunch of succulent duck crepes and tea, Mr. Chee speaks candidly in a deep, gravelly baritone about his career and his new mandate. He is tall and thin with a neatly shaved head, and when he stands he favours one leg, which was badly injured during a car accident last year that left him bedridden for months.
Mr. Chee's background makes him uniquely suited to help nurture stronger business ties between China and Canada. A descendant of educated, middle-class Chinese from the southwestern Chinese province of Guizhou (his grandmother had bound feet), he was born and raised in Singapore and educated in Britain.
His upbringing gave him the advantage of seeing China through an international lens. And his successful career in Canada has earned him credibility with local bankers and directors who have little experience with Chinese investors.
This unique background was instrumental in "bridging the gap" between Teck's board of directors and CIC when the mining company was scrambling to raise cash to pay huge debts that were coming due. Though Teck was in need, people familiar with the talks said some of its directors were concerned that CIC had a secret agenda to help one of China's mining giants seize control of the Vancouver company.
"The takeover negotiations were 20 per cent [about] price and 80 per cent how to deal with China Inc."
That Teck was hesitating at such a time of need frustrated some of CIC's senior officials, sources say. They credit Mr. Chee for keeping talks open and eventually convincing both sides that the investment was in everyone's interest.
That deal opened doors, too, to other resource companies that are willing to tap CIC's huge pool of cash in exchange for selling a minority interest. Last year, CIC agreed to spend $1.2-billion to acquire a small stake in Penn West Energy Trust and help finance an oil sands venture. The deal is largely seen as a template for other foreign companies that are eager to invest in the Canadian oil sector without triggering nationalistic concerns.
Mr. Chee's early experience as a project analyst at a Singapore bank taught him lessons that served him well in Canada. His job was to assess the viability of machinery purchased by business clients with banks loans. His insights earned him respect - and a seat on a number of company boards. Their struggles gave him a life-long appreciation of the importance of capital and the need to invest it efficiently.
When his new wife Margaret pushed to broaden their horizons, they chose to stake their future in North America's booming economy. Canada became their home because of its more relaxed immigration policies.
He landed a job in research at Ontario Hydro by answering a want ad. At the sprawling provincial power utility, he found a bureaucratic organization that raised hundreds of millions of dollars to expand operations with little attention to modern financial disciplines, such as measuring returns on invested capital.
Early efforts to analyze Ontario Hydro's capital programs met with resistance. A request to purchase a $180 Hewlett-Packard calculator was rejected as too costly (he bought it with his own money). He was forced to share a computer when writing software code to build programs that could assess liabilities and returns in the utility's capital program.
"When my time was up, the computer would go 'ding' and my manager would yell my time was up," he said.
When interest rates soared in the early 1980s, Mr. Chee's skills became increasingly in demand. He introduced basic policies to stagger bond maturities to control the flow of cash. And he imported new financial tools such as swaps and options to shield against volatile interest and currency rates. Ontario Hydro was one of the first Canadian companies to employ the derivatives that are now standard in most corporations.
His success earned him senior posts at Manulife Financial and then the University of Toronto, where, starting in 2000, he was placed in charge of operations ("everything from campus police to finance and parking"). He also took the reins in the mid-2000s of the university's endowment fund, leaving him with the task of overseeing a fund just as the bull market was running out of steam.
He decided to retire in early 2008 as the global meltdown was beginning. Although he is disappointed that the endowment fund took a heavy hit during the crisis, he says the charged political environment at the university "was good training for China."
Mr. Chee said he timed his retirement to coincide with the pending birth of his first grandchild, who was due in September, 2008. Those plans changed when he got a call in May, 2008, from Beijing. The caller was Gao Xiqing, a senior Chinese banking and regulatory official, who months earlier had been appointed vice-chairman and president of CIC.
The two men had never spoken before, but Mr. Gao had learned of Mr. Chee's reputation and wanted to hire him immediately as his adviser to help navigate investment pitches that were being thrown at a giant new fund born during a credit crunch.
"They were being bombarded with pitches," Mr. Chee said. "Everyone wanted to be in China. Everyone wanted a relationship with China and CIC was seen as a door in."
Everyone, that is, except Mr. Chee, who initially hesitated to join CIC in Beijing because of his new grandchild.
"I wanted to be here," he says, reaching into his pocket to pull out a photo of his beaming granddaughter, now 2.
The one-year-old CIC fund was willing to wait for the new grandfather. In October, 2008, Mr. Chee left his family behind and moved into temporary quarters in Beijing to help launch China's largest investment fund. In the end, the opportunity was just too difficult to turn down.
"Not many people get to be part of a $200-billion startup."

PITCHING FELIX
Lots of folks have pitched investment proposals at Felix Chee, but few understand what the sovereign fund is looking for. Some arrive with thick deal books stuffed with investment proposals "hoping that something will stick," he said. Others come with problems they want to solve with China Investment Corp.'s money.
So far, CIC has made only two major public investments in Canadian companies, Teck Resources Ltd. and Penn West Petroleum Ltd. Its biggest North American investments have been a $3-billion (U.S.) minority stake in Blackstone Group and a $5-billion purchase of a 9.9-per-cent stake in Morgan Stanley. Those U.S. investments ignited criticism in China that the fund was making a risky bet on troubled Wall Street. That opposition, Mr. Chee said, has put enormous pressure on CIC's managers.
Before you pay a visit to CIC's Toronto office, consider what Mr. Chee is looking for: "If I can check the following three boxes, there is a pretty good chance I am going to make an investment."
1. The investment should have the potential for a decent return.
2. There should be a China component to the transaction so that the deal provides some benefit to businesses or professionals back home. Teck fits this bill because it sells a share of its minerals to China.
3. The transaction should be structured in a way that enhances outsiders' perceptions of China.

Abstract: So who's behind this online blitz? Almost always, it's women. Often, they're professional editors who needed a new venture after mainstream magazines folded. For example, Lonny's team came from the cult-adored but now defunct Domino magazine. Occasionally, you'll find professionally trained designers like Ms. [Kimberley Seldon], or Australian designer Loni Parker, who now offers up Adore Home Magazine (www.adoremagazine.com).

Full text: There's a boom in online-only interior design magazines, with Canadian entrants making their own splash
Maybe you get your fix in the mail. Or perhaps you get a rush at the magazine stands.
But what if latest "glossies" weren't even available in print?
Witness the recent gush of slick, stylish and original interior design magazines. The catch is they're ONLY available online and the bonus is they're free.
It's important to note: These aren't just cool websites or fancy blogs, but a convincing replication of the magazine experience. You get a highly stylized cover, a table of contents, professional photos of striking interiors, and yes, you get to 'turn' the page. Additional options include a bottom scroll with mini-images that allows you to see almost the entire issue at once, making it easy to jump to and from any particular section.
For the most part, the enhanced design of technology explains the rise of design magazines online. Improved, easy to use self-publishing software such as Issuu makes it possible for anyone to create a magazine, and tablets like the iPad make it more fun to experience. Of course to some, it will never be enough.
"I LOVE my house porn," Canadian design star Kimberley Seldon admits. She won't go without this month's print copy of her favourite magazine, warning, "you'll have to pry it out of my cold, dead hands." But that hasn't stopped Ms. Seldon from plunging into the online world with the recent launch of her own high-end digital bi-monthly, dabble.
The premiere issue (www.dabblemag.com) introduces a mix of design, food and travel, with Ms. Seldon chatting it up with famous designer friends like Diane von Furstenberg. Just two hours after hitting the virtual shelves, a flood of 3,500 unique visitors crashed the site. A couple of weeks later, interest remains strong with 13,000 subscribers.
In this context, you're considered a subscriber if you submit your e-mail address, but it's not a necessity for viewing - it's just a sign-up to receive notification of new issues.
Canada is proving to be ahead of the curve on this Internet wave. A magazine devoted exclusively to ecologically conscious design, Pure Green Magazine (www.puregreenliving.com), a husband-and-wife team out of Huntsville, Ont. For Jonathan and Celine MacKay, going digital is both enviro-friendly and budget-friendly. With none of the printing or overhead costs associated with traditional magazines, they can splash out with original spreads, such as the super glam energy-efficient home they feature from the Hollywood Hills.
Other magazines focus solely on local design. Tapping into the fascination with cool spaces designed by the people who live in them - not by professional designers - Covet Garden (www.covetgarden.com) receives 250,000 unique page views every month. Each issue features just one Toronto home and averages 20 pages in length.
"We're not obligated to fill a certain number of pages for advertisers, so you get quality - not filler," founding editor Lynda Felton says. Ms. Felton points out another advantage of online-only publication: immediacy. Last-minute additions or corrections are easy to add, keeping the content more current than print magazines. Another asset is the easy access to past issues, meaning no more stockpiles in your home collecting dust.
All of that still only scratches the surface when it comes to benefits. Consider Chicago-based Rue (www.ruemag.com). Co-founded six months ago by Crystal Gentilello and Toronto native Ann Sage, Rue has logged more than 32 million page views with its first three issues. All the bells and whistles have added to the appeal. You have the option of watching colourful short videos imbedded within the pages. You can also download freebies, such as specially designed stationery. They even give you playlists to listen to while browsing.
Among the most commercially successful online mags has been Lonny Magazine (www.LONNYmag.com). Its latest issue clocks in at more than 200 pages, with ads from major retailers like Bloomingdales and Nautica. Just try to avoid drooling on your keyboard as you flip through one masterfully styled home after another.
So who's behind this online blitz? Almost always, it's women. Often, they're professional editors who needed a new venture after mainstream magazines folded. For example, Lonny's team came from the cult-adored but now defunct Domino magazine. Occasionally, you'll find professionally trained designers like Ms. Seldon, or Australian designer Loni Parker, who now offers up Adore Home Magazine (www.adoremagazine.com). Then there are the self-professed lovers of design like Paloma Contreras, who left her career as a high school Spanish teacher and started High Gloss (www.highglossmagazine.com). Also getting in on the action are small business owners who are keen to extend their brand. The Canadian furniture and textiles designers behind Bookhou (www.bookhou.com) just launched b.a.h. magazine as part of their blog.
Amid all the uplifting imagery and well-written stories, there are some drawbacks.
For one, it's tough to know what's out there, given that as yet there is no well-known "virtual newsstand" where all of the free magazines can be available in one place. As well, some readers will find that the videos, downloads and click-throughs fragment the magazine reading experience by diverting attention into countless open browser tabs.
And not all browsers are created equal when it comes to ease of viewing. Current layout software is optimized when you use Firefox and Safari. Browse with Internet Explorer and the 'links' will often lead to nowhere.
No one is yet predicting the death of printed magazines that you can hold in your hands or proudly display in colourful stacks on your designer coffee table. But inspiration lives both in print and online.

Plan for wilderness resort sparks turf war

Full text: Victoria residents oppose development, which local residents appear to favour
Aturf war is smouldering in the woods west of Victoria as residents of the capital city slam plans for a wilderness resort that would border parkland treasured by the urbanites.
Developer Ender Ilkay wants to build 257 cabins, six caretakers' residences, a lodge and two recreation buildings on about 33 hectares of a 237-hectare property he bought from Western Forest Products in 2008. Some of the rugged real estate, about a two-hour drive from Victoria, borders the 47-kilometre-long, wildly popular Juan de Fuca Marine Trail. The trail is part of the 1,500-hectare Juan de Fuca Provincial Park, which starts about 35 kilometres west of Sooke.
Despite statistics that indicate overwhelming tourist traffic, a lifelong Sooke-area resident said the opinions of people who live outside the Sooke area and come to the trail for recreation shouldn't hold sway.
"If you live in Oak Bay, do you have the right to protest the development?" asked John Brohman, who has called Sooke home for all of his 50-plus years.
Most Sooke-area residents either support the development or don't consider it a significant issue, said Mr. Brohman, who has attended all of the meetings related to the development.
Former Liberal MP David Anderson, who held cabinet posts, including Environment and Fisheries, and who helped establish Pacific Rim National Park, said allowing development so close to the hiking trail is a problem that surpasses local boundaries.
"I get angry when people say it's an issue only for people from Sooke," said Mr. Anderson, a Victoria resident. "I think I'm looking at this better than those who just turned up from Calgary and retired [to Sooke]."
A fanatical hiker, who every Tuesday explores a southern Vancouver Island trail, Mr. Anderson, now 73, with 760-plus hikes under his belt, said that because Mr. Ilkay's development borders a provincial park, every B.C. resident should have a say.
"Provincial parks are owned equally by every person in the province."
And far more Victorians use the park than locals. "This is an international issue," he said.
Juan de Fuca is B.C.'s third busiest provincial park. B.C. Parks estimates that in 2010, about 320,000 people visited the park, which includes the trail and three other areas running along the Pacific Ocean northwest to Port Renfrew.
Mr. Ilkay maintains that his Marine Trail Holdings development is for people who love the wild West Coast and don't want to diminish it. "Trail users won't see anything, hear anything," the West Vancouver resident said.
The minimum distance between any of the cabins and the 150-metre-wide hiking trail will be 150 metres, he said. He will also donate 97 hectares for parkland.
At a March 3 public meeting to discuss the development, of 41 speakers, 27 non-residents and nine Sooke-area residents were against the plans while five locals were in favour, said Sooke-area resident and dedicated hiker Rosemary Jorna.
In February, University of Victoria and Camosun College students and the Dogwood Initiative organized a 150-person protest in Victoria with the rallying cry of "Don't Fuca Up Our Trail."
One of the locals opposing the wilderness resort, Ms. Jorna said construction of roads and other infrastructure will destroy the feeling of the trail. "Right now, it is truly wild."
It is also a very rare and precious area that should not be tampered with, said Sarah Cox, a spokesperson for the Sierra Club of B.C.
"We have on our doorstep a world-class wilderness area. It's not just about who lives closest to the trail," she said from Victoria.
For perennial environmentalist Vicky Husband, "the wild coast is part of who we are. Even people in Sooke, why should they have more say?" she asked.
In 1991, Sooke resident Al Jones proposed the idea of the trail to the NDP government of the day as a way to replace the dying logging and fishing industries with tourism.
While he thinks Mr. Ilkay's development is too big, he adds that it will create jobs and generate needed tax revenue that could improve the trail.
"Right now, the B.C. government has abandoned the trail. There's no upkeep," Mr. Jones said of what was a legacy of the 1994 Commonwealth Games.
In May, Mr. Ilkay's plans to develop the land as a tourist resort will likely go before the 23-member Capital Regional District board, said Mike Hicks, the CRD director representing Juan de Fuca.
Aware that much opposition has come from outside his jurisdiction, Mr. Hicks said everyone's voice carries equal weight.
"It's an issue of great passion. No one wants to see the experience of walking on the trail lessened."

No DTES building freeze, city official says

Author: Bula, Frances

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/no-dtes-building-freeze-city-official-says/docview/857986335/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "I don't think anybody has a sense of what you can or can't do," said Robert Fung, a developer who has specialized in rehabilitating small, historic buildings in Gastown and the Downtown Eastside. "There's been a lot of concern and a general sense of confusion. The decision was completely counter to what council had been moving toward after five years of height studies and reviews."

Full text: There is no freeze on building in the Downtown Eastside, no matter what neighbourhood advocates or fearful developers think.
That's the word from Vancouver's increasingly hands-on city manager, Penny Ballem, who is personally negotiating with Downtown Eastside groups over how to conduct a planning process for the oft-discussed neighbourhood, while also working to ensure that development continues in the area.
"We want to respect that process but we are absolutely not putting a moratorium on there," said Ms. Ballem, who has had two meetings with the local groups. "We want to move ahead on as many things as we can there. Some are within existing policy and some are aligned with what people want down there. But there's no moratorium."
Ms. Ballem said 150-foot towers likely won't go ahead while the city and neighbourhood groups are negotiating to create an overall plan for the area. But there are other projects - some that exceed current height restrictions and will require rezoning, and others more modest - where the city will move forward.
"In the interim, there are 10 to 12 inquiries or applications that we are going to be bringing forward as a group to council in the next while."
Some of the projects will bring low-cost housing to the area - though not the social housing that neighbourhood groups say has to be the priority - along with other needed space for health facilities or social-enterprise groups.
Ms. Ballem acknowledged that owners and developers have been confused ever since city council decided abruptly last month that it would postpone a decision about increasing allowable heights in some parts of the Downtown Eastside.
That decision came after only a few days of public pressure from academics and neighbourhood groups, who said the increased heights would lead to increased development pressure and speculation in an area that has historically been home to the city's biggest pool of low-cost housing.
In the weeks since the decision, which stipulated that the city would work with a committee that included neighbourhood activist groups, developers and their consultants have expressed bewilderment.
"I don't think anybody has a sense of what you can or can't do," said Robert Fung, a developer who has specialized in rehabilitating small, historic buildings in Gastown and the Downtown Eastside. "There's been a lot of concern and a general sense of confusion. The decision was completely counter to what council had been moving toward after five years of height studies and reviews."
Mr. Fung had been planning a tower on the corner of Abbott and West Pender that, although it's blocks away from Main and Hastings, has been stalled as a result of the council decision.
He is also currently rehabilitating a small residential building on Carrall, not affected by council's decision since it doesn't involve a rezoning.
Development consultant Jim Green, a former city councillor, said he's been telling clients that he just doesn't know whether they should go ahead with Downtown Eastside projects.
"Many people believe there's a moratorium for a year. I'm advising them that it's a very difficult situation." Mr. Green said neighbourhood groups have circulated information saying all projects are stalled indefinitely, adding to the confusion.
The Downtown Eastside has occupied a special place in city planning for decades. The area, with 24,000 residents, is home to 30 per cent of all the social housing in the city. As well, it has another 4,000 units of low-cost housing in residential hotels and rooming houses.
City planners have stipulated several times over the years that the city's goal is to maintain the area as primarily low-income. However, planners also said they expected to see the amount of market housing to double to 4,000 units between 2005 and 2015.

Full text: Retired executive sold real estate, helped start a church and became a fixture in town
Mallory Smith could be found just about every morning at the Village Baker Café on Bowen Island, B.C., doing the crossword and holding court with other regulars. He could also be found every Sunday at the church he helped found, Cates Hill, giving the final benediction. And he could often be found having a glass of red wine at the legion. He fired the starter's pistol at the spring and fall yacht races and formed the local men's a cappella group. He marshalled ferry traffic, served as the church treasurer and headed up the municipality's water committee.
Smith turned an early retirement from the corporate world into a new career as the unofficial mayor of Bowen Island, a municipality of 3,500 located between the mainland and Vancouver Island. Some fellow islanders gave him the tag for the efforts he made in transforming it from a summer cottage retreat to year-round country living for both commuting and disenchanted Vancouverites.
He had fallen in love with the island after renting a cottage in the summer of 1970. For the next eight years, his family summered there and he and his wife, Mary Ann, bought some land and made plans to eventually live there full time. In 1989, the former CEO of forest-products firm Koppers International Canada began a second career at 58 after he purchased a small real estate firm, Bowen Island Realty, with partner Wolfgang Duntz.
Smith not only drove prospective real estate clients around, made sales and helped young couples settle in, but he was also someone who supported a couple of development plans for the island and thus found himself holding a minority position. At one point, he had a wish for a cement plant that could help bring down the price of ferried-in concrete for new homes. But most Bowen citizens, whose island municipality does not count a single street or traffic light, opposed the idea and it was voted down.
For Bowen Island's real mayor, Bob Turner, Smith was a good listener, a steady voice in the community and someone who expressed his ideas directly. He says it was that style that helped elevate the tone of municipal debates. "It's easy to be a gentleman if you have no strong opinions. But it's a test of a person's integrity if you can voice these opinions without crossing that line of losing civility."
More than a development advocate, it was his other moniker of "Island Mal," that better defined him. He would wave to one person while he talked to another, while walking to the post office. He met people coming off the ferry so they could see a friendly face, drove countless visitors to the best view on the island and went out of his way for others, such as delivering a lantern to a newly arrived couple during a blackout and bad winter storm.
Charles Russell Mallory Smith, who died on Feb. 24 in Vancouver from multiple myeloma, was born in Albany, N.Y., on Jan. 10, 1931, the third of four children to Reveley and Ruth (nee Mallory) Smith. His father was a cement salesman, who travelled often and eventually supplied concrete for the New York State Thruway. His parents taught all their children piano and the importance of giving back to their community.
He was a risk taker from a young age, but would be ready for the consequences that could follow. As a six year old in Winchester, Mass., he decided one day to play in the brook behind his home, despite his parents forbidding it. He fell in and then came home to tell his father that he was ready to be spanked.
His sense of mischief was pervasive, but never took a seriously dangerous turn. During one summer off from his studies at Harvard, he drove a camp bus in Winchester. He and a few of his friends decided it would be fun to take the bus through town to pick up townspeople from their bus stops. He also sang off-colour songs at the piano to his deaf grandmother, who smiled while his mother looked on disapprovingly.
And his sense of adventure would sometimes mix with his prankster side. As a navy pilot running submarine reconnaissance above the American seaboard during the Korean War, not far from his sister Leila Jane's home, he decided one afternoon to buzz down close to her while she hung her laundry and then called her that night to laugh about it.
His rise in the corporate world came quickly. He spent 25 years moving up the ranks at the Pittsburgh-based Koppers, opening up its first metal products plant in Toronto and eventually heading its international Canadian division in Burnaby, B.C. He also held posts as president and COO of McGavin Foods, president of Methane Technologies and president of Combined Communications. He served on various boards of directors, including as chairman of B.C. Systems Corp.
But he eventually traded in his suits for flannel shirts, his martinis for the local bakery fare and corporate meetings for discussions on island matters.
His greatest legacy, says Ross Allan, will be the Cates Hill Chapel. The non-denominational Christian church sits peacefully in the woods and has been a meeting place for a group of people on both sides of the development issue. Allan, who was among the group of Islanders who helped found the church in 1991, says that while the land had been donated by Smith's business partner, Duntz, with a couple of congregants donating substantial sums, Smith's quiet and steady role as treasurer, socking away donations and making term deposits, eventually led to a down payment for the building's construction. "Mallory represented a generation that saved. We would not have pulled it off without his discipline."
In late 2004, a long-time spinal stenosis condition turned into severe back pain and by the following spring he was unable to walk. He was diagnosed with late-stage multiple myeloma, which had cracked six vertebrae. He had to sell his beloved boat, the Mal de Mary Ann (a play on words that combined the French expression for being sea sick - mal de mer - and his wife's name). He purchased a motorbike and rode for a couple years, until his legs weakened. Even at the latest stages of his illness, he still managed to make it to the bakery café to do his crossword and talk to the regulars.
Mallory Smith leaves his wife, Mary Ann, his son Baird and daughters Katie, Janet and Dawn, brother Trevor and six grandchildren.

Abstract: There's exchange rates, there's the economy, there's airfare," Mr. [Dave Brownlie] said. "There's a lot more things that you have to overcome. We've got the most awareness we've ever had in the world today. We are on people's lists, but we went into this year with countries going bankrupt. If you're in the U.K. and everybody's losing their jobs and they're cutting back, people stay closer to home.

Full text: Whistler Blackcomb's Dave Brownlie is intent on making the continent's top ski resort an all-season destination
The Horstman Hut stands 2,284 metres above sea level near the peak of Blackcomb Mountain, amid glaciers and couloirs. It's Dave Brownlie's favourite place to eat at Whistler Blackcomb, the sprawling ski resort north of Vancouver.
Sunshine splashes through windows of the log-walled hut in the early afternoon on a Friday in February on the bright end of a wild storm that has graced the mountains with an epic two metres of snow.
The hut has warmed and fed visitors since 1987. Mr. Brownlie arrived two years later, signing on as director of finance for Blackcomb Skiing Enterprises, then a fledgling business Vancouver real estate developer Joe Houssian wanted to remake into a massive resort company. Mr. Brownlie was 26 and moved to the quiet little town the same weekend that local hero Rob Boyd won a World Cup downhill on Whistler Mountain.
"I thought that was maybe a good sign," said Mr. Brownlie, eating a lunch of French onion soup and melted Emmental on salami and rye, pickles and mustard on the side - mountain fare.
Like the mountains, Mr. Brownlie finds himself having freshly emerged from a storm. He's now at the helm of Whistler Blackcomb Holdings Inc., newly public after a $345-million initial public offering in November, one of Canada's largest offerings last year. The resort, as a single entity, had never been public. It was always part of Mr. Houssian's Intrawest business which, in the late 2000s, became private after Intrawest was purchased for $2.8-billion in a heavily leveraged buyout by Fortress Investment Group.
Intrawest was gutted by the financial crisis and recession. The seller of expensive ski holidays and high-end resort real estate buckled under a severe debt load. Fortress's equity evaporated and the New York hedge fund barely held on to Intrawest, battling lenders who threatened to auction off Whistler Blackcomb during the 2010 Winter Olympics when the mountains played host to the ski races and sliding sports.
Fortress eventually satisfied its lenders but to do it Intrawest had to give up its main asset, Whistler, to drum up enough cash to pay down its debt. Intrawest, a long-time Vancouver company, decamped to Denver, moving its small head office to the state where two of its seven ski resorts are located - down from 10 when Mr. Houssian sold to Fortress.
Mr. Brownlie, who had climbed the ranks of Intrawest as it grew, helping to expand the mountain and real estate businesses, now turns his full attention to Whistler Blackcomb, whose assets are no longer focused solely on the skiing industry. The 48-year-old president wants to make it an "iconic Canadian company."
Whistler - routinely ranked as the best ski resort in North America and considered among the top in the world - had a bumpy beginning to its public ride. Fortress, after failing to attract a private buyer for Whistler, turned to the public markets. It asked $15 a share, presenting the company as a yield vehicle with a 6.4-per-cent coupon for income-hungry investors. But potential shareholders balked and the offering was slashed to $12, pushing the yield to 8 per cent.
Mr. Brownlie hit the road to sell the offering and counter skeptics who pointed out that ski resorts aren't known for reliable results.
"The biggest [question] was the ability to grow and the stability of the business," said Mr. Brownlie. "Everybody's perception is: 'Well, it all depends on snow.' ... But if you really look at it, snow does have an impact, but we've done a lot over the years to weatherproof our business to ensure we can deliver consistent cash flow."
While unpalatable to investors at $15, Whistler Blackcomb shares have fared well, holding at about $12 to $12.50 since the IPO. Even the weather has co-operated; the two metres that fell down in mid-February pushed the resort to more than 10 metres for the season - more than Whistler gets on average through an entire winter.
Part of Mr. Brownlie's "weatherproofing" is an ever-greater focus on skiers, in British Columbia and Washington state, who are within driving distance. This market underpins current revenue, compared with a decade ago when Whistler depended on American visitors taking advantage of the low Canadian dollar.
Developing Whistler's summer business and reducing its dependence on snow is the second major push. "Getting summer profitable is really unique," Mr. Brownlie said. "Most resorts lose money all summer long until winter comes." An average of 4,500 people ascend the mountains in July and August, up about 50 per cent over the past several years. (The average midwinter number is around 15,000.) The surging popularity of mountain biking - Whistler is a global centre - has helped, but the real lure for less-extreme hikers and sightseers has been the $52-million Peak 2 Peak gondola, a 4.4-kilometre link between Whistler and Blackcomb mountains. At its height, the gondola soars 436 meters above the valley and creek that separate the two. While popular in winter, Peak 2 Peak is fast becoming a summer can't-miss for visitors to B.C - and summer now accounts for about 15 per cent of Whistler's revenue.
While the resort is solidly profitable, growth has been elusive. Annual fiscal-year revenue has been stuck for several years around $220-million and income at $50-million. For its first weeks as a public company, from Nov. 9 to Dec. 31, Whistler's sales were $43-million and profit was $6-million. To expand the business, rather than just maintain it, Whistler has to attract more so-called destination visitors, those who are willing to travel farther and who will spend more money - on everything from ski school to meals at the Horstman.
Before lunch, while in the Solar Coaster chairlift climbing the mountain, Mr. Brownlie had chatted with a couple visiting from England. They'd previously skied in Canada, but admitted they were "one click away from the Alps" when they decided to book Whistler. They were happy they did: The woman called Whistler "ski heaven."
Mr. Brownlie wants to leverage the exposure of the Olympics to bring in more such destination guests. Tourism Whistler, a regional promotion group largely funded by Whistler Blackcomb, is spending most of its ad dollars to draw people from farther away.
While the Olympics might have looked like easy and amazing advertising for Whistler, converting that exposure to profit is a significant challenge. Intrawest chief executive officer Bill Jensen has said it isn't certain the Olympics will produce a "longer-term sustained bump."
"There's exchange rates, there's the economy, there's airfare," Mr. Brownlie said. "There's a lot more things that you have to overcome. We've got the most awareness we've ever had in the world today. We are on people's lists, but we went into this year with countries going bankrupt. If you're in the U.K. and everybody's losing their jobs and they're cutting back, people stay closer to home. As those barriers change, we're in an extremely good position to take advantage."
One tangible bonus of the Olympics was the government-funded $600-million expansion of Highway 99, the picturesque but once treacherous road that connects Vancouver and Whistler.
Still, the resort has not been able to eclipse the skier visit peaks of early last decade; in 2001-02 the resort drew a record 2.23 million, the high-water mark for any North American resort. Mr. Brownlie believes the company can beat that, yet skiing in general appears to be stuck in neutral, barely ticking up in the past decade as baby boomers age. Mr. Brownlie again points to the local market - the outdoors-orientated Pacific Northwest - and his goal to win market share.
He's convinced he has the best product around. After lunch, at the top of the snowy black-diamond run to the base of the Blackcomb Glacier, Mr. Brownlie marvels at the beauty. "You just can't make them like this."

Four manors and a castle

Abstract: Having it all during Ireland's home-and-garden building boom of the 1700s and 1800s meant being a member of the English-Protestant aristocracy in a country where almost everyone was Catholic and relegated to tenant farms and wee, thatched cottages. To Irish nationalists, these grand homes were symbols of British oppression, and a few became the target of IRA attacks during The Troubles. Today, they're a major tourist draw.

Full text: Get inside the opulent monster homes of Ireland's landed gentry - the English Protestants - who couldn't outbuild each other fast enough
Long before armchair renovators began tuning in to the TV show Build a New Life in the Country , Ireland's ruling class was peppering the landscape with massive country homes and château-style castles surrounded by ornate gardens.
It's a rich architectural legacy, remnants of an age when getting away from it all was easy - if you had it all to begin with.
"No streak of Puritan modesty restrained [those] for whom these houses were being built," note the authors of Irish Houses & Castles . "Local rivalries, jealousy, and family pride had their effect on the architecture - people were ruined in the attempt to outbuild one another."
Having it all during Ireland's home-and-garden building boom of the 1700s and 1800s meant being a member of the English-Protestant aristocracy in a country where almost everyone was Catholic and relegated to tenant farms and wee, thatched cottages. To Irish nationalists, these grand homes were symbols of British oppression, and a few became the target of IRA attacks during The Troubles. Today, they're a major tourist draw. The government owns and operates dozens of estates and many of those in private hands are open to the public.
So whether you want to escape into the plush world of the landed gentry or to see tangible evidence of the injustices of Irish history, here are four houses and a castle worth checking out. A driving tour of the lower half of the island, starting and ending in Dublin, will take you to the doorsteps of all five.
Emo Court
This temple-fronted, neo-classical gem west of Dublin might have fallen into ruin if not for the vision of a retired British major-turned-stockbroker, Cholmeley Harrison. He spent an estimated £4-million ($6.3-million) making it look as it did when architect James Gandon - creator of Dublin's elegant Custom House - designed it in the 1790s as a hunting lodge for the Earl of Portarlington.
The house had been converted into a Jesuit seminary when Mr. Harrison bought it in 1969. He followed original blueprints found at an auction and even dispatched workers to Italy to find marble to restore the rotunda. He donated the estate to the Irish government in 1994 and lived onsite, in a private suite, until his death in 2008 at age 99.
Muckross House
Think your guests are fussy? The Herberts, who built this Tudor-style estate overlooking one of the picturesque Lakes of Killarney, spent six years and a hefty chunk of change to prepare for a visit by Queen Victoria and her entourage in 1861. Her Majesty wound up staying just two days.
The 65-room house was sold at the turn of the last century to the Guinness brewing family, who used it as a hunting lodge - stag heads line the entrance hall. The house and its surrounding 4,400 hectares were donated to the people of Ireland in the 1930s, giving the newly independent country its first national park. Some of Victoria's attendants were so taken with the scenery that a nearby outlook is still known as the Ladies' View.
Bantry House
This brick-trimmed homage to Georgian symmetry boasts an unparalleled collection of European art and furniture, including tapestries reputed to have been made for Marie Antoinette. The climb up the 100-step staircase in the rear terraced garden is rewarded with a spectacular view over the rooftop to the ocean and mountains beyond.
This property on Ireland's west coast has been in the White family since the 18th century and in 1946 became the first private manor in Ireland to be opened to the public. Bed-and-breakfast accommodation is available in the main house, and the gatehouse has housekeeping suites.
The house was the backdrop for a turning point in Irish history - the first Earl of Bantry organized local defences when a French fleet, carrying Irish rebel leader Wolfe Tone, entered the bay in 1796. Storms prevented the invaders from landing and an adjacent museum displays artifacts from one of the sunken ships.
Kilkenny Castle
When Edward VII visited in 1904, he asked about the people lining up to greet him. Told they were the Butlers, the king supposedly responded, "Well, why aren't they serving the bloody drinks then?"
These Butlers were descendants of the earls of Ormonde, the family that called the castle home from the 14th century to the 1930s. Sporting round towers at three corners (the missing wall and tower were lost in a siege in 1650), it's the showpiece of a city renowned for its medieval architecture and its namesake beer.
Castle and family alike fell on hard times in the 20th century. The 24th Earl of Ormonde turned it over to the city in 1967 for restoration. Highlights of the tour are rooms recreating the castle's Victorian splendour and the Long Gallery, where artworks are displayed under a vaulted, wood-beamed roof.
Powerscourt Estate
If you're a movie buff, you've seen a lot of this 1740s mansion and its immaculate gardens, located just south of Dublin. Powerscourt was the backdrop for Barry Lyndon in 1975 and the 2002 version of The Count of Monte Cristo .
The house was gutted by fire in the 1970s and has been only partially restored, with shops and a restaurant on the main floor. The real draw is the setting overlooking cone-shaped Great Sugar Loaf Mountain and gardens modelled on those at Versailles.
An hour-long walk around the grounds snakes through a Japanese garden, skirts a lake and fountain facing the house and passes a cemetery where headstones mark the resting places of family pets: dogs, cats and even Eugenie, a beloved Jersey cow.

Full text: The October Killings
By Wessel Ebersohn
St. Martin's, 312 pages
$28.99
It's been nearly 20 years since Wessel Ebersohn's last mystery set in his native South Africa, more than 30 since he introduced the psychologist Yudel Gordon in A Lonely Place To Die . The October Killings brings Gordon back in a brilliant novel of memory, reconciliation and revenge. Ebersohn was always one of South Africa's best, and this new book - the beginning of, I hope, a series - shows why.
We begin in 1985, the final decade of apartheid, with a raid on a group of anti-apartheid activists, and then skip 20 years to the new SA. Abigail Bukula is an icon of the new black majority. With her western university degrees, she's a coming star in the Department of Justice. Her husband is the editor of a prestigious newspaper. She is also a survivor of that 1985 raid, in which her parents died.
Abigail survived because Leon Lourens, a 19-year-old white soldier, spoke in her defence, saving her from a massacre. She has not seen him in 20 years, and when he appears in her office in Pretoria, all that history is revived. He is neither rich nor powerful, but he needs a friend who is. Someone is killing, one by one, the soldiers who participated in the raid. Each Oct. 22, one dies. There are now only two left, himself and the Colonel who commanded. The Colonel is in a maximum-security prison. Leon knows that this Oct. 22, it's his turn. He has a wife and children.
Abigail knows who the murderer is and so does Leon. No one knows where he is. To find him, Abigail will have to meet with the imprisoned colonel, and for that, she needs the help of Yudel Gordon, now a part-time consultant at the prison.
Ebersohn never loses the narrative thread, and there isn't an extraneous syllable in this tight, intelligent novel that weaves history and politics. Definitely one of the best mysteries of the year.
The Sentry
By Robert Crais
Putnam, 306 pages
$33.50Robert Crais's Elvis Cole series is one of the best in American crime fiction. Fans always knew that Joe Pike was the most interesting of the many fascinating Crais characters, and they were delighted when Crais took Pike out of the background and made him the hero of The Watchman and The First Rule . He's back in The Sentry (Cole gets second billing), one of Crais's best.
Pike witnesses a savage beating by a neighbourhood gang. The victim is the owner of a local L.A. store. Pike learns that the man and his niece, Dru, are refugees from Hurricane Katrina. He offers his aid and protection and is surprised when they refuse. Naturally, Joe Pike isn't going to let go, which puts him on the cold trail of a dangerous criminal.
The Second Son
By Jonathan Rabb
Farrar Straus Giroux, 336 pages
$29.95
This is the final book in Rabb's trilogy featuring Berlin policeman Nicolai Hoffner, set in Europe between the World Wars. This is well-trod noir ground, but Rabb does a decent job of weaving history and cop slang.
It's the eve of Hitler's Olympics and Hoffner is unemployed. As a half-Jew, he's no longer a chief inspector of the Kriminalpolizei. His eldest son, race notwithstanding, is a fervent Nazi and a rising star. His second son, Georg, is missing, lost in Spain where the Civil War is raging. Georg's last sighting was Barcelona, so Hoffner, determined to save his son, heads for the Spanish cockpit where socialists, anarchists, democrats, communists and fascists from half a dozen countries kill and die. Everyone lies in Barcelona, but Hoffner has to trust someone and unravel the clue Georg has left him.
Grayling Cross
By Gayleen Froese
NeWest, 303 pages
$19.95 Grayling Cross is the second novel by musician and author Gayleen Froese, and it combines the latest in supernatural talents with mystery. If you can believe in Edmonton as a hive of magicians and psychics, then this is for you.
Psychic Anna Gareau works with PR expert Collie Kostyna. Their job is to keep the lid on any information about the local magicians, particularly their biggest client, the underground supernatural society known as the Embassy. When a teenage psychic goes missing in the ghost town of Grayling Cross, Gareau and Kostyna are hired to liaise with local supernaturalists and help find the missing kid. When an employee of the Embassy is found murdered under deeply suspicious circumstances, it appears that Gareau and Kostyna's client is the killer.
This is a lively novel filled with action, both real and unreal. Froese's dialogue is a bit leaden, but that doesn't drag down the plot. It appears that Anna and Collie are scheduled to return.
A Bone To Pick
By Charlaine Harris
Berkley, 262 pages
$32.50
No one does eccentric southern Gothic quite like Charlaine Harris. Of course, Sookie Stackhouse and the vampires of Bon Temps, Louisiana, are now the stars of HBO's True Blood. But Harris's talents go far beyond fangs and fancy, and A Bone to Pick hasn't a Goth in sight. Instead we have Aurora Teagarden, librarian of the small southern town of Lawrenceton, attending three weddings and a funeral.
The funeral is for her friend Jane Engle, whom Roe knew through their membership in a local (now disbanded) crime study club. It appears that Jane has left her very substantial estate to Roe, and it includes a house with a skull hidden in the window seat. The clues fall fast in this clever little puzzle, but it's the strange characters who keep the story running.
Sitting Lady Sutra
By Kay Stewart
TouchWood, 254 pages, $26.95RCMP Constable Danutia
Dranchuk made her debut in A Deadly Little List , which Stewart co-authored with Chris Bullock. Stewart is on her own in this very good sequel, which has Dranchuk up to her elbows in a murder at Vancouver Island's popular Sitting Lady Falls. Evidence leads her to two more suspicious deaths which may or may not be connected. Meanwhile, three other characters cross Danutia's path: a parolee, a busboy and a confused young art student.
There's a touch too much plot in this slight novel, but Stewart, a former English teacher and the author of two writing textbooks, keeps the action moving and the characters peppy.

Saudi Arabia's inner beast awakens

Author: Khouri, Rami

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/saudi-arabias-inner-beast-awakens/docview/857111188/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: In most of these spheres and proxy fights, pro-American conservative Arabs have generally lost ground to Iranian/Syrian-led groups in the political and military realms. If Bahrain is now the latest battlefield of ideological and ethnic conflict, the military gesture by the Saudis and Emiratis on behalf of the Gulf Co-operation Council is likely to have the opposite effect than its intended calming goal.

Full text:   The decision to send troops is sparking regional tensions and demonstrating Washington's marginalization
Editor-at-large of the Beirut-based Daily Star
The decision by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to send troops into Bahrain is a cause for concern at three levels: It suggests that conservative Arab leaders in key energy-producing states are worried that unrest in Yemen and Bahrain may spill over into their countries; it accelerates the simmering ideological war between some Arab leaders and Iran, with a strong undertone of Shia-Sunni tensions; and it's likely to spark fresh tensions in some Persian Gulf states where Shia minorities will raise the level of their demands and protests.
But it's potentially good news on two other fronts: Saudi Arabia is asserting itself, and the United States is showing itself to be a marginal spectator in this process.
The UAE's Foreign Minister, Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, said on Monday that the Saudi-UAE move was designed to defuse tensions in Bahrain and "to support the Bahraini government and to get calm and order in Bahrain and to help both the Bahraini government and people to reach to a solution which is for the best for the Bahraini people."
This is a legitimate and reasonable goal, but sending in troops from other Arab countries is about the worst possible way to achieve it, given the internal, regional and global contexts in which this occurs.
Internally, a serious homegrown challenge to the ruling elite in Bahrain reflects the wider revolt of Arabs fed up with being denied their full citizenship rights. Regionally, this is likely to be seen as the latest proxy political battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, a battle that, in some places (Iran, Palestine, Lebanon), occasionally spills over into armed clashes. And globally (with the added symbolism of Bahrain's being the home base of the U.S. Fifth Fleet), this is the latest phase of the ideological battle that has defined the Middle East for the past two decades, and especially since the demise of the Iraqi state in 2003 as a result of the Anglo-American attack: the Iranian/Syrian-led regional defiance of American/Israeli/Arab conservatism.
In most of these spheres and proxy fights, pro-American conservative Arabs have generally lost ground to Iranian/Syrian-led groups in the political and military realms. If Bahrain is now the latest battlefield of ideological and ethnic conflict, the military gesture by the Saudis and Emiratis on behalf of the Gulf Co-operation Council is likely to have the opposite effect than its intended calming goal. It will stoke resentment and opposition by many in Bahrain and around the region who will see this move as an "occupation," as some Bahrainis have already said. On Tuesday, Bahrain's King declared a state of emergency.
The lesson that many will draw is that two different standards apply to Arab rights - in countries such as Libya, Egypt and Tunisia, the world will accept or actively support constitutional changes that citizens of those countries demand, while in other countries such as Bahrain, the rights of citizens are secondary to wider energy and security needs.
Sending in Saudi and Emirati troops is probably a counterproductive over-reaction, because tensions in Bahrain are purely political and local. They can be resolved through national negotiations that reconfigure the constitutional governance system in a manner that affirms the equal rights of all citizens and subjects the incumbent power elite to credible mechanisms of accountability and participation - which is what Arabs are demanding across the region. Issues of a political character that were resolvable in Bahrain will now be less resolvable because they've been shifted into an arena defined by foreign troops and a proxy battle for regional/global powers.
An inner beast has awoken in Saudi Arabia, as sending Saudi troops to other lands is a sign of real concern and growing panic, but also of self-confidence and assertion in foreign policy. The regional implications of this Saudi move are enormous - and unpredictable.
The Saudis, Washington's closest Arab ally in the heart of the most strategic real estate in the world, apparently gave the Americans only one day's notice of their intentions. A Saudi official told The New York Times that the U.S. was informed on Sunday that Saudi troops would enter Bahrain on Monday.
There's no better sign of the reality that Washington has become a marginal player in much of the Middle East, largely as a consequence of its own incompetence, inconsistency, bias and weakness in allowing its Middle East policy to be shaped by neo-conservative fanatics, pro-Israeli zealots, anti-Islamic demagogues, Christian fundamentalist extremists and assorted other folks who trample American principles and generate foreign policies that marginalize the U.S. abroad.
Rami Khouri is director of the
Issam Fares Institute for Public
Policy and International Affairs at the American University of Beirut.

The shaky state of Canadian book publishing

Author: Porter, Anna

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/shaky-state-canadian-book-publishing/docview/856942101/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Canadian publishers publish about 90 per cent of Canadian-authored books, as they should, just as U.S. publishers publish more than 98 per cent of U.S.-authored books, as they should. The one significant difference is the size of the market. Ours is about the same as California's, which makes this a labour-intensive, marginal business - one that has our risk-averse bankers run to the safer havens of foreign real estate, junk bonds and seemingly deep-pocketed developers.

Full text:   Fortunately, there are people in this country who value what they contribute to our lives above what they take out of the economy
I spent almost 40 years publishing books in Canada and, as my old friend and mentor Jack McClelland used to say, this terrible business has been kind to me. It gave me the opportunity to work with some very talented writers (Avie Bennett used to say that buying McClelland & Stewart was a small price to pay to be able to lunch with Margaret Atwood), a few interesting artists, politicians, industrialists, bankers and hockey legends.
Apart from that, it's taught me a great deal about endurance and patience. And I've needed both to endure people who believe that the publishing business in Canada needs less government and more incentives for foreign investment. None of the bright-eyed free enterprisers has suggested that the government should change the protectionist policies that have helped our newspaper owners thrive.
How did people get the idea that there are electrified fences against foreign investment in Canadian literature? Unlike the protected business of banking, for example, there are no barriers to the free flow of books into Canada. If you don't believe me, walk through a Chapters store and check where most of the books come from. And, yes, foreign-owned publishers do publish some of the best of our authors - many of them first discovered by the local farm team of publishers, then taken over by the larger foreign firms, once those authors became successful.
Canadian publishers publish about 90 per cent of Canadian-authored books, as they should, just as U.S. publishers publish more than 98 per cent of U.S.-authored books, as they should. The one significant difference is the size of the market. Ours is about the same as California's, which makes this a labour-intensive, marginal business - one that has our risk-averse bankers run to the safer havens of foreign real estate, junk bonds and seemingly deep-pocketed developers. That, in turn, makes it hard for local publishers to get lines of credit so they can compete with foreign publishers when they try to retain those few very successful authors by paying them what they deserve.
Our government has tried to keep the locals going by providing modest subsidies. No, they're not on the scale of farm subsidies or film subsidies or Bombardier subsidies, nor as effective as the tax deductibility of advertising costs if you spend your money on Canadian-owned media, but they've served the purpose of keeping book publishers working at subsistence-level pay, employing people at equally ridiculous wages, and paying taxes for the privilege.
Frankly, I believe most book publishers are brilliant business people with astonishing financial acumen and endurance through difficult times that would put those subsidized car manufacturers to shame. Sometimes, I wonder how wealthy Karl Siegler of tiny Talonbooks would be today had he gone into the car parts business instead of battling on year after year publishing those very fine Canadian books.
Fortunately, there are people in this country who value what they contribute to our lives above what they take out of the economy. (That, I hope, answers the question a distinguished lawyer once asked me: If that's all you make in a year, why don't you change professions?)
The only barrier against foreigners entering our market is that they, ostensibly, can't buy Canadian book publishing companies. That bit of regulation is a hangover from the days one needed a physical presence in Canada to distribute books. Well, as those following book news would be aware, you don't need a local warehouse any more - look at what happened to H.B. Fenn when its foreign-owned business partners decided they didn't need a local distributor. It may even be cheaper to ship your books across the border. So why in hell would they want to buy a Canadian book publisher?
The real question is: What kind of government policies do we need to keep our vital publishing houses functioning? The old model no longer works. What's at stake is our future as a distinct cultural entity, our being a country rather than a collection of self-interested people with nothing to hold them together but the comfort of knowing that our bankers are more prudent than others'.
Anna Porter's The Ghosts of Europe won this year's Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing.

Full text:   gmason@globeandmail.com
In Vancouver, real estate is the economy. So for many, news that Chinese investors are once again arriving in droves to buy up property is being cheered.
Real-estate agents haven't seen anything like it since the mid-1990s, when fears surrounding the Hong Kong handover fuelled the first rush into the local market by Chinese investors. This second charge could be as substantial as the first, which drove up property values by hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Back then, suburban Richmond was the destination of choice. And while it remains the preferred location, investors from mainland China are buying up property throughout Greater Vancouver. Toronto too.
Cam Good, a Vancouver real estate marketer, created a buzz a few weeks ago when he invited the media along on a helicopter tour of Greater Vancouver he was giving a group of interested Chinese buyers. The fact they were willing to look outside of Richmond was considered news.
Not everyone who read about the tour or watched stories about it on television was thrilled. Within days, Mr. Good began receiving angry e-mails from Vancouver-area residents worried that this latest push from China will make prices in the area even more obscene.
"I got a lot of, you know, how are my children ever going to be able to afford a home?" Mr. Good said the other day. "There was an undercurrent of racism in a lot of them. That we should put up a barricade. We have enough Chinese, that sort of thing."
One e-mail qualified as hate mail. It also contained the hope that someone blow up Mr. Good's offices. He was so concerned he turned it over to the Vancouver Police Department, which is investigating.
That there would be some of this type of sentiment is perhaps not surprising. But Mr. Good says people are hypocrites. Many live off the avails of the wealth real estate generates in Greater Vancouver. And yet some of those same people are the ones "complaining about the Chinese buying up the place."
They may be grumbling for a while.
Mr. Good said there are several reasons for what is occurring.
There are more wealthy people in China than ever before. Concerns about inflation and a real-estate bubble prompted the Chinese government to limit the number of condominiums people can own to two. So the wealthiest Chinese are looking elsewhere to invest their money.
That it's hard to get money out of the Communist country appears to be a myth.
"Real-estate values in China have doubled over the last two or three years,' said Mr. Good, whose company The Key has opened an office in Beijing and has plans to open another in Guangzhou next month. "So real estate in Vancouver and Toronto doesn't seem too expensive to them any more.
"We're also seeing a lot of Chinese looking for a parachute plan. These are people afraid of a regime change in China and what that might mean for their wealth base. Canada is seen as a safe place to put their money."
The Chinese love the political and economic stability Canada offers. We have a good education system too, which is why so many mainland Chinese send their children here to go to school. It is common for a mother and her children to come to over, while the husband remains in China to earn a living.
Mr. Good's company has sold more than 500 condos in Vancouver and Toronto in the last two months to Chinese investors. The latest rush into Richmond has moved a growing number of homes over the $1-million mark. A 34-storey condo tower in suburban Burnaby sold out immediately, with the majority of purchasers reportedly being Chinese. The $98-million in sales set a single-day record for the municipality.
Thanks largely to the latest great push from China, the average price of a home in Greater Vancouver rose 12 per cent in 2010 and is expected to rise another three per cent this year, according to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.
"We're just on the cusp of this," Mr. Good said. "The massive middle class in China is just now getting to the point where they can afford the international option.
"People here better get used to it."

A former army base goes civilian

Author: Hadani Ditmars

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/former-army-base-goes-civilian/docview/856630753/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: For Anneli Porter and her husband Darryl, (owner of the Chilliwack Bruins hockey team) who built a luxurious new 2,300-square-foot home near the woodlands, the appeal of Garrison Crossing is that "we don't have to drive everywhere. Our daughter can walk to school, and we can walk to the shops." But added to that is the small town feel. "If our child is ill, we can just call the local doctor and he'll say 'come on over.'"

Full text:   Garrison Crossing offers urban amenities with small-town charm in the heart of suburbia
The drive from Vancouver to Chilliwack is a scenic one. As you approach the town of 85,000 you're embraced by the rugged Coastal mountain range, old farmhouses on small acreages, and eagles winging above you.
But for the ubiquitous, ugly suburban tract housing peeking out from behind metal fences, you might be in paradise.
Now, thanks to the new Garrison Crossing development, a community built on the bones of an old Canadian Forces base over a decade in the planning, you can have your piece of the suburban cake and eat it too.
You notice the shift even before you enter Garrison, off a strip mall in the old logging town of Sardis. Across from the entrance, a new yoga studio offering hot Bikram classes indicates a sea change, and stands out from the neighbouring fast food joints.
As you enter the area called Garrison Village, where flats sit atop shops and cafes, it's not just the espresso bar with weekend folksingers that makes it feel urban, it's the mixed-use, high-density design. Garrison Crossing offers a truly unique blend of urban amenities and small town charm in a suburban setting.
The brainchild of Randy Fasan, chief planner for Canada Lands Company, he first spotted the potential of the site in 1996. But he had to wait until 2002, once a land-claims dispute had been settled with the Stolo nation, to begin planning in earnest.
Mr. Fasan noted the natural beauty of the site, framed by mountains and the Vedder River, but also appreciated the built environment.
"There was something quaint about the post-war housing stock - it had character and simplicity," notes the architect turned planner. And rather than the standard grid system, so typical of former military sites and suburban developments, Garrison had "lovely, winding boulevards, and hundreds of new trees."
Mr. Fasan could see the potential for a kind of new urbanist village in the midst of suburbia - one built on the bones of an already established community - as opposed to one built out of the ether. So, as much as possible of the existing housing stock was preserved, albeit after being gutted, refurbished and often relocated to new sites. Besides lending a sense of depth and history to the development, bordered by soul-less 1980s' vinyl siding-plagued housing projects, there were other advantages. Converting existing housing left a smaller footprint than building brand new homes, and much of the existing wood framing was made from sturdy old growth timber - impossible to replicate.
"Basically," explains project architect Mark Ankeman, "we inherited a site that already had excellent features - both in terms of the natural and the built environment. My main job," he jokes, "was not to screw that up."
Carving a new residential and mixed-use community out of a former military base was not an easy task - especially when working with a developer like Canada Lands - a non-agent Crown Corporation known for its meticulous attention to detail.
An exhaustive series of public consultations over several months meant that by the time the final plans were presented to council, the mayor's decision was almost instant.
"He said it was one of the most beautifully planned developments he'd ever seen," Mr. Fasan, who spent a considerable chunk of his career working on Garrison, notes with pleasure.
And the mayor wasn't the only one with this opinion. The Urban Development Institute awarded Garrison its Masterplan Community prize in 2007.
The public consultation process resulted in a series of priorities for the developer that included adaptive reuse of existing materials - including buildings, roadways and trees, environmental sensitivity and a celebration of the site's historical legacy. To this end great pains were taken to respect everything from raptor habitat to ground water to the site's military history - paid its due homage with Bailey bridges and historical plaques throughout the site. Green space is interspersed throughout the community, with newly built parks and preservation of existing woodlands. A new recreation centre and swimming pool is being built, and 75 per cent of residents on the 153-acre site are within a five-minute walk of shops and amenities.
Variegated housing types - from coach houses, to town homes, flats, row houses and Arts and Craft style heritage homes - and use of different colours, banish any sense of suburban sameness. And strict building codes that restrict materials to a subtle palette of brick, wood and stone, ensure consistent quality throughout, regardless of size, style or price point.
To say that Canada Lands dotted all their i's and crossed all their t's would be somewhat of an understatement. But for Mr. Fasan, it's all part of good business practice. "Any enlightened developer these days will tell you that public consultation and attention to quality and detail pay dividends in the long term."
In practical terms, the site that Canada Lands inherited, explains Mr. Ankenman "had narrow roads, no sidewalks, no overall site plan and lots of wasted space." Messrs. Fasan and Ankenman carefully developed a vision that included laneways for parking to avoid typical suburban design with garages consuming frontage space. Instead they created pedestrian friendly sidewalks and built large front porches onto formerly bare bones "PMQ's (private married quarters) to encourage old-fashioned neighbourly exchanges. They also radically increased the density - often quadrupling it - by fitting lot sizes to housing, and refurbishing a series of 1970s era row housing.
The result is a surprisingly intimate feeling community - and one where neighbours really do look out for each other.
Darlene Goetz, a communications specialist who purchased one of the converted two-bedroom row houses - complete with original maple flooring - last year, says "When I'm sick with the flu, I have neighbours who bring me chicken soup. When they're away I walk their dog for them and help maintain their garden. And every summer we have a big communal BBQ."
Indeed there is a nostalgic sense of the post-war bucolic North American suburb at play here - but it's one that comes neatly wrapped in a well-planned, sustainable and surprisingly urban package.
For Anneli Porter and her husband Darryl, (owner of the Chilliwack Bruins hockey team) who built a luxurious new 2,300-square-foot home near the woodlands, the appeal of Garrison Crossing is that "we don't have to drive everywhere. Our daughter can walk to school, and we can walk to the shops." But added to that is the small town feel. "If our child is ill, we can just call the local doctor and he'll say 'come on over.'"
And for Darrell Fox, an adviser to the Terry Fox foundation, brother of the great Canadian hero, and owner of a new 3,700-square-foot house, Garrison Crossing is simply a lovely place to come home to. "The great thing about it," says Mr. Fox, who manages to work out of a home office and only commutes to downtown headquarters a few times a week," is that everything you need is here. You really don't need to leave."
While the wrong kind of suburban development can induce a sense of panic and entrapment, Garrison Crossing feels like the kind of place you'd like to stay and rest awhile. As Mr. Fasan presides over a master plan model of what the final 1,700-residence development will look like (once the next 800 homes are complete), in the former officer's mess turned presentation centre, the film Pleasantville springs to mind. But this one shines in technicolour.

Full text:   After 17 years with CBC's As it Happens, Barbara Budd has relocated to the place she fell in love with as a young actor
When Barbara Budd decided to buy a house in Stratford, she prayed she'd find something fabulous - and she did. She just never expected it would be a former church.
The actor, broadcaster and consummate storyteller, who co-hosted CBC Radio's As it Happens for 17 years, bought the oldest brick building in the city, a former Presbyterian church built in 1851. (It was divided into two residential units in 1886 when the church moved elsewhere.)
"When I walked into the entrance hall something waved over me. I felt at peace. I instantly knew this was the house for me," says Ms. Budd, who moved from Toronto to Stratford in November, along with her 17-year-old son Thomas. She's since met someone whose ancestor was baptized in the house and someone else whose great-grandparents were married there.
Ms. Budd had actually bought the house five years earlier, foreseeing a time when she'd want to retreat from daily life in the big city and return to the place - and the people - that captured her heart almost 40 years ago. "I felt I had this tremendous connection here," says Ms. Budd, who was an actor with the Stratford Festival from 1975 to 1980. "I missed the small town camaraderie, but also the people who I had shared so much with as actors and participants at the Festival, many of whom still live and work here. Moving to Stratford felt like moving back home."
The house was rented out to Festival actors until Ms. Budd decided she was ready to make the leap. The other half is currently owned by her friend, actor Lally Cadeau.
The two-storey, three-bedroom house, located in one of Stratford's premiere heritage districts, is quadruple red brick, covered in parging, a type of mortar. It has two enormous bathrooms (one of which is large enough to store a small car), a huge open kitchen with a dining area that makes it ideal for entertaining, plus a generous living room with 12½-foot ceilings. The windows are large and plentiful so the house is awash in light even on grey winter days, which helps to showcase her eclectic collection of Canadian art. The house sits on a corner lot and has a screened-in porch on the front and a private, latticed patio at the side that is surrounded by lush perennial gardens that bloom from spring through to the fall. They were planted by local real estate agent Susan Fox, who was not only Ms. Budd's agent but also the former owner of the house.
Two of the first things Ms. Budd bought when she moved to Stratford, which is in a snow belt, were four snow tires and a sump pump. Then she got busy on more creative and restorative projects. She completely rebuilt an aging and temperamental gas fireplace in the corner of the living room, had the bulging wainscoting that runs up the stairs repaired, and most of the main floor repainted - all of which reminded her of a few other things she loves about Stratford.
"When you're living in a small town, there's such a visibility of your work, whether you're an actor on the stage, a painter in the park, the man who installs your sump pump or works on your wainscoting. There's not only visibility, but a regard for individual reputation and a regard for the client. When you live in a bigger city, there's an invisibility. In Stratford you learn very quickly if someone can be relied upon or is not to be trusted."
She's also been delighted with the level of craftsmanship that's available locally. Vyvyan Green, the man hired to repair her wainscoting, for example, was a master carpenter and foreman in England who worked on 500-year-old buildings before moving to Stratford 20 years ago. All the jobs she's commissioned since November have come in under budget, as well as on time. She hired Dave Ellis Painting and Renovations to repaint the hallway, front door, living room, staircase and all the ceilings and he and his assistant did the work in less than three days and for the low estimate. "And when they say they'll be here, they're here. It's fabulous."
Ms. Budd prefers not to say what she paid for the house but she will say it was a fraction of what a similar house in Toronto would cost, "if you could even find a 160-year-old house in Toronto." The day of The Globe and Mail interview, a big bouquet of fresh-cut flowers was delivered, sent by her real estate agent in Toronto, congratulating her on selling her Chaplin Crescent house after just 2½ days on the market and at seven per cent above the asking price.
Life is good for Ms. Budd these days - and in more ways than one.
Poised to turn 60 later this year, the outspoken and gregarious maverick is far from retired; in fact she's busier than ever. She commutes back and forth roughly four days a week to work on Toronto projects - "fortunately, I love driving" - and the day after the interview, she was flying to Calgary to moderate a panel on pop culture and biotechnology at the Glenbow Museum. In addition to her work as host, moderator and guest speaker, she's also in the midst of writing a book. And as word spreads she's now a resident of Stratford, local commitments continue to grow. Invited to participate in this year's Stratford Summer Music, the city's award-winning music festival, Ms. Budd will be "exploring how music has influenced the lives of three extraordinary performers."Busy with work and still buried in boxes, Ms. Budd happily acknowledges it was heart that brought her back to Stratford, but she's convinced it was fate that delivered the house. At one point, she'd actually put in an offer and a deposit on another place, but at the last minute, the couple backed out, saying they decided not to move. Heartbroken, she stopped looking at houses altogether for about a year. Then, her real estate agent called about the church house.
"I was sitting on the front porch about a month ago thinking about that whole scenario," Ms. Budd recalls, "and then it hit me. 'Ooh, that's why that house fell through. I was supposed to live here - because in the long run, this is much more my house than the other one.'"

Full text:   Municipal development charges have more than doubled in five years, construction industry reports say
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
New home buyers in the GTA are being saddled with hidden fees that threaten to price buyers out of the market, with as much as 30 per cent of the purchase price going directly to government coffers.
But the construction industry is pushing back, saying the municipalities' appetite for development charges could derail the new-housing market by driving the average price beyond the means of most buyers just as interest rates are about to move higher.
The charges have more than doubled in the past five years in many communities around the Greater Toronto Area, according to a pair of reports from the industry that will be released on Thursday. Development fees are levied to raise the money for the municipality to provide infrastructure - roads and sewers - to support the housing. However, the cities have also funnelled some of the cash toward projects such as libraries and community centres, which developers say have little to do with the actual construction of a house.
Homebuilders - who have become increasingly vocal in their critique of government policy as the new-housing market shows signs of cooling - said governments have been able to pile costs on consumers over the past several years because interest rates have been low and homes have been relatively affordable.
But with interest rates set to move higher in the next year and more buyers conscious of costs, they said, the full effect of a decade of rising fees could sideline an industry that has been crucial to the region's economic health.
"Municipalities have increasingly looked to development charges for additional revenue because these costs are indirect and hidden," states a report by the Residential and Civic Construction Alliance of Ontario.
The report estimates that home buyers in Oakville pay an average $50,548 in development charges, with most cities surrounding the City of Toronto charging between $30,000 and $50,000 for each new home built. Toronto's average take is $12,281 per house, with development charges set to rise this year after a two-year freeze.
"We're in a different position in the City of Toronto because we aren't building large subdivisions and most of the infrastructure for new homes is already built," special projects director Joe Farag said.
In Vancouver, development charges average $23,418. In Calgary, they are $7,475.
These figures don't include the additional costs added by the federal goods and services tax, or additional charges brought on by the new harmonized sales tax in Ontario and B.C. With those factored in, a report from the Residential Construction Council of Ontario estimates that 30 per cent of a new GTA home's cost is now determined by government charges. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. estimates the Canadian average is 13.4 per cent.
Oakville Mayor Rob Burton said the city charges developers the maximum amount allowed under provincial legislation because development fees haven't covered the cost of growth in more than a decade. "Mike Harris gutted them in 1997," he said.
"So local property taxpayers subsidize billionaire developers whose subdivisions make higher profits by not paying for the hospitals, transit and other infrastructure they require," he said. "Oakville's council is proud to have development charges that capture the maximum permissible amount of the costs of growth."
The builders agree that the shifting of some provincial responsibilities to the municipalities led to rapidly escalating fees in the GTA, but say they should not have to bear the brunt. The president of the Canadian Homebuilders Association said builders can't simply absorb the costs, because their margins have never been thinner.
"Profit is not a dirty word," Vince Laberge said. "Politicians need to raise property taxes instead of having a social agenda funded by the new home buyer."
The reports recommend the province pay a greater share of the cost of municipal infrastructure such as fire stations and libraries, and provide more transit funding, and that municipalities implement user fees in place of development charges wherever possible. If not, they warn, development could be reduced in coming years.

It takes nerve to tell a Toronto audience that Jane Jacobs was wrong. The American-born thinker and activist lived here from 1968 until her death in 2006. She is revered for her insight - now conventional wisdom - that diversity is the key to a livable city. She was one of the first to see the folly of big urban-renewal schemes that destroyed lively older neighbourhoods and replaced them with bland housing projects.
But according to Harvard economist Edward Glaeser, she was wrong about at least one thing: tall buildings. In his smart new book Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier and Happier , he says that "Jane Jacobs' opposition to urban renewal led her to a more sweeping dislike for tall buildings in general."
Jacobs argued that high-rise residential towers isolate their residents from the street. Only by living in low-rise buildings, like her own home in New York's Greenwich Village, could they stay connected to the bustling street life that keeps cities vital and safe.
She led famous fights against plans to drive an expressway through Washington Square Park and tear down 16 blocks of the Village for urban renewal. But her views on density and height also led her to oppose a nine-storey library for New York University. In her 1961 classic The Death and Life of Great American Cities , she argued that neighbourhoods with more than 200 households to the acre risked becoming sterile and standardized.
Anyone who has walked through Hong Kong or midtown Manhattan can see that's mistaken. Lined with high-rise apartment towers, boasting densities many times over Jacobs's danger mark, these streets teem with life. The same could be said of Yaletown in Vancouver or the condo canyons of downtown Toronto.
Prof. Glaeser says that as much as he admires Jacobs for her "enormous wisdom and insight," she was also wrong when she argued in her early work that preserving older, shorter buildings would keep accommodation affordable for homeowners and entrepreneurs. "Her vision for Greenwich Village produced an area that was enshrined in amber, that was unable to produce enough supply to create affordability - and now it's $5-million to buy a house in Greenwich Village," he said at a University of Toronto talk this week.
Greenwich Village is a charming place, for certain. So is central Paris, where high-rise buildings are rare. But the enormous cost of residing in such places inevitably turns them into preserves of the rich. Cities that encourage high-rise living are not only more affordable, they are ultimately more livable. The population density that comes with high-rise buildings brings livelier streets, more efficient transit use, less energy consumption and healthier, less car-dependent lifestyles. The alternative to building up is building out - the curse of urban sprawl.
That lesson often seems lost on Toronto. The explosion in high-rise condo development is a great thing for the city - Prof. Glaeser says he is "exalted" to witness it - but a maze of rules about zoning, shadow impacts and densities often limits attempts to build skyward. Every time a developer proposes a tall building, local residents and politicians fight to block it or scale it down.
It is an old prejudice. Prof. Glaeser notes that when early-20th-century real estate developers were trying to build on New York's Fifth Avenue, then a street of stately mansions, opponents wanted a height cap of 125 feet. Without it, they said, the street would become a soulless canyon and property values would crash.
Today it is one of the liveliest and most valuable avenues in the world.

In bathroom renos, take the long view

Author: Richardson, Sarah

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/bathroom-renos-take-long-view/docview/854917279/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Why don't I tile baths in fuchsia, navy, emerald or lavender? Well, frankly, I believe the only "right" choices for a costly bathroom reno are lasting choices. The most costly elements to install, and the most difficult elements to change are the tile work, the floors, the bathtub, and the countertop. If you stick to the tried and true favourites and commit to a light, natural palette, you'll reduce the risk of asking yourself "why did I ever choose that?" in years to come.

Full text:   Embrace the budget you have to work with and select materials and elements that will stand the test of time
srichardson@globeandmail.com
Every bathroom has an expiry date. When yours is past due, it's time to come up with a new plan that will make it the oasis of crisp, fresh style that it should rightly be. Therein lies my challenge: While I rip out an expired bathroom whose awfulness makes me shudder, I can't help but worry that my new creation may some day be subject to similar criticisms.
So, when it comes to bathrooms, I take the long view. I select materials and elements that will stand the test of time (and hopefully not look like a 2011 time capsule in decades to come). There's no guarantee that the tides of design won't shift and leave you marooned, but if you choose elements that are in keeping with the architectural style of your home you can rest assured that your renovation dollars will be a sound investment in your abode.
If it's fixed, make it neutral
Why don't I tile baths in fuchsia, navy, emerald or lavender? Well, frankly, I believe the only "right" choices for a costly bathroom reno are lasting choices. The most costly elements to install, and the most difficult elements to change are the tile work, the floors, the bathtub, and the countertop. If you stick to the tried and true favourites and commit to a light, natural palette, you'll reduce the risk of asking yourself "why did I ever choose that?" in years to come.
Bring thresholds to the baseline
I'm not keen on using standard wood baseboards in the bathroom, as I worry about their durability. When installed too close to the shower, wood baseboards can be exposed to water, causing them to crack and may cause mildew. Ready-made shower jambs and thresholds are available at your local big box store in 78-inch lengths for a fraction of what it costs to have them custom made. They are available in both Carrera marble and travertine (so you can choose greyish white or creamy beige), and are both practical and good-looking.
Go cheap, then embellish
I've never been able to find fault with the simplest and most basic choices, as long as they are also good quality. When you're planning to dress your bath in white, white, more white, and a touch of cream, why spend a fortune?
There are some frugally functional tile choices to be found at bottom-of-the-barrel prices in the aisles of some not-so-glam shopping destinations. So why not go for it? When the local big-box store is offering an array of ceramic tile at 35 cents a tile, you can bet I'm filling my cart and checking out! The downfall of inexpensive tile is installing it in a lacklustre way; if you pick a single size and slap it on the walls, it will be bland. But if you devise an interesting pattern it can look dynamite.
Strike up the band
Once you've found a source for well-priced tiles, spend some time to review the total offering and let your imagination run wild. After I got hooked on the concept of mixing white and cream I noticed that grey was also on offer. Instead of deliberating which combination was best, I opted to use them all.
By punctuating each row of white or cream tile with a band of pale grey listello tiles, the cheapest tile in the aisle took on a snazzy look. In tile, it's not what you spend, it's how you install it that counts, so hire a great tile setter and embrace the classics.
Play both sides
If you've gone to the trouble of renovating your bathroom and making it a sight to behold, you want to be able to enjoy it from every angle. Instead of buying a tub with the faucet mounted on the end, why not select a double-ended slipper tub that allows you to recline on either end and soak in the glorious views of your dreamy retreat? Since a slipper tub rises gracefully at the ends, you'll have a gently sloped spot to rest your weary head when you're in bubbles up to your chin!
Make it up
Start the process with a floor plan and plot everything you absolutely must install. Then see what you can do with the space that remains. If you begin the adventure with a "must-have" list of the things you can't live without, accompanied by a "nice-to-have" list of the elements that would comprise your dream bathroom, you just might be able to make trade-offs and squeeze in some added amenities. By swapping an outdated corner Jacuzzi for a long and lean slipper tub, we eked out enough room to satiate the lady of the house's dream for a makeup table. Thanks to an inexpensive find from an antique store, we were able to add a touch of old Hollywood glam to this new-fangled reno. To make the painted table surface more durable, we added a piece of glass, so the surface could be wiped clean.
Add a touch of blush
Your simply neutral bathroom statement can still have a hint of colour by adding accent pieces. Apricot, cream and grey is a favourite combination of mine, so I sprinkled some delicate blush tints around the bathroom in effective yet easy-to-change accents: towels, accessories and lampshades are inexpensive ways to infuse an accent without breaking the bank.
And a few more 101 lessons:
The save
Stone floors are a master ensuite "must-have" in my books - and easy to achieve. Natural stone is available at every price point, but you can get it for a song. After finding Crema Marfil for a paltry $6 a square foot for the floor tile, I was able to squeeze in a carpet-like detail band of grey and white marble to define the main circulation space of the bathroom. It only took about 12 square feet of mosaic to create the border, yet it adds presence and polish to the overall look of the room.
The splurge
My design collaborator, Tommy Smythe, loves old-world details as much as I do, and is constantly seeking ways to bring a nostalgic and retro-minded touch to the projects we tackle. Tired of the tried-and-true ubiquitous "frameless" shower enclosure, Tommy conceived of a glass shower enclosure, detailed with chrome framing accents to give it a more historic flair.
The signature Sarah
I want the ooh la la factor in every project I tackle, regardless of budget or provenance of materials. Why can't a room whose materials come from a warehouse make you swoon? I will always choose simple and honest elements used in innovative ways over lavish excess that misses the mark. Embrace the budget you have to work with, and enjoy the adventure of the making the most of what you've got!

How to steal millions from state coffers

Author: Tu Thanh Ha

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/how-steal-millions-state-coffers/docview/854369781/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Meanwhile, the [Sani Abacha] family was able to send stolen funds to the U.S., Britain and Austria, then transfer the sums to Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. In Britain alone, 23 banks handled the money. In Switzerland, 19 banks took deposits from Mr. Abacha's relatives and associates.

Full text: Dictators stuffing the wealth of the nations they lead into their own personal accounts have developed clever patterns over the years to avoid detection and hide the cash - even when their regimes fall. Tu Thanh Ha reports
The three Nigerian men who opened a series of bank accounts in Switzerland in the 1990s used a bewildering permutation of names.
Sani Mohammed. Sani Abba Mohammed. Ibrahim Sani. Muhammad Sani Abdu. Abba Muhammad Sani. Ibrahim Muhammad Sani.
One name they didn't use was Abacha.
They were the three sons of Sani Abacha, the Nigerian strongman who died mysteriously in 1998 after stealing $5-billion (U.S.) in public funds.
Swirling through dozens of banks in seven countries, the intricate financial web left by the Abacha family is a testimony to the efforts dictators deploy to launder their stolen assets.
And the dos and don'ts of hiding money are likely in the minds of many heads of state these days. Moammar Gadhafi is only the latest in the Arab world who is likely facing an unexpected, early retirement.
Three years ago the world got a glimpse of his financial muscle after one of his sons, Hannibal, was arrested in Geneva for allegedly beating two servants. Colonel Gadhafi retaliated by withdrawing $5-billion from Swiss banks.
It is said Col. Gadhafi personally reviews all contracts involving Libyan government funds worth more than $200-million. From its offices in a downtown tower overlooking the Tripoli seafront, his country's wealth fund, the Libyan Investment Authority, has been sitting on a $32-billion hoard in liquidity.
What Col. Gadhafi did with his fortune likely follows the same lessons kleptocrats and corrupt officials from Peru to Zambia have drawn over the years.
LESSON 1: MOVE THE MONEY BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE
In Tunisia, observers had long looked for signs that the family of president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, which controlled a large share of the country's economy, had been planning for a lucrative departure. Relatives had been buying real estate in Europe and Canada. One of his son-in-laws tried in vain to get a residency permit in Switzerland before ending up in Montreal.
But the Ben Ali assets seized so far in Switzerland, Belgium and Canada range only in the tens of millions of dollars, raising questions about whether the regime collapsed before the clan could make an orderly exit.
The most prolific looters, such as Mr. Abacha or the late Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines (up to $10-billion stolen), were able to siphon massive amounts directly from their countries' treasuries undisturbed.
Mr. Marcos had time to move money to accounts in Hong Kong and Switzerland and purchase real estate in the United States through shell corporations and people acting as fronts.
Meanwhile, the Abacha family was able to send stolen funds to the U.S., Britain and Austria, then transfer the sums to Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. In Britain alone, 23 banks handled the money. In Switzerland, 19 banks took deposits from Mr. Abacha's relatives and associates.
LESSON 2. BLUR THE AUDIT TRAIL
Put some distance between the money and its original source, via a series of convoluted financial transactions. This is where one is reminded of Somerset Maugham's quip about sunny places for shady people.
Sheik Fahad Mohammed Al-Sabah, a member of Kuwait's royal family, was part of an $800-million fraud while he was running his country's London-based Kuwait Investment Office until 1992.
Through Swiss, Island of Jersey and Liechtenstein shell companies, the money was moved to the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas and Jersey. The Sheik is now living in exile in the Bahamas and declared himself bankrupt while facing court efforts to recover the money.
In Macau, Ao Man Long, a corrupt public works official who amassed assets of more than $100-million, used companies registered in the British Virgin Islands to funnel in bribes into 39 Hong Kong bank accounts.
Some go even further - buying themselves their own bank.
Pavlo Lazarenko, Ukraine's prime minister from 1996 to 1997 who was accused of embezzling $200-million, purchased a majority share of an offshore bank in Antigua, European Federal Credit Bank, to help launder money.
But efforts to hide the money can fail.
Joshua Dariye, a corrupt state governor in Nigeria, initially stumped British investigators who were checking allegations that he took millions of dollars to the United Kingdom.
They found no trace of him in public records. But they discovered his children attended the exclusive Dean Close School in Gloucestershire. The tuition fees were paid by one Joyce Oyebanjo, a housing manager who, despite her modest job, managed $2.3-million spread among 15 bank accounts and $3-million in real estate, assets which were linked back to Mr. Dariye.
LESSON 3. BE READY FOR A WAR OF ATTRITION
Developing countries have limited resources, so recovering a former autocrat's stolen assets often turns into drawn-out legal battles as the relatives or heirs of the fugitive politician hire lawyers to keep their riches.
The new authorities in the dictator's country face several challenges when chasing the money. The assets have often moved to another continent. Forensic-accounting expertise is required. To investigate offshore accounts, requests for mutual legal assistance have to be submitted, and months pass before there is a reply.
"Every time money is transferred, it takes 10 minutes. The fund is in another jurisdiction. Then it takes three to six months to complete a request for mutual legal assistance," said Clive Scott, a legal adviser for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime who worked on the Lazarenko case.
As a result, more countries are turning to civil courts, where the burden of proof is lower, rather than lengthy criminal proceedings.
In 2007, Zambia successfully turned to the U.K. High Court to reclaim more than $46-million that former president Frederick Chiluba diverted to accounts in England, Belgium and Switzerland, in a trial full of juicy details such as the $1-million account Mr. Chiluba kept with a Geneva tailor's shop.
LESSON 4. BANK HAVENS ARE LESS WELCOMING
Traditional tax havens are increasingly mindful that sheltering dirty money is bad for their image.
Though Switzerland froze $356-million of the Marcos assets after his ouster in 1986, it took 12 years of litigation before the money was returned to the Philippines.
The process is more streamlined now.
Earlier this year, Switzerland adopted a new law enabling officials to seize suspicious assets without a request from a foreign country, which might not have the resources to pursue an investigation.
And anyone thinking of the Cayman Islands as a good place for dirty assets should be mindful that the local courts have been willing to implement requests for forfeiture of stolen money.
"Their reputation is at risk if they allow themselves to be used as repository for stolen money," Mr. Scott said.
"So even in the most active tax havens you will find increased surveillance and concerns."
****
Use legitimate banks.
It's not terribly difficult. Set up an investment, say, in a hotel chain. So when the dictator's nephew - whose name has 23 permutations in the English language - goes to deposit $300-million in a Swiss account with all the right supporting documents, no eyebrows will be raised.
Avoid public accountability
An open, accountable government does not make for an efficient kleptocracy. By gagging the press and beating the populace, dictators can literally drive the money out in trucks.
Keep a cadre of cronies to build loyalty
Associates are essential to help set up bogus accounts and act as fronts in shell corporations.
Invest offshore
Switzerland may no longer be the best bet, now that it has returned funds, but there are plenty of other willing governments: Panama, Britain and Liechtenstein, to name a few.
Pay bribes
Media, judges, cops and anyone else who could be a potential irritant must be greased. In Peru, large amounts had to be "invested" by Vladimiro Montesinos and Alberto Fujimori in bribing judges and media sources, to accomplish their looting.
Craft laws to suit one's banking
Employ a fixer or family member to make your investments.
Gives plausible deniability to any crimes and distances the money from the initial source.
Invest in legitimate businesses, both in developing and developed nations.
Have businesses invest in other businesses ... the more layers the better

WHAT TO GET THE COUPLE WHO HAS EVERY THING

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/what-get-couple-who-has-every-thing/docview/854100968/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Ms. [Kelly Hill] pointed all other guests toward a page on her wedding website where she had a PayPal link for invitees and friends to contribute to her and her fiancé's down payment fund. She also posted photos of a house they were eyeing. "People don't like the idea of putting money toward something when they don't have a visual picture of it in their heads," she says.

Full text: China patterns and fondue pots are out. Wedding gift money for wine, art, travel, renos, even down payments is in. DakshanaBascaramurty reports
Aileen Farrell and Eric Terrien don't need monogrammed Egyptian cotton towels.
Ms. Farrell, 25, and Mr. Terrien, 29, have been co-habitating for 10 months and plan to tie the knot in August in Ottawa.
Last fall, when Ms. Farrell, an administrative assistant and part-time ski racing coach, was setting up her wedding website, she stalled on the registry section.
She told her father, "This is so annoying. We're already living together. We have everything that you can think of."
He offered her a suggestion: registering at their bank.
She took his advice. On their wedding website, the couple have instructions to call their local TD Canada Trust branch to make a deposit directly to their joint savings account.
"We don't need the material stuff any more," Ms. Farrell says.
Instead, she's hoping to use cash contributions to renovate their basement or redo their backyard. She and her fiancé are also planning a second, more elaborate, honeymoon in 2012 for soccer's Euro cup in Poland.
Many soon-to-be-weds have dismissed the standard registry as stuffy, impractical and outdated. The contemporary set now register with travel agents to plan six-week escapes to Fiji. Others register at art galleries in hopes that wedding guests will help pay for a pricey painting.
Some wine connoisseurs even create registries to expand their cellared collection of vintage bottles.
"For many, many years, weddings were about the tradition of the wedding and marriage," says Lisa Cable, a wedding planner in Vancouver. "It's evolved more into the celebration of the unique lives of the couple."
Entrepreneurs have spotted great business opportunities in the alternative registry trend. Sites such as downpaymentdreams.com and ehoneymoonregistry.com have cropped up as channels for couples to collect cash gifts.
In January, Victoria real-estate agents Christina Carrick and Patricia Kiteke launched Home for the Honeymoon (homeforthehoneymoon.com), which they bill as Canada's first down-payment registry site.
Ms. Kiteke says many newlyweds she's worked with are interested in buying kid-friendly houses with yards rather than condominiums, but often need financial assistance from friends and family to make down payments.
A registry offers a socially acceptable way to ask for help, she says. And couples receive assistance from real-estate agents on purchasing a home. The company takes a 7-per-cent cut of guests' contributions.
Newlyweds Janine and Martin Evers set up a last-minute registry on the site two weeks before their January wedding and used the $10,000 worth of contributions to top up the $35,000 they had in hand to put a down payment on a $478,000 four-bedroom house in Edmonton.
"Paying that much more on your mortgage made a huge difference," Ms. Evers, a 30-year-old esthetician, says.
The shifting idea of the wedding registry fits with marriage trends. Canadians are marrying later and often shack up before they get hitched.
In 1972, the average ages for first marriages among Canadians was 22.2 for women and 24.7 for men, according to Statistics Canada. In 2004, it was 28.5 for women and 30.5 for men.
Co-habitation before marriage has also been on the rise in the past few decades. Though many common-law couples never marry, it's worth noting that in 1981, common-law unions made up 6 per cent of all families and in 2001, that figure rose to 14 per cent.
While today's engaged couples are happy to reject traditionalism, their families are not always receptive.
In Ms. Farrell's case, some thought her savings account registry was gauche. "My mom at first was a little taken aback when I told her ... she thinks it's a complete slap in the face to the idea of marriage."
To placate the traditionalists, she and her fiancé registered at Sears, Home Depot and Bed Bath & Beyond.
Kelly Hill, a 27-year-old social media marketing manager in Austin, Tex., was also forced to make a small conventional registry to appease her fiancé's grandmother, who "wanted to give a gift [they] could unwrap.
"We put up a thing at Pottery Barn and checked a bunch of things we didn't really need," she says.
Ms. Hill pointed all other guests toward a page on her wedding website where she had a PayPal link for invitees and friends to contribute to her and her fiancé's down payment fund. She also posted photos of a house they were eyeing. "People don't like the idea of putting money toward something when they don't have a visual picture of it in their heads," she says. They had only 56 guests at their February, 2010, wedding but pulled in more than $12,000, which they paired with the $5,800 they had in the bank to put toward a down payment. They purchased a house in November.
Sarah Shore, a principal planner at Dreamgroup Productions wedding and event planning in Vancouver, says couples can tell family and members of their wedding party to spread the word about alternative registries, or include a page on their wedding website.
While mentioning registries on invitations is a major no-no, Ms. Cable says, couples must find some way to communicate their wishes clearly to their guests.
A friend of hers recently married wrote, "No gifts, please" on her invitations in hopes that guests would instead give cash to use for a down payment on a house.
Most people didn't pick up on the subtext. Of the 150 guests who attended the wedding, only two brought gifts for the newlyweds - the others showed up empty-handed.

China gets tough on property speculators

Author: Wheeler, Carolynne

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/china-gets-tough-on-property-speculators/docview/853988881/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "I didn't understand how to invest in stocks. People can't simply follow what others do, can we? We can't do what we don't know," says Ms. [Luan], who is in her fifties. "Now everyone wants to squeeze into Beijing. How could Beijingers think of investing outside? Rational people won't invest in other cities, because who are you going to rent it to? Who is going to take care of it for you?"

Full text: As a lifelong Beijinger preparing for retirement, Luan Yanju followed the lead of thousands of other Chinese investors hoping to insulate themselves against volatile stocks and low-return bank accounts: She invested her savings in property.
Ms. Luan, who until two years ago worked for German car manufacturer Mercedes, acquired clothing stalls in three Beijing markets, and a second apartment in Miyun district just north of Beijing's city limits.
The market kiosks have paid off, their monthly rent tripling to approximately 30,000 yuan ($4,468) in the last five years, and now help to finance her daughter's studies in Canada. The second apartment, on the other hand, has become a suburban savings account - for now, a refuge from city traffic and pollution; in future, an asset against the proverbial rainy day.
"I didn't understand how to invest in stocks. People can't simply follow what others do, can we? We can't do what we don't know," says Ms. Luan, who is in her fifties. "Now everyone wants to squeeze into Beijing. How could Beijingers think of investing outside? Rational people won't invest in other cities, because who are you going to rent it to? Who is going to take care of it for you?"
This traditional form of investment for Chinese families is about to become much more difficult under a series of tough new government-imposed controls on the housing market.
Chinese officials have increased interest rates three times in the last four months and have ordered banks to tighten lending. Just before the Chinese New Year holiday early in February, the State Council raised the minimum down payment for purchases of second homes to 60 per cent, up from 50 per cent, and urged local governments to set price targets and cap the number of homes residents are permitted to own.
As a result, in Beijing, legally registered residents are now no longer permitted to buy more than two homes, while those without Beijing registration cannot buy property at all unless they can prove they have paid taxes there for five years.
In Shanghai, those without residency documents must pay taxes in the city for a year, and all second-time purchasers will now be subject to a new real-estate tax aimed at financing the building of affordable housing.
"We can see that the government is sending a strong message - houses should return to their basics, which is to be as a shelter by function, and not a vehicle for speculation," said Andy Zhang, managing director of the China operations for global real estate brokers Cushman & Wakefield. "Should these measures effectively squeeze out the bubble and curb speculation, demand for investment purchase will substantially shrink. As a result, sales volume in [the] mid- to high-end residential sector will decrease substantially."
At stake is whether speculators are driving real estate into a bubble which could collapse, deflating the Chinese economy, which has just overtaken Japan as the world's second largest. Officials are caught in a delicate balance between trying to keep inflation down and basics like food and housing affordable for the masses, while still maintaining China's impressive economic growth.
The World Bank has cited real estate crashes in Japan and Ireland as a warning to Chinese officials to rein in their finances. "China must carefully study the cases of Japan and Ireland, where the collapse of the real estate bubble caused a financial crisis and economic stagnation," the World Bank's chief economist Justin Yifu Lin told a Beijing University symposium recently.
Others put it more bluntly: "The history is pretty bleak. These things always create bubble situations and they always end badly," said Michael Pettis, a professor of finance in Beijing University's Guanghua School of Management, who warned the government's efforts may help in diverting excess liquidity from real estate, but that the fundamental problem remains. "I think it's going to be a long, slow deflation of the bubble rather than a burst - more stable, but more expensive in the long run."
The government's actions - and expected further regulation - have been received with reservation by the industry, which has been enjoying brisk business. The price of a new home in Beijing rose 6.8 per cent last month over the same period a year ago; remove government-subsidized housing from the calculation and the increase becomes 9.1 per cent, the highest in the country.
Properties in the new and booming Central Business District (CBD) in east Beijing, for instance, start at 50,000 yuan per square metre.
A typical three-bedroom property in CBD, considered an upscale area with many foreigners and wealthy Chinese, runs about nine million yuan ($1.34-million), or 90 times the average annual salary of a civil servant.
The average cost of a two-bedroom apartment along the more affordable Fourth Ring Road area - considered the edge of central Beijing - is three million yuan or $447,000.
"It's very, very expensive. Only very rich people can afford to live in this area," said Heather Liu, 36, a private real estate agent dealing in high-end properties in the city. Though she called recent price increases "unbelievable," she said she has already seen a slowdown in sales as clients find it harder to obtain mortgages.
"I think [this policy] is not welcomed by many families," Ms. Liu said. "But so many [are] investing in this market the prices were going crazy up. Maybe it will make prices go down a little bit."

The Action: Two weeks of market exposure was ample time for this two-storey house in Kitsilano to generate three competing offers, including one with $37,000 added on top of the list price.
What They Got: Set in the middle of a 37 by 122-foot lot, this 2,657-square-foot residence contains six bedrooms and several entertaining areas, including two guest suites and a family room in the 1,016-square-foot basement.
* The main floor was laid out with two bedrooms, a living room with a gas fireplace and a central kitchen overlooking a rear dining room with vaulted ceilings.
* The level upstairs houses two more bedrooms, including the master suite.
* To improve the condition of the 85-year-old property, the kitchen and all three bathrooms were stylishly remodelled, the insulation, wiring and plumbing were replaced and a new double carport was built in the fenced yard five years ago.
* Local attractions include parks and West Broadway shops, eateries and cafes.
The Agent's Take: "[It's] quite a unique property as it falls in between the 33- and 40/50-foot lots, and is shy of the high demand three-bedroom up product," says agent Marty Pospischil.
"It appealed to the offshore investor buyer, but more so the local Vancouver family buyer as well wanting a home in one of Vancouver's best neighborhoods to raise their family in."

When most people look at suburban intersections, they see malls, gas stations and parking lots. Cliff Korman sees potential.
The Toronto architect specializes in "greyfield" development. Greenfield developers build on farmland or other undeveloped space. Brownfield developers build on old industrial lands. Greyfield developers exploit the grey asphalt of suburbia. The aim is to unleash the value of underused suburban land, replacing parking lots, low-rise malls and sprawling warehouses with new apartment towers, office buildings and shopping streets.
Mr. Korman's firm, Kirkor architects, has its hand in 10 greyfield projects in the Toronto region. It's good for business at his company of just 62 employees, but it's even better for the city. By taking advantage of greyfields, he says, Toronto can reinvent its suburbs. His projects strive to bring urban vitality to barren suburban intersections by creating mixed-use "live, work, shop" development.
At Yonge and Sheppard, where a parking lot now stands, 45-storey and 37-storey towers mixing residential and office space will rise to create the new Hullmark Centre. Farther north near Steeles, another pair of glass-and-steel towers will go up at 7171 Yonge St., a mixed-use project incorporating two public parks.
Over at Don Mills and Steeles, Mr. Korman is hoping to replace a down-at-heel mall and big parking lot with a project that again mixes residential towers, parks and street-level shops. In an artist's conception, what is now a bit of a dead-zone becomes a lively new mini-community where people walk and take transit instead of being slaves to the car.
He says there are dozens of similar underused intersections in suburban Toronto with nothing but "acres of grey and a little strip of plaza - there's just miles of it." In one site developers are considering for intensification, a warehouse with 60 employees covers seven acres, a gross waste of urban real estate.
If you concentrate development at suburban nodes, "think of how many less roads you build, how many less sewer lines you build, how many less fire hydrants you need, how much less police and fire trucks you use. This is ultimately sustainable. We're talking a more sustainable world."
That kind of thinking has been conventional wisdom in city planning departments for years. The problem is getting local residents to go along. Many fear more intense development will worsen traffic and hurt real estate values.
Not true, says Mr. Korman, a fast-talking dynamo who darts in and out of the room to fetch sketches and plans. His projects are designed to discourage car use. Many incorporate bike lockers and auto-share spaces.
As for property values, "Let's get rid of one huge urban myth: A mixed-use intensified project is going to devalue my property. Forget it! Total opposite. All we do is value-up the neighbourhood. We're the top end of the market."
Governments stand to gain, too. In one project, property taxes are expected to rise to $5-million from $200,000, a windfall for the municipality, which will also rake in big development fees.
Even so, Mr. Korman spends countless hours soothing community groups, preparing detailed submissions to the Ontario Municipal Board and negotiating with politicians. "Local councillors," he says, "are elected to protect the status quo."
In the project at Don Mills and Steeles, there have been no less than 22 ratepayers meetings on the supposed horrors of a modest development, already much scaled back in height and density from a developer's original proposal. The local councillor won election by loudly opposing it.
Despite such hurdles, Mr. Korman is optimistic. After years of planning and design work, many of his projects, and others like them, are finally taking shape. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants are streaming into the city, many of them people who were accustomed to apartment living back home, who want to avoid the expense of a car and who like living where the action is - even if the action is at Dufferin and Sheppard instead of Queen and Spadina. "The city can absorb a million people, but you've got to have a plan," he says.
That plan has to include a remake of Toronto's neglected greyfields.

China's oil thirst sets risk for blazing economy

Author: Hoffman, Andy

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/chinas-oil-thirst-sets-risk-blazing-economy/docview/853823658/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Gasoline for China's rapidly expanding fleet of automobiles accounted for about 1.6 million barrels a day. Petrol demand is only expected to increase as Chinese consumers continue to purchase new vehicles. Auto sales in China jumped 53 per cent in 2009 and 33 per cent in 2010, cementing the country's position as the world's largest auto market. In January, 2011, auto sales increased 16 per cent year over year to 1.53 million units.

Full text: ASIA-PACIFIC REPORTER
During the waning months of 2010, demand for diesel fuel in China took a mysterious and unexpected spike.
The sudden increase in the need for the oil product left many experts perplexed. Why was the use of diesel, which had been relatively static for the entire year, suddenly soaring?
It turns out, the surge in demand was a paradoxical consequence of an ambitious environmental initiative. In a last-minute attempt to meet annual emission reduction targets, local government officials in scores of cities were reducing the amount of electricity available from the power grid. Officials cut off power supplies, hoping to sharply reduce the amount of pollution spewed by the country's hulking army of coal-fired electricity plants.
But instead of shuttering or reducing production, many Chinese companies fired up diesel-powered generators to keep their factories and businesses running at full capacity. This was the culprit for the sudden jump in diesel demand and a resulting supply shortage. When the amount of grid electricity available was restored, diesel use returned to normal levels.
China is the world's largest energy consumer, the second-biggest economy and the primary driver of the global economic recovery, making it particularly vulnerable to a potential oil price shock. Political upheaval in Libya and the Middle East pushed crude futures to their highest level in 2½ years this week, raising the spectre of a return to the $140 (U.S.) a barrel oil prices seen in 2008. Prices steadied Friday as top exporter Saudi Arabia moved to boost output to make up for any shortages due to Libya's turmoil.
Despite the pullback, few expect oil prices to decline significantly any time soon. And as the 2010 diesel shortage shows, China's world-beating economy is accompanied by an insatiable appetite for energy. An oil price spike could prove an economic turning point for the country, which is already grappling with rising inflation and a runaway real estate market in many of its largest cities.
Over the long term, rising oil prices could present a major issue for the Chinese economy, said Na Liu, a China strategist who is the founder of CNC Asset Management and an adviser on China strategy to Scotia Capital.
"I do think this is going to be a problem for China," Mr. Liu said.
The main drivers of oil demand in China "are highly unlikely to go lower if the economy continues to go higher. This is why oil is really important for the Chinese economy. The oil price spiking higher is either going to translate into slower economic growth in China or higher inflation and that is not desirable at this stage," Mr. Liu said.
Gasoline and diesel prices are set by China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), which raised fuel prices between 4 and 4.5 per cent this month in hopes of trimming demand and insulating Chinese refiners from the rising cost of crude.
"Excessively fast growth in oil consumption is exceeding the tolerance capacity of our country, economically and environmentally," the NDRC said on its website.
While motorists in Beijing are now paying far more than Americans for gasoline (about $4.28 a gallon, according to Reuters), demand is not expected to decline significantly. Fuel demand rose 12 per cent in China last year and Sinopec expects demand growth to average between 5 and 6 per cent over the next five years.
The potential for a petroleum price shock adds yet another troubling variable to the weighty challenges already faced by China's policy makers.
"The Chinese have lots of policy options but they are not necessarily good ones," Gordon Houlden, director of the University of Alberta's China Institute, said in an interview this week.
Coal remains the biggest source of energy production in China, but oil has also become a lifeblood for the country. Petroleum is a key component in everything from China's huge agriculture sector to the booming auto industry to the cheap plastic goods and the high-end electronics churned out by its thousands of factories for the export market.
Despite its own sizable domestic reserves, China has become increasingly dependant on foreign oil.
In December, 2010, China's total oil supply was about nine million barrels a day. Of that, 4.137 million barrels came from domestic sources and 4.869 million from net imports. Of the nine million barrels a day that China typically consumes, there are three main products that the oil is typically processed into: diesel, gasoline and naphtha.
Diesel fuel for trucks, tractors used in agriculture and generators accounted for about three million barrels a day in December. Diesel demand is expected to pick up again in March as the spring planting season gets under way.
Gasoline for China's rapidly expanding fleet of automobiles accounted for about 1.6 million barrels a day. Petrol demand is only expected to increase as Chinese consumers continue to purchase new vehicles. Auto sales in China jumped 53 per cent in 2009 and 33 per cent in 2010, cementing the country's position as the world's largest auto market. In January, 2011, auto sales increased 16 per cent year over year to 1.53 million units. Total vehicle sales jumped climbed 14 per cent year over year to 1.89 million units. Both numbers are record highs.
A largely overlooked segment of China's oil market is the refinement of petroleum into a product called naphtha which is used to produce ethylene. Ethylene is then used to make plastic and consumer goods. Naphtha accounted for 1.3 million barrels a day of the nine million barrels a day of China's oil supply in December.
In the short term, China appears well positioned to ride out a sudden oil price shock. Its commercial crude oil inventory was up 2.5 per cent at the end of January from the end of December and inventories of refined oil products jumped 11 per cent from a month earlier, according to the state news agency Xinhua.
Diesel stocks climbed 25 per cent and China Petroleum and Chemical Corp. (Sinopec) said in mid-February that its diesel stocks have surged 93 per cent from levels seen late last year when a occurred.
Still, firms like Sinopec, which buy crude at global prices and refine it for sale for the Chinese, market, would see profits squeezed in the event of a price spike. When oil soared to record levels in 2008, China's government moved to subsidize Chinese refiners to preserve profits.
With its deep-pocketed government coffers, China could certainly afford to offer such subsidies again. But as demands and promises for social services increase, corporate handouts are not as politically viable as they once were. On the other hand, if Sinopec and fellow refiners such as PetroChina see profits plunge, there would be an impact on Chinese and foreign investors and a negative effect on the broader economy.
And when the end of the year approaches, local government officials may again resort to their old trick of crimping electricity from the power grid - sending demand for diesel soaring.
If oil prices are much higher than they are now, the decisions made by municipal mandarins out of self-preservation will have dire consequences for both China and the rest of the world.
"We're all in this together," Mr. Houlden said. "Including China."

Abstract: I'm sure you've heard it said that "grey is the new beige." The way I see it, you can never go too wrong if you work your decor around a tried and true natural hue. Instead of simply grey, I've always gravitated to the oyster-toned shades of grey. With a slight hint of green and a touch of sand, the right grey for me is a changeable choice that alters with the light and the time of day.

Full text: A living room gets lively with a shot of style
srichardson@globeandmail.com
I've long been a fan of the century-old classic city row house. In its original form, the small rooms of a row house can feel tight and cramped. After undergoing the transformative process of a contemporary reno, however, these small spaces can become light and airy, with high ceilings and flexible space. Despite having solid side walls without any windows, there is usually a glass-panelled entry door and windows on both the front and back of the room, so they can be amazingly bright (with views to both the street and back garden from a single room).
While I'm a fan of the efficiency and opportunities presented by the row house vernacular, I'm also well-versed in the challenges of trying to squeeze all the needs of a family into one room. The key to decorating success here lies in having a master plan where all the elements complement one another and work seamlessly together. Any home designed for family living needs to be infused with a healthy dose of practicality, and all decisions need to be made with lifestyle and daily usage in mind. That said, there's absolutely no reason to sacrifice style just because you have little ones underfoot.
Start with the classics
The best budget-buster advice I have is to buy collectible classic furnishings. You need not pay high prices to secure stylish solutions with a mid-century mood. While teak furniture was previously viewed as strictly the domain of families with the last name Brady, or homes featuring an extensive installation of shag carpeting, teak is not just a time-warp design option any more. I gravitate to the refined proportions, the simple lines, and the restrained forms of vintage teak pieces. Diminutive in scale and executed with an eye on details and materials, teak is proving itself to be a contemporary classic well-suited to life in the 21st century. Often available at bargain prices in vintage and consignment stores, I suggest you take a second look at teak. I picked up a marble-topped coffee table for about $300, a pair of lamps for less than $200, and occasional chairs for under $350. With no need for refinishing, these finds kick-started my decorating project with fiscal frugality in mind.
Pick a cool neutral
I'm sure you've heard it said that "grey is the new beige." The way I see it, you can never go too wrong if you work your decor around a tried and true natural hue. Instead of simply grey, I've always gravitated to the oyster-toned shades of grey. With a slight hint of green and a touch of sand, the right grey for me is a changeable choice that alters with the light and the time of day. It will never feel too cold, yet it will prove itself to be an adaptable and flexible choice that naturally complements a wide range of accent colours, which can be used to add vibrancy and energy to you living quarters. As an added bonus, if you've embraced the warm-hued tones of teak, you'll find the cooler side of grey is a more flattering complement than old-school beige.
Seam it up
The key to flexibility with one long room is the choice of area rug. You can go custom and have a piece of broadloom cut and bound to your specific dimensions, but if you want to dress your floor with dynamic pattern, you'll need to find a new solution. Area rugs aren't generally offered in proportions that can be likened to a runway, so if the standard eight- by 10-foot or nine- by 12-foot options aren't making the cut, why not make the size you need from what's available? I found a funky eight- by 10-foot pale grey zebra-patterned pure wool rug and opted to have two of them sewn together along the 10-foot side to create a single 10- by 16-foot carpet that defined the living room. Including the cost to have the rugs sewn together, my total price was still far less than what you'd pay for any "palace-sized" carpet in existence.
Demand double duty
If you're suffering from the challenge of a living room that is overrun with toys and kid-related paraphernalia, you need to demand more from your furniture choices and embrace every opportunity to stash and stow the necessary trappings and accoutrements that come along with children. When buying side tables, try to find options with an additional shelf, select an entry console that also incorporates closed storage, and seek out innovative two-in-one options, like the upholstered stools I found that double as storage bins. Covered in a practical grey cotton/linen blend, these affordable ottomans make stashing toys an accessible solution to the clutter conundrum.
Let there be Lucite
I love to add a little glint of light and sparkle to every room. In a room predominated by wood and neutral greys, there's still opportunity for some glassy elements in unexpected places. While stainless and black iron may be the common choices for drapery rods, there are exciting alternatives to consider. Since we only had two windows to dress, I opted to splurge and spent about $100 per rod for clear acrylic rods. I know it's a small touch, but in every project it's the details that make the room work!
Illuminate your art
If you've got a keen eye and a decent quality digital camera, you can create illuminating artwork for your home. After flipping through a gallery of amateur shots taken by our client, I was inspired to turn a fabulous beach scene from a trip to Portugal into a backlit light box. With a click of my mouse, I'd sent the image off to be printed and mounted on Plexiglas, then visited my local lighting supply warehouse to pick up some slim-line fluorescent tube lighting kits that could be easily mounted within a shadowbox frame by my framer (if you're handy, you could make the frame yourself, but I chose to "seek professional help" with this one!). As soon as it was installed, our windowless wall was transformed into a glowing vista of a sunny European destination!
A few more 101 lessons:
The Save
All of my rooms balance a seamless combination of "high" and "low" elements, and this one is no exception. My practical nature demands that upholstery fabrics be chosen with spills and mishaps in mind, so I will always be a huge fan of durable, washable, inexpensive cotton twill. At $6.99 a yard for the sofa fabric, how can you possibly go wrong? When disaster inevitably strikes, the covers can simply be zipped off and tossed in the washing machine to return to their "as new" condition (this approach worked wonders when my two-year-old got into my purse one morning and experimented with mixing red lipstick and hand cream together on the cream sofa). I don't like my living room to be off limits, and washable fabrics ensure that there are no regrets. (I find that covers wash best when there's no piping, and it's always key to prewash and preshrink your fabric BEFORE you have the sofa made!)
The Splurge
With a teensy-weensy dining area that measured up at less than nine feet wide, our seating options were limited, to say the least. After fruitlessly trying a number of available solutions, I finally decided the only route was a custom choice. I looked to restaurant design for a viable solution and borrowed a page from the classic wraparound banquette commonly used to cram maximum guests into minimum space. By tucking an L-shaped banquette into one corner, it eliminated the need for circulation space around the table, and enabled us to create a dramatically beautiful dining destination. In my need to keep the budget balanced, I offset the cost of our custom splurge with a bargain pedestal table for less than $300!
The Signature Sarah
Even the sleekest, coolest spaces need a touch of texture. I automatically gravitate to the tactile beauty of handmade elements for the unique effect they bring to every home, and am always dreaming up ways to weave these hand-hewn wonders into contemporary spaces. One of my favourite discoveries of the last year is the amazing punctured brass hanging pendant that glows above the dining table. With a silvered exterior finish and golden interior, this intricately patterned fixture casts a delicate play of light on ceiling above, and gives the tried and true chandelier a run for the money when it comes to chic solutions.

Full text: 'The sky is the limit' for features in suites at The St. Thomas condo tower near Yonge and Bloor
Location: Bloor-Bay
Builder/developer: Minto
Size: 1,374 to over 6,000 square feet
Price: $1.6-million to over $8-million
Sales centre: 2 St. Thomas St., south of Bloor Street West. Open by appointment only.
Contact: 416-759-2222, www.theStThomas.com
Minto aims to give residents all the luxuries of an upscale hotel without having to share them with temporary guests and travellers at its new boutique condo in Yorkville.
Only 48 private suites will be created within the 23-storey condominium at the corner of St. Thomas and Charles streets.
"Our buyers are different from the Four Seasons [Hotel and Residences], where you're going to be with about 300 people," says Darcia Rowntree, vice-president of sales. "This is more exclusive and exquisite.
"It has all the services of a five-star hotel, and it's just for you."
This contemporary tower, which is evocative of historic residences in New York's Upper East Side, will be staffed with a doorman, valet, concierge and a hall porter.
Down the hall from the grand lobby, there will be dining, party and reading rooms, a catering kitchen and a wine lounge to store prized vintages or entertain guests.
The third floor will offer an indoor pool, gym and outdoor terrace, while the fourth floor will have two guest suites.
The building, surrounded by many attractions and amenities, is on a secluded, tree-lined street one block south of Bloor Street West - dubbed the Mink Mile - and many of the city's leading outlets for fashion, food, arts and culture.
Suite sizes and designs are varied with one-, two- and three-bedroom models available - ranging from 1,374 to more than 6,000 square feet - which has caught the interest of everyone from local luminaries to international buyers looking for a pied-à-terre.
"Other folks are downsizing from huge homes with [8,000] to 10,000 square feet," adds Ms. Rowntree. "They're attracted to the natural light coming in through floor-to-ceiling windows, our ceiling heights ... and lots of great walls for displaying their art because a lot have great collections."
Additional features include formal foyers, living and dining rooms, family rooms and eat-in kitchens with islands, as well as dens, libraries, laundry rooms and master suites with walk-in closets and private bathrooms.
Each unit will have spacious balconies with lights, water and gas hookups. "Some of them are the size of one-bedroom suites in Toronto," Ms. Rowntree says.
As an extension of the common areas, Brian Gluckstein will oversee the interior design of the suites, which will have hardwood floors, gas fireplaces and up to 12-foot ceilings, plus custom kitchen cabinetry and granite, marble or CaesarStone counters.
"The finishes are top of the line," Ms. Rowntree says.
Buyers accustomed to constructing or renovating their home can get full floor suites on the upper floors that will be raw spaces ready for customization by their designer of choice. "To get that is pretty unique," says Ms. Rowntree says. "The sky is the limit here."

Full text: He could have been Switzerland's problem. Instead, he went to Canada.
In 2008, Tunisian businessman Sakher el-Materi, a son-in-law of president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, tried without success to become a Swiss resident, a newly released diplomatic cable shows.
After being spurned by the Swiss in March of 2008, Mr. el-Materi bought a house in Montreal, where his wife, Nesrine, gave birth to a daughter, who gained Canadian citizenship.
Mr. el-Materi, 29, wanted to go to Switzerland to "facilitate his business interests in Europe" but Swiss and American diplomats had other suspicions, says a March 24, 2008, cable from the U.S. embassy in Tunis released by WikiLeaks: "Many Ben Ali critics remain on the lookout for signs he and his family are planning their ultimate - and profitable - departure from Tunisia."
It also said "there is some evidence that the Ben Ali family was moving more money into Switzerland, but perhaps less than into other European countries."
Since Mr. Ben Ali's ouster last month, the European Union has ordered a freeze on his assets.
Sources have told The Globe and Mail that the Ben Ali clan has between $10-million and $20-million in Canada. Switzerland and Belgium have confirmed they have locked tens of millions of dollars in assets linked to the former president and 47 of his relatives.
The 2008 cable says that, according to Swiss Ambassador Christian Faessler, Switzerland rejected Mr. el-Materi's application for residency "to send a signal about their frustration" at a year-long sit-in outside their embassy by a former Tunisian employee.
The former staffer was "reportedly fired for refusing to translate an article published in an opposition newspaper, which he said 'would be used to harm Tunisia's reputation.' "
The Swiss were convinced the man's protest was allowed to drag on because Tunisian authorities were upset that Swiss officials had criticized Mr. Ben Ali's government at a United Nations summit and met with opposition leaders.
Mr. el-Materi then tried to get a visitor's visa to Switzerland but was also turned down.
Five months later, he came to Canada, where another wealthy Ben Ali relative, the president's brother-in-law, Belhassen Trabelsi, had residency status since the 1990s.
In July of 2008, Mr. el-Materi bought a house in the posh Westmount enclave of the island of Montreal, handing over the full $2.5-million purchase price without resorting to a mortgage. Later that year, his wife gave birth to their second daughter there.
The couple also owned real estate in Paris, where they had incorporated a holding company, Societé civile immobilière NES . Anti-corruption watchdog groups say that SCI NES was used to purchase a four-storey heritage house in the affluent 16th arrondissement.
Mr. el-Materi's last visit to Canada was last month. On Jan. 13, he told local journalists he had just returned from Montreal where his wife was meeting a doctor because she was expecting again.
The next day, the Ben Ali regime fell. Mr. el-Materi and his family are believed to have fled to Qatar.

Full text: The last home the Potash CEO owned in the city was a 6,000-square-foot mansion on the river. Now it's a one-bedroom condo
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Bill Doyle is going down market.
After fending off accusations that that his company wasn't Canadian enough, the chief executive officer of Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. has become a property owner in the province again - part of the company's so-called "Pledge to Saskatchewan," made during its defence against BHP Billiton Ltd.'s hostile takeover bid. But this time, there is no mansion along the South Saskatchewan River for Mr. Doyle, who is one of Canada's wealthiest CEOs.
Instead, he has opted for a 1,000-square-foot condo in a 27-year-old building in Saskatoon, which he bought days after BHP's $38.6-billion deal was turned away by the federal government. The estimated value of the property: $308,000, according to the city's land titles registry.
The transaction allowed the Chicago native to stand before the Saskatoon's chamber of commerce last week and proclaim himself a citizen of the city, as he reiterated a series of promises to the provincial government that included the relocation of several senior executives from Chicago to Saskatoon by the end of March.
The pledge was made in October as the company waged a public relations battle with Australia-based BHP, and included a promise to hire more workers in the city as well as continue donating to local causes. It helped secure an ally in Premier Brad Wall, who became the harshest critic of the takeover.
While the city's tax registry states that Potash Corp. is responsible for the property taxes, senior director of corporate and government relations Tom Pasztor said the money is coming out of Mr. Doyle's pockets.
Mr. Doyle earned $9.6-million in 2009, including stock and options, according to Potash's most recent annual report.
"Because he travels 200 days a year, he pays in advance, and he does that by paying the money to his secretary," Mr. Pasztor said. "Whether it's taxes, phone or cleaning he doesn't want to come back to the condo and find himself in arrears. It just works out best to stay on top of his bill payments this way."
Mr. Doyle first needed a place to live in Saskatoon in 1999. He had just been appointed CEO of Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, and agreed with the company's board when it suggested he could better do the job if he moved from Chicago. He built a 6,000-square-foot mansion on the banks of the South Saskatchewan.
His residency didn't last, however, as he moved his family back to the more familiar Chicago within a few years - a decision that remained a sore point for years with provincial politicians. He has kept a rental in Saskatoon since then, the company said.
This time, his ambitions were scaled down - rather than finance another massive residential project, he bought the comparatively small condo to live in while he's in Saskatoon. Given his heavy travel schedule and the fact that his three children are grown, Mr. Pasztor said, the condo made sense.
The sale was conducted privately, so it was not listed on the Multiple Listing Service. The deal closed in mid-November. The last time the condo was sold through the MLS - in 2000 for $114,900 - the condo was described as an "immaculate eighth floor unit overlooking the Saskatchewan River ... very bright unit, with a living room large enough for a hide-a-bed."
Mr. Doyle's former Saskatoon home - with six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, a wine room and multilevel terraces leading down to the river - sold in 2004 for $2-million at a time when the average home was changing hands for just over $100,000.
Saskatoon has been one of the hottest real estate markets in the country over the last decade. ReMax reported recently that house prices increased 9.2 per cent on an annually compounding basis over the last decade, as the province's resource boom fuelled strong economic growth.
"Investors should return to [Saskatoon] in increasing numbers next year, snapping up well-priced condominium and single-family properties," the brokerage said in its 2011 outlook.
The city's housing market is still relatively inexpensive compared with other Canadian cities, with the average resale price hovering around $301,000 in January. The national average was closer to $350,000, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association.

What little girls' rooms are made of

Author: Richardson, Sarah

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/what-little-girls-rooms-are-made/docview/852638001/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Once you've landed on that first vision for the room, it's time to fill in the blanks and add the rest of the fabrics. From upholstery to window coverings, bedding to accessory pillows, there's still plenty of room to add more to the mix. I like a loosely layered mix of fabrics that connect with each other, but don't necessarily "match" perfectly.

Full text:   Let the unbridled energy of children guide your design
srichardson@globeandmail.com
What could be more fun than decorating a pair of bedrooms for three bubbly little bundles of energy? Not much, in my books!
Harnessing the joy, happiness and unbridled energy of little kids and transforming it into rooms that embrace their lively spirit is always a fun adventure for a designer.
When you strip away the grownup need for poise and polish, the decorating adventure takes on a purely lighthearted spirit, fuelled by the desire to create a cozy, happy nest that stimulates the imagination and celebrates the freedom of being a child. So, get ready for a colour-me-happy adventure in decorating.
Start small
I believe in looking for inspiration in unexpected places, and have been known to build entire room schemes from unusual sources. In this case, it all started with a trip to the boho chic mecca of fashion and home, Anthropolgie. If you are a fan of pattern and detail, I challenge you to resist the delicate feminine charm of this cool retail environment! It wasn't long before I'd zoned in on a collection of charming tea towels embellished with lighthearted patterns, crocheted trim and embroidered details. With a wide variety of colours and styles, I knew I was on the path to a scheme (or two). I'd never made the connection before, but a tea towel and a standard bed pillow are roughly the same size. A quick measure of my new find revealed that I could quickly and easily seam a lowly kitchen towel into a quirky and fun pillowcase to fit a 20- by 26-inch pillow for a twin bed. Instead of starting in the bedding department, perhaps you need to take your cart on over to the kitchen aisle to kick-start the creative process?
Create a patchwork of pattern
Once you've landed on that first vision for the room, it's time to fill in the blanks and add the rest of the fabrics. From upholstery to window coverings, bedding to accessory pillows, there's still plenty of room to add more to the mix. I like a loosely layered mix of fabrics that connect with each other, but don't necessarily "match" perfectly. Using my inspirational tea towels as a guide, I combed the selections from both upholstery and garment district stores in search of easy-care cottons with happy colours and friendly price points. There are plenty of lovely, durable fabrics to be had for less than $20 a yard. Since I like a multitude of patterns, combinations are key, such as polka dots banded in solid for a bed skirt, and a large damask motif accented with a different dot for drapes. My approach to the mix is much like the way that little girls dress themselves ... it's often a cacophony of patterns that defies the rules of fashion, yet looks fun and adorable when presented as a fully realized statement.
Go custom on a DIY budget
Small, shared rooms can be tricky to furnish since every inch and every dollar counts. While the vertical efficiency of bunk beds is appealing, I find the extra height dominates the room, so I devised an alternate built-in bed that would accommodate two kids on one even plane, while giving each their own space to cozy up.
Have no fear; you can still execute a successful DIY project without a full suite of power tools. If you measure thrice (twice is never enough), and plan out your installation, you can have your materials precut at your local big box store, then simply install them at home with a drill (okay, it also helps to have a saw in case your measures need a bit of adjusting). I used shelves on edge as the supports for the underside of the bed (at 12 by 36 inches there was no trimming needed), then had two slabs of plywood cut to fit the standard size of a twin mattress, attached two-by-four boards to the outside wall to support the bed platform, and dressed the cut edge of the plywood and shelves with pre-primed window casing profiles. For $200 in supplies, I was able to create one cool bed to fit two cool kids.
Get online for innovative art
Forget pounding the pavement in search of the right art to dress up your little ones' room. Let your fingers do the walking and enjoy the online adventure. I discovered animal cutouts made from vintage wallpaper. Eliminate the need to invest additional dollars in framing, and celebrate the fact that these exotic critters simply require a bit of wallpaper paste (included with the purchase) to affix them to the wall. From elephant to giraffe, lion to alligator, there's an animal to appeal to your little tiger!
A few more 101 lessons:
The Save
Kids are little beings, but boy, they've got a lot of stuff to store! By the time they start asserting their independence, the amount and variety of possessions grows exponentially, so I think it's important to get as much storage as you can out of every piece. On a regular jaunt to one of my standby sources for all things used and inexpensive, I discovered a pair of French Provincial style side tables for a mere $65. If the original finish of your found item doesn't suit your colour palette, it's time to get out the paint and embrace my favourite R word ... Reimagine!
The Splurge
If you're spending money on new broadloom, you need to think about how you can get more from your floor. Forget about standard solids and classic cut pile and look to your floor covering as a way to introduce colour and pattern to the mix. Lucky for me, I landed on pure wool, striped broadloom with a rainbow of colours that tied perfectly to the schemes in the two bedrooms. Patterned options will run at least $2 more per square foot than solids, but if you're covering a small area, it's a small up charge to achieve a great overall look.
The Signature Sarah
Paint it, paint it and paint it! Some leave no stone unturned, and I leave no surface unpainted. Every wall, ceiling, and piece of furniture opens the door to the possibility of utilizing yet another beautiful colour. Whether your look is tone-on-tone muted or high-contrast colour, layering different hues is an effective way to tie all the elements together.

Abstract: This ETF, which was formerly known as iShares S & P/TSX Income Trust ETF, was overhauled late last year so that it is now similar to a balanced mutual fund, in addition to producing a monthly income stream. It invests in nine other iShares ETFs, such as iShares S & P/TSX 60, iShares S & P/TSX Capped REIT and iShares DEX Hybrid Bond ETFs. The manager changes the asset allocation depending on the market environment so it's a "set it and forget it" fund for investors, he said.

VIKASH JAIN
Portfolio manager with archerETF Portfolio Management
iShares S & P/TSX Capped REIT
This ETF, which invests in 13 real estate investment trusts, is attractive for income seekers, Mr. Jain said. "This ETF offers a great yield at just over 5 per cent. Add in an expected capital appreciation of about 3 to 5 per cent, and total return should be near 10 per cent for the year." As the economy recovers, revenue of the REITs should rise, while dividends should stay steady and possibly grow, he added. While four names - RioCan, H & R, Canadian REIT and Calloway - make up 54 per cent of this ETF, the overconcentration is not a concern because "they are fairly major companies in a stable sector," he said.
Vanguard Emerging Markets ETF
This ETF holds more than 800 stocks, with five countries - China, Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan and India - making up 65 per cent of the weighting. Because China is now the world's second-largest economy, and emerging markets are outpacing the developed world in terms of growth, long-term Canadian investors should have emerging markets exposure, he said. "This ETF is a bargain at just 0.27 per cent in fees ... . While this ETF trades in U.S. dollars, its real currency exposure is to the various emerging market currencies, most of which should strengthen over time."
JOHN GABRIEL
ETF strategist with Morningstar Inc.
iShares Diversified Monthly Income ETF
This ETF, which was formerly known as iShares S & P/TSX Income Trust ETF, was overhauled late last year so that it is now similar to a balanced mutual fund, in addition to producing a monthly income stream. It invests in nine other iShares ETFs, such as iShares S & P/TSX 60, iShares S & P/TSX Capped REIT and iShares DEX Hybrid Bond ETFs. The manager changes the asset allocation depending on the market environment so it's a "set it and forget it" fund for investors, he said.
Claymore S & P/TSX Canadian Dividend ETF
This ETF, which invests in companies that have raised dividends for five consecutive years, reduced its securities to 39 from 56 at the end of last year.Holding this ETF means owning quality companies, he said. "Companies paying dividends and raising them consecutively for five years are not companies that fall by the wayside."
TYLER MORDY
Director of research, Hahn Investment Stewards & Co.
WisdomTree LargeCap Dividend Fund
It invests in 300 high-dividend-yielding U.S. large-cap stocks, with 30 per cent in the consumer staples and health-care sectors. Top names include AT & T, Exxon Mobil, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. Multinationals can weather the current economic climate better because of brand recognition, pricing power and revenue from fast-growing foreign markets, Mr. Mordy said.
WisdomTree Emerging Markets Local Debt Fund
The ETF invests in sovereign debt denominated in local currencies of emerging market countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia and Mexico. The debts of such countries are "likely to do better than developed world counterparts given more fiscally sound government balance sheets and improving credit quality," he said. "Yields are also higher, with the additional return prospect of currency appreciation."
DEBORAH FRAME
Vice-president of investments, Cougar Global Investments
Vanguard Emerging Markets ETF
This ETF of 887 companies "gives broad exposure to the emerging markets," which are expected to dominate global growth, Ms. Frame said. "The United States is going to continue to have its challenges ... . We expect emerging markets to have a better return than the Canadian stock market this year." This ETF has an attractive fee of 0.27 per cent, but it is also denominated in U.S. currency. "You also have to make a call on whether you feel comfortable being exposed to U.S. dollars," she added.
iShares Dow Jones Canada Select Dividend Index Fund
This ETF, which holds 30 companies, is dominated by Canada's seven largest banks, but about 14 per cent is also invested in the resource sector, she said. Canadian financials will continue to do well because the domestic banks are sounder, and are recovering more quickly than their counterparts around the globe, she added. "We think emerging markets is going to continue to be the best asset class [this year], so our exports of oil and gas, as well as materials, are also going to do better because of that."

Full text:   After years of being overlooked in favour of Toronto and Vancouver, investors are rediscovering the city
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
When Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. decided to sell its Montreal headquarters, pessimists may have wondered who would want to invest in an older building outside the downtown business district.
But after years of being overlooked in favour of Toronto and Vancouver, investors are rediscovering Montreal, once the centre of Canada's financial industry. The city's burgeoning technology sector, along with established aerospace and pharmaceutical industries, have helped to push down office vacancies and send rents higher for the first time in years.
Despite stubborn unemployment (8.2 per cent in January, compared with 7.8 per cent nationally), and rental rates that are as much as $10 a square foot less than Toronto and Vancouver, Montreal's real estate market is on the verge of expansion. For the first time since 1992, private developers are staking claim to sites and aggressively seeking the anchor tenants they need to build new office towers.
CB Richard Ellis is to announce Wednesday that the Imperial Tobacco building has been sold to real estate investor Groupe Mach Inc. for $24-million, in a sale-leaseback deal that will see the tobacco giant remain as the primary tenant of the building.
"Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of the transaction was the depth of interest shown by local and non-local institutional investors for a non-core, value-add investment opportunity at low initial yields," said CBRE executive vice-president Brett Miller.
There were 979 commercial real estate deals in Montreal in 2010, CBRE said, worth $2.9-billion. That was a 52-per-cent increase over 2009, and tied the city for second place, by dollar volume, with Vancouver, despite having several hundred fewer deals.
The interest is stoked by renewed life in the leasing market. In the fourth quarter, more than 224,000 square feet in Montreal were absorbed by tenants after a year of increasing vacancies. Cushman Wakefield estimates overall vacancy rates at 9.2 per cent, but said almost 500,000 square feet of space is likely to be leased in 2011.
The national average vacancy rate was 8.6 per cent at the end of the year, according to Avison Young.
Montreal's skyline could also see new towers within the next several years: Six office towers have been approved by the city and are ready to start construction, but none will break ground until an anchor tenant signs a lease. The developers are keen to draw new tenants to Montreal.
The most recent project came last week when the real estate arm of the Caisse de depôt et placement du Quebec said it would partner with a private developer to build a 477,000-sq.-ft. office tower in the downtown core.
Established companies may also decide to build new sites as they expand, or look to renovate existing facilities. Rio Tinto Alcan, for example, said last week that it is exploring partnering with a builder rather than spending up to $50-million to expand its existing downtown campus.
"You are finally starting to see rents go up, and the pricing on new construction is beginning to look justifiable," said Louis Burgos, senior managing director at Cushman Wakefield.
Avison Young's Quebec chairman Stephen Leopold said the city is on the cusp of reinventing itself as a major producer of green energy, and its "undervalued" properties are key to its future.
"There is a real sense of optimism that is starting to bubble beneath the surface of the new Montreal," he said. "The new Montreal is an awakening lion. We are the second largest city in Canada and have the western world's most unlimited supply of renewable energy. You don't need a PhD to figure out what this will mean to Montreal's new economy and its real estate prospects."

Sunshine for a song

Abstract: Jamie Golombek, managing director of tax and estate planning at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, agrees that speculators need to be more cautious. "If you're using it for personal use, then I think the resale potential is not as important," he says. "No one wants to lose money, but if you're really buying it because you're going to enjoy it with your family - then if you find something you like and it's a reasonable price range, and interest rates are low if you need to...

Full text:   The numbers are as good as they get - our dollar is high, and prices and interest rates in the U.S. are low. But should you buy south of the border? Experts insist it's still a gamble
The resurgence of the loonie and continued degradation of U.S. home prices are spurring more Canadians to invest in property below the border.
But while this might appear an opportune time to snatch up a retirement home or vacation property, experts warn that jumping into these major purchases without doing extensive research is a recipe for disaster.
The list of things to consider before buying in the United States is long, ranging from estate taxes to property maintenance to insurance.
"There are lots of things that most people don't think about," says Laura Parsons, a mortgage expert with Bank of Montreal. "I know quite a few people who went into the market in the U.S. without a lot of knowledge about what that means."
First and foremost, experts caution that speculative investments in U.S. real estate continue to be a roll of the dice.
"If you are buying a recreational property for personal use, [the situation now is] probably about as good as it gets," says Bob Gorman, chief portfolio strategist at TD Waterhouse, noting that the dollar is high, prices are low, and interest rates are low for those who need financing. "I draw a distinction, though, for those people who ask me about buying for investment purposes, who are not going to use it themselves."
A key reason is real estate prices. As low as they've sunk, it's still possible they could sink lower. And even if they don't, no one expects them to bounce back quickly.
As a result, speculators who might be thinking of investing in a place to rent or flip might be wise to hold off. "We're not quite sure it's the bottom, and there's no rush because once it does hit bottom it's going to stay pretty flat for an extended period of time," says Sam Sivarajan, head of private wealth management in Canada for UBS.
High levels of unsold homes are overhanging the market, Mr. Gorman said. Historically, the number of homes for sale at any given time in the U.S. has been equal to about fourth months worth of sales. Right now, it's closer to 10.
But that hasn't been scaring away investors, who accounted for 19 per cent of purchases in November of 2010, up from 12 per cent one year earlier.
Jamie Golombek, managing director of tax and estate planning at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, agrees that speculators need to be more cautious. "If you're using it for personal use, then I think the resale potential is not as important," he says. "No one wants to lose money, but if you're really buying it because you're going to enjoy it with your family - then if you find something you like and it's a reasonable price range, and interest rates are low if you need to borrow money, and the dollar's relatively high - then you may want to consider it."
In other words, favourable conditions or not, it's still a gamble, but one that might be worth it for a property you will enjoy and would love to own.
For those thinking of taking the chance, one of the first considerations should be taxes. Be aware that in some jurisdictions property taxes for foreigners are higher than for local residents. If you rent the property out, the rental income could be subject to withholding tax. A key consideration for wealthier individuals will be estate taxes.
New tax rules increase the exemption on U.S. estate taxes to $5-million, which essentially means that Canadians who are not U.S. citizens and who have a worldwide estate that's worth less than $5-million don't have to worry, says Mr. Golombek.
Those who have more than $5-million can minimize estate taxes by planning before buying. They might buy the property using a Canadian trust or partnership, for example.
"It's really important to get advice before you buy," Mr. Golombek says. "I would approach a U.S. tax adviser in particular, or a Canadian adviser who specializes in cross-border issues. This may not be the regular accountant who does your tax return; chances are it won't be, but hopefully that person can refer you to a specialist."
Another thing to think about is the amount of your total assets that you want to allocate to real estate. A recent survey by the Royal Bank of Canada suggests that Canadian millionaires tend to have about 15 per cent of their assets in real estate (12 per cent for those with more than $5-million of investable assets).
Insurance is another item for the pre-purchase checklist, especially in hurricane-prone areas, Mr. Gorman says.
Sherry Cooper, Bank of Montreal's chief economist, has another tip if the property is to be a vacation home: check the price, availability and frequency of flights from Canada. "Where we are they fly direct only in the winter, and that's fine with us," says Ms. Cooper, who has a rental property, a vacation property and a property for her mother in Florida.
Ms. Cooper knows first hand that property is not always a liquid investment: she bought a small condo in Florida about eight years ago when her mother wanted to start spending winters there. Ms. Cooper later bought another property for her mom but found that she couldn't unload the first condo. "It was on the market for six months. I cut the price a few times, but never even got a single offer," she says.
But, she adds, prospective buyers can take heart in the fact that she has found a steady supply of renters. "I listed it on Craigslist and two sites for vacation property rentals and I was overwhelmed with requests. And on Craigslist I got someone who rents it 12 months a year."
For those like Ms. Cooper who do make the splash, Mr. Golombek suggests considering a separate will dealing just with that U.S. property. "It's a lot simpler for your executor to deal with a will in, for instance, Florida, with Florida rules than trying to have it dealt with in Ontario," he says.
And, no matter how much preparation you do and professional advice you seek, be prepared for the unexpected.
As one of Ms. Parsons' acquaintances discovered, a new climate can lead to surprises. "I would never have thought that you have to put Saran Wrap on your toilets to keep the water from evaporating," Ms. Cooper says. "They actually have to have neighbours come in and flush the toilets, because it can affect the pipes."

What's the state of real estate in the U.S.? Be prepared for a long, drawn out recovery, advises Bob Gorman, chief portfolio strategist at TD Waterhouse. He offers these figures:
Prices are flat-lining
The 20-city S & P Case-Shiller home price index was down 0.8 per cent for the year ending Oct. 31, suggesting that prices are flat-lining.
Cities where home prices fell
Miami, Tampa, Atlanta, Charlotte, Portland and Seattle.
Cities where home prices rose
Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Washington.
One-third distressed
Thirty-three per cent of homes sold in November were distressed properties, roughly the same percentage as one year earlier.

Abstract: Once a neighbourhood's redevelopment is close to being finished, that's a sign it has become a more mature area and will only increase at an average rate. It's important to "get in front of the tractors," Mr. [Don Campbell] says.

It may be ironic for an author of real estate tips books to advise people not to act on tips, but Don Campbell is adamant that buyers do their groundwork before they invest in the next housing "hot spot."
"I have seen too many people buy a property based on what someone tells them, rather than do their own homework," says Mr. Campbell, president of the Real Estate Investment Network. "This leads to disaster so many times."
If you've heard that a certain neighbourhood is poised for growth, that's just the first step, he says. Before you invest a dime, you need to verify the information. Read the minutes of council meetings, ask local politicians whether the leadership is focused on bringing new jobs and growth to the area, and check for a written renewal plan at the municipal planning department.
"You can actually see what's coming if you get one of those reports on the neighbourhood," Mr. Campbell says. "You just have to have patience, like most investors should."
Before you buy, drive around the neighbourhood, he advises. Look for renewed signs of pride of ownership that weren't there before - a sure sign that renewal is under way.
Other tips for getting the best return for your real estate investment:
Look for transit improvements
If you want to buy in an area that will increase more than average in value, choose a neighbourhood with a major transportation improvement occurring nearby. The demand for such properties is always strong, even when market conditions turn sour. Also, think about who the target buyer will be when you sell the property and whether there are amenities nearby to attract such a buyer.
Check the zoning
Don't buy a property hoping to convert it into something else without finding out how it is zoned. Check with the planning department to find out whether there are any zoning changes pending.
Don't buy too early
Governments announce a lot of things, especially around election time, but not all projects pan out, Mr. Campbell says. "Watch for the tractors and watch for the diggers, and that'll give you a big indication that they're at least committed to getting this project going."
Don't buy too late
Once a neighbourhood's redevelopment is close to being finished, that's a sign it has become a more mature area and will only increase at an average rate. It's important to "get in front of the tractors," Mr. Campbell says.
Buy used
Many renewal projects involve knocking down old buildings and putting up condo towers and trendy shops. Rather than buying into the new condo building, buy an older home in the surrounding neighbourhood, Mr. Campbell says. You'll see a bigger bump in the value of your property than with a new condo that everyone is lining up to buy.
Consider renting
Sometimes when you're buying a house to live in it's not the ultimate investment spot, but you may need to live there because of its proximity to your work. In such a case, consider renting your accommodations. If you can afford it, buy another property with more growth potential as an investment.
Consider the demographics
Is the area's average income increasing faster than the provincial average? What about population and job growth? If these figures are above average, chances are good that property values will see higher-than-average growth. You can research a region's demographics by looking at studies done by Statistics Canada, provincial government economic departments and local economic research firms.
Don't get carried away
You want a fair price. If you get emotionally attached to a house, you might talk yourself into overpaying for the property, Mr. Campbell says. Similarly, if you get caught up in a bidding war, it's easy to get swept up in what he calls the "I'm going to win this" mentality and spend more than you should.

Full text:   While The Globe's Eric Reguly washes down his pork chop and fried potatoes with Scotch, one of Russia's richest and most powerful magnates picks away at cake while sipping his tea. 'Call me Oleg,' says the man who sits atop a sprawling empire that straddles just about every sector
Oleg Deripaska, the Russian billionaire who is said to be Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's favourite industrialist, has gone unshaven for at least three days. He is in grey training pants, a white T-shirt and a dark blue fleece. His nine-year-old son Peter and the family's Labrador retriever, Leo, scurry about. It is 10:30 at night and Mr. Deripaska is relaxed - that is, as relaxed as anyone with 240,000 employees, an empire that nearly collapsed two years ago and a frisky dog trying to drag the table cloth (and all the plates with it) onto the floor can be.
We are in the Deripaska family chalet about 20 kilometres outside of Moscow. A small ski hill next to the chalet is floodlit, exposing a few of the security guards who are an eternal presence in his life. Mr. Deripaska flops onto one of the cushy, low-slung chairs, orders tea from the kitchen staff and invites me to call him Oleg.
The bookshelves are laden with classic Russian novels and books on modern Japanese design - Mr. Deripaska loves Tokyo. Peter, who speaks English with a British accent (he and his sister share a British nanny) is showing us how Leo can dance on his hind legs. His father laughs. "Very intelligent dogs, Labradors," he says.
The modern chalet is big but not ostentatious. "I am not in Aspen, I live in Moscow," he says in an English that has improved markedly since I last interviewed him in his Moscow office three years ago.
Since then, the oligarch has fought for his survival. The financial crisis shredded the value of his holdings, a collection of 100 companies built over just a dozen years as he rose from metals broker to industrial baron. And he might well have lost it all in 2008 if not for his close ties to the Kremlin.
Exactly how Mr. Deripaska managed to save Rusal - the aluminum company that was the main source of his wealth - and other investments, is still a matter of debate. Certainly he won a standoff with foreign creditors, but some think he would be dead and buried without a little help from his political friends, who evidently had no desire to see his investments seized by non-Russians. When his fortunes turned desperate in the bleakest months of the crisis, Mr. Deripaska's long-standing record of plowing his fortunes back into Russia, no doubt helped his cause; some of his fellow oligarchs chose instead to acquire overseas trophy assets like American and British sports teams.
Because he knows I am Canadian, he tells me how Peter has developed a passion for Canadian maple syrup. I wonder where he gets the stuff and before I can ask, he explains that his son was given a load of syrup by Barrick Gold chairman Peter Munk. The booty formed part of the cargo of Mr. Munk's yacht and was transferred to the Deripaskas' in Montenegro, where the two billionaires are developing a superyacht marina. As it turns out, maple syrup is not the only bit of Canadiana on Mr. Deripaska's mind. Two others are the Vancouver Olympics and Hydro-Quebec.
Mr. Deripaska visited Vancouver (and attended the Russia-Canada hockey playoff) to get ideas for his developments at Sochi, the southern Russian town that will host the 2014 winter Olympics. Hydro-Quebec might hold the key to his global hydroelectric ambitions. He told me he leaves Sunday for Montreal to discuss a possible partnership. "They have knowledge and expertise," he says. "We're looking for a partner to build new hydro plants."
Winning the aluminum crown
The dining table is covered with cakes and fresh fruit that are rare treats in frozen Russia: Pomegranates, strawberries, blueberries, grapes, oranges and small, sweet apples that were grown on Mr. Deripaska's farm. I wolf down a pork chop and fried potatoes and sip on Scotch. He sticks with tea, ignores the fruit and half-heartedly tackles a piece of cake.
Mr. Deripaska is 43, tall, slim and in good shape, thanks, apparently, to a careful diet and sporadic, though vigorous, bouts of cross-country skiing. With his stubble beard and close-cropped hair, he looks more like one of his security guards than the owner of Russia's most diversified industrial group, Basic Element , whose holdings range from uranium mines to Gaz , the car and truck maker that recently struck a deal with General Motors to produce small Chevrolets in Russia.
There are more than 100 other companies in the empire, almost all of them private, in a bewildering array of industries. They include hotels, airports, defence and banks.
Mr. Deripaska has a business that makes log cabins and another that publishes the Russian edition of Hello! magazine. Last year, the group's total revenues (unaudited) were $24.2-billion (U.S.).
In spite of his wealth - Forbes magazine last put it at about $11-billion, down from a pre-crisis peak of $28-billion - Mr. Deripaska is not conspicuously flashy like many of the oligarchs.
Roman Abramovich collects superyachts like so many bathtub toys, owns Britain's Chelsea football club and just forked out £50-billion ($79-billion) for Spanish striker Fernando Torres.
Suleiman Kerimov has a penchant for Ferraris, one of which he crashed in 2006, nearly burning him alive. Mikhail Prokhorov, the gold baron who loves to play basketball, owns the New Jersey Nets.
That is not to say that Mr. Deripaska deprives himself.
His 73-metre, six-deck yacht, the Queen K, is a regular visitor to the Mediterranean's most glamorous resorts. He shuns hotels wherever he can. Instead, he buys properties in the places he frequents: Tokyo, London, Montenegro, among others. Mr. Deripaska is shy and strives to avoid publicity, to the point he doesn't publicize his numerous charities, which have doled out $250-million (U.S.) over the last decade, largely to education projects.
He is lucky he can play his own version of global Monopoly, for he came close to losing it all in the 2008 financial crisis.
Mr. Deripaska was born in Krasnodar, in Cossack country's tea-growing region in the far south of Russia. He was drafted into the Soviet army, became an accomplished physics and math student and went on to study nuclear physics at Moscow State University. Graduating just as the old Soviet Union was giving away to the new, raw capitalist Russia, he like many of his contemporaries went into business instead of state research.
He became a metals broker and emerged as the big winner of the so-called aluminum wars of the 1990s. The details are murky. What is known is that there were nasty bouts of violence. Mr. Deripaska often slept in his Siberian smelters so he could monitor their production during those turbulent years. Today Rusal is the biggest single source of his wealth. The company, floated on the Hong Kong exchange last year, is 47.4-per-cent owned by Mr. Deripaska, has a market value of about $25-billion and owns 25 per cent of Norilsk , the world's biggest nickel maker.
In 2007 he was on top of the world, only to learn that leverage cuts both ways. The crisis crippled his real estate, manufacturing and auto businesses. Gaz alone blew out 50,000 workers (though has since rehired 15,000). A margin call deprived him of his $1.5-billion stake in Canadian auto parts company Magna International and he had to unload his stake in Strabag , the Austrian construction giant that is building infrastructure for the Sochi Olympics (he has since bought back into Strabag).
When aluminum prices collapsed in the autumn of 2008, Rusal breached its covenants and seemed certain to become a ward of the international cadre of banks that had stuffed Rusal with $7.4-billion in loans.
Mr. Deripaska used a combination of tough negotiations and clever gamesmanship to keep control of Rusal. He bet correctly that the banks would have no interest in owning and managing a massively complicated company, whose supply chain extends from alumina operations in Jamaica to Siberian hydropower plants. "The deal was very simple," he says. "We never tried to screw the banks. I said 'You keep the debt and I will manage the company and deliver for you.'"
Another interpretation is that he owes Rusal's salvation to his impeccable government connections (he is married to the daughter of the chief-of-staff to former president Boris Yeltsin). Kremlin-controlled VEB bank gave Rusal a $4.5-billion bailout loan at the height of the financial crisis, allowing the company to restructure its foreign debt. The Kremlin would not have liked the alternative. The foreign banks might have seized Rusal, only to sell it to a rival such as Aloca or Rio Tinto. Big resources like aluminum are considered national strategic assets in Russia.
The crisis appeared to damage Mr. Deripaska's relationship with Mr. Putin, however. In a televised broadcast in mid-2009 in a hard-hit Russian industrial town called Pikalyovo, Mr. Putin compared industrial barons who left workers' wages unpaid to cockroaches. He then forced Mr. Deripaska to sign a document safeguarding the future of a local factory, snapping "And give me back my pen," the moment the crestfallen oligarch did so.
The event played well in recession-racked Russia, but may have been staged political theatre. There no longer appears to be any friction between the two men. "I believe Russia recognizes Oleg's major role in building a renewed economic base in a broad range of domestic businesses and rejuvenating ailing companies and infrastructure," says Tye Burt, the Kinross Gold chief executive officer in Toronto who knows Mr. Deripaska.
Back from the brink
After a tumultuous two years, Basic Element seems more or less stable in its somewhat diminished form. After a disastrous start on the stock market, Rusal shares are up about 50 per cent in the last six months. Norilsk is worth about $50-billion, putting the value of Rusal's stake at more than $12-billion. Gaz, whose production lines came to a virtual halt during the crisis, is pumping out cars again. "Gaz is producing five times more vehicles than we used to produce during the Soviet Union [era]," Mr. Deripaska says..
The one looming threat, other than double-dip recession, is a nasty legal dispute with Michael Cherney, also known as Mikhail Chernoy, the Uzbekistan-born Israeli businessman and veteran of the aluminum wars who claims Mr. Deripaska cheated him out of a 20-per-cent stake in Rusal.
Mr. Deripaska denies he owes Mr. Cherney anything. He claims he was forced to work with Mr. Cherney and that Mr. Cherney extorted money from him. In 2008, a British judge ruled that Mr. Cherney's claims could be heard in British court.
The case is to begin in April, 2012. In the meantime, Interpol is seeking the arrest of Mr. Cherney for alleged money laundering in Spain.
Mr. Deripaska is back in expansion mode and the one area that seems to excite him most, other than preparing Basic Element's Sochi airport and the Olympic village for the 2014 games, is hydroelectric power. EuroSibEnergo , Russia's biggest privately-owned hydro company, which is headed for the Hong Kong stock market next month, is emerging as Basic Element's potential growth champion. "I believe that this company will double its capacity in next 20 to 25 years," he says.
He believes that only hydro and nuclear power can save the planet from a carbon-dioxide fuelled inferno. "Hydro causes a lot less environmental damage that coal," he says. "Look at China; 3.2 billion tonnes of coal burned a year. Massive emissions into the atmosphere, massive ash on the ground."
But what about solar and wind power, and biofuels? Wind and solar are power, he says, will never been more than niche power sources while turning food like corn into fuel like ethanol is "definitely a mistake" because it puts upward pressure on food prices.
Which leaves nuclear and hydro power. The problem with nuclear is the exceedingly long time, sometimes decades, between concept and production. Building hydro plants takes fewer years and, if properly constructed and maintained, can last for centuries. Enter Hydro-Quebec. Basic Element and Hydro-Quebec have been holding exploratory talks for several months about forming a technology and construction partnership to develop international power projects, possibly in Latin America. Mr. Deripaska is meeting Hydro-Quebec's top executives in Montreal Monday feb 18 to see if a formal partnership can be launched.
China is his other obsession. Mr. Deripaska doesn't buy the argument that China might be a bubble economy. "They have real demand for everything, for cars, for apartments and kitchen appliances," he says. "I just can't see anything that can stop them from growth. They just need it. It's not like the real estate market in Tokyo. That was artificial."
Russia in general and Basic Element in particular are poised to feed the Chinese tiger with everything from aluminum and hydro-power grids to uranium and rail cars. The potential is vast, he says, and will shift Basic Element's focus to the east, overhauling Russia's economy in the same way that Australia is thriving from its role as China's offshore storehouse of resources wealth. "China's reflection in Australian GDP is 20 per cent," he says. "In Russia, it's still less than 2 per cent."
Rusal, he says, is in a particularly good position to supply China because soaring Chinese energy costs will push down domestic aluminum production (making aluminum requires vast amounts of electricity). Imports will fill the gap. "Over time, I am very optimistic that China will import aluminum and steel," he says. "This will create opportunity for Rusal. Rusal will build another 1.5 million tonnes of capacity and become a six-million-tonne a year company."
The stay-at-home oligarch
Late in the evening, when the lights on the ski hill have been turned off and only the faint outline of trees against the snow is visible, I try to steer the conversation away from business and markets and statistics.
I ask what motivates him and I get elliptical responses. As far as I can make out, he considers himself a Russian patriot who wants to combine the best of the old Soviet Union - superb science and engineering training, infrastructure development, pride of country - with modern capitalism to drag Russia into a new industrial age.
"We are not investors," he says. "We run businesses. I am living here, of course and I care. I know we have a unique opportunity for my [country] to be developed."
The implication is that he doesn't want to be like the oligarchs who invest in portfolios of companies, as if they were buying mutual funds, or taking their fortunes overseas to load up on trophy assets. He will even criticize the men who made huge profits from the "loans-for-shares" scheme in the 1990s, when the cash-strapped government traded equity in state-owned enterprises, from telecommunications to energy, for loans. A small group of Russians got exceedingly rich by taking control of valuable - though epically mismanaged - companies on the cheap (Mr. Deripaska was not involved in the loans-for-shares).
The problem is that some of the industrialists, he says, "did not fulfill their promises" to reinvest back into Russia. Mr. Deripaska, the stay-at-home industrialist (minus the occasional yacht tour) considers Russia an obligatory market, as well as one that can earn him billions as he fixes up the decrepit economy.
At one in the morning, Mr. Deripaska has work to do and escorts me to the door. He says goodbye. I expect him to reach for his BlackBerry or phone. Instead Leo comes thundering into the foyer and I watch through the window as the unshaven billionaire laughs as he plays with his pet.

LISTING AGENT
Gil Goldstein, Sutton Group-
Associates Realty Inc.
The Action: About two dozen potential buyers made appointments to inspect this semi-detached, brick Victorian on a two-block long street running adjacent to the University of Toronto.
What They Got: The 2½-storey structure combines both period details from 1880s, such as stained glass windows, and contemporary finishes, like frameless glass shower stalls in the two bathrooms.
* There is a fireside living room, an open dining area and a designer-renovated kitchen with an island, stainless steel appliances - including a gas stove - and nine-foot glass doors to a private patio.
* There are two second-floor bedrooms, including a master suite with his and her closets; a third-floor bedroom redone by a local architect with a deck and a skylight; and a guest bedroom in the basement.
The Agent's Take: "A lot of people who know the Annex and South Annex just love that particular block because it's very treed and shady with pretty houses," agent Gil Goldstein says.
"And this was an original Victorian with high ceilings and mouldings, but with a really modern kitchen, bathroom, third floor and finished basement."

THE ACTION: In the picturesque Town of Caledon, just an hour northwest of Toronto, this modern farmhouse was viewed by only three buyers, but one ultimately struck up a deal.
WHAT THEY GOT: On what local agent Jamie Gairdner dubs "one of the best streets in Caledon," the previous owner and architect acquired nearly an acre of land to create this unique, two-bedroom residence several years ago.
* Heated concrete floors, 12-foot ceilings and full-height windows overlooking landscaped gardens are highlights in the main-floor rooms, from a fireside living room to a sleek Italian kitchen with custom stainless steel counters and hidden appliances.
* Additional conveniences include three bathrooms, laundry facilities, air conditioning and central vacuum systems, plus well water and septic systems and an attached garage.
THE AGENT'S TAKE: "When I got inside, it blew me away," Mr. Gairdner says, who hasn't seen anything similar in town. "It's a very high-end quality area ... like the Rosedale of Toronto."

Full text:   Client who also went missing in kidnapping returned safely six days later, police confirm
The disappearance of a high-end Toronto real estate agent took a decidedly darker turn as police confirmed the case as an abduction and named a suspect with a notorious past.
On Thursday, exactly three weeks after Jianguo (Tony) Han, 44, and a client named Jun (Johnny) Fei, 40, were reported missing from Mr. Fei's Mississauga, Ont., mansion, police in Peel Region confirmed the men had been kidnapped, and revealed that Mr. Fei had turned up safe and sound on Jan. 26.
Mr. Han remained missing, and an arrest warrant has been issued for Guo Wei Wu, 43, of no fixed address. Mr. Wu was named in local media reports in 2002, 2003 and 2006 in connection with dozens of incidents in York Region, north of Toronto, including burglaries, a stabbing, assaults, automobile thefts and a vehicular confrontation with SWAT team officers who tried - and failed - to arrest him.
Mr. Wu, who has used the first name David, is described as Asian, 5 foot 7, and weighs 170 pounds with black hair and brown eyes.
Police only reluctantly confirmed the safe return of Mr. Fei, who turned up in the city's Don Mills area just six days after the abduction from a spacious luxury home registered to his numbered company on Mississauga's Featherston Drive.
"We're still not convinced the release of this information is going to help Mr. Han," Constable Adam Minnion said, adding that police were pressed into confirming Mr. Fei's return by media who had obtained the information independently.
Referring to detectives investigating the case, Constable Minnion said, "they're very, very sensitive to what information can be released and what can't," out of concern for Mr. Han's well-being.
Mr. Han had been trying to sell Mr. Fei's house, listed at $2.4-million, since the latter part of last year. The home is typical of the agent's luxurious listings, which include a $30-million property in Toronto's ultra-exclusive Bridle Path enclave.
Mr. Han had only recently sold his own home in North York for $1-million and upgraded to a larger one for $2.5-million, not far from the Bridle Path, a far cry from the humble Canadian beginnings described on his personal website. As an immigrant from mainland China, he worked as a landscaper before his rise through the real-estate ranks.
The brokerage where Mr. Han works, HomeLife Landmark in Don Mills, caters specifically to new Canadians and boasts a multicultural roster of agents fluent in two or more languages. The company's office is less than a kilometre from the Tim Hortons outlet where Mr. Han left his black Mercedes on the afternoon of Jan. 19, about 24 hours before he disappeared.
A Tim Hortons manager told The Globe and Mail at the time that Mr. Han parked his car, bought something and then got into the passenger seat of a second car, which drove off.
In October of 2002, Mr. Wu was named in local media reports as a "wanted man" whom York Region police were trying to apprehend when he rammed a police cruiser with a minivan packed with stolen goods and sped away, narrowly missing the police tactical unit's van.
The Toronto Sun reported that Mr. Wu "had been on the run since August [2002] when he allegedly cut telephone lines before breaking into his ex-wife's home and stabbing a man."
After he made his escape from the cruiser collision, officers found the minivan abandoned in a parking lot, where a second van was stolen. Police advised the public not to approach the vehicle or Mr. Wu, who was believed to be armed.
In 2006, the Toronto Star reported that Mr. Wu and a pregnant woman named Xue Fei (Michelle) Zhao had been charged with 65 counts of breaking and entering, plus counts of possession of stolen property and assaulting a police officer.
York Region police alleged that the couple treated burglary as "a job" in which they took $500,000 in goods during nighttime break-ins at 65 companies north of Toronto.

Abstract: Today, the blood-red paint, the seven layers of linoleum, the teal blue broadloom and forest-green panelling are distant nightmares. Today, thanks to the soothing palette of Farrow and Ball paints and a lot of hard work, the old house's "bones" are showing through: its 12-foot ceilings, original mouldings, and inch-thick maple floors.

Full text:   As Cecily Ross packs her bags, she remembers the charms and challenges of country home living
Our house is a very, very, very fine house.
At least it is now. Six years ago, when we bought this 87-acre property just minutes south of Creemore, it was a sad parody of country living - part Green Acres, part Bleak House. The exterior of the 1890s Victorian farmhouse was in good condition. Indeed, with its two front-facing gables, its pointed Gothic windows and extravagant gingerbread trim, it was beautiful to the point of exuberance.
But inside, the previous owners had reduced the house's former gentleman-farmer grandeur to their idea of country-hick kitsch. They thought it was a joke. The dining room chandelier was fashioned from a copper chamber pot spilling over with straw and a rubber chicken. A one-piece suit of red men's long johns was affixed to the wall of the main bathroom as decoration. The switch plates were adorned with cartoon cows and sheep.
Barn board wainscoting had been installed in the family room. Wallpaper borders and frilly curtains adorned the walls and windows of nearly every room.
A couple of weeks after we moved in (on a freezing day in February), we threw a "wallpaper stripping" party and invited a dozen friends from Toronto. We soon realized that the small portable steamer we'd bought didn't stand a chance against the floral madness covering the ceilings and walls of the large kitchen and family room. So we went skating on the frozen pond behind the barn instead and later, over bowls of black bean soup and mugs of mulled wine, we pondered the perils of impulse real estate purchases.
Today, the blood-red paint, the seven layers of linoleum, the teal blue broadloom and forest-green panelling are distant nightmares. Today, thanks to the soothing palette of Farrow and Ball paints and a lot of hard work, the old house's "bones" are showing through: its 12-foot ceilings, original mouldings, and inch-thick maple floors. Airlie Tigh (Tigh is Irish for house or home) was named for the once-thriving village of Airlie that used to exist a quarter of a mile 0.4 kilometres down the road. There's nothing left of it now, other than a chunk of cement half buried in the wetland behind our barn and a historical plaque on the road describing a settlement of 150 people, three sawmills, a tavern and a blacksmith shop.
Our house was built by John Bradley, a doctor who practised in Creemore for many years. He was also the local coroner, pathologist and postmaster. The old back kitchen, which is now a family room, doubled as the Airlie post office. Evidenced all these years later by the letter slot (an unusual relic in the land of rural routes and mailboxes) in our side door and the original pigeon-hole cupboard we now use to store jars of homemade preserves.
In our efforts to restore the house, we have tried to keep things simple. To my mind, the renovation/redecoration fever that has been sweeping the nation in recent years has resulted in a certain sameness to the way interiors look these days. Often they seem to lack personality, as though they're designed for magazine features, not real life. That said, we pretty much gutted and replaced the kitchen, family room and upstairs bathroom. The rest, we sanded and stripped and painted. Our most prized additions include the kitchen island, a lavishly decorated counter from a general store in Angus; a Quebec pine cupboard that we use as a pantry; and a claw-footed tub strategically facing a window that affords excellent views of the Niagara Escarpment in the distance. Whether I'm up to my neck in bubbles or out on the deck on a summer evening, the views over the woods and fields are long and sweeping, the sunsets superb. And in the interests of the planet, not to mention our energy costs and our comfort, we installed a geothermal heating system last winter.
As much as possible, though, we have tried to avoid perfection. For instance, where we could, we preserved the original plaster walls. Old plaster in good condition gives a room a more solid, yet softer feel; the corners are rounder, the angles less exacting than drywall. And plaster absorbs sound like a sponge, enhancing privacy and adding an ineffable peacefulness to the house. The buttery maple floors still bear century-old scars: burn marks where the wood-burning cookstove once stood, phantom shadows where rugs used to lie, door jams worn smooth by the touch of countless hands. As much as possible, we have tried to restore this fine house to its former dignity. We like to think it has "character" and the patina of age.
Now we have to leave. The daily commute to Toronto gets longer every year. But we will miss this fine house, and the property, too. We'll miss the pair of red-tailed hawks that share their territory with us, the scarlet tanagers in the woodlot, the return of the rose-breasted grosbeaks and the bluebirds in May. We'll wonder how the 15,000 trees we planted are doing. We'll miss the wild leeks and the morels in spring, the rhubarb patch, the wild apples and the deer that come to the pond to drink, the towering spruces and birches and willows that guard the house. This fine old house, we'll miss it very much.

Full text:   Real estate companies are sinking billions into the South American country's property market, saying it is ripe for consolidation
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
When the more than one million residents of Campinas, Brazil go shopping, they wander open-air markets and a visit a smattering of outdoor strip malls.
Despite a swelling middle class, the bustling industrial region about an hour outside of capital Sao Paulo has very little indoor retail space. The lack of a proper shopping mall is the kind of thing that Pierre Lalonde dreams about when trying to decide where to invest Ivanhoe Cambridge's money.
Ivanhoe Cambridge - the real estate arm of the Caisse de depôt et placement du Quebec that specializes in retail space - has about $700-million invested in shopping malls in the South American country and isn't averse to increasing that amount. Indeed, Mr. Lalonde is in Campinas this week to get work started on a new project.
The company is one of a handful of Canadian real estate companies that are together sinking billions of dollars into Brazil, betting that the country's highly fragmented real estate industry is ready to be consolidated and professionally managed after decades of underdevelopment. They think that Brazil in 2011 is similar to Canada in the 1970s, and that with the right partners Canadian companies will be able to earn outsized returns on their investments that would not be available here.
"There's a void in that market and we were able to get some land and will start construction soon," said Mr. Lalonde, who is senior vice-president of portfolio management and strategic planning for the Montreal-based real estate company. "Canada is our core market where we developed our expertise, and now we can apply that to countries such as Brazil."
Brazil has one of the strongest consumer cultures in the world, with citizens among the largest spenders on the planet. Its citizens are already the world's fourth-biggest consumers of apparel and cosmetics, despite a wide gap between the rich and the poor.
By 2050, PricewaterhouseCooper estimates, it will be among the top three consumer markets on the planet. Yet there are still sizable cities such as Campinas without the large indoor shopping centres commonly associated with the middle class, because the investment climate hasn't allowed developers access to the money they need to build modern malls.
"From a Canadian perspective, Brazil has really got things under control recently," said Vanessa Iarocci, vice-president of deals at PwC. "It's got a handle on inflation and its currency, it's a net exporter of energy and it has made a lot of progress in the last decade compared to other markets, such as China and India. If you're coming from the Canadian market, it actually looks quite familiar."
Indeed, Brazil has a lot going for it - inflation has stabilized since the mid-1990s, it saw its first budget surplus in 1998, and reached investment grade status in 2008.
There's one key difference between Brazil and Canada, however, and that's where the opportunity lies. Interest rates in Brazil are more than 11 per cent, which has made it almost impossible for local developers to finance development over the last decade because loans are too expensive.
"Brazilian real estate is still in its infancy," said Peter Ballon, vice-president and head of real estate investments for the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board . "There is a lot of pent-up demand across all real estate sectors, and there is still a shortage of capital. We expect the opportunities to be significant, and that we will invest a significant amount of capital there in the next several years."
CPPIB has already committed up to $250-million in a joint venture with Cyrela Commercial Properties SA, a local partner that develops office buildings, shopping malls and logistics facilities.
While the pension funds have only been investing in Brazil over the past decade, Brookfield Asset Management has been active in the country for decades. Today, it has more than $10.6-billion of real estate in Brazil, covering residential, office and retail space. And while it is entrenched enough to act alone, most newcomers to the country prefer to enlist a local partner to help defray the risk and understand local markets.
"There are [Brazilian] entrepreneurs that just can't do it on their own," Mr. Ballon said. "They could grow at a very slow pace, but the opportunity is now and we can accelerate the growth with long-term investments. The returns are good, and having a solid partner helps to manage risk."
There are plenty of reasons for caution. PwC warned in a recent report - intended to encourage Canadian companies to consider increasing their merger-and-acquisition activities in the country - that the murder rate was 12 times higher than in Canada, "raising the risk that companies will lose key employees."
The report lists other challenges, such as powerful trade unions, a complex tax system and "corruption issues typical of a developing country."
"When I wrote the report, I called my colleague in Brazil to see how he would react to those warnings," Ms. Iarocci said. "He was fine with it - and that's why we tell companies we are working with that they never want to do it alone; you want to involve the Brazilians."
There's also the risk of coming too late to the party. While vacancy rates in office towers are notoriously low - some key cities have absolutely no vacancies to speak of - a surge of activity over the next three years is expected to have a major effect on vacancy rates. The Faria Lima district in Sao Paulo has a vacancy rate of 0.4 per cent, but will see its office space increase by 40 per cent in the next three years. Lease rates have increased by 17 per cent in the last year.
The new space will draw from older buildings in the region, said Colliers International research co-ordinator Leandro Angelino, because companies "seek the benefits caused by corporate visibility and the glamour of the region."
That will open up retrofit opportunities in outlying areas, however, and that's where Canadian capital could best be put to work.
"From the very long-term perspective, this sort of market is ideal for pension funds," CPPIB's Mr. Ballon said.

Full text:   Landmark in Old North Toronto is sold to an anonymous European attracted by the stability of the Canadian real estate market
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
It's the ultimate house flip.
A historic stone mansion at 174 Teddington Park Ave. has been sold for $17.5-million, just three years after investors paid $13.5-million for the property and sunk another $5-million into renovations.
Kris and Margaret Isberg also severed a 100 x 190-foot lot from the site as part of the sale, squeezing another $6-million out of the property and ensuring a tidy $5-million profit on their investment.
"I do believe that is a record price for a lot in Toronto," said Barry Smith, a Chestnut Park agent who represented the Isbergs throughout the deal along with colleague Michelle Jalsevac. "As for the house itself, it's easily the highest sale in Toronto for a very long time. There aren't too many that have ever sold for a higher price."
Built in 1931, the 15,000-square-foot home was designed by architect John Lyle for industrialist Frederick Cowan. Mr. Lyle's work is hard to miss in Toronto - it includes Union Station, the Royal Canadian Yacht Club and the Royal Alexandra Theatre.
It's in an area north of Lawrence Avenue and east of Yonge Street called Old North Toronto, considered one of the most elite districts in the city. Neighbours include Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts founder Isadore Sharp, and the upscale Four Teddington Park Avenue retirement home.
The house - which neighbourhood children have always referred to as "the Castle" - features eight bedrooms and 11 bathrooms, a library and a coach house which at 1,000-square-feet is larger than most Toronto condos. Anyone looking out the window would see not only the heavily manicured lawn and gardens, but the 18th hole of the Rosedale Golf Club.
W. E. Phillips of Argus Corp. once called it home, and its most recent live-in owner was Steve Stavro, former chairman of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment.
The Isbergs - Mr. Isberg runs K.P. Isberg Construction and Mrs. Isberg is the former president of bond-manager PIMCO Canada - bought the home with the intention of modernizing it and selling it for a profit, and their efforts were rewarded just months after work finished late last year.
A European buyer put down an offer ahead of "a handful" of interested locals, and intends to immigrate to Canada because of the deal. While the buyer wishes to remain anonymous, he had been considering a house in Boston before opting to invest in the relative stability of the Canadian real estate market.
While there are no statistics to back up the frequent claims, real estate insiders suggest that foreign buyers are increasingly drawn to the Canadian market because prices have rebounded from recessionary lows and the country is seen as a safe haven for investment capital.
The Teddington Park listing saw inquiries from agents in Germany, Malaysia, China and the United States.
"Nobody really knows how many foreign investors there are," said Barry Lyon, senior partner and president of real estate consulting firm N. Barry Lyon Consultants Ltd. in Toronto. "But these are worldly buyers - they like the calm and safety of Toronto, they like the ongoing growth. And they certainly like the cosmopolitan nature of the city."
Sotheby's International Realty Canada president Ross McCredie said high-end homes have drawn the attention of international investors who are looking to invest in hard assets as a means of diversification, and the market has picked up momentum in the past several months.
"I'm not saying there are busloads of foreigners driving around and buying properties," he said. "But I've dug into who these buyers are - they've already owned a few houses here, they have family here. They're willing to look across Canada and take their time to find something they'd like to live in, because Canada is still much more affordable than many other countries."

Fed's illusion of prosperity is bound to vanish

Abstract: At best, the Fed has managed to create an illusion of prosperity, but it won't last. And that should surprise no one who has followed the Fed's activities over the past couple of years.

Full text:   David Rosenberg is chief economist and strategist for Gluskin Sheff + Associates Inc. and a guest columnist for Report on Business
Ben Bernanke, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, recently congratulated himself on CNBC for helping boost the Russell 2000 stock index by 30 per cent.
The San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank just published a report that claims the second round of quantitative easing - so-called QE2 - is a success because the U.S. inflation rate is a percentage point higher than it would have been absent the Fed intervention.
Investors should realize how irrational this all is. The United States is in a radical money-easing environment, in which the Fed is keeping interest rates artificially low while pumping money into the economy.
This type of policy breeds speculative rallies. It inevitably results in boom-bust cycles such as the ones we saw in 1999-2002, 2006-09 and today. This is no time for short memories.
At best, the Fed has managed to create an illusion of prosperity, but it won't last. And that should surprise no one who has followed the Fed's activities over the past couple of years.
The Fed initially tried to create wealth by reviving the housing market through the first quantitative easing program (QE1), which concentrated on buying mortgage loans.
But the foreclosure crisis and the massive excess supply of homes are once again weighing on U.S. real estate values and the Fed has largely given up on reviving that market.
Instead, QE2 has all been about forcing investors to rebalance their portfolios in favour of the stock market. The Fed has no mandate to do this, but it's managed to get away with it by stating that its actions are intended to boost an inflation rate that is too low and veering dangerously close, at times, to deflation.
The Fed's easy-money policies have helped to create inflation in commodities, foodstuffs and stocks. But given the high level of U.S. unemployment, incomes are unlikely to keep up with rising prices, so Americans will be forced to draw down personal savings to maintain their living standards.
Home prices are beginning to fall again and soon we will see the household sector having to rebuild its savings without aid from the government. The view that Washington can take care of everything will disappear with looming austerity, as state and local governments cut back on spending this year, followed by the federal government next year.
Short-term rates at zero, combined with increasing food and energy prices, are bad news for savers.
Given the intractable nature of the U.S. fiscal deficit, the Fed needs to encourage more domestic savings but it won't do so, at least for now, because it fears that higher savings will remove demand from the system and exacerbate the trend to deflation.
The Fed is hoping that by boosting the stock market, it can make people feel wealthier and encourage them to spend. This wealth effect may buy time until the market for jobs and homes turns around on a sustained basis.
The offset, though, is that real wages will feel the pinch, not only from high unemployment, which Mr. Bernanke does not see ending for another five years, but from the Fed's own policies that have encouraged the punishing runup in food prices.
I have little doubt this cyclical bull market and stimulus-led economic expansion has been built with straws and sticks as opposed to bricks. Sure, there could be more upside to stocks over the next few months but, at this point, we are probably closer to the peak than many believe.
Tom Hoenig, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, has been a dissenting rogue on the Fed's Open Market Committee over the past few years, and he has been right.
The Fed needs to stop QE2 and raise short-term rates to around 0.5 to 1.0 per cent as soon as possible. Zero rates and asset purchases are fine in a crisis, but they hurt long-term savers and foster inefficient capital allocation.
We have all seen how Fed-induced speculative bull markets end. We either end up with another cycle of wealth destruction down the road or higher inflation. I see no other outcome.
As a result, the most prudent strategy for an equity investor is to shift toward hedge funds that preserve capital and manage risk appropriately.

Full text:   Wife, mother, grandmother, classy woman, solver of world affairs. Born June 8, 1926, in Toronto. Died Dec. 30, 2010, in Toronto of multiple ailments, aged 84.
A modern matriarch, Helen Tator was a superwoman long before it was in vogue. She was multi-talented, intellectual, honest to a fault, stylish and driven.
Helen had a demanding career and somehow juggled everything else while making it all look effortless. A competent cellphone user, she texted family members and browsed the Internet in search of online bridge games.
She was the youngest child of three, born to Annie and Joseph Zeidel. She came to her left-of-centre politics honestly. Her father, a Jewish immigrant from Russia, helped to start unions in his Toronto men's clothing factory, and was known to offer housing to the working poor.
During the Second World War, Helen graduated from the University of Toronto in occupational therapy. Although she had many boyfriends, it was a blind date with a handsome young man in RCAF uniform named William Tator that was the beginning of a 64-year love affair.
Married in 1947, Helen and Wil had two daughters, Terry and Joan. Helen was devoted to building a family-centred life that included volunteer work. She helped form a local Hadassah-Wizo chapter and co-ordinated volunteers at Mount Sinai Hospital.
Once her children were settled in school, Helen started her career. Over 20 years she held increasingly responsible positions in the social services sector with such organizations as ORT (a Jewish education and vocational training organization), the United Way and the provincial government. She was a role model to many, especially her daughters, as she rose to every new occasion - confronting, challenging, critiquing. Helen encouraged her daughters to seek their own adventures, find their independence and successes. She told them not to be afraid of new experiences.
In the late seventies, Helen took a hiatus from her working life at a time when women of her generation were doing the opposite. She enjoyed the opportunity to have some leisure time. She lunched with friends and played tennis and bridge. Her competitive spirit emerged - she played to win.
When Wil retired, Helen returned to the work force at 64, beginning a successful career as a real estate agent that lasted until she was 81. When making a deal, Helen was focused and driven until the ink had dried.
Helen became a grandmother to Jonathan and Ali. She never wavered in her belief that they would reach their goals. She loved to debate American politics with them, finding Canadian politics just too bland.
In the final years of her life, Helen faced numerous illnesses but she was a take-charge person. She rallied over and over again. She had a strength and determination that is an inspiration to all who knew her.
By Terry and Joan Tator,
Helen's daughters.

For Whistler business, gold was elusive

Author: Stueck, Wendy

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/whistler-business-gold-was-elusive/docview/849314508/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "There was a lot of belief that the Olympics would create a real boost in interest, and consequently in the value of real estate in Whistler," said Patrick Kelly of Whistler Real Estate. "That didn't happen."

Full text: The Olympics left a legacy of sports infrastructure in the resort town, but commerce appears to have received less of a boost
Now echoing with construction noise, the home boasts a sweeping view of the Tantalus Range and a stone-clad entryway reminiscent of castle walls.
When it's finished, the house will have cost somewhere between $5-million and $10-million, in line with sums commanded by homes in this subdivision, named Kadenwood and served by a private gondola that runs from the slope-side enclave to Whistler's Creekside base.
There are still lots for sale here, starting at more than $1-million, and it's Keith McIvor's job to sell them - a task he says has been made easier by the afterglow of last year's Olympic and Paralympic Games.
"There's no question the Olympics have increased awareness globally of Whistler," he said this week.
Mr. McIvor, vice-president of sales for Ecoasis Properties Ltd., believes heightened post-Games awareness may have played a role in the recent sale of five lots. But he can't say for certain. And that's a common theme in Whistler, where there's a sense that the Games were great for community spirit but not as good for business.
In the village, Olympic mascots are on sale at cut-rate prices and hotels are peddling discount packages. Post-Olympic blues are tinged by other factors, including a Canada-U.S. exchange rate that has made Whistler less affordable for American visitors.
The downside was evident even before TV cameras beamed Whistler to the world. Olympic aversion - the tendency of visitors to avoid host communities out of worries about crowds, cost and security hassles - has been documented in several cities. And it played out in Whistler, despite efforts to counter it with marketing campaigns that emphasized the resort would be open during the Games.
In a year-end report, ski resort operator Whistler Blackcomb Holdings Inc. - which went public last year - said its 2010 business was hurt, as expected, by "visitor aversion," and that $32.3-million of venue fees paid by the Vancouver Olympic Organizing Committee to the resort was not enough to make up the difference, estimated at $6.2-million.
Hotel visits tracked by the Resort Municipality of Whistler are expected to be down by about 3 per cent from last year's Olympic level - better than expected, given global economic conditions, according to Tourism Whistler.
Economic benefits, if they come, are expected to take time to materialize. In Park City, Utah, winter visits increased 6.2 per cent over the five years after it hosted some events of the 2002 Olympics.
Whistler Blackcomb, which already had a high profile, isn't expecting the same kind of boost enjoyed by Park City, which was relatively obscure before the Games. But the Canadian resort hopes to translate its increased profile into more visitors and profits.
As Whistler Blackcomb angles for global traffic, some local businesses are struggling to get back on their feet.
Canadian Snowmobile Adventures Ltd., which runs snowmobile, dog sled and snowshoe expeditions in the Callaghan Valley, was hamstrung by Olympic-related road closures, and is only now starting to recover, says co-owner Allan Crawford.
Recent revelations of a grisly cull by another, unrelated sled dog operation have resulted in a public-relations nightmare for Canadian Snowmobile and, some fear, for Whistler as a whole.
The furor over the sled dogs has resulted in a provincial inquiry and weighed on Tourism Whistler and local politicians, who have been called on to comment about the cull.
As the sled dog controversy continues, local businesses are adjusting to the post-Olympic reality.
Summit Ski Ltd. is back to a full complement of about 20 seasonal staff. Last year, it hired four, says owner Ian Van Gruen. The company also slashed purchasing, buying about half the volume of "hard goods" such as skis, snowboards and helmets that it would for a non-Olympic year.
Summit planned to further protect itself by subletting part of its space for use as a hospitality suite.
When a global recession kicked in, those plans fell apart. The company toughed it out, finding a silver lining in stronger-than-expected sales of VANOC-licensed merchandise.
"The Olympics were fantastic - and I wouldn't change it for anything," said Mr. Gruen. "Profitability-wise, we knew that going in and we were ready for it. You just do what you can to mitigate any losses and carry on."
Restaurateurs encountered feast and famine. Vancouver-based Points West Hospitality Group signed a short-term lease at Creekside for a temporary tapas bar.
A last-minute change to security plans resulted in a fence running closer than expected to the restaurant.
"It totally boxed us in and made it almost impossible for people to get to us," said Points West president Rob Ward. "We were cut off from the lifts that we thought we were going to get most of our clientele from."
Points West lost money on the venture, although Mr. Ward declines to say how much. The company has another Whistler restaurant, Players Chop House, that did a booming business during the Games.
On the real-estate front, Whistler residential property values fell by 2 per cent in 2011, countering an upward trend in most Lower Mainland municipalities.
A 2010 report co-authored by University of British Columbia professor Tsur Somerville found no evidence that house prices rose faster in a host city before, during or after the Games than in non-Olympic cities in the same country. The study also found no evidence of a negative effect - a post-Olympic bust - in housing markets. The biggest impact was a construction employment boom in the runup to the Games.
"There was a lot of belief that the Olympics would create a real boost in interest, and consequently in the value of real estate in Whistler," said Patrick Kelly of Whistler Real Estate. "That didn't happen."
He sees infrastructure - such as the rebuilt Sea to Sky Highway, athletes' housing that became permanent housing for Whistler residents, and expanded cross-country ski facilities - as the most lasting benefits of the Games.
"We're only beginning to think: How do we lever these to provide a better experience for guests and visitors and residents?" Mr. Kelly said.
*****
MOVIES AND MORE
A program designed to wring lasting economic benefits from Olympic exposure has generated more than $300-million in benefits for the Lower Mainland, backers of the program said on Friday.
Metro Vancouver Commerce - a joint effort by nine Metro Vancouver municipalities with financial support from the federal government - released an economic report that said the program has generated a total of $168.8-million in investments and an estimated $306.2-million in total economic output.
Of the $168.8-million in investments, $146.5-million consists of one-time capital investments and special projects, including major motion picture projects.
The study cites the Tom Cruise movie Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol , now filming in the Lower Mainland, as an investment made under the program, which involved hosting business "decision-makers" at functions that included ticketed and non-ticketed Olympic-related events.
The study also cites a strategic partnership between Beijing-based Modern Green Development Co. Ltd. and the University of British Columbia that will focus on research and development for "green" buildings.
The goal of the program was to attract $50-million in foreign direct investment to Metro Vancouver by the end of 2011.
The PricewaterhouseCoopers report includes criteria to determine how and which investments could be linked to the program, Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson said at a press conference held to discuss the report.
The exposure and connections generated through the Metro Vancouver Commerce program helped tip the scales for movie studio decisions, the mayor added.
The federal government contributed $800,000 to the $1.5-million program, with member municipalities accounting for the rest of the budget.

Full text: Calgary's mayor tells Marcus Gee how he plans to realize Jane Jacobs' vision on the Prairies. He just has to convince the developers
When Naheed Nenshi was elected to lead Calgary in October, headlines hailed him as the first Muslim mayor of a major Canadian city.
But what makes the Ismaili Muslim, born of parents of South Asian descent who immigrated to Canada from Tanzania, really interesting is not his religious background or the colour of his skin. It is his challenge to the way Canadians build their cities.
Mr. Nenshi, 39, has been thinking about cities and how they work for most of his adult life. As a well-travelled, Harvard-trained management consultant, he learned to love great world cities such as Barcelona and Rio de Janeiro, London and New York. His favourite is Melbourne, Australia.
He can talk your ear off about the success of Curitiba, Brazil, with dedicated busways for carrying commuters. He can explain how a "tax increment finance regime" can help to pay for urban infrastructure. His 3-Ds urban philosophy calls for cities with density, diversity and a sense of discovery.
Seldom has a Canadian mayor come to office with such a deep understanding of urban issues. Now, after years on the outside as a business professor, activist and newspaper columnist, he suddenly has a chance to put those ideas into action.
But can he get Calgary to buy in? To an outsider, at least, sprawling, car-dependent Calgary seems to be an unlikely place to realize his Jane Jacobs-inspired ideas about livable cities.
In a 2002 report called Building Up: Making Canada's Cities Magnets for Talent and Engines of Development, he argued that the successful city of the future will be a place in which: "People live where they work and play. Density is high. Public transit is a preferred choice. Young people can afford to live downtown. Classes and socio-economic backgrounds are mixed ..."
Calgary seems to violate every one of those principles. With no natural barriers - no lake like Toronto's, no mountains and sea as in Vancouver - Canada's fourth-biggest city sprawls north, south, east and west across the rolling foothills of southern Alberta.
Density is low. With the same-sized footprint as the five boroughs of New York, Calgary has one-10th the population.
Though its CTrain light-rail network provides swift service to downtown, 67.6 per cent of Calgarians commute by car and just 16.8 per cent by transit, according to the last census.
Some young people can afford to live downtown, but not many do. The proliferation of high-rise condominiums that has transformed downtown Toronto and Vancouver has only just begun in Calgary. More than 95 per cent of real-estate development is in the suburbs, where vast new subdivisions with names such as Tuscany and Mahogany stretch into the distance.
As for mixing, Mr. Nenshi says that in his own immigrant neighbourhood of Coral Springs in the city's northeast, the proportion of non-white residents has soared to 82 per cent from 50 per cent a few years ago, while in the southern half of Calgary, he says, all but 8 per cent are white.
Yet none of this discourages the effervescent new mayor, an unlikely come-from-behind winner in October's election. He insists that Calgary can, and must, change and he is determined to lead Canada's fastest-growing city into a more sustainable, more truly urban future.
In his high-ceilinged office in Calgary's old City Hall building, he lays out a three-point plan.
First, develop unused downtown lands. Calgary has a bustling downtown with thickets of office towers, including the rising Norman Foster-designed skyscraper the Bow. But there is a lot of barren, underused space in between. Mr. Nenshi has high hopes for the East Village, a once-sketchy area that is to be revived with a new music centre and housing projects.
Second, encourage "spot intensification" of residential neighbourhoods. A recent study showed that 80 per cent of neighbourhoods were actually losing population density as householders saw their children grow up and move out. He would like to see developers build high-rises around transit stops and redevelop low-rise strip malls into mid-rise retail and residential buildings.
Third, build smarter suburbs. That means more subdivisions with a mix of housing types - single-family, townhouse, apartment block - in place of uniform tracts of identical, knock-off houses. He points to the success of Garrison Woods, a new neighbourhood on former military lands with double the density of a traditional suburb. The developer designed it to be walkable, with shops and schools nearby.
Mr. Nenshi wants to charge developers higher fees for building on the city's edges, arguing that the city effectively subsidizes suburban development by charging too little to supply infrastructure and services.
It's not that he wants to abolish suburbs. "We have to recognize that a lot of people want to live in them," he says. "I'm not interested in forcing everybody to live in a high-rise building downtown. This isn't Hong Kong." He just wants the price of a place in the suburbs to reflect the true cost of putting it there.
None of this will be easy. Developers, a powerful force in Calgary and big contributors to local political campaigns, say they are already paying plenty in taxes and fees.
Michael Flynn, executive director of the Urban Development Institute, an industry lobby, says it would be "social engineering" to try to change the housing choices of Calgarians. Like it or not, "Calgary is very much an auto-oriented city. People like to go skiing in the mountains on the weekends."
"The mayor has a very significant challenge in front of him," says Doug Cassidy, an executive with Canada Lands, which developed Garrison Woods. "The majority of development here has been based on the suburban sprawl model. Turning that around will not be an overnight order."
Despite all these hurdles, Mr. Nenshi has a couple of advantages as he presses forward with his vision for a new Calgary. The first is his own skill as a salesman. Open, engaging and almost supernaturally articulate, he impressed Calgarians during the election campaign by daring to speak to them in detail about complex urban issues - an approach that he called "politics in full sentences."
Developer Leslie Conway calls the mayor passionate and "uber-smart."
"He doesn't mince words. He's a great listener. He's supercollaborative."
His second advantage is the city's spirit. Calgarians pride themselves on being creative, entrepreneurial and open to change. The city has gone through several transformations in its history, from railway hub to cow town to oil town to white-collar service centre.
"We are unchallenged by history," the mayor says, "and we have an ability to innovate and pick and choose the best of different places."
With people arriving from all over Canada and the world to profit from the robust Alberta economy, Calgary has become a much more cosmopolitan place, with a population of more than one million, a thriving downtown arts scene and street festivals in the suburbs that echo with the sound of South Asian bhangra music.
Attitudes about city living are changing. One penthouse condo sold for $4.1-million last month, a Calgary record and a sign that high-rise living is gaining appeal.
"When did Jane Jacobs write The Death and Life of Great American Cities ? We're getting there, just 40 years later," Mr. Nenshi says.
When a project called Imagine Calgary asked residents what they wanted from their city in the future, it found that most wanted to live in a place where they could walk to the store, walk their kids to school, get by with only one car and be surrounded by different kinds of people.
"If everyone wants that, why aren't we building that?" the mayor says.
It's a good question, and not just for Calgary. Cities across Canada are trying to reinvent themselves on denser, more modern lines. If Naheed Nenshi has his way, Calgary will show them how.

Full text: Architect Peter Milczyn could merely tweak or make major adjustments, but he has the power to significantly alter the city we know
A key piece of David Miller's green roofs strategy may cave in next week when city council debates a motion from the planning and growth management committee to exempt industrial buildings.
Will it be a sign of what's to come?
Mayor Rob Ford's hand-picked chair, Peter Milczyn (Etobicoke Lakeshore), has signalled that he intends to shake up the city's planning rules. At the committee's inaugural session, it voted to ask council to rescind the notorious driveway restrictions, and it appears that other Miller-era development policies may also be on the chopping block.
There's little question that planning will become a high-profile issue this term. While Mr. Ford demonstrates little interest in growth management and has threatened to freeze spending on waterfront redevelopment, his bid to extend the Sheppard subway will almost certainly mean disruption and intensification for the residential neighbourhoods along the proposed route.
Dealing with the consequences of such moves has fallen to Mr. Milczyn. He's been given a great deal of latitude to press ahead with planning changes that could significantly alter Toronto's landscape. A taste of what's in store:
Official Plan Redux
Toronto's official plan is up for a mandated review in 2011, but it's not yet clear whether the city plans to tweak the five-year-old document or pursue major changes.
"We're interested to see if [the review] is going to be a shampoo and a haircut or whether they'll take a holistic look at the problems with the OP," says Stephen Deveaux, Tribute Communities vice-president of land development.
Development is taking place according to the plan's guidelines, insists Kerri Voumvakis, the city's acting director of policy and research.
But Mr. Milczyn is less certain. He wants to make the OP more precise so neighbourhoods are protected from encroaching development.
Despite his committee's willingness to gut some environmental planning policies, Mr. Milczyn claims he also wants to promote improved urban and architectural design beyond the waterfront and downtown tourist areas. He also sees the anticipated sell-off of city-owned real estate as an opportunity to "create new, high-quality public spaces" by requiring purchasers to incorporate urban design elements in redevelopment plans.
Harmonized Zoning Bylaw:
The Sequel
One of the previous council's final moves was the approval of a harmonized zoning by-law, a highly technical eight-year undertaking intended to combine the zoning rules of all the pre-amalgamation municipalities.
Since the fall, however, the Ontario Municipal Board has received almost 700 appeals of the by-law. "That is just ridiculous," says Stephen Dupuis, CEO of the Building Industry and Land Development Association, predicting the appeals will be a boon for lawyers.
The controversial driveway rules were just the tip of the iceberg, developers contend. Builders are discovering that the massive document contains numerous glitches, some of which are forcing developers to seek rezoning for projects that had already been approved, says Mr. Dupuis.
Employment Lands Conversion
Mr. Ford's council is almost certain to take a sharply different approach to high-profile battles such as a Smart!Centres bid to build big-box stores on a large tract of employment lands in Leslieville.
While Smart!Centres lost that fight at the OMB, there are still vast tracts of underused employment lands throughout the city, many of which are being targeted by big-box retailers, condo developers and religious institutions.
The city this year will take stock of Toronto's industrial zones with an eye to determining which ones remain viable for manufacturing. Building industry officials wants the city to relax its rules, noting that land parcels often sit idle because of inflexible zoning. Council has the last word on employment land designations.
For Mr. Ford, who promised to attract jobs to the city, the dilemma will be choosing between the construction employment created by residential or mixed-used development projects, and the low-paying retail positions created by the big-box retailers that gravitate to large swaths of fallow industrial property.
Development Charges
After a two-year freeze imposed by Mr. Miller in his bid to buoy the local building industry, development charges will jump 25 per cent, beginning next week. Toronto's development charges by-law isn't up for renewal for two years, but Mr. Ford's subway scheme raises the question about whether the city should impose additional levies to underwrite transit expansion.
Last year, a third of the city's $74-million in development charge revenue went to transit - an insignificant amount for megaprojects like subways.
Mr. Ford's hasn't taken a position on the issue of hiking them. But Adam Vaughan (Trinity-Spadina) doubts council has the stomach for such a move. "At a certain point," he says, "the development charges are what the market will bear."
New Chief Planner
Chief planner Gary Wright has said he will retire soon, and development insiders are watching closely to see if council hires an insider or conducts an international search for a high-profile candidate who wants to put his or her stamp on the city's official plan. Planner Joe Berridge hopes council splits the job into two portfolios. "You need a civic entrepreneur and a bit of a visionary crusader in [the latter] position," he says.
A New Plan?
Some feel council should ditch the official plan and radically recast Toronto's approach to growth. John Van Nostrand, founding principal with planningAlliance, says some of the world's leading cities have abandoned "aspirational" OPs for long-term strategic plans that identify major urban goals and lay out plans for achieving them.

Full text: 'Operation Hammer' investigating allegations of fraud and kickbacks in construction industry
With pressure mounting to produce results after 16 months of investigation, Quebec's Operation Hammer has finally struck.
The provincial anti-corruption squad, which is conducting an investigation known as Operation marteau , or Operation Hammer, has arrested a former mayor and two construction firm executives, accusing them of fixing millions of dollars in contracts in return for bribes.
While Operation Hammer has hit several alleged gangsters, Thursday's arrests mark the first time a politician has faced charges. Sylvie St-Jean, the former mayor of the Montreal bedroom community of Boisbriand, and former councillor Claude Brière were charged with conspiracy to commit a breach of trust.
Lino Zambito and Giuseppe Zambito, the vice-president and president of construction company Infrabec, were charged with fraud. In all, 28 charges of fraud, corruption, conspiracy and extortion were laid against seven people, including three employees from two engineering firms.
Inspector Denis Morin of the Sûreté du Quebec, the provincial police, said searches conducted in 2009 uncovered an organized system of influence-peddling.
"Entrepreneurs used illegal campaign financing or bribes given to elected and unelected officials to gain information on how to win contracts," Insp. Morin said.
The kickbacks came in cash, illegal political contributions and paid vacations, investigators say.
With 30,000 residents, Boisbriand has doubled in size since the mid-1980s and is one of several fast-growing suburban cities ringing Montreal that have been targeted for corruption investigations.
The rapid growth has brought a building boom and expanding budgets. Infrabec cornered about half of Boisbriand's $100-million in construction business from 2005 to 2010.
A boom in real-estate development has also raised the stakes in local politics. Around the time Operation Hammer was launched, Lino Zambito was caught on tape trying to orchestrate the results of a coming municipal election. With Ms. St-Jean by his side, Mr. Zambito met with one of her opponents and tried to dissuade the rival from running against her for mayor. (The opponent, Marlene Cordato, gave the tape of the meeting to Radio-Canada and then promptly defeated Ms. St-Jean.) Mr. Zambito was fined $1,000 by Quebec's chief electoral officer. He planned to appeal, calling the incident a setup. Calls to his office were not returned Thursday.
Infrabec is a big player in the Montreal region's construction industry. From 2006 to 2009, the company collected $55-million for contracts with the city of Montreal and its suburbs, according to a Montreal city auditor's report. That made the company the region's eighth biggest public-construction contractor.
Last year, a court threw out a lawsuit by Infrabec that was brought against a citizen who questioned a Boisbriand contract with the company for a waste-treatment plant. Martin Drapeau complained after the cost of the project came in at $35-million - more than double the initial evaluation.
Madam Justice Danielle Turcotte of Quebec Superior Court found the lawsuit "was motivated by the desire to intimidate" Mr. Drapeau.
Operation Hammer was created in the fall of 2009 to investigate allegations of corruption and collusion in the construction industry. While other charges have been laid, Thursday's arrests were the highest profile roundup.
Quebec's Liberal government established the special squad amid intense pressure to call a public inquiry into allegations of bid fixing, kickbacks and illegal political contributions, all connected to the construction industry.
Premier Jean Charest says his government has taken the necessary steps to crack down on corruption. He has promised to go a step further by setting up a permanent anti-corruption investigative unit.
"We gave the police the means to do their job with respect to the construction industry," Mr. Charest said Thursday. "We will propose additional measures so that we can act in a concerted way using permanent operations on issues involving the construction industry."
The opposition parties, led by the Action Democratique du Quebec, insist a full inquiry is required to shed a wider light on suspect practices in the industry. Mr. Charest steadfastly opposes an inquiry, saying it will hinder police work.
"It isn't because police are investigating that we can't have a public inquiry to shed light on all the activities in that industry," ADQ Leader Gerard Deltell said. "One doesn't prevent the other."

Full text: With the Dufferin jog removed, new vistas open up on the edge of a bustling downtown stretch
When city engineers smoothed out the quirky twist where Dufferin Street meets Queen Street West, they removed more than a traffic bottleneck.
Since the Dufferin jog disappeared in November, some of the area's denizens say the cultural divide that separated eastern Parkdale from the fashionable part of Queen Street has crumbled as well.
"Everyone always said it would never go past the bridge," writer Kerry Doole says of the local pastime of speculating about how far gentrification will spread.
If couples are now driving down from Forest Hill for cocktails at the Drake Hotel, they mostly haven't ventured to the stretch of Queen between Dufferin and Lansdowne.
Now, Mr. Doole says, pedestrians are more likely to amble west under the railway bridge at Dufferin and Queen that has stood like a psychological rampart for so long.
He goes himself when he wants to find a hardware store or a cheap convenience store. And he increasingly goes to the west to see fresh bands and to avoid line-ups at the trendy bars.
Mr. Doole, who has lived near Queen and Dufferin for more than 20 years, remembers today's hot spots when they were serious dives. Today, he says, the entire music scene has moved west and high-quality roots, bluegrass and jazz can be seen at the Gladstone hotel and local clubs.
Inevitably, many locals lament the changes that haven't been so favourable to the artists, musicians and writers who have long lived in the area.
"The good greasy spoons are now trendy little bistros," he says.
This less-burnished stretch of Queen, from Dufferin to Lansdowne or so, still offers some of those more authentic establishments.
It also hasn't drawn a lot of developers putting up the high-rise condominium towers that are under construction on the south side of Queen on the east side of the underpass.
People who do venture beyond the new brightly illuminated Dufferin tunnel will find a parkette with a sort of amphitheatre built using limestone from the old underpass.
They will also find caring community programs, homeless shelters, funky shops, dollar stores, group homes and needle exchanges - all are part of the mix.
What it has going for it
Nightlife: The ever-popular Cadillac Lounge has doubled in size while The Rhino and Stone's Place add still more character to the 'hood.
The city's most dynamic mosaic: It's hard to think of a neighbourhood in Toronto that offers more diversity. Large Tibetan, West Indian and North African diasporas are here but immigrants from every pocket of the globe often find their feet in Parkdale.
Galleries: Some of the city's edgiest. Gallery 1313's current show on the theme of sex and bondage warns patrons to enter only if they're willing to risk the titillation.
Pragmatism: Sometimes people aren't so much in the market for original sculpture and designer jackets as they are for light bulbs and cat food. Hardware stores and green grocers abound west of the bridge. The practical-minded can also check out books from the public library or hang out at the Masaryk-Cowan Community Centre.
Designer Fabric Outlet has long been a mecca for interior designers and decor-obsessed homeowners. In an interesting departure for a fabric store, dogs are welcome.
Schools
Parkdale Collegiate Institute and Queen Victoria Junior Public School and Holy Family Catholic School are three of the schools that cater to a very diverse student population.
Transportation
The elimination of the Dufferin jog makes for a smoother ride on the TTC's Dufferin Street bus and the area is well-served by transit with the Queen streetcar trundling for kilometres in both directions across the city.
Harbingers of change
Bacchus grew famous for the vegetarian rotis it served from a hole in the wall on Close Avenue many years ago, then drew its many followers to a new location on Queen Street. But the restaurant's glamorous recent reality television makeover irked some locals who rate pendant lamps high on the list of things that have no place in Parkdale.
The Mascot offers art, music, magazines, free Wi-Fi and espresso shots from a temperamental vintage machine. It's a deliberately low-key hang-out for the community's artists and bloggers.
Motel: If refurbished hotels such as the Drake and Gladstone represent the polished aesthetic on the side east of Dufferin, Motel is the witty response on the west. It's a small black box with a casual clientele.
Market values
Some eye-popping prices are appearing on local real estate listings - especially on the side streets south of Queen where grand red-brick Victorians have been restored. The swift escalation has pushed some of the neighbourhood's artists out to such areas as the Junction for more affordable studio space and living quarters.
A "hard" post and beam loft can be found for around the $330,000 mark at 24 Noble St. and the smaller houses north of Queen, heading towards the tracks, are more typical workers cottages. Some newly built houses and townhouses are springing up: A new four-bedroom semi south of Queen is currently listed at $899,900.
Still, anti-poverty activists have worked hard to keep affordable housing in Parkdale and a high percentage of the area's residents are renters.

LISTING AGENT
Holly Wood, Re/Max Masters Realty
The Action: In a prestigious downtown high rise designed by local architect James Cheng, buyers can only arrange appointments to view its suites, like this three-bedroom and three-bathroom model. It fetched a trio of offers at different times before the holidays.
"Who says that Christmas is a slow time?" agent Holly Wood says. "I had my third and final showing with these buyers on Christmas Eve and wrote the offer on Boxing Day."
What They Got: Built in 1991, but renovated four years ago, this 1,656-square-foot unit is one of only three suites on its floor.
* A large portion of the stylish residence was set aside for a fireside living room and dining area with nine-foot ceilings, a balcony and walls of full height windows framing views of the mountains, Coal Harbour, Lost Lagoon and English Bay.
* The decor has modern, European flair with cherry and maple hardwood floors, mosaic tiling, granite kitchen counters and sleek stainless steel Miele and Sub-Zero appliances.
* The suite is conveniently wired with surround sound throughout and remote operated roller blinds and a drop-down television screen in the principal room.
* A monthly fee of $782 includes the cost of operating common areas, such as the club house and gym, as well as recent upgrades to areas such as the roof and hallways.
* The unit comes with private laundry facilities, storage and two-car parking.
The Agent's Take: "This one feels like a house with a perfect layout, high ceilings and over $200,000 in custom renovations," Ms. Wood states.
"Location is also key with Robson Street just a half a block behind, and the Coal Harbour seawall and Stanley Park just three short blocks down."

Gastown district lights up

Author: Hadani Ditmars

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/gastown-district-lights-up/docview/849002071/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Meanwhile, Reliance Holdings is developing 18 West Hastings into a residential rental project. But it's hard to dispute Mr. [Robert Fung]'s status as heritage conversion king. His passion for the neighbourhood is matched only by his high design standards. Mr. Fung cites the area's "great entrepreneurial energy" - and the fact that it's one of the few remaining city areas with "mom and pop" businesses - as the key to its dynamism.

Full text: Until very recently the downtown stretch was a touristy anachronism. Now, new development is drawing residents and a hip clientele
Vancouver's historic Gastown is a neighbourhood that has had its share of ups and downs. Weathering the ebbs and flows of booms and busts, from the great fire of 1886 through to its mid-century bustling downtown status, it suffered from a 1970s kitschy touristy makeover, blossomed into an early eighties artsy nexus only to languish in general nineties-era decline.
But from the vantage point of the Acme Café, located in the 1907-era Paris Block and next door to the soon to be adjoining Paris Annex, things are looking decidedly up.
"Gastown today is one of the city's most dynamic and creative neighbourhoods," says developer Robert Fung (president of the Salient Group), whose nuanced, carefully considered heritage conversions have contributed immensely to the area's built environment. And despite a recessionary hiccup from mid-2008 to very recently, it is also enjoying a heady confluence of new residential and commercial real estate projects.
Consider the Paris Annex, for example. While economic woes stalled construction for the past year and a half, a recent influx of pre-sales means that building will begin in a matter of weeks. Why the sudden upsurge?
Architect Gair Williamson who designed both the Paris Annex and won a Heritage BC award for his design of the Paris Block (the former headquarters of Paris Shoes) says it's partly due to the arrival of "young hipsters/professionals and cultural creatives who want to live where they work."
And increasingly where they work is the plethora of new restaurants, bars and retail outlets that have mushroomed in the last half-year. Peckinpah's, Meat and Bread, L'abbatoir and Sea Monster Sushi offer brave new culinary delights, while retail outlets like Roden Gray and Orling and Wu offer stylish homewares and fashions. In addition, cultural life and arts institutions - like Simon Fraser University's new school for the Contemporary Arts and galleries like Artspeak - are contributing to Gastown's spring awakening.
With hundreds of new residents living in the Woodwards complex, the demand for new businesses is growing. "There's a real symbiosis now between the commercial and the residential," Mr. Fung says. "They feed off each other."
Symbiosis is a big theme architecturally with the Paris Block and Paris Annex buildings - designed with conjoined innards. Indeed, the mixed-use developments act as a neat neighbourhood metaphor. To maximize space, the two properties which were originally part of a single lot will be fully integrated, The elegant 1907 Paris Block building, with sleek new interiors designed by Evoke, will share circulation, electrical, mechanical and storage facilities, with its neighbour building, some 100 years its junior. In this way, the Paris Annex with its mere 30-foot lot can still offer generous living space. With its high ceilings, modern kitchens and floor to ceiling windows, the Annex will offer light filled flats and two-storey lofts at a far more affordable price - and in a more vibrant urban community than Yaletown or Coal Harbour.
By borrowing the circulation core in the Paris block, architect Gair Williamson has reduced the Annex's floor plate, allowing the three upper levels to be set back from the street, and reinforcing the historical 'sawtooth' pattern at the street wall. Several units in both buildings can access private outdoor space in this way, and both buildings share private and common roof deck space. This "stepping back" effect also creates spacious balconies - and ample living space inside and out. And retail frontage across the entire site is achieved by using a single residential entry for both buildings. In this way a new building will grow out of the old in a modern interpretation of the old heritage fabric.
The key to successful heritage conversion, as well as neighbourhood growth, is "getting the balance right," Mr. Fung says. There can be a "fragility" to the area, he adds, which needs to be respected in terms of the right mix of commercial and residential, low income and market housing, cultural facilities and social services. At the same time, Gastown is a neighbourhood with real gravitas - rooted in a history and not created out of ether and landfill, like some of Vancouver's newer neighbourhoods.
So the challenge is to keep the patina of the neighbourhood intact, respecting the smaller footprint of the existing built environment while introducing new elements.
On this stretch of West Hastings, the balance seems right.
The Acme Café is packed with locals for weekday lunches - and even West Vancouver matrons on weekends. Owner Alan Hoffman - who was attracted to the area because of its character and was one of the "pioneering" restaurateurs who invested in the area when its fortunes were down - is excited about the current growth spurt. As evidence of the neighbourhood sea change, he notes that the next-door Model Express now displays Italian leather shoes next to its more "traditional" knee high patent leather boots and skimpy outfits.
On the other side of the two Paris buildings, the heritage Phoenix building houses a capoeria school and shop and, next door, the Save on Meats, with its iconic neon pig which will soon reopen as a "modern butcher shop" run by Boneta's Mark Brand (another of the area's pioneering restaurateurs). Farther down, Lu's Women's Pharmacy, the brainchild of architect Inge Roecker, marries innovative design - including chandeliers made of recycled plastic from United We Can - with social conscience.
Across the street, a vacant lot is transforming into a community garden, framed by the sculpture of an inner city angel on the side of a neighbouring building. The next block westward, the south side opposite the massive Woodwards project, is taken up by vacant heritage buildings for sale or lease (soon to become Paris Block-imitating heritage conversions perhaps). There is even a new spa here called "Be Fresh."
Meanwhile, Reliance Holdings is developing 18 West Hastings into a residential rental project. But it's hard to dispute Mr. Fung's status as heritage conversion king. His passion for the neighbourhood is matched only by his high design standards. Mr. Fung cites the area's "great entrepreneurial energy" - and the fact that it's one of the few remaining city areas with "mom and pop" businesses - as the key to its dynamism.
A few hundred metres away on Water Street, where Mr. Fung has developed a string of projects from the Acton/Ostry designed Terminus Hotel to the Garage building (named after the area's first parking garage) and the adjoining Alhambra building (one of the oldest in Vancouver), restaurateur David Polinsky sings Mr. Fung's praises. Right next to L'Abbatoire - where a modern glass cube sits atop the city's former jail - Mr. Polinsky has opened a Vera's burger joint. The design of this franchise is anything but generic. Interiors designed by David Hepworth accentuate the exposed heritage brick walls with stylish overhead light fixtures.
"The success of Gastown," he says, "is about developers like Robert with aesthetic sensitivity matched with creative entrepreneurs."
"A year-and-a-half ago," notes the 30-something restaurateur, "this was a scary place to park your car. Now you have to fight for a parking space - and you have to fight for a seat at the bar on a Saturday night."

A model of 1950s design, but time is up

Abstract: I've said it time and again: We don't celebrate our own. If this was the United States, more people would know about Canada's "Trend House" program; there'd probably be a book about it, too, just like the ones on California's "Case Study House" program.

Full text: Montreal's Trend House, one of the few remaining post-and-beam show houses left, faces demolition
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
I've said it time and again: We don't celebrate our own. If this was the United States, more people would know about Canada's "Trend House" program; there'd probably be a book about it, too, just like the ones on California's "Case Study House" program. But that would mean we regard architecture as something that transcends generations, or a teaching tool, or as our collective dreams made real from bricks and mortar.
But we don't, and that's why we're on the verge of losing the Montreal Trend House in suburban Beaconsfield, Que.
"I'm sure many [area residents] have just driven by it and never realized the story behind it," said Michael Goodfellow about his father's design on CBC Montreal's radio program Daybreak the morning of Jan. 28. "It was considered one of his proudest works ... I know it was a project he put a lot of effort into."
Philip F. Goodfellow (1919-1972) was one of 11 architects chosen to design a modernist Trend House. The program began in 1952 with a one-off exhibition home built to showcase B.C. lumber products in Toronto's Thorncrest Village (profiled here in January, 2004), but was so successful the project expanded and 10 more were built. In addition to another home in Toronto by Fleury, Arthur and Calvert, Victoria, Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Regina, Winnipeg, London, Montreal and Halifax each got a home designed by local architects of note.
In Toronto on a business trip the day after his radio interview, Mr. Goodfellow and I sat down for a chat at the home of his son, Phil Goodfellow (an architect like his grandfather) to talk about the fate of his father's Trend House.
"It has been characterized as a rotten wood house that needs to be torn down," he said in disbelief. "That's how the town is characterizing it."
It's true: In the CBC interview, Beaconsfield councillor Brian Ross - one of many who were responsible for granting a demolition permit - states: "[I]t's been neglected for too many years. We have our architect's report that there's very little salvageable left in the house; the original plan had been altered ... so it's not quite the same as it was back in the fifties when it was built."
Citing code issues with the wiring, wood rot and the possibility of mould, he summed up with "there's an awful lot wrong with it."
Funny, I visited the home in July, 2006 and, in addition to remarking at how little the architect's plan had changed, I wrote that the then-owners were busying themselves with a number of improvements. When Mr. Goodfellow and his son visited in 2007, they too were struck at how well the house had held up.
So who's right?
As it was reported in the Montreal Gazette's West Island section by reporter Karen Seidman, the home's new owners, who live across the street, "want to build a home for their older parents so they can be close by." And since the Trend House is not protected by any sort of heritage designation, it's well within their rights to rip it down and do just that. So, yet again, the situation becomes one of preservationists against private interest. And since private interest almost always wins, what then becomes of our architectural history, since almost every building is in private hands?
The very first Trend House, on Rathburn Road in Etobicoke, was torn down in 2006 shortly after its one-and-only owner, Hugh MacDonald, passed away. While the Victoria, Calgary and the second Toronto home enjoy new life by owners who appreciate the architectural pedigree, the fate of the others is unknown.
After suggesting that the Canadian Trend House houses are "equally important" as their American Case Study counterparts, eminent Yale professor and London, England-based architect M.J. Long (who worked in Mr. Goodfellow's office as a young woman) writes in an e-mail: "I think it would be a real shame if [the Montreal house] went. It is a good early example of a really good architect's work. The houses themselves are an important record of that period of architecture. Each [architect] was setting out to do the best possible house for Canada in the fifties."
So what to do?
The younger Mr. Goodfellow suggests that a property tax incentive based on size might encourage retention and restoration of the smaller Trend House over a larger new build. Or, alternatively, Beaconsfield city council could allow the new owners to build the "granny flat" on their own lot, which was what they wanted to do in the first place (they were refused).
"In the same way we trade off density on a certain lot to allow for parkland or public art or social initiatives in the city, is there a way that one could go back to city council and say: 'Could we look at allowing this person a certain amount of overage on their [lot] coverage to retain this home?' " he asks.
We'll see. Beaconsfield council votes Feb. 21.

Full text: Majority of commissioners are expected to vote against proposal to lease office tower near York Mills subway station
CITY HALL BUREAU CHIEF
The TTC's plan to lease a gleaming new headquarters is likely to be killed Wednesday, leaving the transit agency on the hook for up to $2-million to break the deal, The Globe and Mail has learned.
Enough commissioners intend to vote against consolidating the Toronto Transit Commission's offices in a new tower near the York Mills subway station, sources say.
"The problem has always been that it would cost the TTC more than the status quo," said Peter Milczyn, vice-chair of the TTC. "I imagine that most of the commissioners would be skeptical about proceeding with the deal now."
"Based on what I've heard from staff so far, they're not convinced it makes financial sense for the TTC," added TTC chair Karen Stintz, who also represents the proposed site as a local councillor.
Former mayor David Miller and his onetime protegé Adam Giambrone championed the controversial new TTC headquarters as one of their final projects before leaving office.
At Mr. Giambrone's urging, the commission voted 5-4 in late August to sign a conditional offer to lease an environmentally friendly new office tower on a commuter parking lot at 4050 Yonge St. developed by Build Toronto, the city's real-estate corporation.
That offer was signed Oct. 12, two weeks before Rob Ford swept to victory.
Figures obtained by The Globe indicate TTC staff are now seeking approval for up to $2-million to break the conditional lease; however, the final number would likely be lower as two city agencies work together to unwind the deal.
About 1,000 TTC engineers, designers, lawyers and other office staff are currently scattered across five leased locations and two TTC-owned buildings, including its headquarters atop Davisville subway station - an edifice that needs $30-million in repairs and upgrades in the next five years.
Although the transit authority has been shopping for a single home for some time, TTC staff recommended against leasing the 4050 Yonge St. site back in August because they believed it was too expensive.
Build Toronto has been lobbying Mr. Ford's office and his hand-selected commissioners to stick with the deal, which would see the TTC lease 340,000 square feet of the 430,000-square-foot, seven-storey office tower, with an option to lease an additional 20,000 square feet on the main floor for a TTC museum.
Build Toronto was concerned about the fallout if the deal was scrapped, according to a copy of the presentation the agency made to the mayor's transition team, dated Dec. 15.
If the TTC intends to back out of the deal, the document recommends finalizing a communications strategy by Jan. 5 with the objective of "maintaining the integrity of the TTC," and "maintaining the reputation of Build Toronto as a credible deal maker."
In a letter to commissioners dated Jan. 25, also obtained by The Globe, Build Toronto's president, Lorne Braithwaite, argues the TTC's number crunchers aren't properly calculating how much the TTC could save by consolidating office space.
"The TTC chart shows that moving to 4050 Yonge is more expensive by $14-million to the TTC and by $3.3-million overall to the city when all real estate values are considered," the letter reads.
But by Build's calculations, the deal could produce a "net present value benefit" to the city over 20 years of an estimated $75-million.
That's why there's still a possibility enough commissioners could change their minds and vote to salvage the deal after the TTC's closed-door session Wednesday.
If the TTC pulls out, Build Toronto is confident it can find another anchor tenant for a cutting-edge building next to a GO Transit and TTC station.
"We know that this is a very desirable location and a premier office opportunity," said John Macintyre, Build Toronto's senior vice-president for corporate affairs. "So we will continue to market that site to potential tenants and we have a number that we are already talking to."

Shoring up after a 'perfect storm'

Abstract: The perfect storm hit us. We were converting from a private company to a public company and there were many changes associated with that. It wasn't always popular with the people we have here. So we did have some attrition. We lost some of our good people. And we lost marginal people who weren't succeeding. My own personal philosophy, however, is I'd rather see a leaner, meaner organization than a lot of people who aren't productive. We now have 300 agents across Canada.

Full text: Vowing to pick up the pieces following a post-merger rough patch, DTZ Barnicke chairman Tom McCarthy talks about recession, corporate distractions and neglecting the people 'who put the suits on our backs'
When J.J. Barnicke Ltd. was sold to global real estate conglomerate DTZ Holdings PLC, the deal was hailed as a lifesaver for the Canadian commercial brokerage.
After years of struggling to compete with such global giants as Colliers International and CB Richard Ellis, the $26.6-million DTZ deal promised a stronger international network and deeper ties among its agents across the country. Indeed, just before the deal was sealed in 2007, J.J. Barnicke - which was just two years from its 50th anniversary - lost two significant international relationships because of its lack of reach beyond Canada's borders.
The deal couldn't have come at a worse time, however. The recession was about to corrode both the number of deals and the amount of money spent on real estate services in Canada, and the distraction of becoming a public company proved a challenge.
Now, the Canadian arm of DTZ is looking for its third chief executive officer since the merger and vowing to get back on track. Chairman Tom McCarthy has been tasked with revitalizing the company as the economy shows signs of recovery.
Where does your CEO search stand?
We are in the market for a high-profile individual. The outgoing CEO, Alan Colquhoun, came from our European division in Poland, and he was here to integrate our organization into the global network. Now that the company is to be back in Canadian management's hands it's very important for us to get back to the core business that we are in - the transaction business. I hope we can get someone in fairly short order to take care of the administrative stuff. For now I'm here to get the ball moving after a difficult and brutal recession.
How were you affected by the
recession?
The perfect storm hit us. We were converting from a private company to a public company and there were many changes associated with that. It wasn't always popular with the people we have here. So we did have some attrition. We lost some of our good people. And we lost marginal people who weren't succeeding. My own personal philosophy, however, is I'd rather see a leaner, meaner organization than a lot of people who aren't productive. We now have 300 agents across Canada.
What sort of changes did the merger bring?
In a public company there is so much more reporting. They bring in HR people. The entire transparency of a public company is so vastly different than when the company was private, when it was basically our own rules as management. It's a very different culture to work for.
How did that affect the day-to-day operations of the company?
When the public company thing took place the integration made us lose the connection that is the heart and soul of our business - transactions and relationships. We got away from the basics, where the client is the king. This business is not about filling forms in - we never did any of that before.
We worked hard every day, all day looking for new opportunities. Without criticizing my own people I can tell you the transition from a private company to public got our focus switched to other areas.
What do you do differently to keep people around now?
We need to nurture and provide support as the economy moves into expansion. Consider most of our clients are corporations and most of our revenues come from commissions or fees. So most of the people that we deal with in our company are in their minds independent contractors who are commission-driven. It's a challenge to manage them because they are eat-what-you-kill people. They see themselves as hunters, not skinners. It's difficult to tell someone who is in the commission business - so they are self-funding - to tell them what to do. You can just support them and lead by example.
Competition is tough out there, though. How can they compete?
The brokerage industry in Canada is very well served by the people in it. I don't want to criticize my competition; they are excellent. It's a matter of choice - you need to distinguish yourself among those people.
We need to look at training people to provide a wider range of service so we're on their staff and not their payroll. They need to view us as their real estate department. We'd better be prepared for that so they see us as a resource. The idea of nurturing existing relationships is very important.
But what specifically will your people be doing differently?
They need to have a higher level of contact with decision makers such as CEOs and CFOs. There's no point in getting in touch with a guy who is perhaps a purchasing agent - you need to get to the decision makers and you better have a value proposition when you talk to them.
All we have to sell is information services and some negotiating skills. We need to speak their language. Better financial skills. I'm not a proponent of cold calls - warm calls are easier to deal with. We need to spend a lot of time on good training to build communications skills.
What will the DTZ worldwide brand mean to you as you work to develop new business?
We have a joint global mandate with CBRE with Shell [International] that they served to us on a silver platter, for example. We manage retail and real estate operations - we have about 10 people working pretty much full time on that account. That tells you we would like to mine the opportunities that are there with DTZ. That's going to be helpful and important to us - our Shell work emanates from their global positioning.
But the focus remains
on Canada?
The bulk of the revenue for this company will be in Canada. Most of the opportunities will have nothing to do with the worldwide situation, but in time it can be a combination of both. Our business is still largely local. It's not as if we have something exclusive to us - all of our competitors have excellent representation here. Now is the time to [focus on] existing clients and provide information; if you're going to be silent it's suicide in this market. This is not the time to forget the people who put the suits on our backs and the cars in our driveways.

Ontario to merge agencies as part of cost-cutting plan

Author: Howlett, Karen

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/ontario-merge-agencies-as-part-cost-cutting-plan/docview/847089888/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Last summer, Ontario Realty's offices were raided by the Ontario Provincial Police as part of a criminal probe into "irregular" financial dealings by a former employee. In a separate, long-running case dating back to 2000, the Ontario government spent about $23-million in legal and consultant fees pursuing allegations of bid rigging and fraud at Ontario Realty.

Full text:   The Ontario government plans to merge the Crown corporation that manages the province's real estate assets with its in-house infrastructure arm.
Ontario Realty Corp. will no longer exist as a standalone entity with its own board of directors and senior executives once it is folded into Infrastructure Ontario, a senior government source confirmed on Monday.
Finance Minister Dwight Duncan plans to announce the merger at a news conference on Tuesday at the provincial legislature.
Sources close to the government said having just one entity oversee the management of real estate assets and major infrastructure projects, including building hospitals, roads and bridges, will save money for the cash-strapped province.
Mr. Duncan announced last month that he plans to eliminate a dozen provincial agencies. The austerity measure is aimed at helping the province manage through hard times and erase its record $18.7-billion deficit.
"We have a record of finding value for taxpayer dollars and making government work better for people," said a government official who asked not to be named. "We will continue with our plan to reduce the number of government agencies by 5 per cent and redirect savings from the back office to front-line public services like schools and hospitals and reducing the deficit."
The Progressive Conservatives pre-empted the upcoming news conference with their own statement on Monday evening, questioning the government's commitment to reviewing Crown entities.
"While the McGuinty Liberals try to pass this announcement off as a restraint measure," the Tories said, "their laughable record on restraint at these two agencies speaks for itself."
The Tories noted that the number of employees at both entities on the so-called Sunshine list - those who make $100,000 or more a year - has jumped in recent years. The number at Ontario Realty has grown to 117 from 45 in 2003, the year the McGuinty government took office. The number at Infrastructure Ontario has grown to 68 from 13 since 2006.
Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak called last month for a "sunset review" of all provincial agencies, boards and commissions to determine whether they can justify their ongoing value.
Much of the criticism centres on the Ontario Power Authority, an electricity planning entity that has ballooned to more than 300 employees, and the 14 provincially appointed health agencies known as Local Health Integration Networks.
Ontario Realty, by contrast, attracted attention when employees became embroiled in controversy. The corporation manages one of the largest real estate portfolios in Canada on behalf of the provincial government. Assets owned or leased by it consist of vacant land as well as more than 6,000 buildings, including office towers, heritage buildings, courthouses and jails.
Last summer, Ontario Realty's offices were raided by the Ontario Provincial Police as part of a criminal probe into "irregular" financial dealings by a former employee. In a separate, long-running case dating back to 2000, the Ontario government spent about $23-million in legal and consultant fees pursuing allegations of bid rigging and fraud at Ontario Realty.
The government sued four Ontario Realty employees and a group of outside contractors in 2000 for more than $35-million relating to about 40 transactions. After pursuing the case for more than seven years, lawyers acting for the government ended up going after seven of the transactions. The Ontario Realty employees and one contractor pleaded guilty to a variety of criminal offences, including accepting kickbacks and forging bids. All three agreed to make restitution and received conditional sentences with no jail time.
Bill Moore, a spokesman for Ontario Realty, declined to comment on Monday evening.

Full text:   Rob Ford's pledge to contract out garbage collection is one of the reasons he's in office. But maybe it's time for a reality check: Iron-clad job-security provisions in the unions' contracts and the unwavering resolve of workers mean that an all-out commitment to privatization could ultimately put Mayor Ford at the centre of a labour crisis
kgrant@globeandmail.com
CITY HALL BUREAU CHIEF
When Rob Ford campaigned, he made contracting out garbage sound easy.
But imagine this: It's one year from today, and Mayor Ford is waging an impressive war on Toronto's public-sector unions over who takes out the trash.
He's already won a key council vote in favour of contracting out garbage pickup. He's served CUPE Local 416 with the requisite three-months notice that privatization is imminent.
Now garbage haulers and thousands of other city workers have been shivering on the picket line for three weeks - not because they decided to strike, but because Mayor Ford locked them out the minute their contracts expired at 12:01 a.m., Jan. 1.
He's hired scabs to empty the temporary dumps and security guards to keep the picketers in line.
All Mayor Ford needs now is to summon the guts his predecessor lacked while he waits for big labour to cave on the job-security guarantees that make it nearly impossible for Toronto to save cash through privatization.
Reverie aside, easy is the last thing that this process is going to be.
Even if the mayor takes the hardest line imaginable - the storyline above - the ironclad job-security language in the unions' contracts could stymie his efforts to save anything near the $49-million the C.D. Howe Institute predicted garbage privatization could trim from Toronto's annual budget.
That's a big problem for Mr. Ford, who badly needs new sources of savings and revenue to kill a land-transfer tax that is expected to rake in $220-million this year - more than the net budgets of the transportation and municipal licensing departments combined. If Mr. Ford intends to keep his word on the real-estate tax and balance a 2012 budget that won't be engorged with David Miller's leftover surpluses, he'll have to radically remake Toronto's business model in the span of a single budget.
He's already ordered a third-party management review of all city departments, starting with the biggest fish; he has asked for a list of city assets to sell; and he plans to launch a comprehensive review of the fees Toronto charges for everything from recreation programs to building permits.
Contracting out garbage is part of the plan too. But what if, as the mayor's own deputy concedes, it takes years and a piecemeal approach to privatize garbage collection in Toronto, if it can happen at all?
In the meantime, Mr. Ford would most likely find himself ensnared in a war whose outcome is a Pyrrhic victory at best.
"I think it'd be a huge issue," John Cartwright, president of the powerful Toronto and York Region Labour Council, said of contracting out. "I think it's a recipe for tremendous labour unrest."
THE UNION ISSUE
The challenge facing the Ford administration is the sheer size of the Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 416's solid-waste work force and the job-security provisions in their existing deal, which expires Dec. 31, 2011.
In Toronto, there are the equivalent of 920 permanent, front-line staff collecting garbage, recyclables, composting and hazardous waste from curbs, high-rise buildings, businesses, public litter bins and elsewhere. Another 335 work in transfer and disposal, according to city spokeswoman Juanita Christmas.
CUPE Local 416's current contract compels the municipal government to find another job for every permanent worker displaced by privatization - meaning a mayor who has vowed to reduce staff through attrition would have to break his word and absorb as many as 1,255 positions into the existing municipal work force if he tried to contract out the whole service in one fell swoop.
How large an impediment is that?
"Big. Big," Deputy Mayor Doug Holyday concedes. "In Etobicoke, we did not have our hands tied behind our backs like that."
Mr. Holyday, who was mayor of the old municipality when it privatized curbside pickup in 1995, is now chair of council's employee and labour relations committee and one of Mr. Ford's point men on privatization.
It's too early to predict whether Mr. Ford would try to snatch the union's job-security blanket when the next round of bargaining heats up in early 2012, Mr. Holyday said.
"But I imagine they'd fight tooth and nail over that. Why wouldn't they? They should never have had it in the first place."
It was Mel Lastman who, in 1999, first agreed to guarantee jobs for all municipal workers with 10 years of service or more.
If privatization displaced an employee, he or she could slide into a post of equal pay; if forced into a job that paid less, the worker would be entitled to the old, higher wage for 30 months, or 60 months if within five years of retirement.
In 2002, Mr. Lastman tried to water down the provision, prompting a 16-day strike over what he derided as "jobs for life."
Thanks to a little divine intervention in the form of a looming Papal visit, Queen's Park legislated workers back and punted the contract to an arbitrator who strengthened the job-security language.
If "jobs for life" still applied solely to those with a decade or more of service, then only 534 of the 920 bodies in front-line solid waste, for example, would be shielded from privatization.
But in 2005, David Miller extended the guarantee to all permanent employees regardless of seniority, a concession that attracted scant public attention at the time.
Mark Ferguson, the president of Local 416, said maintaining the existing job-security language is a top priority for his members and the members of Local 79, which represents inside workers and usually strikes in concert with Local 416. In 2009, they spent 39 days on the picket line in part to guard a sick-bank benefit eliminated long ago in most of the private sector. The perk is a frill compared to the job guarantee.
No amount of time on the picket line would convince the union to give it up.
"And an arbitrator would never take it away," Mr. Ferguson correctly points out.
During the election campaign, Mr. Ford repeatedly invited Local 416 to bid if Toronto puts some or all of its solid-waste services out to tender.
But Local 416, which represents more than 8,000 staff, won't bid. "We're not an employer," Mr. Ferguson said. "It's an impossible situation for him to ask."
None of this has dissuaded Mayor Ford from his election pledge. His brother and consigliere, Councillor Doug Ford, says the administration remains "100 per cent" committed to contracting out garbage.
"They'll have better service for better cost," he said. "I hope people don't have short memories and forget about the [39] days they held us hostage."
If the Ford brothers really are determined to take on the unions, they could do worse than looking to Windsor, where private haulers began taking out the trash last month.
THE WINDSOR MODEL
As the mayor of a union town, Windsor's Eddie Francis knew he was in for a fierce fight when a municipal workers' strike began in the spring of 2009.
So he crafted a fight plan: He invited private companies to haul away the garbage, largely sparing Windsorites the smelly mountains of trash that filled Toronto's parks the same summer.
The tactic enraged labour leaders, but helped keep the public in management's corner as the strike dragged on for 101 days.
In the end, Mr. Francis eliminated post-retirement benefits for new hires and paved the way for contracting out daycare, parking enforcement and garbage, which a private company began collecting on Dec. 13. Contracting out garbage is expected to save $8.9-million over seven years.
His steeliness also paved the way for a triumph at the polls.
Last October, voters in Windsor - a city of 216,000, where one-third of workers carry a union card - re-elected Mr. Francis with 56 per cent of the vote. While they were at it, they booted Ken Lewenza Jr., son of the national president of the Canadian Auto Workers union, from council.
"Without a doubt," Mr. Francis said, "the strike was a turning point for the city."
Windsor, however, had a huge advantage over Toronto.
In the border city's case, contracting out residential trash and recycling collection to Turtle Island Recycling Corp. - the same company that picks up trash in Etobicoke - displaced just 49 city employees, according to Anne-Marie Albidone, Windsor's manager of environmental services.
Windsor absorbed them all into its parks and recreation department.
Given all the obstacles to privatization in Toronto, even Mr. Holyday concedes that a go-slow approach might be the city's only option.
"It can be done, it just would be done at a slower rate," he said. "You could just keep increasing the size of the contractor's area and shrinking ours, till you got to the balance that you wanted."
There is another way out - and it's a solution Mr. Ferguson said the union would embrace.
"We could increase the productivity of our own people and the efficiency of our own collection," Mr. Holyday said. "I would be happy with either. I'm not so hard and fast on saying contracting out is the only answer."

Abstract: I'm a tactile person, and am known for my need to touch and feel anything that I'm considering using in every room. Your home isn't just filled with decorative objects that look good. Your nest should be feathered with elements that feel good, especially if they're coming in contact with newborn skin.

Full text:   In the nursery, aim for fun and flexible decor that will stand the test of time
srichardson@globeandmail.com
The arrival of a new baby signals a fresh start and the opportunity to celebrate with excitement and exuberance. But it's important to balance the needs of a tiny little human with thoughts of the future. I've always been a proponent of taking a long view towards nursery decor and of trying to avoid the urge to festoon the room in cutesy motifs - decorations that will soon feel outdated or juvenile for the room of a rapidly growing child. Instead of embracing all things adorable in nursery decor, I try to branch out and create a collection of fun yet flexible pieces that will stand the test of time.
The Save
We're told that newborns only see black and white and that stimulating their brain development with bold patterns is important. Why not make an artistic statement while embracing the early development of your baby? Take a trip to your local bookstore or stationery shop and see what you can find to frame up. How about a fabulous set of flash cards depicting all your favourite animals in bold black and white? They add an immediate hit of bold contrast.
The Splurge
I can't resist the opportunity to make the most of every surface and every element of an existing space. When thinking about a baby's room, I found myself occupied with thoughts of staring at the ceiling, which morphed into imagining how to apply the principle of "blue-sky" thinking to this room. Before long, my musings of clouds drifting along in a bright blue sky had transformed into a plan that involved applying bold blue and white paisley wallpaper to the ceiling of this little guy's room. Why not think of your ceiling as the fifth wall, and make it a feature instead of a non-starter? And if you're still wondering why, I can explain it this way - if you put a traditional paisley pattern on the walls, I think the effect would be busy and formal and very traditional in feel. But, if you take a traditional element and apply it or use it in an unexpected way, it takes on a more fun, contemporary feel.
The Signature Sarah
I'm all for re-imagining just about anything and feel that you shouldn't be limited to selecting furniture that fits the exact description of what you "need." Many elements of nursery decor are simple short-lived necessities as opposed to long-term staples. Take the change table, for example. If all goes well in the world of potty training, you'll only use this piece of furniture for a couple of years. Instead of wasting dollars on what's soon destined to become a dinosaur in your home, why not branch out and select something that provides a more flexible solution? I found a solid oak server for under $150 that offered the ideal solution for a change table (for now), and will be a useful piece elsewhere in the home (for later). If you're thinking of trying a similar solution, just be sure to check that the top of the piece of furniture will accommodate the size of a change pad and you'll be off to the races in your own re-imagining revitalization.
And a few more 101 lessons:
Link the eye line
If you're pondering pattern on the ceiling, be sure to create a visual connection that helps focus your sightline at eye level. By dressing the window in a strong blue and white geometric pattern, we were able to seamlessly connect the window to the ceiling and create interest at eye level.
Don't be too serious
Even if you're trying to decorate for the long haul, remember that kids' rooms need to fun and playful. Look to inexpensive fabrics and patterns to add a sense of whimsy. My sidekick, Tommy Smythe, is a devotee of ball fringe, so we invested a grand total of less than $30 to edge our fun and funky drapes with a band of black ball fringe. I know this won't be to everyone's taste, but it makes me smile every time I see it. I encourage you to find the elements and embellishments that make you smile when you walk into a room.
Get over the glider
It seems that a glider or baby rocker is considered a must have. I have a predisposition to react against anything that I'm told I must use, and immediately want to find a better solution. The reality is that there will be late nights, early mornings, not enough sleep, and lots of nursing with a newborn. BUT there's no rule that says you need to be chained to a decoratively uninspired piece of furniture during all these sleep-deprived days. Trust me on this one (I did the rocker for Baby 1 and never used it for Baby 2). If you can find a groovy chair that's easy to get in and out of (so you don't wake the dozing baby), with a high back (so you can rest your head), you're golden. During my quest for an alternative solution, I happened to find one that rocks AND swivels AND is covered in punchy orange felt, all for under $500.
Say it with stripes
Even if you'd never consider embracing my idea of applying paisley punch to your ceiling, you might want to wake up your walls with some sporty stripes. Start by extracting a collection of colours that appear in one of your key fabrics, and then match them to paint chips and buy a quart of each. Use painter's masking tape to mark wide bands in varying widths along the length of the wall. Don't make the stripes too narrow as they will accentuate any unevenness in your taping job. Use a small roller or brush and you'll have a dramatically dynamic wall of stripes in no time.
Look to dad's closet
I'm a tactile person, and am known for my need to touch and feel anything that I'm considering using in every room. Your home isn't just filled with decorative objects that look good. Your nest should be feathered with elements that feel good, especially if they're coming in contact with newborn skin. Shirting cotton that is commonly used for men's dress shirts is some of the finest, smoothest fabric I've ever touched. It's also reasonably priced at $12 a yard and under for silky-feeling, 100-per-cent cotton.You'll only need a few yards to create custom pillows, sheets and duvet covers, and your baby will have the best nest to inspire deep sleeps!

The back story
When Holly Sedgwick's marriage went wrong in the 1990s, she packed her six kids into a car and drove north out of New York to Toronto, the city she had known as a girl when enrolled in a Canadian ballet summer school program.
"I remember first coming here on a bus, and it was the first time I had felt independent," says the American singer/songwriter/painter/dancer whose sister is the actress Kyra Sedgwick (married to actor Kevin Bacon) and whose cousin was Edie Sedgwick, Andy Warhol's late muse.
"Life changes, that's what I believe in, and I felt that in Toronto I'd find a fresh start."
Her main objective was to give her children a safe and nurturing home and so she went looking for a large house in which to accommodate her sizable brood after first slogging it out in a rental in the suburbs.
She eventually found what she was looking for in the city's west end, close to the Etobicoke School of the Arts where the majority of her kids were enrolled. The stately Tudor, built circa 1920s, boasts six bathrooms and seven bedrooms, one each for all the children under her skirts.
"I'm a Buddhist and I was fanatic about my religion when married to my Japanese husband. I felt my duty was to make children, and as many as I could, and so in six years I produced six. It was a miracle, and I was thrilled I could do it," says Ms. Sedgwick, who was born in Montreal 56 years ago. "They became my art, my true passion."
After moving into the house she adopted another child, a local boy who had befriended one of her sons and who came from a broken home. Having survived a less-than-rosy domestic situation herself, Ms. Sedgwick felt she could afford to be generous.
"The house was big enough," she says, "and by bringing that child into our lives we all grew closer. The house nurtured us all through a great period of love and transition."
The neighbourhood
High on top a hill with bucolic views extending over the nearby Humber River and Lake Ontario to the south, the house is located on Riverside Drive, a quiet, tree-lined and gentrified street, where Anne of Green Gables author Lucy Maud Montgomery used to live.
The house next door was her home, named Journey's End, and Montgomery lived there from 1935 until her death in 1942. A historic plaque dedicated to her memory stands in a nearby park. The neighbourhood's atmosphere of artistic creation permeates the Sedgwick house which has produced a few artists of its own. Ms. Sedgwick's son George Nozuka is today a rhythm and blues singer better known by his stage name, George, while Justin Nozuka is a singer-songwriter whose debut album, Holly, was named for you-know-who. When her sons started touring, Ms. Sedgwick admits to feeling envious: Creating music was her dream, too. "So I turned the garage into an artist's studio and cut my own album," she says.
Best feature
The house is designed with a surfeit of windows that flood the interior with light and warmth. One of the sunniest is the eat-in kitchen whose five slender and rectangular windows overlook the Humber River and the in-ground pool that Ms. Sedgwick installed shortly after moving in with her brood in 2002.
Ms. Sedgwick calls the kitchen her favourite room in the house. "It's like a tree house," she says.
She wrote her memoirs at the kitchen table, a yet-to-be-published book documenting her upbringing in Washington, D.C. as the stepdaughter of Philip M. Stern, the American philanthropist, author and former Democratic Party activist who once worked in the John F. Kennedy administration.
Ms. Sedgwick says she grew up used to having dinner with such illustrious guests as John Kenneth Galbraith, the Canadian-American economist who frequently graced her parent's dinner table.
Yet despite the nannies, the chauffeurs, the summers at ballet school, a teenager's apartment in New York's famed Dakota, Ms. Sedgwick's life wasn't the stuff of her famous sister's Hollywood movies. Darkness tinges her life's story, so much so that she has lately taken to converting her autobiography into a work of fiction - the names changed to protect the guilty - rewriting it all in her sunny Riverside Drive kitchen.
"The house has been an inspiration to me," she says. "I've loved creating in it."
When it sells the plan is to move back to Washington, to be close to her mother, a major influence on Ms. Sedgwick's book, art and fascinating life.

Full text:   Simons department store looks to add a dozen locations as U.S. retailers plan entries into Canada
RETAILING REPORTER
Quebec retail magnate Peter Simons is a fan of U.S. discount giant Target Corp. - he checks out its stores frequently and has even used its affordable fashion concept as inspiration for lines at his La Maison Simons department stores.
Now that Mr. Simons is set to launch his first Simons mega-store outside Quebec - in 2012, several months before Target's planned arrival - he's sending his staff south to study his impending rival more carefully.
The Simons store opening next year in West Edmonton Mall will be the first of about a dozen he envisions for the rest of Canada, adding to seven in Quebec (an eighth is slated for 2013) - bringing his total to roughly 20 in the next decade or so.
But Simons is stepping up its game at a time when competition is intensifying as new entrants invade the Canadian market. An array of U.S. retailers, including clothier J. Crew, are set to cash in on this country's relatively buoyant economy by rolling out new outlets over the next few years. Others, such as department-store chains Nordstrom and J.C. Penney, are studying a foray into Canada. The jockeying is also highlighting a dearth of retail space.
Simons, a fashion destination for Quebeckers, is betting that its mix of cheap-chic styles and pricey designer lines will resonate outside of Quebec, including in the United States. By later this year, Simons will expand its e-commerce, currently available across Canada, to U.S. customers.
"We've looked at Target's merchandise and will continue to do it," said Mr. Simons, 46, who at 6 foot 5 inches stands out in the crowd in a three-piece pin-striped suit. "You have to be very conscious of your competition, below you and above you [in price]. I've visited a lot of Target stores. Now that they're coming, yes, we'll look at them again, much more closely."
The family-owned business, founded in 1840 by Mr. Simons' great-great-grandfather, faces other hurdles in branching out in Canada, such as the Bay, which is bolstering its performance under new leadership (and U.S. ownership). As well, Simons remains an unfamiliar banner in English Canada - putting added pressure on Mr. Simons to get it all right.
"It can be a very tight market," said Harley Oberfeld, chief executive officer of Oberfeld Snowcap in Montreal, one of Canada's top retail-real estate advisors. "But Simons is extremely good at what they do and there's no doubt in my mind that they're going to be successful wherever they open in Canada,"
When Simons expanded from its base in Quebec City into Montreal in 1999, it was unfamiliar to many people in that city but quickly took off, Mr. Oberfeld said. "You walk into a Simons store and it's busy - there's action."
The action seems to translate into business. With sales of more than $300-million, privately held Simons generates $600-plus of sales per square foot - more than three times those at the Bay, Mr. Simons said. It does it by selling $10 store-brand Twik T-shirts, similar to ones available at cheap-chic Swedish rival H & M, along with $5,000 Balmain dresses. Each store is designed differently in a bid to keep customers longer: the downtown Montreal store, for instance, features a specially commissioned $300,000 suspended glass sculpture by late Montreal artist Guido Molinari.
Mr. Simons estimated that he invests almost seven times more in his stores than the Bay, which is in the midst of a major overhaul. "I think it will pay off in the long run."
The chain's relatively high productivity allows it to place four to five times more staff on the floor, compared with the average North American department store, he said. New items arrive daily, compared with closer to twice a year even five years ago.
Mr. Simons borrows a page from the Target playbook by gambling on talented designers, providing them with a retail platform as well as help to produce their work.
Mr. Simons is counting on his formula to work outside Quebec, but with some twists. His Edmonton store will respond to local tastes by carrying more casual wear - including jeans - and less high-end dressy clothing, he said. It will stock larger sizes - people in that city are on average two sizes bigger than Quebeckers, his research found.
He's also learned from his mistakes. He doubled the size of one of his Quebec City stores last fall but sales didn't meet his targets. The layout is more open and "free-flowing" than the ones in his other outlets, making it a little more confusing for customers to figure out different departments.
Today one of his big challenges is finding the right space for his stores, which at up to 100,000 square feet each are more than 10 times larger than many clothing outlets. Landlords are often locked into long-term leases with anchor tenants or restrictive rules with other retailers, which ban newcomers such as Simons from setting up shop in the same retail category.
Mr. Oberfeld predicted that with creative thinking and re-working spaces, landlords will find room for Simons. Mr. Simons, who has been on the hunt for ideal locations for the past five years, is looking for stores in Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Calgary and Winnipeg.
"I'm gambling that there are places in the country where people are ready for a more unique, less cookie-cutter experience," Mr. Simons said.

Abstract: Ken Simon, chief executive officer of Menehune Water, a U.S.-based exporter of "Hawaii Water" with 130 employees and an office in suburban Tokyo, says the weak dollar gives his company, and its local distributors, a "13-per-cent advantage" over Japanese water suppliers. "It helps us export our product. It's better for U.S. companies trying to sell in Japan, though it's still hard to get into."

Full text:   The companies that are the lifeblood of the economy are being forced to step outside their comfort zone
Amid the gleaming displays of global exporters such as Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. and Sony Corp., it's hard to find smaller firms among the 750 companies gathered at a recent trade show at Tokyo's Big Site exhibition hall.
Companies such as Kanehiro Electric and Winroader are tucked away near a back wall. Far from the limelight, they and about 4.7 million other small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the lifeblood of Japan's economy, employing about 30 million Japanese, more than twice that of Japan's 13,000 large corporations.
But SMEs are suffering as Japan's currency soars. The yen is up 50 per cent against the U.S. dollar in the past five years and gained about 12 per cent in 2010, despite government interventions in currency markets in September.
"The strong yen really hurts smaller companies in Japan," says Isamu Tezuka, a senior manager of Kanehiro Electric, which has three factories and about 70 employees in western Japan. "It's difficult to sell outside of Japan because our products are too expensive."
Mr. Tezuka would love to export LED lights outside of Japan, but with the yen at about 82 to the U.S. dollar, a 15,600-yen LED light that cost $140 (U.S.) three years ago would now cost almost $200.
"We cannot easily lower our costs to compete with exporters from China or [South] Korea, where salaries are much lower than in Japan. Japanese workers are simply too expensive."
Supplying equipment to government offices and major corporations, Kanehiro Electric and other small firms at the lower end of Japan's industrial food chain often have to bear the brunt of plant closings and job losses due to shrinking domestic demand in an aging society.
"There are many small companies like us in Shimane prefecture," where his company is based, Yoshiyuki Ishitobi says. He is one of 30 employees of Tsuchie Juki, which supplies energy-saving products to major manufacturers such as Komatsu and Hitachi. "We are really feeling a big effect of the strong yen in Shimane. We had to cut 10 employees and I'm worried about losing my own job."
Banri Kaieda, Japan's Minister of Economic and Fiscal Policy, says the government is grappling with how to deal with the strong yen, which he blames on market forces, not government policy. "SMEs are the hardest hit by the strong yen," he said on Dec. 7 in answer to a reporter's question at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan. "The major companies will be able to find a way around the strong yen. Some companies are already shifting their operations outside of Japan. But SMEs can't do this."
Mr. Kaieda says the rising yen - a situation known as endaka in Japan - creates a conundrum for his party, which took power in September 2009, when 93 yen bought one U.S. dollar. "SMEs account for 70 per cent of all jobs in Japan, and when they are sapped of vitality, it has a dramatic impact on Japan as a whole, especially in regions that host clusters of SMEs. Some SMEs would like to relocate bases overseas. The government should try to find a way to help them do this, but if they go offshore, it means Japan loses jobs."
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has indeed helped groups of SMEs. In one initiative, it offered support to companies to go on "global passport road shows" this year to Dubai, India, Singapore, Bangkok and Hong Kong.
But this aid is dwarfed by the efforts of global operations of large Japanese concerns, who are trying to take advantage of the strong yen by securing rights to raw materials that are scarce or non-existent in Japan. Toyota Tsusho said last week it will start building a rare-earth processing plant in India next year, and another in Vietnam in 2013. The country normally relies on shipments from China, but is seeking other sources after a recent dispute disrupted supplies. Sojitz Corp. has agreed to purchase rare earths from Australia, while Sumitomo and Mitsubishi have made deals with Kazakhstan and the U.S., respectively.
Japanese citizens, meanwhile, are increasingly shopping overseas, and they have also become net buyers of real estate abroad, according to Finance Ministry figures. The strong yen has aided the efforts of companies ranging from U.S. pizza makers to Australian beef importers to crack a notoriously protective market.
Ken Simon, chief executive officer of Menehune Water, a U.S.-based exporter of "Hawaii Water" with 130 employees and an office in suburban Tokyo, says the weak dollar gives his company, and its local distributors, a "13-per-cent advantage" over Japanese water suppliers. "It helps us export our product. It's better for U.S. companies trying to sell in Japan, though it's still hard to get into."
Mr. Simon says more Japanese companies need to seize the chance to expand overseas or buy up raw materials. "Most companies, big or small, don't have the experience and comfort level to do international business. They don't have the confidence to operate outside their own country. It really is a closed society in Japan."
As Mr. Kaieda says, Japan "cannot afford to become complacent", in light of China's rapid rise. "If we just stay within our borders, this will lead to more pessimism. It is very important for Japan to open up to the world. If SMEs can become genki [healthy and vibrant], then Japan will become genki ."

Full text:   Community leader, business owner, public servant, family matriarch, role model. Born Oct. 8, 1922, in Railton, Ont. Died Nov. 25, 2010, in Kingston following a brief illness, aged 88.
Harvard Professor Robert Putnam describes people from the "Long Civic Generation," those born between 1910 and 1930, as more likely to be active politically than those born before or after. Alice McKeown exemplified this generation of "self-made" citizens.
Descended from Irish immigrants, Alice was born in 1922, in Railton, Ont., the second of seven children of John and Kathleen McKeown. During the Depression, the family moved from the farm in Odessa, Ont., to nearby Portsmouth, where her father found work at Kingston Penitentiary. Alice's mother, among the early vanguard of women to attend Queen's University, instilled in her four daughters a sense of the importance of learning. After attending Notre Dame all-girls high school in Kingston, Alice went directly to the world of work at a local law firm. By the 1960s, she and her business partners were in real estate, developing land and constructing a golf course west of Kingston.
Alice was active in federal politics for many years. From 1968 to 1984, she served as a citizenship court judge in Hamilton and Toronto, as well as chief justice of the citizenship court in Ottawa. Alice became known for her entertainment prowess: Her 1972 Grey Cup party in Hamilton is remembered not only for the Tiger-Cats' on-field win, but also for the post-game celebration.
Sports were a large part of Alice's life. As a hockey fan, she saw younger brother Jack, playing for the Kingston Nylons in 1951, score the first-ever goal at the new Memorial Centre. In the 1960s, when Harry Sinden, later to become general manager of the Boston Bruins, was playing pro hockey for Kingston, Alice gave him a summer job selling real estate. In 1977, as owner of the Amherstview Golf Club, and with Harry's support, she started the Willy Pratt celebrity golf tournament. It raised money for minor hockey over the next 20 years, drawing NHL stars from Wayne Gretzky to Bob Gainey, along with local heroes Doug Gilmour and Don Cherry.
In 1984, Alice retired to Kingston to take a more active role in the operation of her golf course and in community service. She served as board member of Kingston's Hotel Dieu Hospital as well as chairperson of the St. Lawrence Parks Commission and the St. Mary's Cemetery Board. She was a pioneer for women in many ways. She was the first female member of the Kingston Rotary Club, and her response to restrictions on ladies' playing times at golf courses in the 1960s was to build her own. Alice never married, but assumed the role of family matriarch, initiating family-related events from Christmas curling bonspiels to annual golf excursions to Myrtle Beach. She was loyal to her family and friends to her final days.
Not only did she leave a lasting legacy, but also a living legacy by serving as a role model for her many nieces and grandnieces.

Full text:   Ontario Speaker criticizes inaction after court rules to allow construction of condos that would intrude on vista of historic legislature
The Ontario government will not take steps to preserve the picturesque setting of the provincial legislature, despite criticism from the Speaker's Office and measures in other regions across Canada that protect historic buildings from commercial real-estate projects.
Speaker Steve Peters, who lost a court battle this week to block construction of two condominium towers that would intrude on the view of the legislature at Queen's Park, called Friday on Premier Dalton McGuinty's government to step in.
"We need leadership from the top on this issue," Mr. Peters told The Globe and Mail. "They're the only ones who can step forward and protect that view in perpetuity."
He said he is "troubled" by the government's refusal to put heritage legislation in place to protect Queen's Park from real-estate projects that compromise the skyline surrounding the building. Mr. McGuinty's lack of action stands in stark contrast, he said, to Ottawa and other capitals around the world, including Washington, that have laws to guard the vistas of historic government buildings.
In Ottawa, the Parliament Buildings and the Peace Tower are protected through a height restriction of 300 feet for nearby buildings; it is enshrined in the City of Ottawa's official plan. And in Victoria, the city has established a zoning circle around the provincial legislature, which has the effect of blocking real-estate development, said an official in the Clerk's Office.
"The government and the local municipalities all worked together to ensure that those sight lines would be protected," Mr. Peters said. "Where I'm frustrated is the government is not prepared to grant protection to the most important building in the province."
This was the first time Mr. Peters, the Liberal MPP for the riding of Elgin-Middlesex-London, has publicly criticized his own government since he became Speaker just over three years ago.
But his comments did not convince the government to change its mind.
"The courts have made a decision, and we respect the process that has been undertaken," said Mukunthan Paramalingham, a spokesman for Tourism and Culture Minister Michael Chan.
Mr. Peters said he has exhausted all of his legal avenues. His efforts to appeal a decision by the Ontario Municipal Board, giving the green light to the condo project, was the last step available to him.
Now that he has lost his fight in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, there is nothing blocking Menkes Developments, the real-estate company behind the proposed condo towers, from going ahead with the project.
The OMB ruled last March that replacing the Four Seasons Hotel on Avenue Road with 44- and 48-storey condo towers was consistent with provincial and city planning policies.
But heritage experts and Mr. Peters raised alarms about the project, because the towers will poke up from the gables of the legislature and alter the skyline looking north on University Avenue toward Queen's Park.
"They're going to stick out like a sore thumb," Mr. Peters said.
The Speaker had the support of the New Democrats. One of its members introduced a private member's bill last year to preserve the dignity of the legislative building but failed to win all-party support for it.
"What's tragic is that the government has failed to join the Speaker in his pursuit of maintaining the pristine quality of the site of Queen's Park," NDP MPP Peter Kormos told reporters on Friday.
Queen's Park is not the only provincial legislature embroiled in controversy over a proposed real-estate development. An ambitious plan for a new convention centre in Nova Scotia's capital has met with a mixed reaction.
Phil Pacey of the Heritage Trust said in an interview that the centre would block the view from Citadel Hill in Halifax. The city has laws protecting the view from four key vantage points. However, a clause was added in 2009, allowing a developer to double the height of a building if a government funds the project. The developer is seeking funding from the federal government.
"We clearly are hoping that they won't," Mr. Pacey said.

Full text:   Architect Kyra Clarkson's addition of clerestory window invites sunlight into upper floor
jmays@globeandmail.com
All renovations of old Toronto houses are not created equal. A number of amateur updates I've seen around town - especially from the early period of the local craze for antique brick dwellings - are remarkably careless.
As I've found, it's just not good enough to hire a few workers and turn them loose to gut and strip out everything that gives the building character, then splash the interior with buckets of white paint. The result may be more ostentatiously "modern" than what was there before, but it almost always lacks soul, a sense of home, and a properly respectful attitude toward the neighbourhood and the streetscape. We need to have those civilized qualities in the houses we inhabit, quite as much as we need food and fresh air and beauty.
Last week, I visited a modest Riverdale reno that effectively embodies this desirable placemaking. It's the handiwork of Toronto architect Kyra Clarkson, who has brought to her project both flair and punch.
The problem handed Ms. Clarkson by her clients - he's a lawyer, she's a doctor - involved opening up their typical Riverdale Edwardian to make way for a growing family. There were considerable constraints on how this could be done. For one thing, the house fit very tightly on its lot, so no lateral expansion was possible. And any proposal that entailed dropping an extra level on top of the house (which featured two storeys plus an attic) would certainly run afoul of city planning regulations.
The building, I should add, had already undergone one previous revision, in 2003. When the lawyer and doctor moved in that year, they asked Toronto architect Joe Lobko to consolidate the interior, which had been chopped up into flats, and break open the wall at the rear of the house. Mr. Lobko's ground floor overhaul created an attractive flow of space from the kitchen (perched above the street in this hillside residence), through the dining area to the living room and beyond, to the outdoor terrace at the back. The clients wanted Mr. Lobko's design on the house's entrance level to be retained.
Which left Ms. Clarkson with the second floor and the attic to work with. Here, the architect made some interesting moves. She devoted the entire second level, for example, to the family's sociable activities. There's a playroom for the children (three, six and eight years old), and a family room. Large windows fore and aft admit south and north light into the middle of this storey - a welcome brightening of the usually dark interior of any old Toronto house. The biggest challenge, however, was the attic, where all the bedrooms now had to go. Ms. Clarkson's response to this test was deft and imaginative. She obtained permission from the city to pop up the roof a few feet, thereby creating a clerestory that invites sunlight into the hallway linking the three bedrooms. These bedrooms are not large. They couldn't be.
But each has a distinctive character. The bright master suite has been furnished with a wide, handsome window that overlooks the laneway and nearby backyards. The bedroom for the three-year-old, at the middle of this level, is tall and quiet, with natural light filtering down from a high strip of windows. The couple's two boys, six and eight, have a delightful room out of a story book: Their large dormer window, an expansion of a feature in the house's original plan, permits a very urban, panoramic view of the street and the city beyond.
Ms. Clarkson's attic scheme serves well the practical demands of a young, modern family that doesn't mind lots of travelling up and down stairs. (I found the stairs uncommonly steep, and their transparent glass sides made them seem precarious, though my apprehension about climbing up and down the staircase may be due to personal idiosyncrasy.)
But Ms. Clarkson's craft goes beyond structure here, into the service of the family's aesthetic needs. I especially appreciated the architect's use of intense colour in the attic: a cascade of bright yellow paint on the walls of the corridor, for example, and the expanse of vivid cobalt blue tile in the bathroom.
Architects should be bolder about proposing strong colour in their renovations, and their clients should be less easily pleased by the same old flat, white wall treatments. Colour can bring spatial richness and refinement to any architectural scheme, and it does exactly that job in Kyra Clarkson's thoughtful Riverdale enhancement.

Full text:   The Harper government took office on a promise to clean up the "revolving door'" between the worlds of government and lobbying. There's just one problem: The lobbying watchdog won't tell the lobbyists what the rules are.
With an election expected as early as this spring, many of the hundreds of government-relations experts who earn their living in Ottawa say Lobbying Commissioner Karen Shepherd is unwilling to explain how much they will be able to contribute to a campaign - or even to party coffers - without creating a conflict of interest.
The larger lobbying firms tend to employ a mixture of people with Liberal or Conservative roots who, historically, have played major roles at election time.
The Conservative government's new Lobbying Act, which came into effect in July of 2008, does not spell out what types of campaign activities can be performed by registered lobbyists. That means it is up to Ms. Shepherd, the country's first commissioner of lobbying, who was appointed in June of 2009, to determine whether the lobbyists are in compliance.
But she refuses to do so until a complaint lands on her desk.
Ms. Shepherd was invited to the annual general meeting of the Government Relations Institute of Canada a couple of months ago to answer questions from the lobbyists who were anxious about the state of uncertainty.
Michael Robinson, a member of the Earnscliffe Strategy Group, who has held many senior volunteer positions within the Liberal Party, asked whether he could help the party in a future campaign.
"I said, 'I have in past election campaigns, and may in the future, be asked to play such diverse roles as to organize and prepare the leader for debates, negotiate with the networks, be the national campaign fundraising chair, or organize the constituency campaign of my local MP. I need to know which of those things am I allowed to do and not be in conflict with the lobby registration guidelines,'" Mr. Robinson said.
"And she said 'I can't tell you.' She said, 'I can only tell you after the fact if somebody lodges a complaint.' It's very frustrating."
Other lobbyists say they have not been able to find out whether they will be able to post campaign signs, make political donations, or work on the local campaign in their own ridings.
Ms. Shepherd declined to be interviewed for this story. Her office replaced the Lobbyists Registrar, which the government said lacked the needed independence and powers to police lobbyists.

THE PROMISES
In its 2006 electoral platform, the Conservative Party promised sweeping changes in response to the sponsorship scandal.
Promises kept
* Ban political donations from businesses and unions, and limit individual donations to $1,000
* Prevent senior government officials from lobbying Ottawa for five years after their retirement
* Bring Crown corporations under the umbrella of the Access to Information Act
Promises broken
* Establish a public appointments commission to ensure that federal nominations are merit-based (the opposition blocked the appointment of the Harper government's nominee, businessman Gwyn Morgan, and no new candidate was proposed)
* Force ministers and senior government officials to register their contacts with lobbyists (instead, lobbyists must register some of their communications with senior federal officials)
* Limit government secrecy by reforming the Access to Information Act according to the recommendations of the information commissioner, and allow public interest to override exemptions (no such changes were made)
Controversies
* The government appointed Kevin Page as Parliamentary Budget Officer, but has frequently slammed his findings and is refusing to boost his powers or budget.
* The government has acted to protect whistle blowers, but Integrity Commissioner Christiane Ouimet, appointed in 2007, recently left after staff complained hundreds of complaints were not investigated properly.

THE BACKGROUND
Julie Couillard caught the public eye in 2007 when she wore a revealing dress to the swearing-in ceremony of her then-boyfriend, Conservative MP Maxime Bernier, as foreign affairs minister.
In 2008, reports revealed that she had ties to members of biker gangs, and the opposition called her a potential security risk. Ms. Couillard had lived with a man who was assassinated in 1996, and she had been married to a member of a biker gang.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper dismissed the concerns as personal matters. Shortly after that, Ms. Couillard alleged that Mr. Bernier had left confidential briefing notes in her home. He was forced to resign.
A Montreal newspaper then revealed Ms. Couillard had quietly promoted a real-estate project to members of the Conservative government, including Mr. Bernier and a senior ministerial aide, who was also forced to resign.
Ms. Couillard wrote a book and became a media commentator while still working in real estate. Her website has not been updated in months.

Abstract: The U.S. Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday publishes its anecdotal survey of business contacts from the Fed's 12 regions, adding local colour to the mounting evidence that the world's biggest economy has reached a point where employers can start replenishing the millions of jobs lost during the recession.

Full text: MUST WATCH
Monday brings a look at executives' thoughts on the speed and strength of the recovery, when the Bank of Canada releases a quarterly survey of businesses across the country.
The results will give Governor Mark Carney and his rate-setting panel a strong "here-and-now" feel for the pulse of Canada's boardrooms and factory floors, as policy-makers prepare their Jan. 18 interest-rate decision and a comprehensive economic forecast due the next day.
Despite many encouraging signs in Canada and the U.S., Mr. Carney isn't likely to move his benchmark interest rate from 1 per cent. Indeed, a report last Friday on the U.S. labour market, perhaps the biggest factor affecting Canada's economic health, was disappointing even as a similar report from Statistics Canada showed employers in this country are creating higher-quality jobs than earlier in the recovery.
Still, the poll of executives could reinforce the views of economists, who believe policy-makers may start tightening again sooner than later.
Two key questions in the survey of about 100 senior managers ask about their hiring intentions and plans for investment in machinery and equipment, something Mr. Carney has urged companies to ramp up so they can compete with overseas rivals and prepare for a world in which the economy won't be able to rely as much on an aging workforce to produce growth.
Should firms indicate they plan to increase both, Mr. Carney will be more confident in the private sector's ability and willingness to drive the recovery this year without the extra crutch of near-record-low borrowing costs.
Also this week, a slew of reports will give a sense of how quickly the housing sector is cooling.
The real-estate market is expected to contribute less to the economy as the year goes by, with mortgages getting more expensive and Canadians becoming preoccupied with trimming their debts. Still, a report last week from Royal LePage suggested the sector could have a stronger-than-anticipated first half of 2011, precisely because buyers may try to close deals before borrowing costs start climbing.
On Monday, Statistics Canada reports building permits from November, on Wednesday the agency reports prices for new homes in the same month, and on Tuesday, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. reports the annual pace of housing starts for the final month of 2010.
SHOULD WATCH
The U.S. Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday publishes its anecdotal survey of business contacts from the Fed's 12 regions, adding local colour to the mounting evidence that the world's biggest economy has reached a point where employers can start replenishing the millions of jobs lost during the recession. Plus, trade reports from Canada and the United States, both due Thursday, and data on U.S. retail sales, could increase the sense that brighter prospects for continental commerce aren't far off.
WORTH NOTING
And now for the cold shower. U.S. inflation data this Friday will probably underscore why minutes from the Fed's Dec. 14 meeting show that even with a drumbeat of positive news, Chairman Ben Bernanke and his officials remain cautious, projecting price gains will be too slow - and unemployment too high - for their liking "for some time." Two other central banks that are widely expected to be on the sidelines for much of 2011, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, hold policy meetings on Thursday.

The sad past of a building with no future

Abstract: In May, Paul Zucchi, a veteran structural engineer retained by the Lalanis, assessed the damage. In a report dated June 15, Mr. Zucchi wrote, "It is our professional opinion that a repair of the building is not viable in its current precarious state. We are concerned that any attempt to work on or stabilize the structure could trigger a further collapse and put the lives of workmen at risk." The "most feasible option," he concluded, was to "demolish the building."

Full text: Yonge Street landmark a victim of bureaucratic infighting, toothless heritage policies and shoddy management
When the north wall of the former Empress Hotel, at 335 Yonge St., crumbled in April, the city sprang into action and erected hoardings around the historic structure.
The hoardings irritated local merchants and Ryerson officials. However, until this week's suspicious fire, it appears little was happening behind them.
But documents obtained by The Globe and Mail show that the reclusive Lalani Group, which owns the property through a numbered company, and city departments spent the spring locked in a tense game of brinksmanship over the fate of a building that had, according to one engineering assessment, no future to speak of.
With wrecking crews now demolishing its charred husk and police seeking a "person of interest" seen leaving the area just before the fire, 335 Yonge's slow-motion demise is a cautionary tale about how an irreplaceable building can fall victim to bureaucratic infighting, toothless heritage policies and shoddy management.
"We can't let this happen again," Downtown Yonge BIA executive director James Robinson said. "Toronto and Yonge Street has lost part of its identity."
The Lalanis, a family with homes in York Region and holdings in Florida and Panama, aren't talking. They did not respond to phone calls to their listed numbers or e-mailed requests to their lawyers.
Days after the wall collapse, the Lalanis urged the city to put up hoardings, which meant they didn't have to get paid-duty police officers to patrol. City officials, meanwhile, pressed the owners to hire heritage consultants and engineers to figure out how to salvage the building.
On April 20, then-councillor Kyle Rae asked heritage officials to prepare a report recommending that 335 Yonge be legally designated under the Ontario Heritage Act, which would give the city broad powers to regulate alterations and prevent demolition. It proved to be too little, too late: For years, the city had done little to protect the Italianate structure with the arched windows and imposing tower.
In May, Paul Zucchi, a veteran structural engineer retained by the Lalanis, assessed the damage. In a report dated June 15, Mr. Zucchi wrote, "It is our professional opinion that a repair of the building is not viable in its current precarious state. We are concerned that any attempt to work on or stabilize the structure could trigger a further collapse and put the lives of workmen at risk." The "most feasible option," he concluded, was to "demolish the building."
Heritage officials tried in vain to contact the Lalanis, and then attempted to persuade the building inspections department to lean on the owners to hire a heritage consultant, according to internal e-mails. But in a clipped e-mail exchange in late June, city inspections manager Dave Deonarine wrote that his department had no plans to be involved in any heritage assessment.
On July 2, the Lalanis applied for a demolition permit. Council voted "its intention" to designate the building five days later - 36 years after it was added to the city's inventory of historic property.
THE OWNERS
The Lalani family began leasing 335 Yonge in the 1980s and subsequently bought it. Property records show the numbered company that now owns it, 2160943 Ontario Ltd., purchased it from the Lalani Group International Inc. for $7-million in 2008.
Among the directors of the numbered company is a Noorali Lalani. There was no answer this week at the door of the Thornhill house listed as his address in corporate records. According to property assessment records, the house is worth $999,000.
There was also no answer at two other nearby grand-looking homes listed in corporate records as addresses for the numbered company's other directors, Zahir Lalani, Noori Lalani and Anwar Lalani.
The Lalanis also have links to two Panamanian-incorporated companies, property records show. In 1996, Noorali Lalani took out a $600,000 mortgage on his Thornhill home from a Panamanian company called Coromandel Holdings Inc. It lists two officers with Lalani as their surname, including an Al Lalani of Richmond Hill. Another Panamanian corporation, Dunkirk Enterprises Inc., also lists Al Lalani as an officer and granted a $3.95-million mortgage to the owners of 335 Yonge St. in 1996.
Both companies' listed addresses in Ontario are a low-rise building in an industrial park in Concord, north of Toronto. The building was purchased in 1994 for $600,000 by Melotone International Inc., an Ontario corporation that lists Al Lalani as its president.
The Lalanis possess real estate assets in Florida, including two seaside condos in St. Petersburg, assessed at around $300,000 each. They also own commercial property in the state, where a real estate crash has crushed land values. A company called Maya Development Co. LC is listed as the owner of 44.7 acres of vacant, lightly wooded commercial land about 100 kilometres southeast of St. Petersburg. The owners' contact information in property records is N. Lalani, and includes the Thornhill address.
Sarasota County records show the Lalanis buying the property in 2000 for $3.3-million. Hundreds of thousands in property taxes have been paid over the past decade, including last year's bill of over $70,000.
It is worth around $4-million, according to property-tax assessments. It is currently up for sale, with an asking price of $27-million.
THE CITY
For years, and even as recently as last November, the Lalanis had pledged to restore their downtown Toronto asset. But there is little to show for their promises.
In August of 1997, the city approved a $20,000 façade improvement agreement with the Lalanis, with the funds payable upon completion of the work. But the company didn't do the renovations so the city withdrew the grant in 2000.
Four years later, the Lalanis again asked for a grant. Eager to see improvements, Mr. Rae secured a $12,500 grant as part of the 2006 city budget.
They seemed to be looking for new revenue. In mid-2005, the Lalanis and the Pattison Group sought city approval to install a pair of massive billboards on the north and west walls. Mr. Rae said that at a time when many downtown landowners saw their taxes skyrocket, such signage was a potential source of new revenue. But city officials argued the signs obscured heritage features.
The Lalanis pressed the city, promising "a major facelift" for the building "depending on the revenue stream that we expect to generate from the signage," Al Lalani wrote in an e-mail to Mr. Rae in 2006. The city rejected the Lalani-Pattison sign application, and the promised renovations didn't materialize.
On July 18, 2006, a Municipal Licensing and Standards officer issued a notices to the Lalanis, ordering them to address exterior problems. MLS issued a second order just over a year later.
According to the city, the Lalanis appealed the orders, first to council's Property Standards Appeal Committee, and then to a provincial court. On Nov. 18, 2008, city officials inspected the property, and concluded the Lalanis had complied with the earlier work orders, so the hearing was cancelled.
Until the wall collapsed, the city seemed focused on the façade. Spokesman Bruce Hawkins said it is unclear whether inspectors had gone inside recently.
As Mr. Robinson observes, "It now appears there was something far more serious within the building, but obviously there was no awareness of that."

Abstract: "There are low-income families in the city. A lot of them are recent immigrants or refugees," says Basil Luksun, director of planning and building for the city of Burnaby. "I don't think we zero in on any particular area in saying, 'This is an area that has a lot of issues.' ... What we, as a city, try to do is to address the overall livability of the city. And to do that I think we try to address that in terms of the needs of the community across the whole spectrum."

Full text: No longer are those struggling to survive easily spotted wandering around the Downtown Eastside. More often, they're new to the country, trying to make ends meet in the suburbs
From the sidewalk, the home of the Kokeihi family looks just like any other in the suburban Burnaby neighbourhood.
And inside that brick bungalow, the array of family photos and the flames licking inside the fireplace reinforce the image of a family leading a comfortable life. But it's a misleading one - the family of Iranian refugees is on income assistance and barely making ends meet. They struggle to find work and cringe upon mention of their monthly bills.
"Life is so hard in Canada," says daughter Shabnam, the member of the family of six who is most comfortable speaking in English.
Without Canadian references, Ms. Kokeihi says work has been hard to come by. And refugee support groups have told the family they're on their own if they want to pursue a career in their chosen field of music.
Forget what you think you know about poverty in the Lower Mainland - it's no longer about the gritty images of the Downtown Eastside.
Increasingly, the poor of Metro Vancouver are like the Kokeihis: scattered outside the urban core, making them all the harder to see, much less help. According to data supplied exclusively to The Globe and Mail, the Downtown Eastside is among the areas in the city whose wealth has grown the most between 1970 and 2005, though that change has been driven by pockets of prosperity rather than an overall jump in the standard of living.
But at the same time, pockets of poverty are building in the suburbs. According to research by UBC geographer David Ley and the University of Toronto's Cities Centre, the areas where average income contracted the most in that same 35-year period are in the outlying areas of Vancouver and its suburbs: southeast Vancouver, north Richmond, Burnaby, Surrey and Coquitlam. Several were also among the poorest, compared to the rest of the city, in the 2006 census.
These areas, magnets for both immigration and refugee settlement, have become nodes of low income, unemployment and the invisibly poor. The people who live there are disproportionately new Canadians and visible minorities.
Local governments have yet to catch up to the changing face of Lower Mainland poverty.
The city of Coquitlam approved its first permanent homeless shelter just last month, after intense debate and in the face of vocal opposition from local residents.
But it's becoming impossible to ignore the growing need for shelters, social services and supports in areas built for low-density, single-family dwellings in middle-class neighbourhoods. Part of the problem is poverty in the suburbs can be hidden behind the doors of neatly appointed bungalows.
"If it's not in your face regularly, I think there's sometimes a sense people won't think it's as big an issue as it really is," says Martin Wyant, executive director of SHARE family and community services in Coquitlam.
The availability of services and supports reflect this: Vancouver has far more units of subsidized housing per capita than any of its surrounding municipalities, even though the areas where poverty is growing the most are outside the city's limits.
Prof. Ley calls it the "suburbanization of poverty." He has been working with researchers in Toronto and Montreal, documenting shifts in income disparity in those three cities.
"I think there's going to be quite a bit of surprise at the data on the maps," he says. "This is fresh information."
The rise in suburban poverty is driven by both economic and migratory shifts: Relatively affordable suburbs overtake downtown when it comes to attracting both immigrants and refugees.
As land values in the Lower Mainland have risen, especially in the city of Vancouver and along the water, the premium placed on choice real estate means "people have sorted themselves more across neighbourhoods according to their income," says Krishna Pendakur, an economist with Simon Fraser University and co-chair of Metropopolis British Columbia, which researches cities and diversity.
A report from the Immigrant Services Society of B.C. found 84 per cent of government-assisted refugees arriving in the Lower Mainland settle outside the city of Vancouver. At the same time, Richmond, Burnaby and Surrey have higher concentrations of recent immigrants and visible minorities. And the region's non-white population is increasingly concentrated in localized neighbourhoods, geographer Dan Hiebert, also a Metropopolis co-chair, found in a study commissioned by Citizenship and Immigration Canada.
Beyond the obvious peril that new ghettoes could arise in the suburbs, there are less obvious dangers - including the public-health impact of poor, scattered neighbourhoods. Health officials are just beginning to track the impact of neighbourhood-scale stratification, but early data indicate that where you live increasingly predicts how healthy you will be. In part, that's a result of people moving to affordable neighbourhoods, and the poor being statistically less healthy. But there is also a self-reinforcing cycle, in which poor people in those suburban neighbourhoods have less access to services that could help improve their health.
In some cases, the universal approach of public-health promotion is actually increasing disparities, says Vancouver Coastal Health's chief medical officer Patricia Daly. That indicates a need for targeted health campaigns for vulnerable areas.
Municipalities say they're aware of the region's growing income gap. But the data on neighbourhood-level poverty are new.
"There are low-income families in the city. A lot of them are recent immigrants or refugees," says Basil Luksun, director of planning and building for the city of Burnaby. "I don't think we zero in on any particular area in saying, 'This is an area that has a lot of issues.' ... What we, as a city, try to do is to address the overall livability of the city. And to do that I think we try to address that in terms of the needs of the community across the whole spectrum."
But statistics alone don't tell the whole story of poverty.
According to the numbers, Munira Elhassan is destitute. She receives $680 in government assistance, and monthly rent in her subsidized building in the Edmonds area of Burnaby eats up $328 of that. Much of the leftover money goes to medication stemming from a bad fall that left her unable to work. A very proud woman - in Egypt, she was a civil engineer with a chauffeur - she still finds a way to offer treats to her visitors.
Life in her neighbourhood is very good, she insists, pointing to support from refugee service groups and her mosque. That's a far cry from when she first arrived in this country and had no idea how she'd survive financially. "I came here and felt like I was a little dot in the middle of the ocean," she said. "I didn't know where to go."

Remembering Ginsberg and the summer of poetry

Author: Hawthorn, Tom

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/remembering-ginsberg-summer-poetry/docview/822356456/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: At one point, Mr. [Allen Ginsberg] posed outside the home with the host and several poets. Among those in the photograph is Dan McLeod, who would go on to co-found the Georgia Straight underground newspaper. Some years later, the Straight faced a substantial fine for criminal libel by having awarded a "Pontius Pilate Certificate" to a judge who convicted Mr. [Stan Persky] on a loitering charge.

Full text: Howl, titled after the work of Allen Ginsberg and soon out on DVD, is a reminder of how the sixties got started in Vancouver in 1963
tomhawthorn@gmail.com
Allen Ginsberg, fresh from an Asian sojourn, arrived in Vancouver with his hair and beard untrimmed, ringlets cascading from his face. The poet looked like an Old Testament prophet in an age of Brylcreem conformity.
He was a mad (holy) man amidst the Mad Men.
It was the summer of 1963. A three-week university course brought to the grungy port city with its neon-lit streetscapes an all-star lineup of hotshot writers known as the New American Poets.
George Bowering, at the time a student at the University of British Columbia who would go on to become Canada's first poet laureate, had been reading these works for years. He intended to follow his favourite, Charles Olson. Instead, he found himself shadowing Mr. Ginsberg.
"Maybe it's embarrassing to say it," Mr. Bowering said Tuesday, "but he seemed to have some kind of spiritual aura. The air shone around him."
He remembers the poet in Stanley Park so taken by its natural beauty to deliver an impromptu recitation of Adonaïs , a pastoral elegy to John Keats. "Pages and pages and pages of Shelley!" Mr. Bowering recalled. "I was astonished."
The movie Howl , which takes as its title the famous poem written by the late Mr. Ginsberg, is being released on DVD this week after a limited theatrical run. The movie intersperses an interview with the poet, a reading of the poem, and a notorious obscenity trial in docudrama fashion.
For some who see the movie, it is unnerving, though not unsatisfying, to see Hollywood portray characters they knew in the flesh.
Stan Persky, a 69-year-old philosophy professor at Capilano University, knew many of the people portrayed in the film - Jack Kerouac (from whom he received a postcard at age 16 encouraging him in his writing), Neal Cassady, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Peter Orlovsky (Ginsberg's lover), and the poet himself, whom he met in 1959 while stationed with the U.S. Navy in San Francisco.
"Ginsberg was an advocate of gay liberation 10 years before it was invented," Mr. Persky said. "Ginsberg was totally open about it. I'd be walking around Chinatown and see him on the other side of the street and he would call out, 'Hey, have you got a boyfriend yet?'"
Mr. Persky worked with the poet in organizing an early anti-Vietnam War protest at Berkeley, Calif. When the local Hells Angels chapter made it known they were prepared to beat the peace marchers for not being patriotic, the poet went to visit them in their compound. He returned to announce the Angels had changed their mind, offering to provide security for the protesters, an entente negotiated after the long-haired, gay poet shared with the leather-wearing bikers a supply of LSD.
The 1963 visit to Vancouver coincided with several parties held at the Kerrisdale home of Ellen Tallman, a writer, and Warren Tallman, an English professor, at 2527 W. 37th Ave. The atmosphere was redolent of cigarette smoke and spilled Black Label.
At one point, Mr. Ginsberg posed outside the home with the host and several poets. Among those in the photograph is Dan McLeod, who would go on to co-found the Georgia Straight underground newspaper. Some years later, the Straight faced a substantial fine for criminal libel by having awarded a "Pontius Pilate Certificate" to a judge who convicted Mr. Persky on a loitering charge. The newspaper held a benefit to raise legal funds, attracting the support of folk singer Phil Ochs and Mr. Ginsberg. In a radio interview with Jack Webster, a hard-hitting interrogator from Scotland known as the Oatmeal Savage, the gentle poet used wit and humour to disarm the host. In the end, Mr. Persky remembers Mr. Ginsberg cajoling a $50 cheque from the Scotsman.
Looking back, the 1963 poetry conference is the day that we think of as when the 1960s began in Vancouver.
Mr. Bowering likes to tell an anecdote about the conference.
At one point, the visiting poets were playing a friendly game of Monopoly at the Tallman residence. Savvy purchases and some luck with the die soon had Mr. Ginsberg demanding rent payments and calling mortgages on his fellow poets, as he ignored their entreaties for loans or leniency. The writer who decried the excesses of American capitalism was a whiz at tabletop real estate.

Manufacturing's not dead. We're dining out on its success story

Abstract: "We're located close to the airport and the highway system. ... If you look at the corridor between Toronto and Niagara Falls, that's 7 million people, roughly. So it's a big chunk of our market," says plant manager Daniel Marcoux. "Your major suppliers are within driving distance."

Full text: The belly of Soham Ajmera's business smells of warm garlic and sounds like a million motorized hamster wheels.
The factory floor hums and squeaks as a series of chain-mail conveyor belts roll, stretch and bake endless rows of teardrop naan. The machine will churn out 20,000 pieces of the flatbread today, made to order under private labels for supermarket shelves.
Around the corner, dozens of trays of tins filled with morning-glory batter are transferred to slowly rotating vertical ovens before they're shipped off to fancy coffee shops across the country.
The Ajmera family's FGF Brands has grown since its 2004 inception as a maker of almond-flour muffins to a baking behemoth, provider of President's Choice naan and Starbucks muffins.
Forget the struggling automotive industry: This is Toronto's industrial heartland.
In 2010, Ontario's manufacturing sector added jobs for the first time since 2004 and grew in GDP for the first time since 2005, according to a study released Dec. 29.
But even Jim Stanford, a CAW economist and vice-chair of the Ontario Manufacturing Council, admits the hard-hit manufacturing industry has a long way to go if it hopes to return to pre-recession levels.
The food manufacturing industry, however, seems an exception to the rule. Southern Ontario may be better known for the cars it used to turn out by the thousands, but by 2008, Greater Toronto's food-manufacturing sector had already eclipsed the area's automotive industry: 58,460 employees to 45,830, according to Statistics Canada Labour Force Survey data.
The GTA's food-processing sector is the second-largest cluster in North America, beating out Chicago but behind Los Angeles, which carries the continental title for greatest number of people employed slicing, pasteurizing, baking, juicing and packaging.
And it's still growing - as it has been steadily over the past 15 years - even while many of the region's blue-collar jobs have disappeared.
Toronto's proximity to key markets in Canada and the U.S., combined with a renewed focus on local food and the home-team advantage when it comes to pumping out diverse cuisine, have helped keep companies competitive and profitable.
Michael Wolfson, the city's food and beverage sector specialist, says businesses are taking advantage of incentives to move back to Toronto.
Long criticized for its disproportionately high commercial-tax rate compared to other municipalities, the city has been trying sweeten the deal for industrial developers with grants and waived fees: A tax increment equivalent grant in select areas of the city waives building permit and planning fees over a specified period; industrial developers who invest at least half a million dollars in new or expanded development or retrofits are eligible for rehabilitation grants.
And the city's apparently counterintuitive planning tactics might be paying off. In an economy where housing development is in high demand, Toronto kept some sites zoned industrial, kiboshing condo development on land developers saw as prime residential real estate that would bring in more money than a factory in the midst of a manufacturing slowdown.
But Build Toronto spokesman Bruce Logan says the city has gotten "a lot of interest" in one city-owned property, a 10-hectare industrial-zoned piece of surplus land near Lakeshore Boulevard and Islington in Etobicoke they hope will go to a company developing it for food-processing purposes.
Even investors and private-sector giants are buying the hype: George Weston Ltd., owner of grocery giant Loblaw, bought artisan Ace Bakery for $110-million in November. And Premium Brands, based in Richmond, B.C., bought a majority share in Torontonian Maximum Seafood in July - the company's first Central Canadian acquisition.
The municipal government's tax-break carrots aside, it makes sense (especially in an economy bracing for triple-digit oil) for businesses to set up shop nearby the people they're selling to, the people they're buying from and the people who are working for them.
"The food industry is a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week industry. So you need access to labour, you need access to transit to get people to the midnight shifts," Mr. Wolfson says.
When Quebec-based Lassonde Beverages wanted to expand elsewhere in Canada, a Toronto location was a must. Now more than six years old, their Toronto plant - the company's largest outside Quebec - pumps out 53 million litres of juices and fruit cocktails a year.
"We're located close to the airport and the highway system. ... If you look at the corridor between Toronto and Niagara Falls, that's 7 million people, roughly. So it's a big chunk of our market," says plant manager Daniel Marcoux. "Your major suppliers are within driving distance."
"And we've got the work force."
That isn't to say things have been easy: The recession, a high dollar and renewed scrutiny on the food-processing industry thanks to such high-profile health scares as the 2008 listeria outbreak have meant it can be challenging to scare up enough capital to get started or expand, says Stewart Metcalfe, vice-president of Colliers Food Facilities Group.
And with global food security increasingly top of mind, Mr. Metcalfe argues, outsourcing food production becomes less palatable an option.
Mr. Ajmera relocated to Toronto for reasons both practical (to fill an unmet flatbread need) and sentimental: He says he fell in love with Toronto while passing through as a business student in Detroit. Toronto's vitality reminded him of his native Bombay.
He stays, he says, because it's home: His Canadian-educated sons live here, as do his grandchildren. But there's also a compelling business case to be made. If there weren't, there's no way FGF Brands, which he founded with friend Jim White, would be not only surviving but expanding in an increasingly competitive market.
"I'm in the baking business, and this is the best place to be based," Mr. Ajmera says. So he learned to roll with the punches: When retailers seeking to target recession-weary consumers asked for cheaper products this year, he rolled out "tiers" of naan - some without expensive buttermilk and ghee - to keep prices down.
FGF Brands has grown steadily after opening at his sons' behest, a decade after Mr. Ajmera sold his first baking company, Dough Delight. And after upgrading three times to larger buildings, the company plans to add a second plant on the other side of Steeles, a few blocks away from their headquarters on the Concord side of the Vaughan-Toronto border. It's a base he plans to pass on to his sons Tejus and Ojus Ajmera, who work with him now.
"They are the future. They are the business. And I'm the proud father."

Full text: We elected Rob Ford. We still watched the Leafs. We hosted an, um, eventful G20. Paul Attfield, Kelly Grant, Anna Mehler Paperny, J. Kelly Nestruck, and Brad Wheeler weigh in on the stories that mattered and the ones to watch
CITY HALL
THE STORY THAT MATTERED:
Rob Ford wins the mayor's race
Who would have thunk it when 2010 dawned?
Hitherto best-known for his weekly anti-spending rants on AM640 and a trove of unintentionally hilarious clips on YouTube, Rob Ford romped to a 47-per-cent victory in the Oct. 25 election.
With his promise to "stop the gravy train," the Etobicoke councillor spurred a suburban uprising and the sauciest meme of the year.
Mr. Ford's win stunned the downtown elites. They'll just have to get used to it. Why? Because, in the immortal words of Don Cherry, "He's going to be the greatest mayor ever ... put that in your pipes, you left-wing kooks."
THE STORY TO WATCH:
Rob Ford actually runs the city
Timidity is not the new mayor's style. He's already boxed out the left and scored by repealing the $60 vehicle-registration tax, reducing office budgets and putting an end to (literal) free lunches at council meetings. But that was the easy part. The hard stuff - building subways, freezing taxes without cutting services, killing the land-transfer tax - is still to come.
Kelly Grant, city hall bureau chief
***
REAL ESTATE
THE STORY THAT MATTERED: Condos
Developers, property owners, wannabe property owners and the economically voyeuristic were riveted by talk of a housing rebound for the first half of the year. Then, in the summer, demand for tiny, pricey boxes in the sky started to lurch. Despite fears of a dip in the market, as of this fall, more than half the units sold in Toronto in 2010 were high-density. And lest you think dropping per-condo prices, which declined slightly after climbing all year, indicate everyone's coming back to their senses, RealNet numbers make clear the cost per square foot is still going up - the condos people are buying are just really, really freakin' small.
THE STORY TO WATCH: Bubble speculation
A December report from TD economics told everyone to calm down, for Pete's sake, because the housing market is "landing safely," having ducked both bubble and crash. Naturally, that hasn't stopped speculation of a burst bubble, or at least a slowdown - especially as Canadian household debt exceeded its U.S. cousin for the first time in nearly two decades.
Then again, bubble-related jitters haven't exactly halted Torontonian high-rise development, which is spreading north from the dense downtown up through Yorkville, Yonge and Eglinton and north of Steeles.
Anna Mehler Paperny

DEVELOPMENT
THE STORY THAT MATTERED:
Waterfront revitalization
In the 1980s, Toronto's politicians, planners and developers said they were ready to finally clean up the city's polluted industrial lakeside land.
Almost three decades later, the city's ready to embark on a real waterfront revitalization. But it took the threat of the Don River flooding and the impending hemisphere-wide scrutiny accompanying the Pan Am Games to kick-start development.
The city approved plans for dramatic reshaping of the Lower Don Lands this year, after a successful Pan Am bid put a deadline on turning the West Don Lands into an athletes' village intended to morph into a mixed-income residential community.
At the same time, developers moved forward on such projects as the Corus Quay building and Sugar Beach, turning the edge of Lake Ontario into somewhere you might actually want to hang out.
But good luck dodging the tourists.
THE STORY TO WATCH:
Selling the city's surplus sites
The ostensibly cash-poor city of Toronto is land-rich. Like, really land-rich. The city is sitting on an estimated 7,000 sites it no longer needs. And close to two years after its creation, Build Toronto is finally finding buyers for the first sites on the block.
The city has transferred 35 sites to Build Toronto since the body's creation. Two of those - a future condo-tower site at Front and Sherbourne, and a Yonge-Eglinton site slated for a TTC museum - have agreements signed with buyers or leasers.
Seven others are awaiting bidders. And Build Toronto CEO Lorne Braithwaite said he expects Mayor Rob Ford to give the organization direction to speed up its land sales to help raise funds as the city tries to cut back on spending while attempting to leave services unaffected, freeze taxes and tackle its debt.

LAW
THE STORY THAT MATTERED: The G20
Who wouldn't want to play host to an international event boasting the planet's most powerful financial leaders?
Well, actually...
After the federal government decided to hold the financial summit in Hogtown rather than cottage country, Toronto was left scrambling to accommodate delegates, journalist retinues and security details.
And the weekend's images that left their mark on the city have nothing to do with global financial accord. Try videos of burning cop cars, smashed storefronts and police officers roughing up civilians, instead.
Numerous inquiries and investigations have been launched into police conduct over the G20; Ontario's ombudsman slammed the whole summit as a major abrogation of civil liberties. Most recently, a Toronto police officer was charged with assault in connection with the arrest and beating of protester Adam Nobody.
So, um, memo to the feds: Next time you decide to host a massive summit in a major Canadian city, maybe stick to Parliament Hill, okay?
THE STORY TO WATCH: Prostitution laws
It looked like curtains for legislation governing pimping and brothel-keeping when Ontario Superior Court Justice Susan Himel ruled those laws hurt women more than they helped.
But a December ruling by Ontario Court of Appeal Justice Marc Rosenberg threw that legislation into limbo again: Now we won't find out what forms of communication-for-the-purpose are legal until at least April, when the court will hear an appeal of Judge Himel's ruling. Once a decision does come down, however, decriminalizing the above-board sex trade could put municipal governments in charge of licensing and creating prostitution-specific bylaws as best fits their communities.
And you know what that means: Councillor - and, briefly, mayoral candidate - Giorgio Mammoliti's dreams of a Torontonian red-light district could come true.
Anna Mehler Paperny
***
SPORTS
THE STORY THAT MATTERED:
Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment
For all its bragging about its money-making ability, helped by last summer's completion of the Maple Leaf Square condo development and Real Sports Bar and Grill, MLSE once again came up woefully short when it comes to its bread and butter - the teams upon which its empire is built.
The Toronto Maple Leafs, Toronto Raptors and Toronto FC are all worse now than they were a year ago, and in almost all cases there appears scant hope on the horizon, save for CEO Richard Peddie's impending retirement.
The Leafs continue to wallow in the NHL basement, the Raptors are finding it tough to draw a crowd after Chris Bosh's defection, and TFC was so bad in 2010 its best player decided to run away to Scotland, if only temporarily.
Still, these epic levels of ineptitude didn't stop rumours of Rogers looking to buy into the $1.5-billion money-making machine, even though that story was more far-fetched than a Maple Leafs playoff run.
THE STORY TO WATCH:
The Toronto Blue Jays
With Cito Gaston retiring once again, second-year general manager Alex Anthopoulos has finally been able to appoint his own man to manage the Toronto Blue Jays.
John Farrell is the man tasked with returning the two-time World Series champions to contention, and with an exciting young pitching staff combined with breakout home-run machine Jose Bautista, 2011 should see the free-swinging Blue Jays improve on their fourth-place finish in the American League East Division.
Paul Attfield
***
THEATRE
THE STORY THAT MATTERED:
The reinvention of Canadian Stage Company
Repatriated from France to his home town, new artistic and general director Matthew Jocelyn has rendered Toronto's biggest not-for-profit contemporary playhouse unrecognizable, shifting the theatre away from unsurprising productions of last year's (or last decade's) Broadway and West End hits to director-driven productions of shows with long titles that you've never heard of. Mr. Jocelyn kicked off his first season off this fall by directing a German play called Fernando Krapp Wrote Me This Letter and promoting it by hiring students to "protest" around town with pickets that read: "Live Theatre is Krapp!" Audiences took up the debate in the lobby. Visionary or Eurotrash? Daring or indecipherable? Profound or pretentious? Whatever it was, at least it wasn't boring - and for that we are grateful.
THE STORY TO WATCH:
Richard Rose working with Wajdi Mouawad
With his production of Scorched , Tarragon Theatre artistic director Richard Rose finally made superstar Quebec playwright Wajdi Mouawad's work speak to English-speaking audiences. Will he be able to do it again with Forests - an even more sprawling epic from the poetic playwright about one girl's search for her roots that stretches from the Franco-Prussian War through to Montreal Massacre? We'll find out April 19 to May 29.
J. Kelly Nestruck

TRANSIT
THE STORY THAT MATTERED: The TTC and You
A smart-phone photo of a hapless napping TTC worker was enough to spark a Torontonian tempest of rider discontent - especially following a January fare hike whose anticipation resulted in the mass hoarding (and subsequent rationing) of the transit system's antiquated tokens.
Yes, TTC management conceded, the aging system is often frustrating and communication failure between staff and riders is all too common.
But the TTC, in its infinite wisdom, showed it understands and appreciates the importance of customer service. And when confronted by a sweeping report recommending renewed attention to the way transit users are served, it did what any chagrined organization would do: Pledged to create a museum in its own honour.
THE STORY TO WATCH:
The Transit Network Once Known as Transit City
In case he hadn't made it perfectly clear during the election campaign, Rob Ford is no fan of light-rail transit. He declared Transit City "over" on his first day in office, and has since said any new transit in this city will go underground, thank you very much.
So what happens now?
Premier Dalton McGuinty has indicated he's happy to let the city spend the $8.15-billion in provincially pledged funds as it pleases. TTC staff have been put to work coming up with alternatives to bring forward in the new year. As far as Mayor Ford is concerned, a Sheppard subway is a priority and the other three planned lines will have to wait.
The good news, he says? You can still take the bus to Woodbine Live in Etobicoke.

MUSIC
THE STORY THAT MATTERED:
What concert-industry recession?
While the rest of North America reeled, Toronto at the very least weathered a storm brought about by too many acts chasing too few ticket-buying dollars. Yes, the battered Virgin Festival took the year off (leaving this city without a mega festival), but North by Northeast thrived (gloriously, with Iggy Pop lording over Yonge-Dundas Square), Luminato sparkled (with imaginative programming once again) and local promoter Collective Concerts said it enjoyed its best year ever. Even Lilith Fair (which was Lilith Beware elsewhere) drew respectable numbers on a rainy Saturday at Molson Amphitheatre.
THE STORY TO WATCH:
Local hip-hop phenom Aubrey (Drake) Graham
He broke world-wide big with his debut album in 2010, and he will figure largely again in 2011 - he'll host the Juno Awards, which celebrates its 40th anniversary at the Air Canada Centre in March. We look forward to seeing what the up-swinging Drake - "It's far from over" he boasted - has in mind for an encore.

Abstract: "We decided to take a deep breath and just do it," Mr. [Allan Scott] says. The gallery and Ledcor nervously shook hands on a $90-million budget, 50 per cent higher than before. "Full marks to Ledcor," he says. "We signed the contract 10 months later at the same price."

Full text:   Alberta's Lede family has built everything from oil sands infrastructure to telecom networks and landmark buildings. Now younger brother Cliff is content to have left the chill of Canadian winters behind to build something of his own in California
gpitts@globeandmail.com
A few years ago, Canadian construction baron Cliff Lede sat at the blending table of his newly acquired Napa Valley winery, and decided to put his stamp on the place. He loved wine and he loved vintage rock 'n' roll. "We could have all the vineyard blocks named after classic rock songs," he remembers thinking.
So instead of blocks mapped out according to arcane codes - such as "West 9" or "East 8" - his plots of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon carry titles such as Moondance (after Van Morrison's 1970 classic), Truckin' (for the Grateful Dead) and Hotel California (The Eagles).
For Mr. Lede, 55, the new system is not only nostalgic, but practical. "Someone says 'A block' and I say, 'Oh, you mean Dark Side of the Moon" - he says, alluding to the Pink Floyd album. "At least I can remember what that is."
This is the ultimate baby boomer's fantasy fulfilment - to not only own your own 25-hectare California vineyard and winery, but to combine it with references to your youth in the 1960s and 70s. And if visitors to Cliff Lede Vineyards crave more refinement, they can stay the night in his Poetry Inn for up $1,400 (U.S.), or sip his 2007 Poetry cabernet, priced at $150 a bottle.
"There is poetry in everything in this valley," Mr. Lede once told a writer from the University of Alberta's business school, "and we want that feeling to pervade this place."
But his magnificent obsession is crafted not from poetry - or even Jerry Garcia's rock riffs - but from the gritty prose of rural Alberta. Its origins lie not in some refined terroir but in the sand, gravel, and mucky bitumen of the oil patch 2,500 kilometres northeast of Napa Valley.
The vineyards underline the long, strange trip taken by Cliff Lede (pronounced "Lady"), his brother Dave and the company they control, a construction titan named Ledcor Group. It is the company that built a big part of the modern West, survived the killer cycles of the energy economy and is now weathering the U.S. real estate meltdown. It is a North American success story, yet typically Albertan - great wealth achieved by doing mundane things very well in the oil patch.
Over 63 years, the Ledes have been Alberta road builders, pipeline trenchers, telecom darlings, and dot-com busts, but they have never entirely abandoned their roots.
Coming off a tumultuous foray in fibre-optic networks - from which it spun off 360Networks Corp. - Ledcor emerged as the builder of Alberta's signature monuments. It is about to complete the massive Bow Tower in downtown Calgary, the highest building in Western Canada, and has finished the twisting metallic Art Gallery of Alberta in Edmonton. It is the construction company most identified with big oil sands projects.
Ledcor began as part of the cluster of small service companies that flourished around Edmonton following the massive Imperial Oil strike at Leduc in 1947. But Ledcor, with revenues estimated at $2-billion a year, is now based in Vancouver and operates in such places as San Diego, Honolulu and Nevada.
Asked why Ledcor has come so far, Hal Kvisle, recently retired as chief executive officer of pipeline giant TransCanada Corp., explains that "it is the vision of the Lede brothers and the things they did - these guys are not constrained by anything."
Mr. Kvisle became aware of Ledcor in the 1970s as a young Dome Petroleum engineer drilling wells in Central Alberta. Ledcor was among the companies he hired. Near the end of his career, he contracted the firm to build the Canadian arm of TransCanada's giant Keystone bitumen pipeline into the U.S. Midwest.
It is a case study in risk-taking, played out over and over on the service side of the energy business, he says. "There is an incredibly gutsy willingness to stake a fair bit on a new venture and work 18-hour days to make it go. The Ledcor story is just the top of the pinnacle." But there has been a personal price to this drive.
Tragedy heralds new era
Sept, 25, 1980, started out as a typical day for Bill Lede, owner of a contracting company called Leduc Construction. As a farm kid out of Hay Lakes, Alta., he had started out as a small road builder, and in his early 20s built the access road and well site for the big Leduc oil strike in 1947. It was the blowout that ignited the energy boom that still drives the Western Canadian economy - and Ledcor has been cashing in every since.
Thirty-three years later, Bill, 55, was mayor of Leduc and a well-liked local entrepreneur. "Dad had a knack for getting along with people," his son Cliff recalls.
At noon that day, he and his sons Cliff and Dave went out to inspect a job site. Bill walked up beside a high bank of gravel and clay, which suddenly gave way, burying him under five metres of earth.
"I was standing to the side and saw his hard hat thrown clear." Dave Lede later recounted. "We all dug with everything we had - hard hats, shovels. It was just too late." All that was left was to go home and tell their mother Florence that her husband was dead.
It was a tragic moment that burned deeply into the family memory - and it changed the company in a significant way. Safety became the watchword of the construction business, and still is to this day. It also propelled Bill's elder son Dave into the CEO's job for which he had been groomed.
Cliff Lede says his father's legacy still resonates in how Ledcor operates and how he runs his winery. "My father taught my brother and me the importance of having good people and treating them right."
Dave, 32, was more serious and driven than his amiable politician father. He was known for his taciturn nature, answering questions with a clipped yes or no. Cliff, 24 at the time and fresh out of school, had the easy charm of his father. The two men, both University of Alberta commerce graduates, continued their father's work but their ambition was bigger- to diversify far beyond earth moving and road building.
The company name was changed to Ledcor, reflecting the desire to stretch beyond Leduc. Dave moved the company into pipeline trenching for big players such as TransCanada, and into civil construction, mining, office buildings and other areas. He moved his operations to Vancouver, while Cliff as chief operating officer stayed in Edmonton a while before decamping to the West Coast as well.
As the energy business went flat in the early 1980s, the Ledes' diversification proved timely. The company suffered, but not fatally. The B.C. business grew and Ledcor built the spectacular Coquihalla Highway down the central spine of the province from Kamloops to Hope. Then in the 1990s, the brothers made the bet of their lives.
Dot-com dreams
A Saskatchewan boy, Bernie Stene went to work for Ledcor in the late 1980s, and found himself doing sewer and water work. Then he was handed a new contracting job - to help lay an underground network across the country for Bell Canada based on new glass-fibre technology.
It seemed like a natural extension of the pipeline trenching business, but the unforgiving terrain in Northern Ontario was something the Ledcor people had never seen before. The problem was not only forest and rock, but "we covered every freaking kind of swamp - it was amazing," Mr. Stene recalls. "But we learned a lot."
Mr. Stene and a group of managers convinced the Lede brothers that if the company was so good at laying fibre, why not become more than just a contractor - why not build and own its own networks?
It was an idea that seemed right for the times. In the late 1990s, the world was seized by a new gold rush in fibre networks that would carry massively expanded broadband services to seemingly voracious markets.
With a partner, Ledcor hit upon the idea of laying fibre along railway rights of way, which gave it a cross-Canada ticket - you make one deal with one railway and it would take your network across the country, even into the centre of major cities. Mr. Stene and a colleague invented a rail-mounted plow that would lay cable more efficiently by shifting wheels on and off railway tracks. And the company developed a "condominium" approach of franchising fibre to different carriers.
The brothers enthusiastically backed this focus. The dream became not just Canadian but global - to lay tens of thousands of kilometres of fibre, including an Atlantic network to Liverpool, England, from Halifax. The Ledes hired Greg Maffei, a financial wunderkind at Microsoft, as CEO of a spun-off network company called 360Networks. But as soon as 360Networks went public in 2000, the dot-com bubble burst and the stock sunk.
One problem was that too many people were jumping into the game. Players such as Global Crossing, Level 3, and MCI were laying fibre faster than demand could possibly justify. "The idea was just ahead of its time," says Mr. Stene, who now runs his own network services company.
"360Networks was trying to circle the world with fibre, which was a big high-stakes game - and the market wasn't there yet," says Robert Watson, president of SaskPower, and a former telecom executive whose company was acquired by 360Networks.
The share offering left a bitter taste inside Ledcor, especially for employees who invested and held on too long as 360Networks tumbled into bankruptcy protection. The shares, which went public at $14 in April, 2000, and hit a high of $35.90, fell to pennies by mid-2001. After being listed by Forbes as the world's 270th richest people with $2.1-billion in net worth in 2000, the Ledes fell off the global billionaires' list. But the dot-com bust didn't sink them. A company they controlled, Ledcor Partnership LP, had sold a large quantity of shares in advance of 360Networks going public. The Ledes escaped much of the rancour surrounding network flops because, having funded 360Networks in the early days, they had indicated their intention to take some money out.
What's more, as a general construction company, Ledcor was so diversified that as one door closed, another opened. The fibre-optic bust was followed by the oil sands boom. Ledcor stepped up its work in northern Alberta - which flourishes now even after the sharp market decline of 2008-09.
The Lede brothers moved into middle age, accumulating marriages, children and wealth. Cliff was never as committed to construction as his brother, and began to focus on his love of grapes and wine developed as a boy making basement wine with his mother in Leduc. An Edmonton wine-shop owner had opened his eyes to the glories of Bordeaux grape varieties, and he started to build a cellar. "It's kind of a male thing - we like to collect."
Then, in his mid-40s, he reached a decision point - how could he put his personal stamp on his life? He remembers pondering his relationship with Dave. "I came to the realization that he is always going to be my older brother, he is always going to be senior to me.
"Going into a family business at 24 and working at it till I was 44, I just thought I needed to do something on my own."
In the mid-1990s he found his destiny in the Napa Valley, and a few years later, his search for a winery began in earnest. In 2002, he spent six months negotiating the purchase of family-owned S. Anderson vineyards for a price which local media speculated was $15-million.
He reluctantly agreed to change the name to Cliff Lede Vineyards, reflecting the Napa Valley practice of identifying the wine with the winery owner. The private construction baron had become a brand, which made him a little uncomfortable. "One of the hardest things to learn was talking about Cliff Lede," he says.
He bought land within sight of the vineyards to build a small, modernistic inn, now an architectural landmark in the valley. He also brought Ledcor itself into the Napa Valley, where it has forged a business building wineries, along with hotels and restaurants.
He remains a Ledcor director, and he talks to his brother Dave about every other day. "But you cannot do construction on a part-time basis. I am resident of the U.S. now and spend the majority of the time here. I am at this business every day."
Meanwhile, according to friends, his brother Dave knows no other life than running the construction company. A former employee, who watched him regularly arrive at the office at 7 a.m., says "he really loves his company more than he loves anything else."
Looking to the future
Allan Scott had a front-row seat as Ledcor changed the face of downtown Edmonton. As a telecom executive and local economic development boss, Mr. Scott watched the firm build the striking City Hall and do much of the construction around the city's landmark Churchill Square.
Then he came face to face with Ledcor's cost discipline as chairman of the Art Gallery of Alberta. The gallery had chosen Ledcor to build what would become the next major structure on Churchill Square - an eccentrically stunning building designed by Los Angeles architect Randall Stout.
But with plans finalized and the fundraising set to launch, Mr. Scott grappled with an overheated economy which in the 2004-08 period pushed building costs far beyond the $60-million that had first been estimated.
"We decided to take a deep breath and just do it," Mr. Scott says. The gallery and Ledcor nervously shook hands on a $90-million budget, 50 per cent higher than before. "Full marks to Ledcor," he says. "We signed the contract 10 months later at the same price."
It was an extraordinary feat for Ledcor and the subtrades, he says, but the cost controls did not compromise the basic design. The Ledes came in as donors, with the new gallery incorporating a theatre named for the family.
Such resilience is critical in a post-meltdown period that has been trying for Ledcor. The oil sands have been up, down and now up again. In the shaky moments of early 2009, the Bow Tower's developer , H & R REIT, struggled to complete a critical financing - but managed to pull it off.
Cliff Lede admits U.S. operations are weaker. "There was a correction needed," he says. " I remember the 1980s when the oil patch went in the tank and we were a small contractor in Alberta and our dad had just died. But it all came back."
Yet plenty of questions remain, particularly about the firm's succession plan. Cliff, Dave and Florence Lede - in her 80s and still living in Leduc - control the majority of shares, but the next generation is a question mark. One classic mechanism for exiting ownership in the construction industry is to sell shares to employees. Ledcor already has substantial management share ownership and will likely move further in that direction.
Whatever happens, the two Lede brothers will likely never reunite as a management team. Cliff misses the close camaraderie of construction, but he thrives on being master of his own destiny. He believes he is building a business for future generations in the Napa Valley's vaunted Stag's Leap wine district.
Sitting in his winery, he sounds like a man who does not yearn to shiver away his time on a Canadian job site. "I spent 40 years of my life in Edmonton - and the people there are as good as you will ever find - but the weather leaves something to be desired." Napa Valley, he says, "is a pretty nice place to live."

Full text:   Once the centre of the city's garment industry, 555 Chabanel moves from cutting and sewing to marketing and creation
It was built in the early 1980s as testimony to the then pre-eminent role of Montreal's garment industry: a massive single-use low-rise tower - 555 Chabanel - boasting one million square feet of space, for use by players in the city's thriving needle trade.
Today, the 15-storey edifice - big enough to contain a small village - is a different creature. The garment sector has been badly shaken over the past several years by forces such as the rise of low-cost foreign competition, new technology and changes in the supply chain.
As manufacturing operations moved offshore or to other locations occupied by sub-contractors, the vast spaces at 555 Chabanel and several other similar buildings in the working-class neighbourhood in the north end of Montreal emptied out.
The armies of garment workers who filed in daily to work in the so-called "sweatshops" shrank.
Cavernous rue Chabanel was badly in need of a makeover.
Enter a group of local real estate developers, tenants and city officials who have banded together to repurpose the hulking 555 Chabanel and its neighbours by making the buildings more appropriate for a mix of uses, including fashion showrooms, general office spaces and lofts for web marketing and video game companies.
Offering rents that are much cheaper than those found downtown or in the now-trendy loft spaces further south helped attract new tenants and inject fresh life into the building, says Eyal Cohen, managing executive director at Marcarko Ltd., which owns 555 Chabanel.
"We offer five-star services but we're 35 per cent cheaper than the downtown," said Mr. Cohen.
Among non-fashion tenants Marcarko has lured to the posh, made-over tower - which offers all the amenities, including fibre-optic wiring - are Laurentian Bank and Aviva Insurance Co., which have extensive back-office operations.
"The story here isn't just manufacturing and garment any more. These days it's about innovation and commercial use."
On the fashion side, which retains a strong presence in the building with small warehouses and wholesale showrooms, the accent is on marketing and creation, where it used to be all about cutting and sewing, he said.
To make the area even more attractive, there are plans to revitalize the strip. The City of Montreal committed to upgrade the infrastructure and plans for a bike path, improved mass transit and a new stop on the nearby local commuter train line, said Stephanie Cardinal, an urban planner and architect who is at the centre of efforts by the Regroupement pour le developpement et la promotion du quartier Chabanel.
A key element in the reinvigoration of the strip is an effort to bring some much-needed action at street level, she said.
A few high-end restaurants have moved into the neighbourhood. Other projects organizers hope will come to light include a boutique hotel and a three-storey shopping centre at 99 Chabanel.
"The area was in decline. We decided we had to go beyond clothes manufacturing," said Georges Dayan, a Montreal real estate developer whose company - Groupe Dayan - went on a buying spree in 2005 with partner Canada's Public Sector Pension Fund, scooping up five buildings.
After spearheading revitalization projects in other parts of the city - such as the International Quarter - Groupe Dayan felt that Chabanel offered plenty of potential for renewal, said Mr. Dayan.
The presence of a power shopping centre - the Marché Central - just west of the strip is a big plus, given its role as a destination for shoppers from all over the region, and a marketing campaign is being rolled out to raise Chabanel's profile as a place to visit, said Ms. Cardinal.
"It's kind of like the meat-packing district in New York City that became a trendy place. We have the same vision for Chabanel," she said.
Ultimately, the goal is to transform the strip into a design hub, with internationally recognized cultural and fashion events, said Ms. Cardinal.
"I see this as a neighbourhood of the future," she says.
"True, some people look at this industrial architecture and go, 'Yech,' but it's all about the passion you put into it."
"The idea they're selling is that you don't need to be downtown anymore. You've got efficient, relatively inexpensive spaces, close to large labour pools, and the investment is not huge in terms of renovating the interiors, maybe replacing the windows," says Brett Miller, regional managing director for Eastern Canada with CB Richard Ellis Group Inc.
"Montreal has a relatively high stock in these type of buildings, industrial class buildings, and companies in growth mode, such as communications or information-technology or gaming, are in growth mode and attracted to these spaces."
What's missing so far is one or two blockbuster deals involving the luring of a high-profile tenant from the downtown, he said.
Chabanel also has competition from similar real estate located in nearby neighbourhoods, he said.
"It's premature to say this is a success story."

Oil sands firms consider outsourcing positions

Author: Vanderklippe, Nathan

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/oil-sands-firms-consider-outsourcing-positions/docview/821272589/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Shifting vast numbers of jobs away from the oil sands would "mean ripping the heart out of Fort McMurray's middle class," said Gil McGowan, president of the Alberta Federation of Labour. "Those are the kind of jobs that form the backbone of Fort McMurray's economy, and their loss would actually be quite destabilizing."

Full text:   Up to 15,000 support jobs could be done remotely, study finds
As Canada's oil sands companies work to head off another looming labour crunch, some have begun looking at moving huge numbers of employees out of Fort McMurray, Alta. - and possibly, in the future, to India.
Several oil sands firms have started discussions with management-consulting and outsourcing firm Accenture, which has completed a broad labour analysis that shows that 10,000 to 15,000 jobs could be uprooted from northeastern Alberta.
And thousands of those positions could eventually be sent to overseas centres like Bangalore or Chennai, says Michael Denham, managing director of Accenture's management-consulting services in Canada.
Mr. Denham has proposed radical changes to the way the oil sands are run. Instead of using thousands of workers in Fort McMurray, where the population has now swelled to 100,000, real estate prices are sky-high and workers are difficult to find, companies could simplify recruitment, cut salaries and boost productivity among workers who could be electronically connected with their tasks.
Finance, engineering, maintenance planning, human resources and supply chain work could be moved from Fort McMurray and done in cities like Calgary and Edmonton. In the future, as the model takes hold, substantial numbers of jobs could be sent overseas.
"We estimate that 40 to 60 per cent of all job titles and all work could be moved and be done remotely from Fort McMurray," he said. "And maybe half of that could be moved offshore now."
Though he would not identify who, Mr. Denham said "there are a couple of clients we're working with on this topic."
With oil prices above $90 (U.S.) a barrel and rising, the world's biggest energy companies are once again turning their attention to northern Alberta, raising worries of a Fort McMurray labour shortage. The desire to keep costs as low as possible during a new boom has increased the willingness to consider all options.
Several oil sands firms have already taken steps to increase offshore work.
Imperial Oil Ltd. is using South Korean manufacturers to build hundreds of components for its $8-billion (Canadian) Kearl mine, and engineering firms are increasingly using employees in Texas and overseas to design new oil sands projects.
If the idea begins to take hold, it would radically change the face of Fort McMurray, which has struggled with rapid growth.
But, despite its growing pains, Fort McMurray has managed to create a surprisingly community-oriented city. Droves of people spend nights at a newly expanded recreational complex, complete with a large water park, and hotels have teamed up to offer discounted rates to out-of-town kids sports teams that come to use its high-end athletic facilities.
Fort McMurray is, according to the United Way, the most generous city in Canada, and it owes much of its virtue to the fact that companies like Suncor Energy Inc., Syncrude Canada Ltd. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC employ large, well-paid work forces - including substantial numbers of white-collar employees - in the city.
Syncrude, for example, has 5,580 employees in the Fort McMurray area, and only 200 in Calgary and Edmonton.
Some companies are wary of uprooting Fort McMurray workers. They want to protect their "social licence" to operate, a key strategy that ensures salary dollars flow into local communities.
Moving parts of that worker base is "definitely not something Syncrude is considering," said spokeswoman Cheryl Robb.
"We see ourselves as a member of the Wood Buffalo community ... In fact, our retention program has incentives for employees to live in the local community."
Shell, which employs 2,000 in the area, believes "that it is a benefit to the community of Fort McMurray for our employees and their families to live, work and play in the city - and in doing so, contribute to the social fabric of the city," spokesman Phil Vircoe said.
Shifting vast numbers of jobs away from the oil sands would "mean ripping the heart out of Fort McMurray's middle class," said Gil McGowan, president of the Alberta Federation of Labour. "Those are the kind of jobs that form the backbone of Fort McMurray's economy, and their loss would actually be quite destabilizing."
Mr. Denham argued that for Fort McMurray, losing jobs could actually provide benefits to an area that has seen frenetic growth produce Vancouver-like real estate costs and Toronto-style traffic.
Life as a boomtown "plays havoc on local pricing, local facilities, etc. I truly believe the community there would benefit from a more balanced, more sustainable approach to growing its infrastructure," he said. "Our hope is to get the whole industry thinking along these lines. As a result, everyone will benefit from a more rational deployment of where people work."

Three routes to financial freedom

Author: Heinzl, John

Full text:   Their approaches to building a successful portfolio may differ, but these small investors all share peace of mind; each has found - and stuck with - a strategy suited to their circumstances and temperament
It's one thing to read investing tips from the pros. They do this stuff for a living. But ordinary folks can teach us a lot about achieving financial independence, and today we've got three examples to prove it.
Each of these small investors has taken a slightly different route to building wealth, but one thing they have in common is that they came up with a system - often after much trial and error - and stuck with it.
One is a classic index investor who buys low-cost exchange-traded funds and doesn't believe in trying to beat the market. Another is a dividend growth investor who buys companies with a track record of increasing their payments to shareholders. The third is a stock picker who owns a mix of dividend and growth companies.
What their stories show is that there is no single way to achieve financial success. Rather, the key is to find a strategy that suits your temperament, is relatively easy to implement and doesn't carry an excessive amount of risk, so you won't bail out when markets get volatile. The other important ingredient in all three strategies is time.
Graeme Tweedie
Strategy: Indexing
Portfolio: Six figures
Graeme Tweedie made some "classic mistakes" in his early years as an investor. He got burned by a penny stock that an associate had recommended. He bought a mutual fund that had shot the lights out one year only to watch it trail the index the next. And he once got bitten by the rising Canadian dollar on a fund that invested in the United States.
"So I learned that trying to avoid exchange rates is a good idea, following hot mutual fund managers is a mug's game and that investing in individual stocks was risky," says the retired Canadian naval officer, who lives in Halifax.
Ultimately, those experiences helped shape Mr. Tweedie's indexing strategy. He also took financial planning courses and read several books, including The Power of Index Funds by Ted Cadsby and All About Asset Allocation by Richard Ferri.
After he retired in 2007, Mr. Tweedie sat in his dining room for hours crunching numbers. "I got all the annual index results for the last 20 years and I built a spreadsheet where I could plug in various asset allocations for equity and fixed-income percentages, with the equity further subdivided into Canadian, U.S. and international," he says.
Based on his calculations, he determined that the best-performing equity allocation over the previous 20 years was a 50-50 split between Canadian and U.S. indexes. He then used that information to set up his current portfolio.
His equity exposure - which makes up 40 per cent of his total portfolio - is divided evenly between the iShares S & P/TSX Capped Composite Index Fund (XIC) and the currency-hedged iShares S & P 500 Index Fund (XSP). In keeping with his low-cost strategy, the ETFs have management expense ratios of just 0.25 per cent and 0.24 per cent, respectively. To take advantage of compounding, he reinvests dividends in additional units.
For the fixed-income portion - which accounts for the remaining 60 per cent of his portfolio - he uses a ladder of guaranteed investment certificates with maturities ranging from one to five years. To make sure his GICs are covered by Canada Deposit Insurance Corp., he's careful not to exceed the $100,000 limit with any one financial institution.
The 60-per-cent weighting in fixed income is based on his age - he's 57 - and risk tolerance. "The fixed income-to-equity ratio is the most critical part for risk reduction," he says. "A simple stress test for any investor is to assume a 50-per-cent [drop] in equities and ... see how you would feel if your investments were reduced that much."
Because of his hefty fixed-income weighting, if the value of his stock market holdings were cut in half, his portfolio would fall by just 20 per cent - a serious haircut, but not a reason to panic. "So far so good, and I sleep well," he says.
Christopher Varley
Strategy: Dividend growth
Portfolio: Seven figures
As a 60-year-old, self-employed art dealer in Toronto, Christopher Varley won't have a company pension to fall back on when he retires. So his investment plan is geared to building a solid - and growing - retirement income for himself and his wife.
With that goal in mind, he buys stocks with a track record of increasing their dividends. His holdings include Canadian Utilities Ltd., Enbridge Inc., Toromont Industries Ltd., TransCanada Corp. and Fortis Inc.
He's also a big fan of dividend-paying U.S. consumer companies that derive a chunk of their revenue from abroad, such as McDonald's Corp., Colgate-Palmolive Co. and Procter & Gamble.
Excessive trading "is just a fast trip to the poor house," he says. That's why he buys and holds dividend stocks for the rising income. Using a full-service broker who charges a 1-per-cent commission to buy or sell also discourages him from active trading.
Paying a full-service broker "might sound stupid, but I only make a few trades a year, so the cost is a tiny fraction of my total portfolio. And my adviser provides additional services gratis [such as analyst reports] and answers questions," he says.
Mr. Varley started buying dividend stocks in the mid-1990s and got his "first big break" during the technology bubble.
"When the 'smart money' dumped their 'boring' bank, telecom, pipeline and utility stocks to pay for tech stocks, I happily bought their castoffs," he says. "Needless to say, I was the one who made the money."
Now, the portfolios he and his wife own generate about $52,000 in dividends annually, and that income is growing about 7 per cent a year. About one-quarter of his portfolio is in cashable GICs, largely because he needs to stay liquid for his art business and because he's always looking for opportunities to buy dividend stocks at attractive prices.
He likens his approach to owning an income-producing apartment building. As long as the rental income is growing, it doesn't really matter whether property prices are rising or falling.
"Would you panic and sell if local real estate prices fell? Of course not, but that's how most people view equities," he says. "They're constantly trading."
Silke Rudelbach
Strategy: Stock picking/
dividends
Portfolio: Seven figures
Silke Rudelbach bounced from one adviser to another over the years, never satisfied with the service or returns she was getting. So after the financial meltdown of 2008 and with her portfolio in a serious slump, she took a deep breath and decided to start managing her own money.
Now, the self-employed public relations consultant in Toronto reads financial newspapers, watches BNN and scans company reports online when she's considering a stock. Her investment style leans heavily toward dividend-paying companies, but she's also a fan of gold and base metals producers.
For diversification, she also owns several investment real estate properties. "I just believe in real estate. I come from Germany. When I left it 30 years ago it was not a society where you made your money on the stock market," she says.
Becoming a self-directed investor was one of the best decisions she's made, she says.
"Taking responsibility for myself was a very good feeling," she says. "There are so many people who just don't want to be bothered. They know they have to invest but it is so overwhelming. They think, 'Oh no, I can't do it myself. I need somebody who does it for me.'"
To stay on top of her portfolio, she maintains a binder with articles sorted alphabetically by company. If she has a question, she e-mails the company's investor relations department for an answer.
She steers clear of bonds, because interest rates are so low. Instead, she is willing to accept the stock market's short-term volatility in exchange for the higher long-term returns it delivers. Being patient and having faith in the market are key planks in her investment plan. "I truly believe if it goes down it will go up again," she says.
She also believes in automatically reinvesting dividends, which reduces brokerage fees and gives her a sense of satisfaction as the number of shares gradually grows.
Another important factor in her financial success has been her ability to save. It's a habit she learned in Germany where the government and employers had generous contribution-matching programs that encouraged people to sock money away.
She's maintained her frugal ways in Canada. Instead of owning a car, for instance, she takes public transit and puts the savings into her real estate investments. "Every time I had the money for a car, I bought a condo instead," she says.
As for managing her own investments, she's more convinced than ever that she made the right move.
"Brokers are only salespeople. They only have their own interest in mind, unfortunately," she says. "I just looked at my portfolio and I'm so happy. It's doing very well."

Super-wealthy enclaves endanger diversity

Abstract: "The entry level at Lawrence Park is getting higher and higher," Ms. [Irma Baldanza] said. "I wonder where it's going to end. Obviously, people are going to be buying these homes, so I don't know if there's just a lot of wealthy people out there."

Full text:   Trend called unfortunate by those who would like to see a less polarized city
Growing up the northwest end of Toronto, Irma Baldanza aspired to live in a place like Lawrence Park.
"I remember driving through areas like Forest Hill and Lawrence Park, where my Dad would point out and say, 'Look at these beautiful houses,' that sort of thing," she said. "Once I got married and we started thinking about owning a home, this is one of the areas we looked at."
The couple started out with a relatively affordable house on Yonge Street and Blythwood Road in the mid-1980s, moving in 1990 to a red-brick Georgian house they could add on to over the next several years, accommodating a growing family. In the past two decades, Ms. Baldanza has seen the treed neighbourhood become increasingly attractive for wealthy families - and, more recently, developers and investors - drawn to the larger lots and green spaces.
In a city where property is increasingly at a premium, the rarity of a neighbourhood of large lots just blocks away from a major transit artery makes for dramatically increasing property values. It helps to have good schools - both public and private - and engaged residents eager to pitch in for fundraising and beautifying initiatives.
Local real-estate agent Cheri McCann said a new house that would have sold for $2.4-million eight years ago is now going for nearly twice that. Even 10-year-old houses are selling for as much as $3.5-million.
This prized slice of city just southwest of Lawrence and Bayview avenues is the area of Toronto where average individual income has grown the most - relative to the city's average - in the past 35 years, according to a report that came out last week from the U of T's Cities Centre. That report found the city is being increasingly polarized between rich and poor neighbourhoods.
"The entry level at Lawrence Park is getting higher and higher," Ms. Baldanza said. "I wonder where it's going to end. Obviously, people are going to be buying these homes, so I don't know if there's just a lot of wealthy people out there."
It's harder for Ms. Baldanza to judge the tone of the neighbourhood now that her grown children aren't at school nearby. But as a member of the Lawrence Park Ratepayers Association she's familiar with the pride residents take in preserving the local green space, ensuring trees are planted to replace the aging canopy that lends the area its name.
"It's a source of pride for our neighbourhood, and we like to keep it clean. ... I think that all contributes to the attractiveness of the neighbourhood."
Councillor Jaye Robinson, who defeated incumbent councillor Cliff Jenkins in October's election, views the shift to super wealthy as a cause for concern.
"There has been this trend - an unfortunate trend, because it is affecting the character of the neighbourhood," she said. "The price point of homes in Lawrence Park is going up because of these bigger houses."
From Ms. Robinson's perspective, it's indicative of a need for development that "shifts the decision-making power back to residents."
While the city's added pockets of wealth are an economic boon, pricing out all but the highest bidders for in-demand areas can help drive income polarization in neighbourhoods across the city.
"You get this kind of cascading effect of giving even a small group of people a windfall of growing disposable income," said Armine Yalnizyan, a senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.
It's an inevitable result of basic supply and demand. But in situations of unequal income growth, the polarizations created by pricing people out of the real estate market are sharper.
"One of the challenges is that we are ending up with a city where you don't have people of different income levels living together and that has an impact in a number of ways," said John Campey, executive director of Toronto's Community Social Planning Council. It can mean sharply divergent access to services - even public ones such as schools, where parental fundraising in affluent neighbourhoods can make a huge difference in the quality of programming.
One of the most visible characteristics shared by the city's most desirable enclaves is access to transit: The majority of the city's richest neighbourhoods are on or very near subway lines; only 19 of the city's 68 subway stations are within or near low-income neighbourhoods.
This is one reason why discussions around income disparities keep coming back to transit: That's what helps make affluent neighbourhoods desirable, and that's what policy makers keep hoping will aid areas of the city that risk becoming no-go zones because there's nowhere to go (or no way to get there).
"You get rid of, almost, the ghettos we've got now where people really are trapped," Mr. Campey said. "You make more of a mix because you make more of those neighbourhoods attractive, which works both ways: It attracts more middle-income into those neighbourhoods but it also makes it more easy for low-income people to get around."
Then there are downtown wards that have gone from low-income inner-city neighbourhoods in 1970 to highly prized areas of nightclubs and trendy condos. In Trinity-Spadina councillor Adam Vaughan's mind, that gentrification has positive potential if the city leverages it properly. In a market hungry for condo development, he's made a point of trading extra density for a floor or two of rental, below-market or supported-living units. And he'd like to see that become the norm.

The cost of killing Transit City

Author: Anna Mehler Paperny

Abstract: "The private sector, in order to make some investments, needs some certainty," he said. "If we are going to go with a subway system, then we need to know what that entails. If we're going to go with a light-rail transit system, we need to know that's certain. And if it's going to be a combination of the two systems, we need to know that, as well."

Full text: Uncertainty over what will replace Toronto's transportation plan threatens to stall investment and development throughout the city
The promise of a light-rail transit artery and transformed streetscape were what persuaded Kal Brach and her husband to sign a 15-year lease and invest in an ambitious renovation for their dental office on Sheppard Avenue East.
Ms. Brach hoped the planned Sheppard line would turn a commuter route used by people to get from Point A to Point B into a place where they might stop for a coffee - and maybe notice the local dental office.
"It's very much a commuter type of street," she said. "We'd love that to change."
Every week for nearly three years, Ms. Brach met with Toronto Transit Commission staff to pore over plans for her neighbourhood at Sheppard Avenue and McCowan Road and an ambitious transit line that - they promised - would link it with the Sheppard subway in the west and Scarborough Rapid Transit in the east. So Ms. Brach was more than a little shocked to find out earlier this month that the line is in limbo, with the city's new mayor declaring Transit City dead in its tracks on his first day in office.
"I'm disappointed," she said. "That was a waste of time, quite honestly."
Mayor Rob Ford, his new TTC chair, transit staff and the province are all quick to assure Torontonians they'll get their promised transit network. However, it's not clear what form that will take - even transit staff and TTC chair Karen Stintz refuse to guess whether the revamp they've been tasked with bringing to the commission next month will cost more, push back timelines or mean the same amount of transit as promised. (Ms. Stintz did suggest, however, that they might look to the private sector to help cover the cost of subways, which cost three times as much per kilometre as at-grade light-rail transit.)
And that uncertainty is what's worrying residents, businesses and investors after the city spent years planning its growth around a transit backbone whose execution is now in doubt. By putting the brakes, even rhetorically, on Transit City, the city is throwing into confusion its own plans for densification, investment and development. What can be built, where and how high is contingent on zoning that's based in large part on planned transit lines and the number of people they're expected to carry from one place to another every hour.
Don't get Steve Diamond wrong: Like Mr. Ford, he likes subways.
The former development lawyer and president of Diamondcorp likes the idea of buying and building up land along an underground transit artery whose construction won't paralyze his street, but which will have the capacity to carry thousands of people every hour. But Mr. Diamond, like anyone eyeing Toronto's volatile real-estate market, also likes to know what he's getting into.
"The private sector, in order to make some investments, needs some certainty," he said. "If we are going to go with a subway system, then we need to know what that entails. If we're going to go with a light-rail transit system, we need to know that's certain. And if it's going to be a combination of the two systems, we need to know that, as well."
"The uncertainty does put the city at risk," Mr. Diamond said. "And what we can't go through is four years where there's no improvements to the city's infrastructure in terms of transportation. That would be a disaster."
Ms. Stintz, whose first week on the job has been spent dealing with responses ranging from overjoyed to furious to merely confused, is quick to note the apocalyptic demise of Transit City has been much exaggerated.
The task before transit staff is largely tweaking, she said. Yes, it may affect the city's official plan in terms of what Toronto wants to look like decades down the road - but that plan was up for review this year anyway. And despite the mayor's suggestions to the contrary, Ms. Stintz - along with Ontario Transportation Minister Kathleen Wynne - said at some point council will have to vote on the plan.
"Ideally, we'd have transit on every major line, and it would be underground," Ms. Stintz said. "But you know, you do need to make choices. And what I do believe strongly is that we're going through the right process.
"We did have a referendum - it was the municipal election. ... Transit City was not endorsed as the transit vision for Toronto."

Full text: More than 20 places of worship line a stretch of road in Richmond. Globe photographer John Lehmann asked representatives from the array of faiths along the 'Highway to Heaven' what the biggest stereotype is about their religion.
********
If there are many paths to salvation, British Columbia's No. 5 Road can be seen as an open-air guide book.
The highway - which runs in a straight line through the city of Richmond, south of Vancouver - is often referred to as the Highway to Heaven, courtesy of more than 20 places of worship that line part of the thoroughfare.
Sikh, Muslim and Hindu structures share the road. So does the Thrangu Monastery, which opened in July and describes itself as the first traditional Tibetan Buddhist monastery in the Pacific Northwest.
The area's attraction for religious groups reflects not a quest for holy ground, but local zoning and immigration trends.
Twenty years ago, Richmond council opened up farmland along the No. 5 road corridor to allow groups to build churches, schools or other buildings for community use. The idea was to attract local churches that were outgrowing their quarters.
Religious groups started snapping up properties along the highway, drawn by relatively inexpensive land prices and the opportunity to build bigger buildings than could be squeezed in to urban settings.
During those two decades, immigrants flocked to Richmond, driving trends in everything from restaurants to real estate and places of worship. Today, more than 60 per cent of the city's roughly 190,000 residents are of Chinese or South Asian origin.
The city's changing character is reflected in new facilities on the strip, such as the Thrangu Monastery, and expansion plans of an elder in the group.
The Ling Yen Mountain Temple - a Buddhist temple operating on No. 5 Road since 1999 - says it needs to expand to keep up with its growing congregation. It has filed expansion plans with the city that include a 15-storey temple and nine other proposed buildings.
The proposal - which has drawn barbs as a "Buddha Disneyland" that is too big for the neighbourhood - is before the council.
Meanwhile, the prayers, meditation, blessings, classes, banquets and celebrations continue, with most passers-by having only a vague idea of the breadth of beliefs and cultures represented on the thoroughfare.

Biggest stereotype:
The biggest stereotype Mr. Mau says he encounters is among his predominantly Chinese congregants, many of whom equate religion with going to the temple to ask for blessings - for business, marriages, children or health - rather than an ongoing spiritual relationship.

Biggest stereotype:
Many people do not realize that Islam - as is Christianity and Judaism - is a monotheistic, Abrahamic faith. Another issue is fear and "guilt by association" as a result of violent incidents involving Muslims in other parts of the world.

Biggest stereotype:
The biggest stereotype about Christianity is that it's a series of rules you have to keep, and that good behaviour gets you in to heaven. In reality, the faith involves a belief in God loving humans regardless of their worth.

Full text: Neck-deep in the fight game and casinos, UFC boss Fertitta brothers have penchant for making risky financial bets
The new business partners grinned broadly as they welcomed invitees to the gala opening of their $300-million casino resort in Henderson, Nev.
Inside the sprawling complex, which includes a 500-room hotel, eight restaurants, 2,200 slot machines, and a pool surrounded by a sandy beach, guests mingled with actress Charlize Theron, boxing promoter Bob Arum and watched a performance by former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash.
The 2001 opening of Green Valley Ranch was to have been the triumphant first joint venture between two men, Brian Greenspun and Frank Fertitta III, whose families were Las Vegas fixtures (the Greenspuns in real estate and publishing, the Fertittas in neighbourhood casinos, down-market joints catering to locals).
For a time it was, but the relationship soured earlier this year.
And the ensuing legal saga and other court filings provide detailed insight into how Frank Fertitta, 48, and brother Lorenzo, 41, who control a multibillion-dollar empire that includes the Ultimate Fighting Championship, conduct their business.
Though the spotlight usually focuses on minority partner Dana White, the bombastic, high-octane face of UFC, the brothers are the quiet impetus behind one of the fastest-growing sports businesses on the planet. And in many ways, their corporate strategy mirrors UFC's inside-the-octagon ethos: aggressive, brash, relentless, few holds barred.
Take the way the brothers acquired the company in 2001 for $2-million (all figures U.S.) from previous owner Bob Meyrowitz, who was looking to inject cash into the moribund league.
"I came back to him and said, 'Look ... if we are going to do this we don't want to have partners. We'd like to make you an offer to buy you out of the entire business.' And probably about four to six weeks later we had struck a deal," said Lorenzo Fertitta, who spends most of his time as chairman of UFC. Frank mostly runs the casino business.
Court documents and regulatory filings show the Fertittas are unafraid to deploy hard-nosed business tactics. Zuffa LLC, the parent company that owns UFC, is a frequent and aggressive litigator, especially when it comes to infringements on their brand.
"I don't know that it's really different than any other business," said Fertitta, later adding, "there's literally people that infringe on our trademarks every single day. ... Whether it's piracy on the Internet or people using our marks to try to help their own business, we're going to fight that in a very aggressive way."
Last month, lawyers for Zuffa - it's the Italian word for punch-up - sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google.com, demanding it stop linking to illegal video-streaming sites. They've gone after agents, websites and copycats, and have sued fighters who stray from conditions imposed by their UFC contracts.
Zuffa, which claims to control more than 90 per cent of the mixed martial arts market, is also embroiled in a dispute with rival Bellator over the alleged theft of proprietary information.
There is yet another ongoing suit that alleges the brothers surreptitiously gained control of an energy drink company - it was founded by a convicted money launderer and later had a sponsorship deal with UFC - forced it into bankruptcy, and bought back the assets on the cheap using a Toronto-based company as a front.
Zuffa has sought to quash the allegations and continues to market the energy drink, one of many growth areas.
"The No. 1 thing they have done brilliantly is to control their content, whether it's the fights themselves, distribution, licensing, or managing their brand," said David Carter, who heads the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California.
At a time where other sports are girding for labour disruptions, the Fertittas are operating with no salary cap, revenue sharing or free agency.
Fighter compensation can be something of a sore point among former competitors and within the robust online community that follows and analyzes UFC's every murmur. White has said 18 of the UFC's roughly 230 athletes make upward of a million dollars a year. Still, the lesser lights in Saturday's UFC 124 in Montreal - which will set an attendance record - can expect to make between $6,000 and $10,000, double if they win.
Meanwhile, the UFC generates as much as $30-million in pay-per-view and gate receipts for a major card; there are plans to hold 30 or 31 events next year, half on pay-per-view.
Large dollars inevitably attract rapacious characters, so the Fertittas protect themselves and their businesses accordingly. But sometimes they also find themselves named as defendants.
In January, Greenspun got a call from just-fired Green Valley executive Timothy Wright, who began making allegations about a long-running scheme to lure high-rollers away from the casino to Station properties - the enticements allegedly included UFC tickets. The alleged plot even involved providing inferior cuts of meat for a Green Valley restaurant called Hank's Steakhouse
"No detail was too small," court filings claimed.
Greenspun sued for breach of contract. The Fertittas hit back hard. They immediately put Green Valley into bankruptcy protection, effectively freezing the lawsuit.
They also shot back at Wright in a court filing that alleged "deeply troubling personal and professional misconduct."
The suit was settled - as most of Zuffa's legal matters eventually are - and both sides agreed to continue working together. But the damage to Green Valley may be done. Court filings show the casino has $850-million in debt.
Debt is a recurring theme in the brothers' businesses.
According to the main U.S.-based credit rating agencies Zuffa is carrying roughly $470-million in debt and credit facilities.
Moody's upgraded its outlook on the company earlier this month from stable to positive, citing "continued strong revenue" and "improving credit metrics."
But Moody's view isn't all rosy: "Though the majority owners have significant financial resources, they have a history of being high financial-risk tolerant entrepreneurs, which constrains upward movement in the rating."
Translation: The Fertittas have a penchant for making risky financial bets, and the fight game and casinos aren't exactly Canadian chartered bank stock.
Though it insists debt isn't a problem, Zuffa is sensitive to things such as "pay-per-view fatigue" - which seems to be denting the revenues at World Wrestling Entertainment.
"We think 15 [each year] is a good number. We could easily do 50, but we don't. It's about managing supply," said Tom Wright, a former CFL commissioner who is now Zuffa's man in Canada.
The Fertittas' "significant financial resources" stem from Station, founded in 1976 by their late father, Frank Fertitta Jr., a former Tropicana bellman made good.
The Fertittas took the company private in 2007 - but quickly found themselves swept up in the 2008 downturn and with $6-billion in debt.
The brothers managed to hang on to the business through a bruising Chapter 11 filing; some creditors complained the Fertittas manipulated the process to preserve control while shedding much of the debt.
Station Casinos is shortly expected to emerge from court protection with $2-billion in debt, a collection of more than a dozen casinos and challenging prospects.
The Fertittas have long maintained Zuffa is insulated and separate from Station, and UFC is intent on expanding its strongest markets, Canada among them.
But the greater promise lies further afield.
In January, Zuffa announced it had sold a 10-per-cent stake to Abu Dhabi's royal family. Four months later, UFC held a gala fight card in the emirate.
Zuffa's international ambitions - it is notably eyeing China and India - are borne both out of design and necessity.
Cash flow is key given UFC's debt picture and the scale of its plans, so there are new markets to tap into, branded gyms to flog, reality TV shows, clothing, video games, and possibly a standalone television network.
"We truly believe that in the next 10 years ... we'll be the biggest sport in the world. Once again people kind of look at us like we're crazy and laugh at us," Lorenzo Fertitta said. "But if you think about the potential of what we're doing here, we truly have what we believe is the only global sport."

In the Eastern Ontario region around Kingston, it's difficult to find a new house in an established golf community, much less one directly overlooking manicured fairways.
But Kaitlin Group has made the search much easier with the release of Loyalist Estates' third phase.
It offers 44 houses that will each face a new road and back onto the greens of Loyalist Golf and Country Club in Bath, which is a small waterfront town just 15 minute west of Kingston.
"They're all premium lots," says vice president, Gary Daniell. "And because they're on 55-foot lots, when you drive through that street ... you'll see between the houses, golf courses on both sides."
The idyllic setting and proximity to the prestigious 18-hole championship golf course is a major attraction for many buyers - especially active adults - to the project where 350 of 500 homes are already built and occupied.
"There's a certain percentage that buy here because of the golf and they want to take in that whole lifestyle," says Mr. Daniell. "Over 70 per cent of the people - once they move in here - they end up picking it up because of the social element of the community."
A 20,000-square-foot clubhouse with an outdoor pool, tennis courts, gym, lounge, games and dining rooms is also a popular spot for residents to indulge in various activities, meet neighbours and entertain family and friends.
"I don't know of any golf course community in the region that has what we have to offer," says Mr. Daniell.
For a change of scenery, residents do not have to go far to reach the town's local marina on Lake Ontario, walking and cycling trails, quaint shops and a farmer's market.
Highway 33 nearby also leads into Kingston, home to larger attractions, malls and hospital, while Highway 401 offers a quick route to Toronto and Ottawa.
"It's in a setting that appeals to everyone," adds Mr. Daniell.
Interested buyers can select from bungalows with or without loft levels, as well as two-storey houses and freehold bungalow townhouses with optional lofts.
"Some people are ready to downsize to a small townhouse bungalow that's a little more affordable, a little less care and square footage than they might have had when they first retired [here]," says Mr. Daniell.
However, features in the third phase will be updated with vinyl siding and optional brick and stone elevations, front porches and attached single or double garages.
Inside, there will be ceramic tile floors, broadloom carpeting and staircases with oak pickets, handrails and stringers, plus optional gas fireplaces.
"Although you're part of the community, you're on a street of all new designs, new features and new standards ... that previous phases perhaps didn't have," adds Mr. Daniell.
Occupancy dates vary as there are inventory houses available. "Someone could move in as soon as 30 days or next summer," Mr. Daniell explains.
An initiation fee of $7,500 for the clubhouse is included in house prices. Annual club membership fees are $800 per household.

Abstract: More than any other, one holiday project occupied our team this season: decorating a client's home for the Kid's Help Phone "Home for the Holidays" tour in Vancouver. The event takes place annually in several Canadian cities, but this year was my first. I was a bit nervous. Many of the participating homes are on posh properties in the city's most desirable precincts, and there is definite pressure to impress.

Full text: Designer Kelly Deck gives tips on how to dress a tree, create a festive fireplace mantel and give your principal rooms some cheer
kdeck@globeandmail.com
Ah, putting up the Christmas tree and untangling knotted strings of lights. This is the time of year that reminds me of my father on a ladder on the driveway, a cloud of breath shrouding his head, cursing as he rooted out dead bulbs.
More than any other, one holiday project occupied our team this season: decorating a client's home for the Kid's Help Phone "Home for the Holidays" tour in Vancouver. The event takes place annually in several Canadian cities, but this year was my first. I was a bit nervous. Many of the participating homes are on posh properties in the city's most desirable precincts, and there is definite pressure to impress.
With the tour home, our team decided to worry less about impressing than inspiring, however. In addition to giving people as many takeaway Christmas decorating ideas as possible, we wanted to engage the passers-through in a simple idea: that decorating a home is really just an excuse to spend time with loved ones.
We had three major components to our strategy.
The Tree
The goal was to give the home a bright and creative air while avoiding the pitfalls of Christmas kitsch. Our approach? To create a consistent look for the tree while combining the homeowners' older decorations with new ones.
As we start to decorate, the old Disney cartoon Pluto's Christmas Tree came to mind. You know the one - the two chipmunks stow away in a tree Mickey has cut down and dragged home. As Mickey dresses the tree, the chipmunks scamper about inside it.
The cartoon brings home to me an often-overlooked idea: a Christmas tree's crucial dimension exists between its core and periphery. Don't linger too long on the surface; the interior is where you find depth and complexity.
The tree-dressing kicked off with the lights. I prefer all-white twinklers: quiet and tasteful, they don't muddy a room's light the way coloured lights can. In our home, we used bulbs aplenty: at least 100 per foot of tree height.
Hanging them, we started at the top and worked down, not simply winding strands around the tree - this creates a husk of light - but weaving strands to the core and then back to the outer branches. We lay on the zigzagging rings around and around the tree, taking care not to skimp at the bottom.
Next: dividing our decorations into groups. We started with what we had tons of: inexpensive silver balls. We spread them around, remembering to tuck some into the inside branches to create some shimmer from within. After that we put the prized ornaments - the most decorative, expensive and sentimental - on the outer branches. Last, we hung the crystal and glass for a final layer of depth. A smart DIY tip: Place shiny ornaments in the recesses of the tree's boughs, where their ability to reflect light is needed most.
The Mantel
The tour home was traditional and stately, with a magnificent fireplace, and we wanted the mantel to match. We used classic holiday elements to create an elegant but handmade look: a wreath, greens, metallic accents and stockings.
My friend and colleague Cristina Herring made us a wreath. She took fresh, silver-dipped eucalyptus, wired it in bunches, and attached it to the mirror with a ribbon of silver satin. I think that wreaths, whether store-bought or handmade, look better made from one material: that way, you can decorate around them while avoiding a fight for visual attention.
On the mantel itself, we placed boughs of spruce and cedar, thick in the centre and thinning at the edges. Through them we wove more twinkle lights, then placed bejewelled reindeer and mercury glass candlesticks for added glimmer.
Christmas stockings came next. We looked high and low for ones that didn't look too mass-produced. Then, three days before the install, eureka: Simone found a pattern on Marthastewart.com and we used fabric remnants to sew new stockings for the whole family. They were a hit.
The Family Touches
With the signature pieces of tree and mantel done, we wanted to dial up the coziness of the kitchen and family room while keeping the decor playful and interactive. For the kitchen table we made a centrepiece by spraying some bare branches gold, lodging them in floral foam at the bottom of a vase, then filling the vessel with white aquarium pebbles. On each of the branches hung mini-ornaments we picked up at the local crafts store - exactly the sort of thing with which kids love messing about.
My favourite crafty piece was the Advent calendar we made for the kids. We picked up 25 baby mittens, cut out felt numerals, and filled each mitten with candy, stickers, and a Christmas joke. We attached them to grosgrain ribbon with tiny clothespins.
And if the calendar wasn't "Suzy" enough, we also made cookies and wrapped them so the kids could distribute them at school as gifts. The sugar cookies took me forever to pipe, but I loved the ritual of making them at this time of year. They looked like little jewels.
The best part of the experience for me wasn't the finished design, however. It was sitting around the office with my team, stitching and gluing, recalling memories of our Christmases past and laughing through the afternoon.

No money down? Buyer beware

Abstract: CORRECTION: A story in yesterday's Life section about problems with store credit cards should not have included the photo to the left from Leon's Furniture Limited's Ho Ho Hold The Payments promotion. Leon's Furniture does not charge retroactive interest and its interest rate is well below the 30 per cent charged by some store credit cards. Leon's provides monthly statements including details of the financing plan and does not include an annual fee.

Full text: When Farrell Macdonald got his first rental apartment in Toronto, he didn't have much to fill it with, so he went to the local big-box store and charged $3,000 in furnishings to the store's credit card, for which he wouldn't have to pay a cent for a year.
Although the store's staff didn't mention it, Mr. Macdonald noticed in the contract's fine print the "outrageous" interest he would face on the purchase once the promotional period was over.
"From the ads on television, they make it so attractive, but the hook is never even mentioned at all," says Mr. Macdonald, a real estate sales rep.
As the holidays near, it seems like every furniture, electronics and office supplies store is offering to hold the payments and interest on big-ticket items.
While it can be tempting to buy now and pay later, the devil is in the details. Miss your first payment on some of those store credit cards and you could be hit with close to 30-per-cent interest, retroactive from the date of purchase. And as the fine print will tell those who care to read it, these deals are subject to change.
That's what happened to Judy Caruso and her husband, Nick, after they signed a three-year, no-interest contract on a flat-screen television. The Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., retirees bought the TV three years ago, put it on the store credit card and made their payments promptly every month. They balked, however, when the lender notified them midway through the contract that there was a new $21 annual fee on the card. The only way out of the deal was to pay the balance in full.
"My husband and I look with a jaundiced eye on anything now that says no interest and no payments for a year or pay by the month," Ms. Caruso says. "It's just not something that's going to happen to us again."
Store credit cards are a thorn in the side of Bruce Cran, president of the Consumers Association of Canada. "We're getting lots of complaints on this at the moment. Some of them seem to be absolutely morally incomprehensible. People are being charged these huge penalties because they're a day or two late with their payments."
This year, the Department of Finance created new credit card regulations to improve billing transparency. According to department spokeswoman Stephanie Rubec, however, the new regulations do not apply to store-specific credit cards, because, unlike general credit cards, they aren't issued by federally regulated institutions and therefore fall under provincial purview.
Mr. Cran says his association plans to take this matter up with the government in the new year. But until changes are made, it's borrower beware.
"In some cases, some of these big stores, furniture suppliers in particular, have been accused of not being very helpful about reminding people that a payment is due on a certain date, otherwise this big penalty of all the interest for that year will suddenly hit you," Mr. Cran says. "There's nothing illegal about this, but morally, I suppose, maybe this is not where we want to go."
It's not just Canadians who are warning consumers about store credit card deals. In the United States, New York congressman Anthony Weiner recently conducted a study about the penalties and high interest that lurk beneath these teaser deals. His findings show that rates on some cards can increase a further 12 percentage points if customers are late making the minimum payment for just two months.
A former furniture saleswoman, Leslie Bennett (she didn't want her real name used), says that she was pressured by managers at the Edmonton store where she worked to sign customers up for the store credit card, and was offered financial incentives by the lender to do so.
Ms. Bennett says customers would come into the store intending to buy a couch, learn they were approved for more credit than they needed, and then make more purchases to take advantage of the no-payment deal. It was a practice she found reprehensible.
"The staff was pushed to sell it so much, and I refused to and I got in trouble for it, but I was just like, 'I don't believe in this.' "
Another pitfall of store credit cards is the negative effect they can have on your credit score if used improperly, says Kelvin Mangaroo, president of the rate-comparison site RateSupermarket.ca. While sign-up incentives are enticing, they may not be worth it in the long run, he says.
"Especially around the holidays, many consumers start to think they can sign up for multiple cards and get the bonuses without any negative effects. However, they don't realize that by applying for several of these cards in a relatively short period of time, they can negatively affect their credit score, even if they pay off the balance in full before the due date."
For those who are stuck in a bad credit card deal, Mr. Cran advises them to take out a bank loan to pay off the high-interest debt. And for those who may be considering such a purchase, he implores them not to be pressured into buying on impulse.
"There are no freebies in this world. You're going to pay for it, and those purchases are the very ones that can get you into trouble."
***
HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF
Ask questions
Read the fine print. Ask about payment schedules, interest rates and any other fees you may face. Find out how to make payments when they come due and what happens if they're late. If the store's staff can't answer these questions, consider it a red flag.
Don't buy
on impulse
Don't let a salesperson talk you into signing something you are unsure of or buying more than you intended to in order to receive an incentive. High-pressure sales tactics are a sign of trouble.
Research payment options
Deferring payments and interest may not be your best choice of financing. If you have the money to pay off the purchase quickly, you may be able to get a better deal using your favourite rewards credit card. Use an online credit card comparison tool before you shop.
Beware of special offers
If you tend to carry a balance on your credit cards, one-time discounts may not be worth it. Store credit cards often carry interest rates as high as 29.9 per cent, and some apply the interest retroactively to the date of purchase if you do not pay on time.
Avoid too much credit
Signing up for multiple cards within a short time frame could get you flagged by the credit bureau as a "credit seeker" and hurt your credit score.
Get help
If you are stuck making high interest payments, contact the credit card company first. If that doesn't help, look
for cheaper borrowing options, such as a bank loan, line of credit or low interest credit card transfer to pay
it off. If the lender has been unresponsive, contact your local Better Business Bureau or provincial consumer
affairs office to register a complaint.

CORRECTION: A story in yesterday's Life section about problems with store credit cards should not have included the photo to the left from Leon's Furniture Limited's Ho Ho Hold The Payments promotion. Leon's Furniture does not charge retroactive interest and its interest rate is well below the 30 per cent charged by some store credit cards. Leon's provides monthly statements including details of the financing plan and does not include an annual fee. The Globe and Mail apologizes for the error.

Full text: As 160,000 street lamps near the end of their useful lifespan, Toronto Hydro studies what will replace them
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
Look up.
If you live on Delaware Avenue, Anglesey Boulevard, Beresford Avenue or a dozen other streets, you may already be doing just that. If you don't, but still find yourself bumping into others with neck craned skyward, perhaps you're an infrastructure aficionado.
Or a lighting designer: "Lighting designers all have chronic neck problems because we all walk around looking up," jokes 61-year-old architectural lighting veteran Gerry Cornwell.
For the past three years, Mr. Cornwell has headed Toronto Hydro's Adaptive Lighting Asset Management Program (ALAMP), a study to determine which lighting technology (or technologies) will best serve our streets - expressway and cul-de-sac alike - and our pocketbooks in the 21st century. Last upgraded in 1993, the city's approximately 160,000 fixtures will need either total replacement or refurbishment soon, but advances in LED (light emitting diode), fluorescent and induction systems and new electronic ballasts to control older metal halide and high-pressure sodium systems mean Toronto Hydro faces a dizzying amount of choice.
"In the past, the street lighting industry was dealing with maintenance, now it's dealing with change," explains Mr. Cornwell, founder of the lighting certificate program at Ryerson University and lighting designer of the ROM's Bat Cave, Egypt and Nubia Galleries. "A lot of communities are saying 'Look, we just don't have enough know-how'... so, Toronto Hydro, to its credit, has taken the approach that we need to have answers, we can't just throw money at this."
In other words, despite the buzz surrounding the energy efficiency of LEDs, it wouldn't be prudent to replace thousands of fixtures with that technology before extensive, all-weather testing is done, so, in September, 2007, Phase One of ALAMP began at two closed sites owned by Toronto Hydro. When computer models showed that some of the new technologies couldn't provide enough light to meet regulations based on current pole heights and pole spacing, they were dismissed. Those that excelled in the theoretical world were then physically hoisted up onto spare poles and monitored during all four seasons.
In June, 2009, technologies that succeeded were installed in small batches at various locations in the city (a full list can be found at www.torontohydroenergy.com/alamp.html). Sites were chosen to represent different scenarios, such as local roadway/low pedestrian, collector roadway/average pedestrian, major roadway/high pedestrian and so on. Signage was erected at these sites inviting residents (or non-residents) to provide input via an online survey.
The most interesting area, perhaps, is Delaware Avenue for the block that runs south of Bloor Street West. New LED fixtures give the street a decidedly bluish tint, which reminds me of the time I walked out of my little Montreal "four-and-a-half" (two-bedroom) on the first powerless night of the infamous ice storm of 1998. "What's that blue light glinting off the snow?" I asked my friend. "Moonlight," he answered, "which you don't notice when the street lights are on."
Here, on Delaware, the artificial LED moonlight is certainly enough to illuminate the street, but being a very directional light source, there isn't much falling onto the faces of the homes, which I find a little disconcerting. More interesting is the intersection of Delaware and Hepbourne: On Hepbourne Avenue, warmer, whiter LEDs have been installed for comparison, and on Delaware south of Hepbourne, the old, slightly orangey fixtures remain, enabling a comparison of three lighting types at one intersection.
Other technologies are more difficult to notice. On Beresford Avenue north of Bloor Street West (near Runnymede), new induction lights - which Mr. Cornwell describes as "fluorescents on steroids" - give off an ordinary white light; aficionados are tipped off only by the slightly larger housing these require. "Most people are just unaware of it," says Mr. Cornwell, "and where we've done electronic ballasts in existing fixtures, people are totally unaware of it because it looks the same ... we just changed the guts."
Of course, changing only "the guts" is better for the environment; while fixtures don't seem large when viewed from the sidewalk, it's worth remembering they're actually 30-inches long and contain about 30 pounds of aluminum. Then again, with so many fixtures of various vintages to contend with, it's likely almost as many technologies as Toronto Hydro is testing will light our way home. "The process is like painting the Golden Gate bridge," explains Mr. Cornwell. "You start at one end and when you finish you go back and start again."
Field-testing ends in July, 2011, and data analysis will be completed by October, 2011. During this time, any further advancements in new technologies will continue to be tested.
And if this seems like overkill, Mr. Cornwell points to Los Angeles, where it was announced recently that 140,000 streetlights would be replaced with LED fixtures over the next five years. "It's very spotty, it's very un-uniform," says Mr. Cornwell of that city's new street lights. "One of the principles that's guiding ALAMP is that we shan't do anything that's detrimental to the health and safety of Torontonians."
But there's no guarantee for those of us who insist on walking with our heads up.

Full text: CPPIB's investment head is focused on where to get the future funds for Canadian retirees. For Mark Wiseman, China is the key
FINANCIAL SERVICES REPORTER
Mark Wiseman, the man in charge of investments at the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, has a habit of checking his wrists.
It's something he started a couple of years ago, but these days he's doing it all the time.
That's because on his frequent travels to Asia, Mr. Wiseman collects cufflinks with Asian pictures and patterns.
"I have them on almost every day," he says. "I like them, but I also think it's good to wear them to remind myself that I've got to be thinking about Asia."
His taste in accoutrements isn't the only thing that's changed in the past few years. Asia has eclipsed Europe in his travel schedule. "It's not that Europe is unimportant, it's just relatively less important," he says.
Mr. Wiseman and his fellow executives are increasingly turning their sights to Asia in an effort to ensure the fund's required future growth trajectory. It's estimated that CPP contributions will exceed the amount the plan pays out each year until the end of 2021, after which some of the fund's investment profits will be needed to help pay CPP benefits.
The CPPIB opened its first office outside Canada in Hong Kong in early 2008, and its only other foreign office is in London. In September, Mr. Wiseman made the trek to Hong Kong for the opening of a new, larger, CPPIB office.
"We were already out of space," he said. "Our growth [in Asia] has exceeded our expectations."
The office has roughly 15 investment professionals and five support staff, but that's expected to double.
The CPPIB has already committed more than $1.6-billion to eight private equity funds that focus on greater China and smaller emerging countries in Southeast Asia (excluding India). It has almost $350-million invested in China's real estate market and more than $1-billion in a passive index portfolio that trades in Hong Kong, out of a total portfolio of $138.6-billion.
But what's causing Mr. Wiseman some anxiety is the fact that less than 1 per cent of the fund's assets are directly invested in China. Although the CPPIB is already ahead of many peers in China, Mr. Wiseman is working to ensure that it substantially ramps up its investments in the country, and that the fund has access to the phenomenal economic growth expected to continue there.
"The reality is that China will be the largest economy in the world," he said during an interview in his office, as he pointed to a presentation that was recently given to the fund's board of directors. "To go to the United States or Europe [to invest] is an easy thing to do, but it's not reflective of what the world looks like today and it's certainly not going to be reflective of where the world's going to be long term."
Over time, CPPIB wants to become a player in India and other areas of Southeast Asia. "We're focused on building a presence in emerging markets, but China's the logical place to start," Mr. Wiseman said.
The fund's strategy has been to find partners with local knowledge, including big North American names such as KKR Asia and TPG Asia, but mostly Chinese-based private equity firms such as CITIC Capital and Hony Capital.
"We know we're going to get taught some lessons along the way, and so we're not jumping in with both feet," Mr. Wiseman said.
But as it learns from the locals and assembles its team on the ground, CPPIB is setting the stage for its first large direct investment in China. It has hired Peter Chen, a direct investor who was a founding member of Bain Capital Asia and prior to that was a manager at General Electric Corporate Financial Services, with responsibilities for greater China.
Asked whether CPPIB has created a position as head of its Asian business yet, Mr. Wiseman said "stay tuned."

Full text: A new report shows that recoveries in Europe and North America aren't keeping up with the rest of the world, Siri Agrell writes
Istanbul was Constantinople and now the former capital of the Roman Empire has emerged at the forefront of global economic recovery.
A new ranking of 150 cities reveals the urban centres that have made the best rebounds from the global financial crisis that began in 2008.
The Global Metro Monitor, released by Washington's Brookings Institution, measured employment trends and the growth of local economies to reveal that the financial downturn has shaken up the metropolitan world order. The cities that have demonstrated the greatest economic resilience are not centralized in the United States or Europe, but spread throughout Latin America and Asia, where a new network of trading partners, from Lima, Peru, to Shenzhen, China, has shed its reliance on U.S. markets.
Many of the top-ranked cities also benefited from conservative banking regulations in the lead-up to the crisis, according to the report's author, Alan Berube, and became havens for investment after the implosion of Wall Street.
Only one U.S. city - Austin, Tex. - cracked the top 30, along with Canada's highest-ranked city, Montreal. And while some U.S. centres, including Detroit and Cleveland, appear to be on the mend, many European capitals remain in decline.
"We knew things were bad here, but people are reading this and saying 'Thank God we're not Europe,'" Mr. Berube said.
******
UP
1. Istanbul
The Turkish capital is the surprise victor in urban economic recovery, with the highest recent employment growth of any city in the world. Although it was heavily affected by the immediate fallout of the global financial crisis because of its strong links to the European Union, Istanbul made a quick and impressive rebound. With a conservative banking sector and a strong trading relationship with Asia, the export-oriented port city took advantage of increasing demand in the Far East for its manufactured goods as the European market withered. Istanbul may also have benefited from the financial collapse of its neighbour. "Some of the capital that sloshed towards Turkey might have been coming out of Greece when the debt crisis hit that country," Mr. Berube said.
3. Lima
The fourth-largest city in South America produces more than half of Peru's gross domestic product and also has soaring rates of employment. Financial sector regulation protected much of Latin America from the banking crisis that crippled the United States and, like Istanbul, Lima became a haven for the investment of global capital pulled out of U.S. and European markets. Peru has major mining and agricultural sectors and had established trade agreements with several Asian countries before the recession, supplying the minerals from which growing cities are built.
26. Austin
More than just the alt-rock capital of the U.S., Austin is home to the University of Texas, the state government and social-networking giant Facebook's only facility outside of California. An emerging information technology centre, Austin's major industries were not drastically affected by the recession and the city's income has grown faster than the national average over the past two years.Texas employed more conservative lending standards in the lead-up to the subprime mortgage crisis, saving it from the housing bubble.
27. Montreal
The only Canadian city in the top 30 and one of just four Western centres to demonstrate a dramatic rebound, Montreal climbed from a pre-recession ranking of 74. Canadian banking regulations also prevented a U.S.-style real estate crisis, but with Toronto coming in at 63 and Vancouver at 92, Mr. Berube said Montreal also benefited from having the largest inland port in the world, as well as the strength of its aerospace and electronics sectors.
DOWN
146. Las Vegas
To say the city has come up snake eyes is something of an understatement. After a pre-recession boom that saw it ranked at 14 in terms of income and employment growth, Las Vegas suffered from one of the biggest real estate bubbles in the United States. The gambling oasis took another hit when the global recession caused a major decline in tourism, forcing the city's hospitality and retail sectors - which employ more than half of Las Vegas residents - to make major layoffs. But unlike some European cities, Mr. Berube said the Nevada city will be pulled out of its decline as the rest of the country rebounds.
150. Dublin
Before the recession, the Irish capital had been experiencing a period of rapid economic growth and was ranked No. 6 among expanding economic centres. Along with Madrid and Las Vegas, the Irish capital dropped from the top 30 urban economies before the recession, to among the bottom 30 post-recession. "That region is going to take quite a while to get over the hangover," Mr. Berube said. "I'm not sure that the austerity measures they're undertaking right now are going to spur rapid growth there any time soon."

Full text:   Study shows that taxes on commercial property rents are greater here than anywhere else in the world
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Canada is the world's most expensive country in which to own office towers, at least when it comes to how deeply taxes cut into profits.
Taxes on commercial property rents in Canada are a "massive" 53 per cent of total income, according to a study by international tax advisory firm Taxand. The United States, the next highest country on the list, taxes its commercial property rents at 41 per cent.
"The alarmingly high total tax rate in Canada is largely the combined result of high levels of both income tax, which stands at a rate of 30 per cent, and real estate tax at 3.6 per cent," the study concludes.
The study looked at how much tax a landlord pays on the rent payments it receives. That includes value-added taxes such as Canada's goods and services tax, property taxes and corporate income taxes.
Finland charges the least tax on commercial rental income at 8.99 per cent.
Part of the reason for the gap between Canada and other countries is that the Canadian market held up better through the recession. Landlords had easier access to credit, and there were few distressed sales to drive down values.
In key cities such as Toronto, vacancy rates didn't decline as much as some had expected, allowing landlords to keep their tenants. With vacancy rates holding steady, the municipalities haven't felt the need to lower tax rates to remain competitive and help landlords hang on to their tenants.
Many countries lowered their taxes - both corporate and property - last year in an attempt to firm up commercial real estate markets. In the Netherlands, the overall taxation rate decreased to 17.67 per cent from 25.67 per cent, with most of the drop coming from changes that allowed landlords to deduct annual depreciation from their income tax base.
Germany also saw a decrease, to 13.7 per cent from 20.66 per cent. Overall, taxes on rents decreased 0.75 per centfrom last year's survey, which did not include Canada.
"The overall decrease has undoubtedly prevailed as a result of competition for inward investment in the wake of the global financial crisis," said Keith O'Donnell, Taxand's Luxembourg-based head of real estate.
"Whilst governments will undoubtedly have considered an increase to plug budgetary deficits, authorities are clearly more concerned about the potentially disastrous knock-on effect that could be caused by a depressed property market," Mr. O'Donnell said.
Canadian taxes are higher because local municipalities have relatively few ways to raise money to pay for the services they deliver, said Gerry Divaris, the vice-president and national practice director at Cushman & Wakefield. Because of that, the temptation to raise property taxes - particularly on corporations - can be great.
Property tax rates charged to businesses in Canada are higher than the rates charged to homeowners. For example, in Toronto the property tax on an office tower is 4 per cent while a house is charged at 1.24 per cent.
"The situation is that these assets are generally seen as cash cows, and the ability of most municipalities to generate new revenue is very limited," Mr. Divaris said.
"This needs to be viewed in light of globalization. We can't afford to tax the heck out of our assets because the folks who want to invest here will see their costs are significantly higher," he said. "To continue taxing this way is to lose investment to other parts of the world."
If municipalities hope to attract real estate investors they need to bring the two rates closer, said CD Howe Institute analyst Ben Dachis, especially because businesses don't tend to reap the benefits of municipal taxes in the same way as homeowners.
"There are very few services that businesses actually receive from municipalities," he said, adding landlords are typically charged user fees for things such as water and sewer services on top of their taxes.
"Most of the services and the education system they fund are for the residents, which only
tangentially benefit the employer."
The taxman's sticky fingers don't seem to be hurting the country's investment landscape, however, with the value of commercial property deals set to reach $16-billion by the end of the year, according to Avison Young.
That's $4-billion more than in 2009, powered largely by real estate investment trusts that have been able to raise millions of dollars to invest in office, industrial, retail, land and multi-residential properties.
"This upswing is attributed to a number of factors, including stable and improving market fundamentals, historically low borrowing costs, high availability of debt, a narrowing bid-ask gap and the emergence of REITs as active buyers," said Avison Young's director of research Bill Argeropoulos.
Office sales have accounted for about $2.3-billion of 2010's sales, Mr. Argeropoulos said.

Abstract: The REIT structure "opens up a whole new investor set and mobilizes that capital," said Gavin Ingram, a director at OPTrust Private Markets Group who is responsible for North American infrastructure. "That has been a roadblock - how do we get the capital in the U.S. to help this renewable power get to market."

Full text:   Ontario pension manager part of group launching energy infrastructure trust
Canada's OPTrust Private Markets Group, the private-equity and infrastructure arm of the big Government of Ontario employee pension fund, is teaming with four giant partners to create a first-of-its-kind real estate investment trust that will invest in U.S. power infrastructure.
REITS have traditionally invested in real estate such as malls and office towers. This $2.1-billion U.S. REIT will seek to own key electrical and natural-gas assets such as local distribution companies and power lines, the first time such investments have been packaged into a REIT. The REIT will have an emphasis on infrastructure for renewable power.
By creating a REIT, OPTrust Private Markets Group and its partners can spin off more cash from the assets and get better tax treatment.
The structure has long intrigued bankers and investors, but there are several challenges to making it work, including assembling a group of investors.
The pension fund manager is investing alongside Marubeni Corp., a Japanese trading company; Hunt Power of Texas; Manulife Financial Corp.'s U.S. arm; and TIAA-CREF, which manages money for those in the academic, research, medical and cultural fields in the United States.
OPTrust Private Markets Group handles all the private-equity and infrastructure investments for OPTrust, a $12.1-billion government employee pension plan. The group has quietly been building one of the larger pension-fund, private-markets teams in the country.
The group has offices in Toronto and London and more than 30 employees. It has about 20 investments in its portfolio, including stakes in Thames Water, a British utility; Oceanex, which ships goods by water from the mainland to Newfoundland; and Porterbrook, a train-leasing company in Britain that was created as part of the privatization of British Rail.
In 2009, OPTrust Private Market's infrastructure investments generated a 14.5-per-cent return, while its private equity investments lost 3.1 per cent.
Wall Street and investors have been working to create such REITS since the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ruled a few years ago that transmission assets - such as pipes and power lines -could qualify as real property eligible to be owned by a REIT.
The advantage of a REIT is that it minimizes taxation at the corporate level by passing almost all its cash flow on to owners.
A REIT also attracts investors who want to get into power assets but want yield and cash flow, rather than a more traditional private-equity investment that is built on the notion of an increase in value of the underlying asset.
The REIT structure "opens up a whole new investor set and mobilizes that capital," said Gavin Ingram, a director at OPTrust Private Markets Group who is responsible for North American infrastructure. "That has been a roadblock - how do we get the capital in the U.S. to help this renewable power get to market."
Some of the challenges in setting up the REIT included satisfying rules on U.S. control of assets, as well as creating a partnership because a single investor is not be permitted to do it. OPTrust Private Markets Group has been working on the deal and its partnership for more than a year.
For now, the REIT will be a private affair. The initial assets will come from Hunt Power, which will contribute utility and distribution assets as well as cash.
Once the $2.1-billion is invested, with $400-million coming from OPTrust's share, the structure enables the owners to take the REIT public to seek more capital, said Kevin Warn-Schindel, head of the private markets group.
"As the strategy plays itself out and the asset base gets added to, it will reach a size where to grow beyond that would be beyond the capital capabilities of the existing group. That would be when we would potentially want to introduce public investors."

As Spain issues denials, bailout fears accelerate

Abstract: While Spain's 2010 budget deficit is high, at 9 per cent of gross domestic product, its national debt at about 53 per cent of GDP is fairly low by euro zone standards, giving it some flexibility. Some economists say that, on paper, Spain should not be a bailout victim because its deficit is coming down, thanks to austerity measures and tax hikes; exports are improving; and unemployment seems to be stabilizing, though it remains painfully high at about 20 per cent.

Full text:   If country's efforts to avoid rescue package fail, entire euro zone would be put at risk
A disturbing pattern is emerging in the galloping euro zone debt crisis. A struggling country denies it needs a bailout. Investors don't believe it and drive up sovereign bond yields, making the bailout inevitable.
The no-bailout-yes-bailout reversal happened in Greece earlier this year. Two weeks ago, Ireland's politicians forcibly denied a bailout was needed, then accepted one on Sunday. On Friday, it was Spain's turn to deny.
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero told Barcelona broadcaster RAC1 that he is "absolutely" ruling out the need for a rescue package from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund and said speculators betting on plummeting Spanish bond prices might get burned. "I should warn those investors who are short-selling Spain that they are going to be wrong and will go against their own interests," he said.
Not to be outdone, Portugal issued a similar denial after German media reports suggested the European Central Bank and some countries in the euro zone - the 16 European Union countries that share the euro - were heaping pressure on Portugal to accept a bailout. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who is a former Portuguese prime minister, rejected the German reports as "absolutely false."
The Spanish and Portuguese offensives came after the bond yields of the two countries surged, thanks to fears that the euro zone debt crisis is accelerating. The yields on Spanish bonds have climbed more than 100 basis points (one percentage point) since the start of November, with half of that increase coming in the last week, in the wake of the Irish bond collapse. The yield on 10-year Spanish bonds went as high as 5.28 per cent on Friday, pushing the spread over benchmark German bonds to 264 basis points, the highest level since the euro was born 11 years ago.
Spanish yields fell slightly later in the day, when Spain's government announced it would proceed with its remaining debt auctions this year, though they would be scaled back slightly because the state is well funded. Ireland, meanwhile, took a fresh blow when Standard & Poor's lowered the credit rating of Anglo Irish Bank six levels, to junk status. The ratings on other Irish banks dropped only one-notch.
The euro zone countries, both weak and strong, are finding it impossible to shield themselves from the debt contagion. Yields on Belgian bonds, considered one of the euro zone's safest sovereign investments, have been steadily rising and reached 3.68 per cent, more than a full point over German bonds. The cost of insuring Belgian bonds is climbing, even though the country has a fairly strong GDP growth rate (2.1 per cent in the third quarter) and a relatively low budget deficit. Italy's bond insurance costs have also been rising.
Spain is doing everything in its power to avoid becoming the next bailout victim. If its efforts fail, the entire euro zone would be at risk because the Spanish economy is 70 per cent bigger than that of Greece, Ireland and Portugal combined. A bailout would strain the resources of the EUR750-billion ($1.01-trillion) euro-region bailout fund, dominated by the EUR440-billion European Financial Stability Facility.
While Spain's 2010 budget deficit is high, at 9 per cent of gross domestic product, its national debt at about 53 per cent of GDP is fairly low by euro zone standards, giving it some flexibility. Some economists say that, on paper, Spain should not be a bailout victim because its deficit is coming down, thanks to austerity measures and tax hikes; exports are improving; and unemployment seems to be stabilizing, though it remains painfully high at about 20 per cent. Local banks, heavily exposed to the collapsed real estate sector, are being restructured, though economists say the effort should be accelerated.
In a recent note, Deutsche Bank economist Gilles Moec said, "We consider that [Spain's] fiscal consolidation is on track" and should not need more cutbacks.
But Spain's successful deficit-reduction efforts may not be enough to fend off the bond sellers. Traders say Spain is particularly vulnerable to any whiff of default anxiety because it, unlike Ireland and Portugal, has a highly liquid bond market, which is attracting short sellers.
******
HOW SPAIN STACKS UP
Public debt: 53% of GDP
Compared to many other parts of Europe, Spain's public debt is at reasonable levels. Both France and Germany are in the mid-70s, while the European Union average is 74.7 per cent. French and German banks have the highest exposure to Spain's debt, together holding about 60 per cent of its bonds. Still, the spread between German and Spanish bonds has been rising sharply lately.

Unemployment: 20 per cent
Spain's unemployment rate is among the highest in Europe. The number of jobless has risen by almost a million per year since the real estate bubble burst in 2007. By comparison, Germany's jobless rate is less than 7 per cent, and the average for the European union is under 10 per cent.

Abstract: Because every floor of [Marilyn Monroe] is different, Mr. [Soudack] explained, the walls and columns of each had to be designed separately to bear up under the forces - what architects and engineers call "loads" - exerted on the building by nature.

Full text:   Thoroughly modern Marilyn Monroe condo tower rests on a bedrock of pioneering work
jmays@globeandmail.com
Last Friday's topping-off party for Marilyn Monroe - as everyone calls Beijing architect Yansong Ma's curvaceous 56-storey Absolute condominium tower in Mississauga - was a celebration of the many people whose energies and talents came together to realize this unusual project.
But the event also marked the completion of the Toronto area's first residential tall building in a thoroughly 21st century style. Marilyn, as built, is more portly and less daring than Mr. Ma's original design, but she's still a bit sassy, sexy and irreverent toward the formal pieties of cereal-box skyscraper modernism. She talks back to Toronto developers who complain that they can't build and sell anything except the same boring stuff we've been seeing since the Second World War. She has also proven to be wildly popular with condo consumers, who snapped up her suites as soon as they hit the local real-estate market.
(Construction of a second Marilyn tower is now under way.)
Mr. Ma won out over 91 competitors from 70 countries in a 2006 juried contest staged by Fernbrook Homes and the Cityzen Group, co-developers of the site at the important Mississauga intersection of Burnhamthorpe Road and Hurontario Street. Fernbrook and Cityzen wanted a scheme that promised to pack a strong architectural wallop in the largely low-rise suburban city immediately west of Toronto and, as it was originally proposed, they got one.
But after the flashbulb hoopla of the competition passed - Mr. Ma's capture of the prize garnered international press attention - the developers had to face the task of pulling the designer's sinuous, sensuous idea down from the clouds and figuring out a practical, affordable way to raise it, or some semblance of it, from the Mississauga mud.
To get that job done, they turned to Toronto architect Atilla Burka and structural engineer Sigmund Soudack. Last week, I talked with Mr. Soudack and his associate, architect Yury Gelman, in their North York office.
"Marilyn really got our juices moving," Mr. Soudack said. "It required extraordinary effort from a creative, structural aspect. We had to do a lot of pioneering. I've been designing for 42 years, but I had never done [a tall building] like this. There was nothing in our history we could fall back on. What's unique about this project is that every floor is different. Each floor is basically an ellipse that keeps moving." As Marilyn spirals from the ground, the elliptical floor-plates rotate 209 degrees, bottom to top, to generate the pneumatic profile of the building.
Because every floor of Marilyn is different, Mr. Soudack explained, the walls and columns of each had to be designed separately to bear up under the forces - what architects and engineers call "loads" - exerted on the building by nature. There is "dead load," the immense weight of the concrete and steel of the structural fabric itself. There is wind load, which is tested on models in wind tunnels, and the load of the earth tremors that occasionally rattle Toronto-area teacups. Put all the factors together, and you arrive at the "load combinations" that every supporting element must sustain. Making Marilyn stand up and assume its proper shape involved calculating more than 200 of these load combinations. Designing an ordinary tall building entails the calibration of only 10 or 15 of them.
"If the building had been concentric from top to bottom, with columns sitting on top of each other - that's normally the way we design buildings - it would have been simple," Mr. Soudack said. "But in this case all the loads, the centre of gravity of each column, is constantly shifting."
Understanding the extraordinarily complex forces at work in a tall building could conceivably be accomplished - and was accomplished, early on in the career of skyscrapers - with nothing more complicated than a slide rule, pencils and paper. But the jobs of architects and engineers have recently been made been easier and more economical by ever-greater advances in computer technology.
"Software today is very sophisticated," Mr. Gelman said. "It can account for different phenomena, different behaviours of the structure. [To design Marilyn,] we had to learn new aspects of the software we had, and we had to master new software. When we designed some of the columns, we used software that accounts for the non-linear behaviour of materials. Because of the shape of the walls, because the column is curved, the building received additional forces [that] create tensions throughout the structure. All this was accounted for during the analysis and design of the building."
So much for the craft of engineering. The art of it, for Mr. Soudack, consists in never losing sight of the ultimate goal: fashioning a structure that is profitable for its investors and hospitable for homeowners. He estimates the cost of putting up Marilyn at about 20 per cent above that of a conventional tower.
"Marilyn is beautiful, it's fantastic," Mr. Soudack said. "Luckily, it was very well received by the public, because it's something unique. But ultimately, we don't know at this point how it will be received when people start moving in. That is the ultimate test: whether people are happy. That's the unknown."

Pride goes before good communities

Abstract: "Those three were the top of the list in almost all the communities we surveyed that were growing economically," says Paula Ellis, vice-president strategic initiatives for the Miami-based foundation.

Full text:   New study may serve as a guide to growth
tbelford@globeandmail.com
Is emotional attachment to a community directly related to economic growth? If so, what are the most important factors defining that emotional attachment?
The John F. and James L. Knight Foundation, based in Miami, has been looking at those questions for the past three years and the results of their findings are not only quite remarkable, they may also provide some insight into just how we can keep Toronto livable and economically successful in the years to come.
The foundation's findings are especially relevant for cities like Toronto that are going through massive change. We are building up instead of out. That means public spaces like parks and condo terraces are replacing private spaces like backyards.
We have to make high-density neighbourhoods of concrete and glass so attractive that people take pride in them and so comfortable and relaxing that they want to walk, entertain, work and shop within walking distance.
For three years, the foundation has commissioned the Gallup organization to do a phone survey of 43,000 people in 26 U.S. cities for what it calls The Knight Soul of the Community Survey.
It found that cities whose residents expressed the greatest civic pride also had the highest growth rates in gross domestic product. The more the residents loved living in a city, the faster it grew and the more it prospered financially.
The three main factors determining love for community were: openness, social offerings and physical beauty.
"Those three were the top of the list in almost all the communities we surveyed that were growing economically," says Paula Ellis, vice-president strategic initiatives for the Miami-based foundation.
"This is an area where little research has been done and we hope it can be a starting point for much more."
Openness means a welcoming attitude not just to new arrivals but also to minority groups. It means having programs and the infrastructure in place to ensure existing residents a sense of belonging and to welcome new ones.
Cities compete for new businesses and for new residents. Openness is a powerful lure.
Social opportunities go hand in hand. They can range from great schools, universities and colleges to simple neighbourhood activities such as Cub and Brownie packs, little league sports and social clubs for seniors. What many of them share is support from local volunteers.
It makes sense that the more residents are engaged in creating a thriving social life in the community for people of all ages, the greater their commitment becomes to making it a great place to live.
The final point is beauty. Not every city can claim Vancouver's mountains and sea or Toronto's lakeshore and acres of green ravines and parks. What they can do, however, is make the most of what they have, says Ms. Ellis.
She talks of working with the city of Wichita. As she explains it, the city once had one magnificent street sheltered by old leafy trees. Disease, however, killed all those trees and the city decided money would be better spent in other areas.
"After talking with us, however, and looking at the research material, they decided to replant that boulevard and restore it to its former beauty. The result drew praise from locals and visitors alike," she says.
Indeed, you can see similar things happening in areas of the GTA. In Yorkville, the local business improvement association is spending millions to improve the streetscape and make it more welcoming to shoppers. New condo projects of any size downtown are required to spend money on street art.
The foundation's survey is an important document and suggests a path to the future of livable, successful communities.
"The next big challenge will be getting the message across," says Ms. Ellis.

Full text:   Lower house prices coupled with a higher Canadian dollar can make for a sweet deal, but getting to know the local market is crucial
The collapse of the U.S. housing market has been epic. Home prices remain 30 per cent below the peak of May, 2006, as measured by the S & P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index.
Unlike stocks, bonds and commodities, U.S. real estate has not had a big runup in prices since the Crash of 2008. It's one of the few asset classes where bargain hunters might still be tempted to jump in. The values are even more enticing for Canadians, owing to a gain of more than 30 per cent in the loonie against the U.S. dollar since 2004.
"These are the best buying prices I have ever seen for U.S. houses," declares Bob Keats, a financial planner since 1981 and author of The Border Guide: A Canadian's Guide to Living, Working and Investing in the United States . "Canadians are able to buy one-third more than they could have a few years ago."
The savings may even be greater than that. The housing affordability index calculated by the National Association of Realtors (NAR) in the United States is showing a huge improvement: In the third quarter of 2010, it was nearly 50 per cent higher than the average of 2007. Not only did tumbling house prices contribute to affordability, but so did a slide in mortgage rates to 4.75 per cent from 6.5 per cent.
Jim Chuong, a Toronto-based sales representative for Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc., has been shopping for U.S. investment properties since the fall of 2009. He has made several purchases since his first in early 2010.
After an intensive screening of regions in the U.S. sunbelt, he narrowed his focus to Arizona. A key criterion was low crime rates: With the help of crime data published on the websites of most U.S. cities, he found that Arizona neighbourhoods were among the best for having both low crime rates and low house prices.
"I'm finding rental condominiums for sale in Arizona at $50 [U.S.] per square foot in decent neighbourhoods, with little property or violent crime," he notes. "That's as much as one-tenth the cost in Toronto."
Also appealing were the choices for registering title. The state had an ownership option known as "community property with rights of survivorship," which allows Mr. Chuong's estate, in the event of his death, to pass on U.S. properties to his wife with few tax hassles.
As well, taxes and insurance costs are low in Arizona. Annual property taxes, says Mr. Keats, are under $1,500 for a $200,000 house - less than half the taxes levied in fiscally challenged Florida and California. There are big savings on home-insurance premiums too, compared with hurricane-prone Florida and earthquake-prone California.
Mr. Keats, formerly from Vancouver and now living in Phoenix, favours Arizona, too. For retirees, detached houses with swimming pools and backing onto golf courses can be found at prices ranging from $150,000 to $200,000 - and such properties are near major metropolitan areas, close to amenities.
Mr. Keats feels confident in a housing rebound. "There is an influx of approximately 40,000 people into the Phoenix/Scottsdale area every year, thanks to growth in industries such as tourism, defence and aerospace," he explains. "That should, in due course, absorb the surplus of houses on the market."
Rachelle Berube, a Toronto-based property manager who writes the Landlord Rescue blog, advises a cautious approach. "You know what they say about real estate: It's all about location, location, location," she says. "Because of the local nature of markets, you really have to do your due diligence.
"A friend bought a house in Florida for $60,000, which seems like a great deal compared to Canadian houses. But in Florida that price is still $10,000 above the average in the area. My friend also found out she can't work on her own house; there is a rule that only U.S. citizens can do repairs or renovations on houses in her area."
Getting to know the market before buying is especially important in the case of investment properties. "If the tenant stops paying, or the property manager is doing a lousy job, it's hard to address these things when you are thousands of miles away. You'll have to buy many properties in the same area to make a flight worthwhile. I personally prefer to own rentals close to where I live, so I can get to them easily."
Research is vital, even if you're buying a property to live in. Ms. Berube offers another illustration. "A couple bought a foreclosure at an auction and moved into the house. Later, they were shocked to receive an eviction notice. It turns out they had bought the second mortgage and did not really own the property.
"If you are going to buy in the U.S., take the time to really know the area, and avoid tour bus trips sponsored by real-estate brokers to see foreclosures, and areas marketed to foreign buyers. You absolutely don't want to be part of the buying frenzy. There are 52 states to pick from; go your own way."
The inventory of unsold houses suggests U.S. housing prices could remain weak well into 2011, if not see further discounting. According to NAR data, unsold houses total nearly 11 months of supply, well above the norm of five to six months.
U.S. housing should eventually recover but, as seasoned value investors like Mr. Chuong know, exact bottoms in markets are hard to predict.

Full text:   REAL ESTATE REPORTER
The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board may be ultimately focused on Canadian retirees, but its real estate activities this year have been anything but local.
With few deals to be found in Canada's relatively robust commercial real estate market, the $138-billion fund has spent a lot of time scouring recession-battered countries for the deals it couldn't find at home.
It has been working with a considerable advantage - the Canadian market didn't see property values decline at the same rate as other countries, because the banks were able to keep the money flowing and renegotiate mortgages through the worst of the recession.
That left the fund with cash that could be spent where owners have been under considerably more pressure - it has spent $840-million in the United States, and about $762-million in Europe. By contrast, its only Canadian deal was worth $230-million.
On Monday the fund cut its biggest European deal of the year, saying it would spend $486-million for a quarter stake in a London shopping centre next to the city's Olympic village.
The pension fund said it would own 25 per cent of the Westfield Stratford City project, with APG of the Netherlands scooping up another 25 per cent stake for the same price. Developer Westfield Group will retain the other 50 per cent of the retail project, which has been valued near $2.8-billion.
The centre will be anchored by John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, Waitrose and a movie theatre. It will include more than 300 stores and 50 restaurants. The mall will have 1.9-million square feet of retail and entertainment space when it is finished in the third quarter of 2011.
About 75 per cent of the space is pre-leased.
The fund's senior vice-president of real estate operations, Graeme Eadie, answered questions about the fund's approach.
What attracted you to the
shopping centre?
It's a very major shopping centre in the U.K. market and in Europe. We're getting in at the front end, which should get us some long-term upside. The deal really hits all of the sweet spots for us.
What sweet spots?
Well, the return is primary. The long-term profile is next. We have a very strong partner in Westfield and a well-aligned investment partner with APG.
What is the U.K. strategy?
The core philosophy is to find good quality, long-term assets. We entered the market a few years ago, and now the market has gone through the trough and is coming back out the other side.
So you feel U.K. real estate has bottomed out?
I think the pricing has recovered to the point where we are being a little more selective. We bought a few things [through the recession] and then backed off, and as it appeared to be bottoming we started to buy again.
How many people do you have working in London?
We have eight doing real estate; there's a private equity team on top of that.
What about in your other offices?
We have six in Hong Kong, and then the balance is in Toronto, where we have about 24 people.
Where are the opportunities right now for commercial real estate buyers?
Australia seems to be offering some interesting opportunities. We have some exposure to China. Canada and the U.S. are core markets, but in the U.S. pricing has increased so it's a little more difficult to find deals that are really attractive.
What are you seeing in China?
Most of the opportunities there are in building new - there's not very much that we'd buy. It moves at a quicker pace - there's a very high level of growth and many development opportunities. You have to be very nimble.
Do you need to work harder to find deals now that the market has firmed up a bit?
Well, you always have to work hard.
But wasn't it easier to be a cash buyer last year than it is now?
Strangely, not entirely. Pricing was such last year that the vendors didn't want to sell. The vendor has to get their price, but it has to be something that we still see as attractive.
How are things in Canada?
You haven't been that busy here.
Canada is fairly strong, the fundamentals are generally good across the board. But there's not a lot that comes available. There just isn't a lot of depth to the market.

BUYING ABROAD
A breakdown of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board's real estate investments for 2010:
$762-million in Europe
London: Westfield Stratford City shopping centre, $486-million. CPPIB on Monday said it would buy a quarter stake in the giant retail development next to the site of the 2012 Summer Olympics.
London: 10 Gresham Street, $208-million. The fund bought a 70-per-cent stake in an eight-storey office tower. The 260,000-square-foot property is occupied by Lloyds TSB bank and seven other tenants.
Hürth, Germany: Hürth Park shopping centre, $68-million. The fund took an 80-per-cent interest in a centre near Cologne with about 60,000 square feet of retail space.
$840-million in the U.S.
New York City: 1221 Avenue of the Americas/600 Lexington Avenue, $575-million. The fund bought 45-per-cent stakes in the two office towers in a deal it cites as a sign that it has arrived as one of the world's big players.
Washington, D.C.: 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue NW and 1101 17th Street NW, $92-million. The fund receives a 45-per-cent interest in two office towers. 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue, known as the Warner Building, is a 13-storey, class-A office building with more than 600,000 square feet, about three blocks east of the White House. The other property is a 13-storey tower.
Multiple locations: Five shopping centres, $173-million. CPPIB partnered with Kimco Realty Corp., taking 45-per-cent stakes in shopping centres in Hollywood, Fla.; Arlington, Va.; and the California cities of San Diego, Temecula and El Cajon.
$230-million in Canada
Multiple locations: Eight shopping centres, $230-million. The fund bought the Hillside Centre in Victoria outright, and boosted its stake to 100 per cent in shopping centres in such cities as Prince George, B.C.; and London, Stoney Creek, Sudbury and Thunder Bay, Ont. It took a 90-per-cent stake in malls in Quebec City and Sherbrooke, Que.

Abstract: The sellers of this home brought their asking price down in response, "to the negative reporting of real estate values on the six o'clock news," says Mr. [Bruce Lasuta]. "A wise real estate investor once said 'in British Columbia, you'll never lose money in real estate. You'll just sell too soon,' which means quite simply, the market will always have ups and downs but, it always comes back."

Listing agent
Bruce Lasuta, Prudential Sussex Realty
The Action: In April, this 1,032-square-foot home was listed for $579,000. After a failed offer of $515,000, the price was reduced. The sellers received another failed offer and in August they reduced the price again to $429,000.
"As we are seeing more and more often now due to our aging local population, some elderly owners are no longer able to maintain their homes," says agent Bruce Lasuta. "Family members, because they have moved away from the area, or are also retired themselves and not wanting the homes, are selling these older family homes. Some are quite modest in size and value while being surrounded by recently built, more modern 'trophy homes' in the neighbourhood."
In this case, the seller's family did not want to have to maintain the one-bedroom home over the fast approaching fall and winter months, so when they received a "very clean" offer of $387,000, they took it.
What They Got: This was the home's first time to market. The previous owners purchased the property in 1975 from forestry company McMillan Bloedell for $28,500. The new owners, from Vancouver use the home as a "weekend destination" and were able to take quick possession and enjoy the warm September weekends, says Mr. Lasuta.
The Agent's Take: "Savvy buyers are aware of the 'contrarian rule' that suggests you buy when the market is selling and sell when the market is buying," says Mr. Lasuta.
More importantly, they realize that real estate is not as liquid as some 'flip this house' programs would suggest. Instead, they purchase quality properties in a good area for long term personal use while taking advantage of present market conditions."
The sellers of this home brought their asking price down in response, "to the negative reporting of real estate values on the six o'clock news," says Mr. Lasuta. "A wise real estate investor once said 'in British Columbia, you'll never lose money in real estate. You'll just sell too soon,' which means quite simply, the market will always have ups and downs but, it always comes back."

Rick Hedvigi probably qualifies as a sort of Internet pioneer. Earlier this fall he became one of the first people in the GTA to sell his home through a new Internet-based listing service.
Sage Real Estate, formerly a Sutton Group franchise, split from Sutton in September and created its own version of the Multiple Listing Service available only to Sage clients. It is the first brokerage in the GTA to do so.
Sign with Sage and you get all the bells and whistles of a traditional brokerage, including a listing on the Toronto Real Estate Board's MLS. But you also get a dedicated website for your home complete with up to 30 professionally shot photos and a description of the property, a link to Sage's own corporate site and social media sites like YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, Realty Stock, Oodle, Craigslist and Kijiji.
Mr. Hedvigi got three competing offers for his Royal York Road and Bloor Street home within a week of listing with Sage - two through Facebook and one through Google - and sold the property in the high $700,000 range or $50,000 above the list price.
"It was terrific," he says. "We didn't have to go through open houses, we sold very, very quickly and we got quite a bit more than we asked. Frankly, I am surprised no one created a service like this before."
Sage might be the first GTA brokerage to launch its own version of the MLS on steroids but other groups have not overlooked techno trends. Some surveys suggest up to 90 per cent of people looking to buy real estate start their search on the Internet.
Want to know what a specific neighbourhood is like? Try www.zoocasa.com. There is even an iPhone version that pinpoints the user's location through GPS and shows all nearby properties for sale.
Use it on your home computer and you can pull up details and descriptions of the surrounding community.
Looking for a sunshine rental or ownership vacation home in Florida? This November saw the launch of a new site called www.flahomesandcondos.ca. It is a one-stop resource for Canadians looking to rent or buy in the state.
There is a section that allows Florida agents to list both rental and resale condos and homes, searchable by area, property type and price range and a section that lists local professionals such as lawyers, mortgage brokers and tax specialists.
The site that is likely to have the most profound effect on GTA residents, however, is the Sage site. It is among the first in this city to harness the accessibility and ubiquity of the Internet to buy and sell residential property.
While no one will yet discuss its implications, the private Internet-based system is also likely to have an eventual impact on real estate commissions. Why pay a 5-per-cent commission when technology is doing all the heavy lifting?
Right now, Sage is sticking with standard negotiated commissions, says vice-president Evan Sage. The service is only a few months old. Too soon to decide such weighty issues.
What he knows is that it works and justifies the gamble the company took. Larry Sage, Evan's father, started the company 33 years ago and for the past 13 years it was a member of the Sutton Group, operating as Sutton Bayview.
As Evan tells the story, Sage senior became more and more impressed with the potential of the Internet during visits to conferences in the United States. About a year ago he decided to completely reshape the way his company did business.
First he would have to break the ties with Sutton Group. The money saved in franchise fees helped pay for the investment in new technology required, Evan says. Then he invited his two sons Evan and Bradley to leave their jobs and join him at the newly minted Sage Real Estate.
Admittedly, some agents concerned about the new way of doing business left the company, winnowing its strength down to about 87 agents. Trial runs in October saw the company pick up and post about 41 new listings and the response in almost all cases was encouraging.

Fraser Street hits its stride

Author: Gold, Kerry

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/fraser-street-hits-stride/docview/806920000/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "What I'm getting at is that a year or a year-and-a-half ago, the people who wanted the character home on the tree-lined street, were saying, 'Okay, I can't afford Main Street, so I will plug my nose and move in here and we'll just pretend.' And now it's changed. Now they are saying, 'I want to be in that neighbourhood.'

Full text: Value-conscious home buyers have made a new discovery: 'The neighbourhood is hot as hell'
When the Beehive Hair Lounge packed up its hair supplies and moved to Fraser Street recently, an alarm bell sounded for Main Street shop owners.
Beehive had been a Main Street institution during the past decade, an independently owned shop with the kind of owners and staff who knew all the shop owners around them.
It's that mom-and-pop charm that has made Main Street one of the best pedestrian streets in the city. But high rents have pushed Beehive out of the neighbourhood and into the arms of Fraser Street, only seven or so blocks away. When faced with a rent increase that nearly doubled, owner Sarah Campbell decided to make the leap to Fraser, and she isn't alone.
The move is a telltale sign that Fraser Street is becoming the new Main Street. In the past year, real estate prices in the Fraser area have soared, a major condo project is under way, and retail businesses are slowly, but surely, trickling in.
"We are a small business, and we don't have a lot of extra income to pay huge rent and we don't want to raise our prices. To move a few blocks and keep prices low makes more sense to me," says Ms. Campbell, who, like more than half her clientele, also lives around Fraser.
"There are a lot of vacant spots on Main Street now, because rents are so high. The only people who can afford that rent are bigger corporations.
"It's gentrification. It happened on Cambie. You have to be aware of it, and you have to think forward. And I thought about it for the last five years, I saw it happening."
High prices have also pushed a lot of first-time home buyers out of the Main Street area and toward Fraser Street, a formerly non-descript, relatively low-priced area bordered by the semi-truck-thoroughfare that is Clark Drive. Perhaps precisely because of chaotic Clark Drive, the streets between Clark and Fraser have remained relatively untouched by new development. To the delight of heritage-home lovers, they contain a lot of intact old houses that, compared to those on Main Street, have proven a bargain during the last few years.
But those new residents have needs, such as coffee shops. Katharine Reynolds, who is one of Fraser's new residents, saw the demand and jumped at it.
Ms. Reynolds is owner of the just-opened Outpost Café on Fraser Street, located near the new Beehive. The film industry production designer had purchased a Queen Anne bungalow in the area three years ago for $525,000. After a renovation, she recently had it appraised at $865,000.
"It was an awesome investment," she says.
But her investment, she says, has turned into a great home, too. She's since fallen in love with the neighbourhood.
"A lot of my friends have moved into the neighbourhood as well," says Ms. Reynolds. "There are great character homes in this neighbourhood, and not so crazy expensive as the west side. I'm one block east of Fraser, and my house would have been $300,000 more if it was just a few blocks west, on the other side of Main."
There is a new listing for a five-bedroom house at 1044 E. 13th Avenue, near Glen Street, a block-and-a-half off Clark. The house, which has been totally renovated and sits on a 33-foot lot, is listed at $1.228-million. For the past three or four years, that kind of price tag was more often found around fashionable Main Street, not Fraser.
Realtor Nancy Steele wasn't surprised to hear about the new listing.
"Within the last six months, there have been sales well over $1-million in that area," she says.
As for whether she thinks Fraser is the new Main Street, she doesn't have to think long: "I just wonder whether you're too late to even say that. It's already happened."
Young families and first-time buyers already fill the neighbourhood. The parks are filled with mothers and strollers. The tired old character homes have undergone renovations and restorations. Front yard and boulevard gardens have sprouted. Block parties are held in the summer. There are line-ups to get into Les Faux Bourgeois, an upscale French bistro that saw a niche. At Fraser and 30th, a major condo development called Century is under way, with city-view units selling for around $400,000."A year ago, I was looking to buy a 30-year-old Vancouver Special around Glen Park for myself," says Ms. Steele. "They were going for $650,000 or $675,000 at the time, and now I'm looking closer to $800,000.
"What I'm getting at is that a year or a year-and-a-half ago, the people who wanted the character home on the tree-lined street, were saying, 'Okay, I can't afford Main Street, so I will plug my nose and move in here and we'll just pretend.' And now it's changed. Now they are saying, 'I want to be in that neighbourhood.'
"I wish I was more seriously anticipating this change," adds Ms. Steele. "I kind of saw it coming but I didn't jump on it."
Part of the appeal for house buyers, she says, is that the area is also approved for single-family laneway housing under the city's new eco-density initiative. As well, it's a central neighbourhood, with direct access to downtown along the Kingsway. And it has trees, lots of trees.
"It's one of the few areas where there are tree-lined streets. And there's an excellent school there," says Ms. Steele. "The neighbourhood is hot as hell."
Meanwhile, some Main Street shop owners worry about generic corporate retail moving in. There is a spacious Tim Hortons at Broadway, and developer Will Lin has plans for a 26-storey condo tower where the former Slickity Jim's Chat & Chew diner once served up breakfast for the locals.
"It's a huge topic around here, all the business owners are like, 'Wow, what is going on?'" says Red Cat Records co-owner Dave Gowans, who was surprised to see long-time shops like Beehive move out. Some have gone out of business due to rent hikes. Across the street, he has seen a real estate office move in and a children's bookstore move out.
The rumour is that a natural soap and oils chain store is going to move in to the old Beehive location, the sort of shop usually found in a yuppie neighbourhood like Fourth Avenue.
"In a few years, if things continue the way they are, and businesses keep having to move, I don't know what our existence will look like here," says Mr. Gowans. "I love this neighbourhood. I worry about stores like Starbucks moving in, things that we just don't really need more of in Vancouver."

Homes that get an A+

Abstract: Homeowners don't necessarily have to buy in areas with an IB school in order to attend. As a specialized program within the Toronto District School Board (which, unlike other districts, doesn't charge students wanting an IB diploma), the IB program is open to students outside a particular school's catchment area.

Full text: Parents in search of schools with International Baccalaureate programs are heating up the real estate market in some neighbourhoods
And now it's time for your Toronto Real Estate ABC's.
A) There's a new incentive for buying a house right now.
B) A school with an International Baccalaureate diploma.
C) It's a smart move.
Know this, and you can advance to the head of Toronto's home-purchasing class.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that IB schools are behind a recent spate of bidding wars erupting in the GTA.
Widely perceived as a private school perk, academically elite IB programs are increasingly on offer through the public system, and houses in neighbourhoods with IB schools already in place are reaping the benefits.
"They're a new real estate trend," says Bill Thom an agent with Re/Max who says much of his business these days is coming from parents looking to buy homes in areas where there are schools with an IB program.
"Instead of giving $25,000 to a private school, I tell my clients to put that money instead on their mortgage. An IB school in their neighbourhood is a guaranteed world-class education, so why look elsewhere?"
Mr. Thom says that houses in areas with an IB school are selling faster and for more money right now than those in areas where this rigorous academic program isn't already in place.
One of his recent listings was a two-storey at Bayview and 16th Avenue.
After only five days on the market received 10 offers, largely because of nearby Bayview Secondary School, which implemented its IB program about five years ago.
When that came in, it changed Bayview Hill's housing prices," says Mr. Thom. "Then they turned Bayview Hill Elementary School into an IB school too, so that made Bayview Hill even more desirable."
IB schools have a reputation for providing among the most challenging of high school programs.
The International Baccalaureate was originally developed in Switzerland in 1948 as a rigorous study program that would give the children of diplomats an entree to schools around the world.
The two-year academically enriched program stresses enhanced time-management skills along with an academic program combining advanced study with creative and athletic pursuits.
Toronto schools offering IB programs are often sought out by people moving to the city for the first time who are looking to buy real estate, says Alex Pino, an agent with Sotheby's International Realty Canada.
"I think houses that are close to IB schools sell faster as there are many buyers coming from all over the world to the city looking for this education for their kids," Mr. Pino says.
"In Rosedale and Summerhill, we see houses close to Branksome Hall and The York School selling faster and sometimes with several families bidding on them as they want their kids to walk to the IB schools. We just sold a Rosedale house to a family from South Asia whose girls are going to the local IB School."
But it's the public schools with IB programs having the biggest impact on the local real estate market, experts say.
Such is the case of Monarch Park Collegiate, an east-end high school that for decades has had a bad rap for being in a sometimes rough-and-tumble working-class neighbourhood.
Real estate surrounding the school has rarely been a hot commodity. But that has changed since the implementation in September, 2008, of an IB world program that over the past two years is credited with turning the neighbourhood around, at least from a real estate point of view.
"Frequently, I get calls from people wanting to move into the area from another province or country who are looking for an IB school," says John Au, Monarch Park's IB program co-ordinator.
"It becomes a factor for them wanting to move into the neighbourhood. They want to be closer to our school."
Homeowners don't necessarily have to buy in areas with an IB school in order to attend. As a specialized program within the Toronto District School Board (which, unlike other districts, doesn't charge students wanting an IB diploma), the IB program is open to students outside a particular school's catchment area.
But, increasingly, families are drawn to a neighbourhood, wanting proximity to their child's education.
In Parkdale, an until recently downtrodden neighbourhood in Toronto's west end, the presence of an IB school is cited as one of the reasons the area is turning itself around.
Parkdale Collegiate, founded in 1888 and the city's second oldest high school, implemented its IB diploma in September, 2008, and since that time enrolment has spiked as a result of families actively seeking out the school, says Andrew Lin, the school's IB program co-ordinator.
"We had 600 students before, when we didn't have the program, and we now have 875. We average about 50 to 90 new students a year," Mr. Lin says.
"The IB program is one of the main reasons for that increase. People in the neighbourhood recognize the value of an IB world school, and they recognize its value to the community."

Full text: Even if Canada's housing sector is in for a sluggish stretch, there are ways to capitalize
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
As the U.S. housing sector crashed, a handful of investors made billions of dollars because they had the foresight to short the market.
They were able to cash in because most of the mortgages issued during the U.S. property boom were repackaged and resold to other investors. Owners of the investments were willing to lend them out to be sold short, because they didn't understand the extent of the crisis to come.
Good luck trying that in Canada, where lending has been more conservative and banks tend to hold onto their loans rather than selling them off. But that doesn't mean there aren't other ways to bet against the housing market.
Full warning: a full-scale correction is unlikely, according to most economists. But rising household debt and declining home affordability have caused some observers to conclude that the sector is vulnerable, at least to a period of stagnation.
"We have allowed armies of hormonal young couples without money to buy homes," said Garth Turner, a former MP who now sells books and gives scary speeches about a coming disaster he likes to call "Houseageddon."
"We had a state-sanctioned policy of inflating real estate through bizarre mortgage rates, the home renovation tax credit, first-time buyer's grant, RRSP home buyer's plan and the tax-free treatment of capital gains on a principal residence. Why would we not expect consequences?"
If you share his view - or even if you think that the market is entering an era of flat prices - here are strategies to consider:
Sell your house
If this is indeed the top of the market, the easiest strategy is simply to sell your house and let some other chump suffer the indignity of falling values.
But don't rush to dump your residence until you research the specifics of your local market - even if home prices weaken nationally, some cities may still be fine.
"You want to look at the fundamentals of the market," said Ross McCredie, president of Sotheby's International Realty Canada. "Are there more buyers than sellers?"
He considers the idea of selling "beyond stupid" because of the transaction costs and taxes involved, not to mention the costs of renting until you feel comfortable with the market again.
Not everyone agrees, of course. The Economist magazine recently concluded that Canadian home prices were 23.9 per cent overvalued, which suggests that delaying a home purchase or even selling might make sense in some cases.
If you don't want to jump out of the housing market entirely, you might want to consider moving to a smaller home with less expensive payments. This reduces your costs and reduces the pain if real estate prices flatten or dip over the years ahead.
"The next 10 years will be about buying a house to live in, not to live off of as an investment," said Phil Soper, chief executive officer of Brookfield Real Estate Services.
Short housing-related stocks
Another way to bet on falling home prices is to short stocks that would suffer in the event of a real estate decline.
Banks might seem to be candidates. There are about a trillion dollars of outstanding mortgages at Canadian financial institutions, with the Big Five chartered banks holding about $400-billion. If the housing market were to completely melt down, the banks would take a hit.
The problem with this strategy is that banks are very well capitalized and there are no historical precedents to suggest shorting a bank because of bad mortgages would be a good idea. The delinquency rate on mortgages across Canada is about 0.4 per cent - and has been decreasing for the last year. It was last "high" in the early 1990s, when it reached 0.6 per cent.
A better idea might be to look at furniture companies such as Brick Group Income Fund and Leon's Furniture Ltd. or a hardware retailer such as Rona Inc. All of them are closely tied to the housing market, although at the moment nobody is shorting their shares.
Invest in apartments REITs
Investment funds are snapping up apartment buildings as fast as they can, because they believe rents will move higher as unaffordable housing drives more people toward rental accommodation.
"An awful lot of the fortunes of families and smaller businesses in this country were founded on multi-unit residential buildings," said John O'Bryan, vice-chairman of CB Richard Ellis, adding that the challenge has been finding good buildings to buy.
The easiest option is to invest in publicly traded companies that specialize in multi-family residential properties, such as Boardwalk REIT, Killam Properties or TransGlobe Apartment REIT.
One thing not to do is to consider selling REITs short, even if they are heavily exposed to the housing sector. That's because borrowing the units to short puts you on the hook for the monthly payouts, which are relatively high.
"Bottom line, shorting high-yield securities is never a good idea since the distribution/dividend tends to put a tangible floor under the stock," said Dennis Mitchell, a vice-president with Sentry Investments.

Full text: Business leader, TV personality, philanthropist, family man - this lunch partner's plate is full
At noon on Sept. 17, I walked into Brett Wilson's Calgary office expecting a leisurely lunch with the financier, philanthropist and reality TV star. Fifty-three days and six hours later, that meal was finally consummated - at a gala dinner this week in Toronto.
In between, our conversation was derailed by phone calls from Mr. Wilson's girlfriend, quality time with his ailing retriever Maja, his meetings with business partners, and his trips to Britain and India.
Oh, and did I mention Dan Aykroyd? The actor and booze-marketer, an old friend of Mr. Wilson's, suddenly appeared in his office on that September day, scuttling my lunch interview and setting off an eight-week marathon of e-mails and apologies.
"This is a typical day of madness," the 53-year-old Mr. Wilson said apologetically, as I gulped down the fish stew prepared by the chef at his investment company, Prairie Merchant Corp.
Welcome to the hectic, friend-filled, celebrity-packed life of Brett Wilson, international man of non-mystery - the personable tycoon who plays "good cop" on Dragons' Den , the show where millionaire panelists mercilessly grill starry-eyed startups and dispense money or mockery.
All this self-inflicted mayhem has made Mr. Wilson's modishly unshaven visage one of the most recognizable faces in Canadian business. He has built household-name cachet on wealth (which he won't divulge) gained from his investments and his founding stake in Calgary financial boutique FirstEnergy Capital Corp.
Mr. Wilson sees his celebrity status as a transitory tool that, for the moment, draws attention to his causes, celebrates entrepreneurship, and brings interesting deals across the transom.
"Dragons' Den gives me a platform that I don't want to waste," he said. "If the brand works and people like it, we will keep on playing."
Indeed, the brand often veers toward super-saturation. As Mr. Wilson was evading lunch with me, he was keeping other dates - on covers of magazines, in an ad for clothier Harry Rosen, and in a contest offering "lunch with Brett Wilson."
On the business side, Mr. Wilson was busy too. Having left FirstEnergy two years ago, he is returning to the financial services sector in partnership with Bruce Chernoff, a Calgary investor who is as media-shy as Mr. Wilson is spotlight-grabbing. The two old friends are collaborating in Canoe Financial, which aims to be a significant player in the investment funds industry.
"It's not Wilson versus O'Leary," Mr. Wilson insisted, referring to tough-guy Dragon Kevin O'Leary, another publicity-craving financier who has emerged as investment-fund front man.
"This is Wilson versus the other 50 fund managers in the country, and Kevin is one of them."
At the moment, Canoe, where he recently became chairman, has about $1.5-billion under administration, and aims to grow to $5-billion to $10-billion over the next five years.
"We wouldn't define our program as a success unless we are in that range," Mr. Wilson says.
Canoe is hiring people, including veteran money manager Bob Haber, who spent 25 years at Fidelity Investments Canada and will run Canoe's EnerVest fund focused on Canadian equities.
Mr. Wilson says Mr. Chernoff lured him to Canoe not just for his pretty face, but for his track record in building financial services companies, and his reputation as an investor.
In his philanthropy, Mr. Wilson supports a number of core causes, including Outward Bound and Canada's troops. Hence, his attendance, along with 1,700 others, at the True Patriot Love dinner Wednesday in Toronto.
The fare was heavier than at Prairie Merchant - beef Wellington and well-cooked veggies - but it was all to raise money for families of military personnel.
Outside his few favoured causes, Mr. Wilson is rarely a long-term benefactor. "I refer to myself sometimes as being a serial philanthropist."
He spends time on a cause, raises awareness and cash, and then, as it gains suitable prominence, moves on to another worthy target.
But another of his continuing preoccupations is prostate cancer. He had an epiphany nine years ago when, in his early 40s, he was diagnosed with the disease. Being a cancer survivor forced an evaluation of his life.
He withdrew from FirstEnergy, and devoted more time to personal investments and philanthropy.
He has, for example, already booked a venue that holds 5,000 people for his 55th birthday, which will be a fundraiser for the prostate cause. He spends more time with friends, and his three children - he divorced from their mother in 1999.
The cancer was a rare setback in the charmed life of this car salesman's son from North Battleford, Sask., who studied engineering at University of Saskatchewan. In student government, he made friends with a commerce student from Regina named Murray Edwards.
In Mr. Wilson's life, good friends make good business. The two men reunited in Calgary, where they were cofounders of FirstEnergy.
Today, Mr. Edwards, as major shareholder in Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and other prominent companies, is the most influential Calgary tycoon, and Mr. Wilson one of the most public philanthropists.
As with many old friendships, there have been rocky moments, but the two men remain partners in some private energy ventures. At Christmas, there will be a combined party involving their companies.
As he stepped away from FirstEnergy, Mr. Wilson poured his efforts into Prairie Merchant, his personal investment arm specializing in real estate and energy. One small but highly strategic subset contains 31 Dragon's Den investments, representing a value of about $4-million.
As a philanthropist, Mr. Wilson is scornful of efforts by billionaires Bill Gates and Warren Buffett to get the world's mega-rich to give away half their money. His concern is what the billionaires will do with the other half. Anything left over from charity generally goes to children, thus reinforcing a sense of entitlement. "If you want to kill your children, give them all the half-billion or billion dollars that's left,' he says.
He is setting up his own children to embark on life, but not to inherit great wealth. "I'm rich - my children are not."
Next week, Mr. Wilson's moveable feast takes him back to Calgary, for lunch around the communal table with his Prairie Merchant team of about a dozen people. The chef comes in from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., the food is superb, and the table talk binds the team together, he says.
And who knows who will pop in? Mr. Aykroyd, who was in Calgary to show appreciation for local retailers who sell his wine, is typical of the circles Mr. Wilson moves in. They first met on a white-water rafting expedition organized by Robert Kennedy Jr. Mr. Wilson took along his son, who got a chance to mingle with the families of other guests, including tennis legend John McEnroe and Seinfeld 's Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
Indeed, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Aykroyd share a common quest - to push their personal brands into new markets.
Mr. Wilson admits he doesn't return e-mails as quickly as people would like, but that doesn't seem to matter any more. "My priorities now are my children, my health, and my friends."

Steeltown's architectural history comes alive

Abstract: "The only stipulation is it has to be recognizable as Hamilton," says H + H founder Graham Crawford, a 56-year-old retired management consultant who purchased the 1882 building after a quarter-century living and working in Toronto. He credits his gallery's success to the "partnership" model, whereby exhibit research is first gathered by specialists in the field or by local historians, to which Mr. Crawford applies his curatorial skills using six gallery video screens.

Full text: HIStory + HERitage gallery zeroes in on the beauty of Hamilton's mid-century homes and the stories behind their design
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
Blink and you'll miss it.
Nestled among the old fruit markets, laundromats and a few fancy art galleries, the 12-foot-wide black sliver of a building on Hamilton's James Street North near Cannon Street is indeed small, but in three short years this storefront multi-media gallery has already made a huge impact.
In fact, HIStory + HERitage has been an eye-opener: Although tiny, its mandate to tell the stories "of the men and women who have helped to shape the City of Hamilton" is a massive undertaking. In its first year alone, tales of The Women of Whitehern , Stanley Roscoe's amazing modernist Hamilton City Hall and the Royal Connaught Hotel have been shared, along with many others.
"The only stipulation is it has to be recognizable as Hamilton," says H + H founder Graham Crawford, a 56-year-old retired management consultant who purchased the 1882 building after a quarter-century living and working in Toronto. He credits his gallery's success to the "partnership" model, whereby exhibit research is first gathered by specialists in the field or by local historians, to which Mr. Crawford applies his curatorial skills using six gallery video screens.
Today, H + H celebrates the opening of SLEEK: Hamilton's Modernist Residential Architecture a fascinating exhibit researched by retired architect Anthony (Tony) Butler. "And I had a ball doing it," says the 79-year-old with a laugh.
It shows. On each screen is a loving tribute to a significant Hamilton-area modernist home using Mr. Butler's text, contemporary photographs by Mr. Crawford or noted local photographer Jeff Tessier, vintage photographs and original floor plans, all set to the languid sounds of Paul Desmond's saxophone.
And each home is a story unto itself. For instance, the modest 1952 Stoney Creek home of architect Jim Christie started off as a two-bedroom bungalow but grew as the family did over the years.
As a result, Mr. Christie's office moved from the basement to a bedroom until finally ending up as an addition to the front of the house, where it would serve the architect until his death in 2007.
"We learned all this from Peg, his wife, and their elder daughter," notes Mr. Butler.
Striking is Mr. Christie's use of glass mosaic tile for a decorative effect in the bathrooms and on stair pickets.
One screen over is "the mushroom house" (as it is known by locals) in Dundas, a 12-sided home atop a concrete cylinder designed in 1971 by Harry Lennard for his parents.
A slow 'pan-and-scan' style allows gallery-goers to dwell deliciously on interior photographs that reveal a kitchen contained within the cylinder, and a warm wooden ceiling that terminates with a light-loving circular skylight.
"Relax and enjoy, become engaged, and look at stuff," suggests Mr. Crawford.
After a similar tour of a 1970 home by Trevor Garwood-Jones, another screen invites viewers to the Mac Gerrie house, which the architect designed for his family in 1966; eagle-eyed viewers will spot the same light fixture in both period photographs and in 2010 photographs.
Mr. Gerrie's home is also notable for having what was considered to be, at the time, "the tallest residential door in Canada," says Mr. Crawford with a chuckle.
Next up is the home selected to be SLEEK's poster-boy, the steel-and-buff-brick beauty on Amelia St. that Toronto-based architect Jerome Markson designed for his aunt and uncle, the Goldblatts, in 1955.
Interestingly, the idea for SLEEK came a few years ago when Mr. Crawford was discussing architecture with a neighbour and mentioned that his favourite modernist home was the Goldblatt residence.
Ironically, Mr. Crawford's neighbour replied that the home now belonged to his mother, so a visit was arranged within a few days.
"It's as spectacular on the inside as it is on the outside," says Mr. Crawford, "so that sort of got me thinking ... and I asked Tony [Butler] to lunch."
Architect Stanley Roscoe's Ancaster home - an incredible 1955 composition of wood and glass under a shallow-pitch roof - completes the video portion.
Other significant homes, such as the 1955 John Douglas Kyles home in Greensville (featured in this column in March 2007) and Barton Myers's 1971 steel-clad townhouses for Dofasco are represented by photo essays hung on the wall.
Overall, SLEEK is a hugely entertaining exhibit backed by solid research by Mr. Butler - "It gave me an excellent excuse to get in touch with all the architects I'd known in my years of practising here," he says with a grin - disseminated in playful fashion by Mr. Crawford.
It comes, too, at a crucial point in history, as mid-century modern homes are under constant threat by money-hungry monster home developers: "Making people aware that these houses are important is more and more critical," finishes Mr. Crawford.
Mr. Crawford, then, is to be commended for his efforts. While some retirees choose to spend their time and money on travel or hobby farms, here is a proud Hamiltonian who has placed his passions at street-level, and then welcomed the rest of us inside this cozy, welcoming space for conversation and debate about municipal politics, architecture, history and the future of Hamilton itself.
And that's something that's impossible to miss.
SLEEK opens today and runs until Feb. 11, 2011. Gallery hours are Thursday - Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is free.

A local builder specializing in urban infill projects is transforming the site of a bleak industrial facility into a chic residential destination in North York.
Situated at 25 Hobson Ave., just west of Victoria Park Avenue, between Eglinton Avenue and O'Connor Drive, the old bottling plant has already been torn down to make way for 42 freehold townhouses and 10 semi-detached residences.
"It's few and far between ... that you'll find new townhouse projects like this," says Gary Goldman, who is the principal of Stafford Homes. "[People] don't want to buy an old home, and they want to live in the city."
The low-rise project, called Keystone Mews, will be nestled within a community well established with local shops and businesses to big-box stores and restaurants. Major supermarkets, retailers and banks can also be found in malls nearby on Eglinton Avenue.
Commuting around the city or downtown is quick via TTC bus routes operating on surrounding streets or the Don Valley Parkway to the east.
"There are schools, churches and mosques, and an ice rink on Bermondsey," adds Mr. Goldman. "It's got all the amenities there."
Many parks are in the immediate vicinity as well, though residents will have backyards, decks and patios to entertain outdoors. "Besides having 20-foot frontages, there are a lot of pie-shaped lots and corner lots, so you get a decent sized property," adds Mr. Goldman.
Indoors, these three and four-bedroom models will offer 1,635 to 2,260 square feet of living space spread out between three and four levels, including lower-level family rooms with rear walkouts and access into front garages.
Foyers will be located on a landing area between the lower level and main floor, which will generally house living and dining areas, great rooms and eat-in kitchens with islands or peninsulas.
"One of the most prominent features of the townhomes is that when you walk in the front door, you have a two-storey vestibule, so it could be up to 14 feet above you," adds Mr. Goldman. "You could see up to the second level that has open railings."
The 2,100-square-foot Victorian townhouse model also has a unique layout. The third master suite has a sitting area with a section that opens to the fourth floor above where the master sleeping quarters, walk-in closet, private bathroom and balcony are located.
"You have a two-storey master retreat, which is a fabulous design," says Mr. Goldman.
Interior finishes will consist of hardwood floors, broadloom carpeting and imported ceramic tile, as well as granite kitchen counters, stainless steel appliances and ceramic tile backsplashes.
Exteriors will feature a mix of brick, stucco and board and batten elements, as well as gables, coloured mortar, precast sills and keystones.
As a bonus, these homes will also be built with green features, such as high-velocity, forced-air heating systems, water-saving toilets and driveways with permeable surfaces.
First occupancies will begin November 2011.

Full text: As price and availability align, investors, both foreign and domestic, like what they see
They have cash aplenty; they are in it for the long term, and they have taken the GTA real estate market by storm.
Chinese buyers have become by far the dominant force in the new condo market in the GTA.
Estimates of their impact suggest overseas Chinese investors, the 100,000-strong local community and the 20,000 to 25,000 Chinese citizens who are students resident in the Toronto area now account for anywhere from 25 per cent to 40 per cent of all new condos purchased here.
In high-end suburbs in Markham and Richmond Hill, Chinese buyers are snapping up $1-million plus homes in both the new and resale markets. In some prime downtown Toronto projects they account for 65 per cent of the sales during the first few crucial launch weeks when prices are lowest. "Their impact is huge," says Stephen Wong, president and founder of Living Realty Inc. in Markham.
His company's 500 agents handle about 4,000 resales a year plus 2.500 new homes. "Our view is that today Chinese investors account for 40- to 45 per cent of all new condo sales," says Mr. Wong.
"The fact is, they love Toronto. They see a stable, steadily growing residential market in a country with a stable economy and political structure. As long as we can create projects in great locations at reasonable prices, they will keep buying in great numbers."
Their clout has even reached into luxury new and resale homes in areas where there is a concentration of Chinese residents, says T.C. Chan, president of Tradeworld Realty Inc. His company has 200 agents and a strong focus on Asian investors.
"Where I live in Richmond Hill and in parts of Markham, 60 per cent of luxury resales - homes selling for $1.3-million plus - are going to Chinese," he says. "We have homes where buyers use them just twice a year when they visit Canada, yet they maintain gardeners, cleaning staff year round.
"I have seen launch days at projects like Angus Glen when they release a new series of luxury homes and expect maybe three or four people to buy over the weekend but instead 20 Chinese families snap them up."
The importance of Chinese investors is shown in the fact that there are six major brokerages now specializing in the trade and about 10 Chinese publications in the GTA dedicated to the real estate market, says Mr. Wong.
There is even a professional organization: The Chinese Real Estate Professional Society of Ontario.
The extraordinary interest from Chinese buyers begs a number of questions. Where are they coming from? Why are they buying in Toronto? And is the surge of investor-owned condos a good thing?
Last question first: While many people who buy a condo for their own use might feel uncomfortable living in a building where a large number of suites are occupied by short-term renters, without investor-owned suites the GTA would have virtually no rental stock available.
Experts like Barry Lyon of N. Barry Lyon Consulting Ltd. point out that, because of rent controls, about 98 per cent of new rental suites have come from investor-owned condos. Just two years ago when prices for new suites reached the stage where they made little economic sense as a rental unit, investors fled the market.
The concern then was that the GTA would face a shortage of rental suites and rents for what was available would shoot up as vacancy rates dropped. This fall, however, builders managed to cut selling prices at newly launched projects simply by reducing the size of suites.
The cost per square foot remained the same, but the price per suite was down by about 10 per cent. Once again investors could plunk 20 per cent down and see enough in rent to cover mortgage and maintenance payments with a reasonable return.
"Smart Chinese investors can get 4 per cent a year return on a rental plus a significant return on built-up equity and the natural rise in real estate prices when they sell down the line," says Mr. Wong.
"They are mainly long-term investors. Some will flip at higher post-construction prices, but in the main they like to buy and hold."
Where are they coming from? Since 2000 there has been steadily growing interest from mainland China, but buyers are also based in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia - indeed any place where there is a prosperous overseas Chinese community, says Tony Ma, a broker with HomeLife Landmark Realty Inc. in Markham.
"Almost all of them have a relative or close friend in the GTA," adds Mr. Wong. "That relative or friend buys and tells them about the opportunity and they invest here as well or buy for their children attending school or in the hope that they will eventually move here themselves."
All three men say Chinese are not the only ethnic buyers driving the new condo market. East Asians, immigrants from the former Soviet Union and Koreans all have sizeable representation. Indeed local investors are in the minority.
Mainland Chinese investment has been spurred by Chinese government policy, they explain. Before the middle of this decade, there were no restrictions on Chinese investing in residential real estate in their home country.
"In the old days you would see people buying 10 suites in a new project in cities like Shanghai and Beijing," says Mr. Ma.
Today, however, rules say Chinese must put 30 per cent down on their first residential purchase and 50 per cent down if they want to buy a second and hope to get mortgage financing. After that, residential purchases are all cash transactions.
The size of new suites in China - on average, about 350 square feet - is a factor as well. Nor are there any longer restrictions on taking money out of China. The days of a $20,000 cap disappeared as China began its move towards a market economy. Fortunes were being made in China and overseas investment was seen as a smart economic move.
"Here they can buy suites double that size and up and as many as they like as long as they can meet bank financing requirements," says Mr. Chan. The only caveat is that most builders will not sell any one investor more than two suites in a single building.
Granted, Chinese investment enthusiasm does not extend to all projects and to all areas of the GTA. Their primary focus is new launches in areas served by the subway or in pockets with a high renter concentration.
That means downtown Toronto, the Yonge Street strip or along the stretch of Sheppard Avenue West served by the subway.
The three most important factors for them are location, price and design, says Mr. Chan. Design has to follow the principles of feng shui.
"They don't like odd corners; they like high ceilings and lots of light and are concerned about placement of doors," says Mr. Chan. "They often avoid resales because they want to make sure nobody died in the home," adds Mr. Ma.
Within that flood tide of investors are specific sub-groups. While for many price is the determining factors - the lower the better - which means a preference for one bedroom suite and one bedroom and den suites. There are also those whose focus is on two-bedroom units.
Again, however, the smaller the better because size determines price.
"We have a large number of clients who want family suites," says Mr. Wong. "That means small two-bedroom units and we are seeing junior two-bedrooms now at 700 square feet or so.
Square footage only comes into play when determining price. They want to be able to rent two-bedroom family suites and when you advertise them you say two-bedroom, not how big they are."
Finally is the surge likely to continue? All three experts say yes - if immigration to the GTA continues at the 100,000 a year mark and if builders can continue to supply affordable product in neighbourhoods of high rental demand.
"Chinese investors are leery of the stock market but they do understand real estate," says Mr. Wong.
"And as long as we can continue to provide product they will want to buy here either as investments or for their family use."

LISTING AGENT

The Action: Four public open-house events were held for this two-storey, brick house to give it maximum exposure to buyers, including three who ultimately drafted offers, says agent Theodore Babiak.
What They Got: This 1,418-square-feet residence in Roncesvalles Village contains three bedrooms upstairs, two full bathrooms and a formal foyer, living and dining rooms.
* The kitchen has hardwood floors like most areas of the house, stone backsplashes and access to a stairwell with an exit to a deck and one of two entrances to the basement.
* Also on the lower level is a recreation room with a wood-burning stove and wood-panelled walls and floors, as well as a five-piece bathroom with a whirlpool tub.
* The private backyard is landscaped with perennial gardens and a stone walkway to the parking pad.
The Agent's Take: "It's a turnkey home in one of Toronto's most pedestrian friendly neighbourhoods," says Mr. Babiak.
"The retail on Roncesvalles, which is a two-minute walk, is much more interesting than some areas where national franchises have taken over. And you can walk to local schools, a playground and dog park or go further to High Park itself, which is only eight minutes away."

Full text: The downtown Vancouver peninsula - which appeared headed for resort-town status, crowded only with residential condos - is poised for a commercial office building renaissance, as Telus Corp. prepares to unveil a new headquarters.
The $500-million-plus project expected to be announced this week joins a similarly large proposal two weeks ago from a group that includes Vancouver billionaire Jimmy Pattison. Three other real estate companies are close to building significant new office space as well.
It is a major reversal from the seemingly entrenched trend of the past several years, where the last notable office space was completed in 2007 and nothing had been started since then. In the intervening years there have been office building booms in Toronto and Calgary.
Now, with an office vacancy rate in Vancouver that is almost half the national figure - and rental rates near the highest in the country - downtown office building is about to come alive again. The signs of new buildings in the works will likely allay fears that a large city without many big corporate head offices was going to see its economic vibrancy wither.
Telus aims to make its new 22-storey headquarters at 520 West Georgia Street - coupled with a 43-storey residential tower on the same large downtown block - a civic icon.
"It's stunning," said one person closely involved in the project. "It doesn't look like any office building you've seen."
For Telus, the company is leveraging its real estate assets on a block of downtown Vancouver where it has a small head office, its central telecom network hub and other holdings. The company, which this year opened a $250-million building in Toronto, doesn't plan to use operating cash flow for the Vancouver project, according to second source, close to the company.
There had been a shadow over commercial real estate on the crowded downtown peninsula, where developers have been able to fetch far more money per square foot from condominiums as buyers paid big dollars for views of mountains and ocean.
The fear for politicians was too many residents in an area where eventually there wouldn't be enough jobs, a situation that could have seen downtown dwellers actually commuting to the suburbs to work.
But because Vancouver City Council two years ago made zoning changes to prevent condos from completely taking over, market dynamics have persuaded builders to pursue office towers.
"The [Telus] application shows a strong confidence in the direction this council has been taking for business," said city councillor Raymond Louie.
Avison Young, a commercial real estate brokerage firm, said recently "the race is on" to build new office towers in Vancouver.
Among the firms is Oxford Properties Group Inc., looking to build two buildings. Bentall Corp. awaits a development permit for a large tower. The Aquilini family, a local real estate player and owner of the Vancouver Canucks, want to build a 22-storey office tower across from their arena.
Despite the ambitious plans, doubts still course through the commercial property scene. "All bets are on hold until cranes start swinging," Avison Young said.
Behind the Telus project is a leading Vancouver development team, Westbank Holdings Ltd., led by the flamboyant Ian Gillespie, and the reclusive Ben Yeung of Peterson Investment Group Inc. The two have built several downtown Vancouver landmarks in recent years, including the tallest building in town, the 61-storey Shangri-La condo/hotel.
The architect on the Telus project is the celebrated Gregory Henriquez, noted most recently for his Westbank-backed Woodward's project, an internationally respected $375-million development on the city's recovering Downtown Eastside, where the group built an elaborate mixed-use facility - expensive condos and social housing, retail space and a university art school.
For Vancouver, the Telus plan is a significant endorsement. The city is home to only three of the top 30 public companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Goldcorp, No. 9, occupies space in an anonymous tower. Teck Resources, No. 14, has its nameplate on the ground floor of Bentall V, the last tower completed in 2007. Telus stands at No. 29 on the TSX.
"[The Telus project] is really a vote for the City of Vancouver," said Bernie Magnan, chief economist at the local board of trade.

Full text: A project to raise the profile of Midland Park, a Scarborough community lost on most people's radar
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
Just as some of the greatest television shows decided to call it quits when ratings were at their highest, I, too, feel confident leaving my neighbourhood, Midland Park, as 2010 draws to a close.
As regular readers will remember, during the lazy, hazy days of summer my wife and I decided to put our beloved 1961 back-split on the market as we searched for a downtown condo (yes, we found the condo, which I'll disclose soon, and no, as of this writing, our house has not sold). Just as we were doing that, however, we were also putting the final touches on a project that's been very close to my heart.
Let me explain. Back in the summer of 2009, our neighbourhood association chair, Mark Weiser, told me about a mural project that was in the works for a strip mall at the corner of Ellesmere Rd. and Midland Ave.
"Great," I said, "does it celebrate the history of Midland Park?"
"No," he replied, "it celebrates diversity. We're working with Mural Routes and Amnesty International."
It's a great cause and it inspired a great mural, but I was secretly crestfallen because I think murals work best when they speak directly about their location. And I especially like murals that celebrate things that can be overlooked, such as the founding of what might seem to be, at first glace, an ordinary housing development.
So, just about the time councillor Michael Thompson was officiating at the unveiling of Sail On and Fair Well (the title of the Amnesty mural), I was thinking of joining the Midland Park Community Association. It wasn't out of spite or about getting another mural done, but because I thought our neighbourhood could use a little help with branding.
While I'd only been a resident since 2005, I'd done a great deal of research on the area, and it burned me that Midland Park was usually lumped in with Bendale on real estate maps. It had its own story to tell: Curran Hall, the company that built it between 1959 and 1961, was owned by Paul Hellyer, Lester Pearson's future minister of national defence. It was Mr. Hellyer's policy to save old-growth trees, and homes that were tucked in between those trees were lovingly designed by architect Edward (Ted) Ross.
My first order of business as an MPCA member was to get T-shirts made. It's a simple, relatively cheap way to get people thinking of 'place' and, hopefully, to feel proud of that place. I borrowed the idea from Professor Rafael Gomez, who, for a while, ran a great little gallery/shop/think tank called 54 East in the Wexford Heights strip plaza. On offer at his shop were T-shirts designed by local artists featuring made up logos for Don Mills, Leaside and Wexford (among others) or sporting slogans such as "Honk If You Love Scarborough."
Our T-shirt - which Prof. Gomez and his associate, Jeremy Hopkin, helped me with - featured artwork by one of our residents, Howard Mann, a semi-retired graphic designer. The slogan was taken right from the original 1960 Midland Park brochure: "Midland Park. The Modern Place to Live."
By the winter of 2010, another resident, Lisa Duperreault, had taken on the difficult task of building a new website for our group (www.midlandparkcommunity.com). Once it was done, I came up with the idea of fridge magnets to promote the site, which we had manufactured by the same company that did our T-Shirts. These were delivered door-to-door.
Although our roster was pretty full planning events for spring and summer, I approached Mr. Weiser with the idea of a Midland Park-specific mural at another strip plaza. His enthusiasm for the idea, plus his ability to arrange a meeting with the strip plaza owner and the executive director of Mural Routes, Karin Eaton, got the ball rolling.
Mural Routes, founded by the Scarborough Arts Council in 1990, was the perfect mentor. They assisted me with the City of Toronto grant application, vetted my "Call to Artists" (which specified, among other things, that this mural was not to feature quaint 1920s-era shopkeepers with arm-garters or cows in fields, but rather the founding of a modernist postwar subdivision) and then allowed me to send the Call via email to their network of artists.
I won't bore you with details of judging panels and contracts except to say two things: I didn't allow myself to be a judge because I'd already had enough influence over the process - the panel consisted of five residents with experience in architecture, art or design - and, secondly, without the help of my wife, Shauntelle, and MPCA Co-chair David Barnes, the mural never would have been completed on time, since they both came to my aid at the eleventh hour.
Unveiled last week at the corner of Oakley Boulevard and Ellesmere Road is the fruit of our collective labour. The artist is the supremely talented Sarah Collard, a 42-year-old mural veteran (Google her wonderful work in Winnipeg).
So, as I take a bow and say farewell (with what I hope are high ratings), it's my sincere hope that this mural will inspire others to learn about and love Midland Park as I have.

Abstract: "The location is outstanding," says Mr. [Mark Reeve]. "You're literally a five-minute walk to some of the best restaurants in the city on College Street." Residents can also check out popular bars, cafes and music halls nearby, or take a short trip on a streetcar to the financial and entertainment districts.

Full text: Location: Trinity-Bellwoods
Developers: Urban Capital Property Group and Shram Homes
Size: 1,900 to 2,700 square feet
Price: $829,000 to $1,250,000
Sales centre: 250 Manning Ave., north of Dundas Street. Open Wednesday to Friday from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.; weekends from noon to 5 p.m.
Contact: Phone (416) 537-4994 or visit www.trinitytowns.com
The rarity of a new freehold townhouse project in Little Italy put together by a local high-rise development group and a low-rise custom home builder has led to nearly half of the units being purchased as soon as sales opened last weekend.
"The interest has been very strong because there really is not a lot of choice when it comes to new townhouse options in that location," says Mark Reeve, who is a principal of Urban Capital Property Group, which teamed up with Shram Homes for the joint venture.
"We don't imagine it'll take very long to sell out."
There are still 24 out of 45 townhouses left within the community, which is situated on former school grounds between Claremont Street and Manning Avenue, just northeast of Trinity-Bellwoods Park.
"The location is outstanding," says Mr. Reeve. "You're literally a five-minute walk to some of the best restaurants in the city on College Street." Residents can also check out popular bars, cafes and music halls nearby, or take a short trip on a streetcar to the financial and entertainment districts.
Given the urban setting of these three-storey residences, architect Richard Wengle conceived the facades with masonry materials, wood veneer paneling and metal accents, as well as flat roof systems and aluminum-clad wood windows.
"It's well-designed, modern architecture, but we also wanted it not to be cold or sterile," says Mr. Reeve. "We wanted it to be warm."
Buyers can select from four layouts, which have street-level entrances and lower-level recreation rooms with access to single or double garages exiting to an underground laneway.
Open concept principal rooms will be situated on the main levels, which have ten-foot ceilings, and three or four bedrooms will be spread throughout the upper floors, which have nine-foot ceilings. In one plan, the master suite will occupy the entire third floor with a sitting area, large sleeping quarters and a bathroom with a tub, twin showers, vanities and walls of his and her closets.

Full text: Project set in the emerging Riverside neighbourhood targets a young, urban buyer
Location: Riverside
Developers: Hyde Park Homes and Lamb Development Corp.
Size: 500 to 1,400 square feet
Price: $199,900 to low-$500,000s
Contact: To register, phone 416-214-2000, riversidetowns.com
On Saturday, Hyde Park Homes and Lamb Development Corp. will launch a stacked townhouse project that combines the space and feel of traditional houses in Riverside with the maintenance-free luxuries of a downtown condominium. These Victorian-style residences, known as the Riverside Towns, will range from 500 to 1,400 square feet and cost between $199,900 and the low-$500,000s.
"These are brand new modern, slick houses that will complete very nicely with some of the smaller houses in the area that people are spending $500,000 on," says Brad J. Lamb, founder of Lamb Development Corp.
"They've got the best heating systems, and you don't have to renovate and change the knob and tube."
Though the developers are aware of the high demand for these types of stylish, yet affordable properties, only 63 townhouses will be built within the infill site on Broadview Avenue, just north of Queen Street East.
"There's nothing at all in the downtown east end like this," says Mr. Lamb.
"For younger people to be able to buy a one- or two-[bedroom] or two-bedroom-plus-den unit in a townhouse project is a rare thing."
The development's proximity to hip bistros, cafes and galleries on Queen Street East, as well as parks and walking trails, is also expected to be a hit.
"The whole stretch of Riverside and Leslieville has completely changed, so there are dozens of new restaurants, stores and bars," Mr. Lamb explains. "It's a much more livable Queen Street East than it was three or four years ago."
Plus, residents will have access to streetcars virtually at their doorstep and the Don Valley Parkway just minutes to the west.
"You're in a residential enclave, yet a very short distance to the hubbub of downtown Toronto," adds Mr. Lamb.
The project will boast red brick exteriors with charcoal brick accents, stone elements and wrought iron railings.
Each model will have street-level access, including some off an interior courtyard, and one- or two-bedroom plans spread over one to three levels.
Most units will have patios, balconies or rooftop terraces measuring up to 500 square feet.
"The roof deck is not a whole lot smaller than a private backyard," says Mr. Lamb.
"[Plus] you have a city skyline view from a lot of these roof decks because the area is all single-family homes and there are no apartment buildings."
Standard finishes and features will consist of smooth nine-foot ceilings and engineered hardwood floors throughout, as well as European-style kitchen cabinetry, stainless steel appliances and stone counters.
"We're putting in very high style, contemporary interiors into Victorian-styled architecture," says Mr. Lamb, who notes this is similar to how locals renovate older properties in the area.
Monthly maintenance fees will be 26 cents per square foot.
Depending on the unit, parking will cost $19,000 or $24,900. "The biggest problem living in the east end - or anywhere in the city - is parking," says Mr. Lamb. "Here, we have underground, secured parking, and it's heated."
Occupancy is slated for the summer of 2013.

Bennett Jones flies flag in Dubai

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/bennett-jones-flies-flag-dubai/docview/762168904/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "I always worked on the premise that Canadian firms are as good as any. None of us has the former imperial reach, or the huge domestic market to lever into places ... so it's harder for us," he said. "But that doesn't mean we should concede the entire international legal world."

Full text:   Bennett Jones LLP is the first Canadian law firm to hang out its shingle among the gleaming, futuristic spires of Dubai.
The firm's new permanent office in the United Arab Emirates, announced Tuesday, is the first for a Canadian law firm, and a natural move for an outfit with western roots and strengths in the oil and gas sector.
The firm recently announced a new satellite branch in Beijing, but the Dubai office - in the works for two years - is a much larger undertaking, said Bennett Jones chairman and chief executive officer Hugh MacKinnon.
Bennett Jones says it will be the only Canadian law firm fully licensed to practice law in the UAE, with three lawyers moving to Dubai and plans to hire local talent.
Despite its debt crisis and real estate crash, the opulent Persian Gulf city remains the region's business hub, Mr. MacKinnon said, and is still booming. Recent tension between the UAE and the Canadian government - which has forced the closing of a key Canadian military base near Dubai - has had no real impact, he said.
The firm's plans include not only working for Canadian companies investing in the UAE and local investors looking to invest in Canada's energy sector, but also challenging the British and U.S. firms that do much of the international work in the region, Mr. MacKinnon said.
"I always worked on the premise that Canadian firms are as good as any. None of us has the former imperial reach, or the huge domestic market to lever into places ... so it's harder for us," he said. "But that doesn't mean we should concede the entire international legal world."
The managing partner in the new office is Dany Assaf, who has been working in the region for almost a decade and plans to divide his time between Toronto and Dubai. Mr. Assaf said that while other Canadian firms do work in the region, and Blake Cassels & Graydon LLP has a new office in Bahrain, no Canadian firm will be on the ground in Dubai the way he will be.
"No one has an office, no one has a real presence," Mr. Assaf said. "It has all been one-off stuff."

These corners are coming around

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/these-corners-are-coming-around/docview/761165100/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "I think people in Toronto are too conservative to come into this kind of neighbourhood," says Rochelle Jordan. Her gorgeous, high-ceilinged, art-book store Acadia has never been broken into in the 25 years she's been in charge. "It's more a problem of perception than reality."

Full text:   Birchmount and Glendower
What's changed: In 2007, the non-profit Art Starts asked residents what neighbourhood spot was most in need of beautifying. The answer? The basketball court hunkered between the Toronto Community Housing buildings. Over the past three summers, locals - from Tamil kids to Chinese grandparents - have come together to jazz up the concrete walls with art. Too bad the project lost its funding last year.
What hasn't: "We still need to work on the relationship between police and youth," said Edmond Crosbie, 41, who has lived here for 16 years. Part-time and summer employment is scarce. Transit service is intermittent to the point of insult.
What the police say: Drug charges in the L'Amoreaux neighbourhood dropped 44 per cent between 2004 and 2008, while sexual assault and B & Es went down 20 per cent or more. Robberies rose 40 per cent. No shooting charges have been laid in 2010.
What the locals say: "I helped build that!" says a teenage boy, walking through the basketball court on his way into the apartment building on Birchmount. Neighbourhood pride keeps the spot mostly free of dealers and users.
Jane and Finch
What's changed: In 2009, a move by city council to label the area "University Heights" drew derision from locals who wanted more than re-branding. More welcome was this summer's tiny new food market held at Shoreham P.S. on Thursday afternoons, where moms of all ethnicities wait three-deep to buy produce that's cheaper and better than at local groceries.
What hasn't: The main streets are pedestrian-unfriendly arterials lined with high rises in need of serious repair. People here are still younger, poorer, and newer to Canada than in the rest of the city.
What the police say: Robbery and stolen-vehicle charges dropped 50 per cent or more in the Black Creek neighbourhood between 2004 and 2008, but drug charges went up 47 per cent. On the police map tracking 2010 gun violence, Jane Street is a flutter of red dots from Lawrence up to Steeles, and one person in Jane-Finch died from a bullet so far this year.
What the locals say: "What's missing is child care," said Andrea Lue, a resident who works at the Jane/Finch Community and Family Centre. People can't go back to school or accept jobs, she says, without someplace safe to leave their kids.
Bloor and Lansdowne
What's changed : Crackheads and pimps: 0; young families: 1. A spot on the subway line made Bloordale worth gentrifying as downtown-ish real-estate prices shot through the stratosphere. The past few years have seen a steady influx of indie clothing stores, cute resto-bars and art galleries, such as the 30-year-old Mercer Union, which moved here in 2008.
What hasn't: The city has an open offer to match up to $12,500 of proprietors' funds in a façade improvement project, but there are still plenty of pawnshops with signs crusted in pigeon poop.
What the police say: Drug charges dropped 31 per cent between 2004 and 2008, while robberies have gone up 12 per cent. Sex workers are still here, though not as numerous - their long-time diner hangout, the Dale, has morphed into the brunch crowd's Bloordale Pantry.
What the locals say: "Five or six years ago, Bloor and Lansdowne was a rough area," says Spiro Koumoudouros, owner of the House of Lancaster strip club since 1982. "Now you see people walking around at 11 o'clock with no fear."
Queen and Sherbourne
What's changed: Here come the condos - the Brad Lamb-led Kormann House tower is going up to the southwest, facing The Modern to the east. Inside the ground floor of one of the stately Victorian buildings on Queen, a trio of appealing shops includes EcoStems organic florist, a vintage spot with excellent shoes and a high-end audio store.
What hasn't: This is still the south end of the Garden District, home to the city's highest concentration of homeless shelters and soup kitchens. Men line the sidewalk, the parkette outside Moss Park Arena, and the dive bars dotted along Queen.
What the police say: Sexual assaults went up 17 per cent between 2004 and 2008, but charges for drugs and robbery dropped. Theft over $5,000 plummeted 47 per cent.
What the locals say: "I think people in Toronto are too conservative to come into this kind of neighbourhood," says Rochelle Jordan. Her gorgeous, high-ceilinged, art-book store Acadia has never been broken into in the 25 years she's been in charge. "It's more a problem of perception than reality."

Queen Street East near
Broadview Avenue
Developer:
Streetcar Developments
Size:
577 to 945 square feet
Price:
$336,400 to $564,900
Sales centre:
625 Queen St. E., west of Broadview Avenue. Open Monday to Wednesday from noon to 6 p.m.; weekends from noon to 5 p.m.

At Streetcar Developments' latest urban infill project in the Riverside District, every suite and most common areas will be equipped with iPod docking stations, speakers and Wi-Fi access to keep residents constantly connected to various media.
The concept seems to have caught on with young, tech-savvy buyers as about 85 per cent of the 98 units have already sold in the mid-rise building.
"In terms of the finishes and amenities that [Streetcar] provides - like docking stations and having it wired for sound - it's very much what their specific demographic of purchaser is looking for," says Prish Jain, who is a principal architect with the design firm, Tact Design.
"Few other developers offer that sort of specific amenity in their units."
However, the development team also credits the strong sales numbers to the site's premium location at 630 Queen St. E. within steps of independent cafes, bakeries, restaurants and bars, as well as galleries and artisan shops in the nearby Distillery District.
Commuters also have 24-hour streetcars along Queen Street and easy access to the Don Valley Parkway.
"You're literally across the river from downtown Toronto," adds Mr. Jain. "That stretch of Queen Street from the Don all the way out to Riverdale is emerging as a nice place to live."
New parks, amenities and services are popping up throughout the community, especially with the waterfront redevelopment of the West Don Lands nearby.
Even this eight-storey residence will house street-level shops after its completed July 2012.
In another effort to blend in with the existing streetscape, Sync Lofts will have a brick façade with cutouts for recessed balconies on the lower floors and glass-enclosed balconies and terraces set further back on the upper floors.
"From the street, you don't see the actual balconies, you see the opens in the masonry," Mr. Jain says. "That was a more handsome approach to providing balconies for purchasers ... and responding to the heritage brick buildings all around in the neighborhood."
The interior design of the one and two-bedroom models will evoke the feel of local loft conversions with nine-foot ceilings, full height windows and open principal rooms, as well as sliding bedroom doors in many cases.
Other notable finishes will include hardwood floors, stone counters and high gloss kitchen cabinetry.
Green features will be standard, such as all-off light switches in the foyer, Energy Star kitchen and laundry appliances, and energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, as well as water saving fixtures and dual flush toilets.
In addition, a green roof, car sharing vehicles and bicycle parking will be on site.
Monthly fees will be 45 cents per square foot, plus hydro. For one year, residents will receive free Internet, high definition cable and phone services from Rogers.
Recreational facilities will include a dog wash station, rooftop gym and terrace.

Abstract: Rose Guarnieri and Anthony Menna were planning their wedding when they decided to invest the money in overhauling a grubby old diner at [Bloor] and Lansdowne instead. The couple wanted to provide the casual boite they've longed for the whole 10 years they've been there, Ms. Guarnieri says.

Full text:   West-end hood is attracting artists and entrepreneurs
cireland@globeandmail.com
For years the scruffy area around Bloor and Landsdowne has been an affordable outpost for artists and students, but these days young first-time homeowners are moving into the tree-lined sidestreets and fixing up the slender Victorian semis.
A similar refurbishment is taking place on the Bloor retail strip, where art galleries, vintage clothing shops and cafes are moving into the spaces vacated by hardware and used-appliance stores.
An improving status often calls for a new name and recently the area has become known as Bloordale, though some of the locals just call it Blandsdowne.
Thinking of joining the migration? Here's how Bloordale rates on some key measures:
It gets high marks for...
A sense of community Rose Guarnieri and Anthony Menna were planning their wedding when they decided to invest the money in overhauling a grubby old diner at Bloor and Lansdowne instead. The couple wanted to provide the casual boite they've longed for the whole 10 years they've been there, Ms. Guarnieri says.
Now she crafts cappuccinos and iced Americanos at the front of the Bloordale Cafe while Mr. Menna is the man in the kitchen. The slender space has become a hang-out for artists, curators and the Sunday brunch crowd.
The couple's fellow pioneers have opened the Ping Pong vintage shop, Holy Oak cafe and Toronto Free Gallery in the midst of the long-established Mercer Union artists' co-operative, Economy Fruit and Salvation Army Thrift Shop.
Transportation The Bloor subway line zips commuters straight to Yonge & Bloor. There are also streetcars on College and buses on Landsdowne. Wesley Rickert, proprietor of the Toronto Free, opened the interdisciplinary art space in a former hardware store partly because of its proximity to the subway. Now a broader public is discovering the events Mr. Rickert holds for rising artists.
Green lifestyle
Dufferin Grove Park provides 14 acres of green space, an organic farmer's market on Thursday afternoons and skating in winter. Cyclists have an easy cruise on bike lanes along College St.
There's room
for improvement in...
Neighbourhood security The area's back alleys and twisting laneways provide good cover for the nefarious activities of drug addicts and prostitutes, which is one reason why this area has been known for a high crime rate in the past. But the young families moving onto the side streets have little tolerance for finding syringes in their parking spots. Ms. Guarnieri at the Bloordale Pantry has had drunks, drug dealers and addicts hauled off her doorstep.
"When we first opened up I called the police twice a week at least," says Ms. Guarnieri, who held firm even after the ruffians hinted at throwing a brick through her window.
But she adds that all of that sketchy activity is being pushed out.
"There are definitely a lot more children playing in the streets," says Ms. Guarnieri. "You get landlords that actually care because they live in the neighbourhood."
SchoolsHomeowners aren't moving to the neighbourhood years before their kids reach kindergarten just so they can be positioned for the highest-ranked school. But there are plenty within a short walk, including Brock St. Public School, Bloor Collegiate Institute, Shirley St. Junior School, Pauline Johnson Junior Public School and Kent Senior Public School.
Nightlife The bar scene is, let's say, nascent. But it's not too far to stumble home from livelier scenes on College, Dundas and Ossington.
Harbingers of Change
Three Speed is another cool bar from the owners of the Communist's Daughter, who were way ahead of the curve when they opened at Dundas West and Ossington. This time they've taken over a former Vietnamese karaoke bar - the throngs have followed.
The Holy Oak Cafe is the place for artfully-crafted lattes. Holy Oak has also just started serving locavores their Tuesday night dinners with a prix fixe menu that offers organic, seasonal fare for vegetarians and carnivores.
New homeowners browse Ping Pong and HAUS for a panoply of finds, such as mid-century furniture and vintage glass. Vintage Depot has an amazing array of clothes, all organized by colour.
Market values:
First-time buyers can pick up a loft or condo around the $299,000 mark while a nicely-updated semi-detached on one of the side streets can be found for less than $600,000.
Detached houses are harder to find and can sell for more than $800,000.

Full text:   Former mill town has transformed into a weekend waterfront getaway for Vancouverites looking for affordable property
kgold@globeandmail.com
There's a new resort destination - it's 20 minutes from downtown Vancouver and for less than half a million dollars, you get a two-bedroom, 1,100-square-foot apartment with a waterfront view.
It's the Vancouver Island city of Nanaimo, which has turned from a worn out and empty mill town into the kind of cozy seaside city where restaurants are housed in heritage buildings and the ocean views are about as spectacular as it gets on the West Coast. In other words, it's close to becoming a resort town, where Vancouverites in search of affordable waterfront property can go for a weekend getaway.
Dwayne Yaretz, who lives in Yaletown, bought a 1,250-square-foot waterfront apartment at the Pacifica in Nanaimo back in 2005 for less than $500,000. He uses the two-bedroom property as a weekend getaway, accessible by a 20-minute seaplane flight, steps from his downtown office.
"That same property in Coal Harbour would easily cost $1,000 a square foot," says Mr. Yaretz, who works in corporate finance. "My investment would be $1.2- or $1.4-million for a similar view. Quite frankly, the waterfront view from Pacifica is just as nice."
When Pacifica developer Bill Wright realized that a big chunk of the demographic buying into his project was the 40-something getaway-for-the-weekend crowd, he kicked into action. In order to sell the remaining 30 or so units of the 18-storey, 143-apartment, 26-town home complex, he is offering free flights from Vancouver on Harbour Air, with one return a week, adding up to about 88 flights. Considering a round trip is about $150 from downtown Vancouver, it's the perfect incentive for urban buyers. Another incentive is the price - a two-bedroom unit that's more than 1,000 square feet starts at around $440,000. The penthouse is priced at $760,000. In Vancouver, prices for comparable properties would be in the seven digits.
Pacifica has single-handedly changed the Nanaimo waterfront. It sits on the site of a former eyesore, a half-complete concrete shell of an office building that had lost its financial footing and languished for more than a decade. For a couple of years, there was a plan for a hotel and conference centre. And then, in 2005, Cape Development stepped in.
"If you can imagine, for about 10 years they had this edifice on their doorstep, which is the gateway to Nanaimo and it looked like something in Beirut. It did not look nice," says Mr. Wright. "I remember looking at brochures of downtown Nanaimo and they had erased this structure out of all the pictures. I thought, 'I would, too.' "
In order to work with a half-complete structure, preserving the parking spaces and adding on 10 more floors, the developers undertook what is considered one of the largest building renovations ever in Canada. The result is a massive 212,000-square-foot condo and townhouse development - a monument to the golden era in real estate in which it was built five years ago. Back then, there was hot demand for a luxury tower.
"In terms of financial success, if maybe we didn't go as high as we did, it may have been better," says Mr. Wright. "We would have finished sooner. Because we added additional floors onto the structure, it took an enormous amount of time and cost."
Corry Hostetter, general manager for the Downtown Nanaimo Business Improvement Association, says that if downtown was to truly revitalize, that pivotal site had to be revitalized, too.
"It's played an extremely large part in the revitalization of Nanaimo," she says. "I've been in Nanaimo for 22 years, and for all that time it had been an empty building."
Downtown Nanaimo is a small but scenic heritage neighbourhood that was a quaint seaside community until big box retail came to town. Many of the businesses moved to the outlying malls at the north end of the city, where people did their shopping by car instead of on foot. With the major department stores and many of the mom and pop shops gone, and with little residential development in the core, it became a neglected ghost town. For several years, the City of Nanaimo has been offering incentives to revitalize the economy of the downtown core, and it's worked. There is the new Vancouver Island Conference Centre, restaurants in heritage buildings, a four-kilometre seawall, boutique stores moving in, and tourists and locals walking around the streets.
There is also a renewed energy and sense of pride. Before redevelopment of the Pacifica site, it was the old Malaspina Hotel. During demolition in 1996, a 1938 mural by B.C. artist E.J. Hughes - who lived near Nanaimo until he died - was salvaged from the hotel basement and later restored for the new conference centre.
"It's grown up," says Ms. Hostetter. "It was a mill town, a lot of forestry workers would live here because it's central to the island. That transition from a blue-collar town has happened in the last 20 years because of the way the economy has gone. Now, with the university here and a lot of technology and trades, it's definitely changed the landscape. There's more of a resort town feel."
Mr. Yaretz says it's not the same town he remembers visiting while on fishing trips as a child.
"There was one time when it was a one-horse, many-bar town, and I don't think that's any longer the case," he says. "I think it's gentrified quite a bit in the last 10 years."
Key to revitalizing the old downtown was the city offering business incentives such as exemptions from development cost charges on new downtown developments.
That one incentive probably saved the Pacifica developers about $1-million, says Jeremy Holm, manager of current planning for the City of Nanaimo.
"The community was definitely keen on seeing that site redeveloped," says Mr. Holm.
Like most developers, Cape Development was on the upswing until the economic downturn of 2008. Because the renovation had been so complex, their completion date was poorly timed with the downturn. By the time they completed with more than half of the units pre-sold, it was a matter of focusing on those deals already made, to ensure that the majority of them closed. A few opted out.
"Because you've taken some time to complete the renovation, people get cold feet," says Mr. Wright.
"When I say renovation, we're talking about working with a concrete structure that we had to selectively demolish in parts and rebuild in parts. What we thought was going to be fairly simple and straightforward turned into a very good challenge.
"But by doing the renovation, it provided the complexities that made it very attractive," he adds. "We have balconies - some of them over 2,000 square feet - that wouldn't have happened if you were to start with an empty hole in the ground. You couldn't afford to do that."
Prior to Pacifica, there were only two residential towers in the downtown area, neither of them recently built. Mr. Holm says there is potential for more waterfront development, such as large industrial areas that are adjacent to the downtown core.
He's seen an influx of seasonal property owners from the U.S., Alberta, Ontario and the Lower Mainland, snapping up property on nearby islands such as Protection Island as well.
"We are definitely to some extent a destination for retirement buyers, or seasonal accommodation for out-of-country or out-of-province residents," says Mr. Holm.
"We are definitely on the yachting and cruising circuit, so people do find out about us that way, too."
Of course, the market has slowed lately, but investors like Mr. Yaretz are banking on Nanaimo eventually becoming a strong player in the market.
"That's why I bought it, to use it, but also as an investment," says Mr. Yaretz. "I thought Nanaimo would catch on, and I think it has - maybe not as quickly, with recent economic problems the last two or three years. Maybe it hasn't seen the growth that I would have hoped. But nevertheless, there's always someone saying 'so and so goes over several times a week.' One person was telling me that they know a woman in corporate finance here who flies [to Nanaimo] every day, five days a week.
"If I sold it today I would make a small profit, even with the times as they are. There is a bit of an upside there, but not enough for me to sell and forego what I want to use it for."

Abstract: "It's going to be really hard to do anything like Afghanistan again in the future, because all these countries are stretched, and burned by it," Prof. [Stephen Saideman] argues. "Politicians paid a lot of cost for it domestically, and we still don't know where it's all going."

Full text: Not your father's war: Selling conflict to a skeptical public
It seemed straightforward in the days after terrorists smashed jetliners into the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon.
Leaders of NATO countries knew they had to stand by their traumatized ally. For a time, their voting publics understood this too.
But nine years since the invasion of Afghanistan, Americans wonder why more of their blood and treasure should be spent on what seems like a failing venture. As a result, President Barack Obama has scaled back U.S. ambitions for success in Afghanistan and put the world on notice that there is a time limit to the U.S. commitment.
Waning support from Canadians helped prompt the Harper government to agree to a 2011 end to our combat presence.
Britons, skeptical about the shape-shifting rationales for invading Iraq and Afghanistan, have stopped buying the argument that Britain's overseas entanglements are reducing, rather than fuelling, extremism at home.
The Netherlands, which saw a government fall over the mission earlier this year, kept a promise to withdraw all 1,950 Dutch troops in August.
Welcome to the dilemma facing leaders in the 21st century. The conflicts of the future will likely be smaller-scale versions of the messy affairs of the past decade: long, complicated, with goals that are hard to define and harder to achieve.
At some point, Western governments will be urged to act, whether to try to untangle the tribal complexities in Afghanistan, getting between rival factions in Congo or prodding authorities in Yemen, Somalia or the Philippines to root out Muslim radicals plotting attacks on U.S. soil.
The question for leaders after Iraq and Afghanistan is this: Can you sell a war that no one wants? And if you can't, how does that affect global security?
"The bar is probably higher now," says Eugene Lang, a former adviser to two Liberal defence ministers and co-author, with Janice Gross Stein, of The Unexpected War: Canada in Kandahar .
"After 9/11, the bar was pretty low, because you'd had a really game-changing event, people believed the world had changed fundamentally overnight, and on top of that you had relatively strong economies."
All of the advanced economies face years of high unemployment, tepid real-estate markets and belt-tightening measures that aren't conducive to expensive military adventures, where casualties and strategic missteps are visible to voters.
But those dynamics may be most acute in the U.S., exacerbated by feelings that America's traditional allies are cutting defence budgets to the point of uselessness, and that emerging powers should step up and do more.
"Americans will say, 'Why should it be us?' if it is truly a post-American world, or a post-Western world," says Christopher Coker, a professor of strategic studies and international relations at the London School of Economics.
"They will be looking at the cheaper options more and more, as the politically sustainable ones, and the economically sustainable ones."
That means responses could be "much more minimalist" for the foreseeable future, Prof. Coker said: unmanned drones for things such as targeted assassinations; quick special forces operations on the ground as needed, and no drawn-out attempts at "nation-building under fire" by large numbers of conventional troops.
More than 40 countries, including Canada, are investing in drone technology. The United States alone has quadrupled drone strikes in the tribal areas of Pakistan since Mr. Obama was elected, and the military plans to double production of them next year.
"They can endure strategically, and so can the country, because the country isn't asked to make any sacrifices," Prof. Coker said.
The irony, however, is that by heeding the lack of public appetite for a heavy ground presence - which many experts still insist offers the best hope of keeping local populations onside - politicians might end up making things worse.
Drone strikes in the tribal areas of Pakistan, for example, appear to have done little in the battle for hearts and minds. It's unclear how many civilians the drones are killing, or whether new recruits are being driven into the arms of the Taliban as a result of the thunderous Hellfire missiles crashing around them.
But what is clear is that the relentless drone campaign is creating an atmosphere of fear and paranoia among citizens.
A recent poll by the New America Foundation, a Washington think tank, of residents in the tribal areas of western Pakistan found 38 per cent feel the United States is the biggest threat to their personal safety, compared with 16 per cent who said it was the Taliban. The study also found 76 per cent oppose the drone attacks, and 77 per cent believe the U.S.-led war on terror's real purpose is to weaken and divide the Muslim world to ensure American domination.
Is it possible that a decade of favouring quick fixes such as drones to appease a generation of war-weary Western voters could burden the next generation with costlier conflicts to undo the damage?
"Minimal strategies are affordable," Prof. Coker says. "Whether they're effective or not is a completely different matter, but they're the ones that will be most attractive, at least in the short to medium term."
Stephen Saideman, a political science professor at McGill University who specializes in international security, questions whether drones are necessarily the way of the future.
"Drones have utility, but they can only work if we have people on the ground gathering intelligence."
After all, if the real ticket out of Afghanistan and other failed states is to train local armies so they can fight insurgencies themselves, that requires years of side-by-side nurturing and teaching. That means boots on the ground - not just drones in the air.
"The standard language is they can fight their wars better than we can," Prof. Saideman says. "But they can't get there until we train them. That involves infantry, special forces, guys on the ground with guns."
But short-term pain for long-term gain no longer seems an acceptable argument, for voters or for the governments they elect - and turf out.
"It's going to be really hard to do anything like Afghanistan again in the future, because all these countries are stretched, and burned by it," Prof. Saideman argues. "Politicians paid a lot of cost for it domestically, and we still don't know where it's all going."
Nevertheless, he predicts voters could still be galvanized to support interventions in the case of "a humanitarian crisis that is so clearly one-sided that the publics of NATO countries become so motivated to say, 'Afghanistan was hard, but we're going to do this because what we see here in country X is so awful.' "
Indeed, though polls show Canadian politicians could face voters' wrath if they authorized another overseas mission in the next while, some observers say our self-image as an outward-looking, benevolent force for good in the world will ultimately prevail.
With so many foreign-born Canadians, internationalism is increasingly becoming "part of our DNA," or our "new nationalism," says Norman Hillmer, a Carleton University professor and leading authority on Canadian military and political history.
Plus, starting in the late 1990s and through the Afghanistan mission, he notes, Canadians have become more at ease with and "more respectful" of our military past, and less attached to the idea that we should be peacekeepers.
None of that means selling future wars to Canadians will be easy, with today's battles fought in a 24-hour, real-time media environment where "every death and every setback gets sensationalized," Prof. Hillmer says.

Globe Catalysts
How will governments sell war after Afghanistan?
Ted Goulden
To borrow a phrase from the markets - "This time is different." Within a generation or two, the stigma from the Afghanistan experience will be a fading memory and some leader will come up with a new justification - and more importantly, an entirely new strategy - and sell it to the public on the basis that it has never been tried before. We can see from the American experience in Vietnam and Iraq how this might work.
Rob Katzer
The key will be for the government to level with us. Canadians have in the past accepted big sacrifices and will accept them in the future - if they are asked and the case is strong for our involvement.

Abstract: "We're still building houses we sold in the spring," said Mr. [Victor Fiume], the home builders' president. "But at some point we're going to finish that work, and the unemployment rate is going to take a hit because we'll be laying off workers.

Full text: High household debt + high home prices + high unemployment + slow income growth = housing bust
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Wake up, Canada: The house party is over.
A wide range of indicators say Canada can no longer count on a booming housing market to keep the economic blues at bay. But in the quarters where it most needs to be heard, the message is not resonating.
Many policy makers have yet to adjust their view of a market that just last spring was helping the economy rebound from the recession. Sales of existing homes were setting records month after month; a generous tax credit had encouraged the masses to take on renovation projects; new home starts were hitting all-time highs.
Victor Fiume, president of the Canadian Home Builders' Association, remembers speaking at a meeting of municipal leaders at the height of the boom. "They were bouncing down the stairs with excitement about what it meant to their tax base."
Many of them are still holding on to those hopes, even as the market slows.
"Now they're looking at me like I have two heads," Mr. Fiume, who is also general manager of Durham Custom Homes in Oshawa, Ont., says of the local politicians. "They find it very difficult to believe we can come to such an abrupt halt."
The trouble is not that Canada is on the brink of a gruesome real estate bust like the U.S. - because it isn't. It has been shielded by more cautious lending practices, and avoided such bad practices as zero-down-payment or no-documentation mortgages. With few exceptions, Canadians have equity in their homes.
Mortgage defaults are minimal. Housing speculation never reached the absurd levels that it did in such Sun Belt states as Nevada and Arizona, and the federal government has taken steps to ensure that it never does, in part by requiring much higher down payments for investment properties. There is a lot that is good about the structure of the Canadian property market.
But a period of stagnation or slowly falling prices, coupled with weak home sales and waning construction activity, would cut off one of the engines that drove impressive economic growth and job creation in the years before the 2008 financial crisis.
This week, when the Bank of Canada released its latest report on the domestic economy, it specifically mentioned the prospect of "a more pronounced correction in the Canadian housing market" as one of three key risks.
The primary reason for that, of course, is the mountain of debt carried by many Canadian households, which has worried the central bank governor for many months. Toronto-Dominion Bank said this week that Canadians will soon owe more than $1.50 for every dollar of disposable income, an unprecedented level. And home prices are already stretched far beyond their historical norms, particularly in the largest urban markets such as Vancouver.
It all adds up to a simple, unpleasant equation: High debts, plus high home prices, plus high unemployment, plus slow growth in incomes, equals a housing market that's much different than the one Canadians are used to. Is it any wonder that, after 10 years of explosive growth, the housing market appears out of gas? Sales fell by as much as 45 per cent in the country's largest cities over the summer and haven't recovered through the traditionally brisk fall market.
That means the summer effectively wiped out a year's worth of gains, with the average resale price back at year-ago levels. New construction fared little better, with the seasonally adjusted rate of starts falling to 186,000 in September from April's peak of 201,900.
That has dramatic implications for employment and consumer spending levels - and for an economy that has grown accustomed to relying on housing-related spending for about 20 per cent of its gross domestic product.
"Canada doesn't need a U.S.-style problem to have a problem," said Alexandre Pestov, a market analyst at Three Bears Research in Toronto. "A Canadian-style issue will do just fine."
The threat to come
As economists debate what comes next in the real estate sector, they're surveying unfamiliar terrain: The country has never been in quite this situation before. Any one of the series of obstacles facing the housing market has the potential to wipe out billions of dollars of household wealth and stall the economy.
Interest rates are at record lows, but will inevitably move higher and price some people out of their homes. Prices have soared far beyond the rate of inflation for most of the past three years. Over the past decade, average prices have increased 121 per cent to $331,089.
The OECD called Canada's housing market "overpriced" in a recent report, adding that 7.5 per cent of Canadian households could find themselves in trouble by the middle of 2012 if interest rates rise, as they're expected to do.
Prices have finally reached the point where they've scared some buyers out of the market. The Canadian Real Estate Association has reported that September sales numbers gained an anemic 3 per cent, after declining as much as 45 per cent in some cities (such as Vancouver) through the summer.
Home prices, which shot upward in the spring, have reverted back to levels last seen a year ago, effectively erasing a year of gains. Higher interest rates in the next year are expected to further quell the market.
Market forecasters are near-unanimous in the belief that prices will fall in the coming years, though few foresee the sort of rapid declines that savaged the American market. The stateside disaster was largely fuelled by loans made to people who weren't creditworthy. Canada's problem is different - easy credit is luring people into buying houses they may not be able to afford when rates rise to more historically normal levels. That's why economists and market watchers foresee a drawn-out retraction of the market that will gradually erode prices, rather than a crash.
The effects of a slow burn can still be devastating, however. Among those most affected are property developers, real estate agents, investors who hope to flip houses, municipalities that rely on revenue from building permits and housing construction, and baby boomers planning to cash out their homes to finance their retirement.
Housing-related spending - including the rental market and the sale of existing homes - accounts for about 20 per cent of gross domestic product in Canada, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. stated in its annual report released in late September. (Statistics Canada only counts residential construction's impact on the economy in its GDP estimate, which it places at a 7 per cent share.)
It's the highest level CMHC has recorded in a decade, and translated into $307-billion in economic output in 2009. And that means the impact of a slip in prices is greater than it would have been a decade ago when it accounted for $184-billion in spending.
If home resale prices were to fall just 5 per cent, $10-billion would be sucked from the economy, said Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist at CIBC World Markets. Consumers, worried about their falling net worth, would stop spending on things such as restaurants and shopping trips.
"The housing market of the last 10 years has been very important in terms of the wealth effect. And I can tell you, the next decade will be much weaker. Does this have consequences for the broader economy? Of course it does."
And that's merely the effect of a decline in the value of existing homes. Any housing slowdown usually comes with a major impact on new home construction - and it played a pivotal role in the rapid healing of Canada's labour market after the recession.
About 35 per cent of all jobs created through the recovery can be traced back to construction, according to the Canadian Home Builders' Association, with home builders accounting for the majority of the activity. But much of the work taking place today harkens back to sales made last year, when new sales records were set.
"We're still building houses we sold in the spring," said Mr. Fiume, the home builders' president. "But at some point we're going to finish that work, and the unemployment rate is going to take a hit because we'll be laying off workers. Then, more than ever, people will understand why it's important to have a strong housing market."
A staid housing market
The slide may have already begun, although a lack of interest on the part of buyers has so far been mitigated by a lack of new inventory hitting the market.
The number of months of inventory in Canada, on a seasonally adjusted level, stood at 6.6 months at the end of September. That's how long it would take to sell all the listed houses at the current pace of sales.
And while supply and demand are keeping prices firm, few expect that to last over the next two years. CIBC World Markets has suggested prices could fall as much as 10 per cent in the next two years, as has TD Bank. CREA suggested at the end of July that prices could slip 1.2 per cent by the end of the year, and fall 0.9 per cent next year.
CMHC is the lone dissenter among the market watchers, saying only that average resale prices are "expected to edge lower through the end of 2010 and then rise modestly in 2011." It's not exactly a ringing endorsement.
"The next decade will be weak," Mr. Tal concedes. "In the next year we should see negative growth, with places like Vancouver maybe even seeing a 20 per cent decline. Maybe we will see prices moving with inflation across the country after that, but no more. I do not think it will be a crash that will send people jumping out of windows, but the housing market of the future will be a very boring place."
RESEARCH FINDINGS
Researcher Alexandre Petrov has been looking for evidence of a real estate bubble in Canada. He wrote a report for Three Bears Research last month, comparing statistics from 1985 to 1989 to statistics from 2000 to 2010 in search of patterns. Here are some of his findings:

REAL ESTATE BUBBLES
When it comes to Canadian real estate bubbles, there have been two loud pops.
Toronto 1989
While this ugly period for Toronto housing is often referred to as a crash, it actually took five years for prices to finish their swoon. The market was pumped up through the 1980s by record-low unemployment rates and relatively low interest rates. But as the decade neared its end, rates began creeping higher until they peaked at just over 14 per cent in 1989. This set the market back, and in five years prices fell 27 per cent as unemployment climbed about 11 per cent.
Vancouver 1994
The Vancouver crash took just three years to play out, with prices falling 16 per cent. Price gains had been fuelled by immigration, which cooled through the mid-1990s and affected demand for housing. Relatively lower interest rates through the early part of the decade also helped fuel demand, which took years to recover.

Full text: Location: Orillia
Builder: Mutual Development Corp.
Size: 900 to 2,300 square feet
Price: Mid-$200,000s to over $1-million
Sales centre: 80 Orchard Point Rd. Open Saturday to Thursday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Contact: 1-888-713-7134, orchardpoint.ca
On a narrow waterway connecting Lake Simcoe and Lake Couchiching in Orillia, Mutual Development Corp. is building an upscale condominium community with many of the benefits of owning a waterfront cottage - but none of the maintenance.
Over 70 per cent of the suites in the first phase have sold, prompting the release this month of the second and final phase of the Muskoka-inspired development.
"Orchard Point is a very unique project. It has 1,500 feet of waterfront on 3.5 acres and is secluded from the city and roadways," says president Mike Bowering. "People are buying the suites primarily for the amazing views of Lake Simcoe and the luxury status of the buildings and finishes."
There are 90 suites in the new eight-storey building that will stand two storeys taller than its sister residence under construction on Orchard Point Road off the Narrows, where aboriginal people converged before the Orchard Point Inn was built there in 1880.
A hospital, another resort and a marina also occupied the site in subsequent years.
The site is bound by water on three sides, allowing the project to have a private beach, pier and boat docks, plus landscaped gardens, paths and access to local trail systems.
Both buildings will also have underground access to a club that includes a gym, a party room with a kitchen, dining and lounge areas and a terrace.
Additional recreational facilities, museums and an opera house are in town, as well as a hospital, malls and golf courses. The site is also a short drive from Casino Rama and within sailing distance to Georgian Bay along the Trent-Severn Waterway.
"For people living in Orillia, they can move from their home to a project like this and not have to compromise too much on space or the types of things they're used to," says Rod Rowbotham, president of the architectural and interior design firm, onespace unlimited.
"If you're moving from the city of Toronto, you're getting the lifestyle of a luxury resort and cottage without having to invest in a cottage or do winter maintenance."
Nearly every unit will face south towards Lake Simcoe and have a balcony. Some units on the upper floors will have multiple terraces measuring 20 by 20 feet.
"Cottage life is all about living outdoors, so we wanted to give the opportunity to have people live outdoors as much as they live indoors," says Mr. Rowbotham. "Large terraces was exactly the way to solve that."
About 16 units remain in Phase 1. A full range of one- and two-bedroom units, ranging from 900 to 2,300 square feet, will be available in Phase 2.
Various plans will have enclosed dens, open principal rooms and kitchens with islands and peninsulas, as well as master suites with walk-in closets and private bathrooms. Finishes will include granite kitchen counters, laminate floors and five white appliances. Penthouses will have hardwood floors, 50-ounce carpeting and stainless steel appliances.
Monthly fees will be 39 cents per square foot.
Each unit will include parking in a heated garage. Boat slips will be leased annually.
Phase 1 will be completed next spring and Phase 2 will be ready by summer, 2012.

Full text: Shellianne Bedder has sold more than $100-million worth of luxury Toronto condos to high-end buyers. On the day she spoke to Deirdre Kelly, she was working on a $7-million deal at the Regency Yorkville
What's it like selling high-end
Toronto real estate in a down
market?
There is no down market for high-end buyers. People may speak of a slowdown in a luxury market, but they misunderstand that luxury product does not move anywhere near the same speed as modestly priced product. This is because the luxury buyer has multiple homes, and thus has no sense of urgency. Their motivation for purchase is a lot different because they are not buying for shelter or investment. They purchase when they find what it is that they are looking for.
So how do you find that for them?
The salesperson has to be able to thoroughly understand the lifestyle of the purchaser and demonstrate to them how their lifestyle requirements can be met.
Since the luxury buyer is purchasing a large - huge by city standards - suite, they want to indulge their tastes. So it is better to sell a suite "raw" so that the buyer, with the assistance of their designer, has an open palate and can virtually customize the suite to meet their unique requirements. A high-end buyer does not want the builder to predict their tastes and requirements. They insist on having their own personal signature on this home. When they see something that is already in existence, then it is someone else's signature, not theirs. They like to call the shots. They like to be in control.
Who are your buyers?
It's a mixed clientele. Right now I'm selling to mostly local buyers who are a combination of old money and new. They range in age from their late 30s to their late 50s. Some are young professionals who have become incredibly successful and for whom a large luxury residence is important. I also have couples with substantial amounts of money working in more than one country at a time in the financial sector or in the dot-com industry.
Do they pay cash?
Yes.
Do they haggle?
They never haggle over the price. Once they find what they want, it's far more important to them to get exactly what they want in terms of the finished product, everything from specific types of hardwood and top of the line appliances right down to the designer toilet.
Do they bring their designers with them?
In most cases, yes. And when a designer is involved, he or she is extremely influential in shaping the purchaser's buying decision. The designer is actually far more important than an agent or broker in getting the purchaser to buy.
Can you describe the psychology of the luxury buyer?
These buyers are extremely sophisticated. They've researched everything. They know what they want and it's not what someone else has. They are extremely discreet. They prefer to remain as anonymous as possible. They're only rude after they've bought; beforehand they're very, very nice. They're also very precise and although they've made multiple purchases and to the average person a $7-million chunk of real estate is hard to even fathom, the luxury buyer likely already has several homes in that price range.
That being said, they take what they are buying very seriously. Most will put a lot of time and effort into the ongoing construction of the suite. Surprisingly, the actual sale can happen fairly quickly, but the time taken to decide on the selection of finishes can go on forever with no rush to expedite the process.

Pushing for yield a dangerous game

Full text: Investors looking for fat returns are driving up prices of high-yielding stocks and bonds, emerging market stocks and even small-cap stocks. Some economists fear an emerging market bubble
Hard to believe it was just two years ago that risky U.S. bonds were yielding 20 per cent or more and blue-chip Canadian bank stocks 6 per cent to 8 per cent. No one wanted them.
Now that yields have fallen by half or more, investors seem willing to buy almost anything. Yet the risks today are every bit as great as they were in late 2008 and early 2009, market watchers say.
Ask Paul Moroz about the current yield environment and he'll point to the $1-billion (U.S.) Mexico was able to borrow last month at 6 per cent for 100 years.
Bond buyers "are going to Mexico thinking they're getting ahead by buying a 100-year bond at 6 per cent!" he marvels. Mr. Moroz is manager, global equities, at Mawer Investment Management Ltd. of Calgary.
The Mexican issue makes Government of Canada 10-year bonds yielding nearly 2.75 per cent look generous by comparison.
All the world over, investors are reaching for yield, pushing up prices of high-yielding stocks and bonds, emerging market stocks and even small-cap stocks as people look for fat returns. Some economists fear an emerging market bubble.
"People will always do it, but it's a dangerous game," Mr. Moroz said in an interview. "There's no silver bullet."
People are taking more risks because they have to save for retirement, he says. He predicts the market will respond with new and enticing investment products promising an alluring combination of high yield and low risk. "People are trying to turn water into wine."
This is what happened in the heady days before the financial panic in 2008 when even the most sophisticated investors were buying fancy new products - usually some form of securitized debt obligation combined with derivatives such as options or futures - that they didn't fully understand.
These securities "had the illusion of yield and lower risk, but they really had a lot of risk attached," Mr. Moroz says.
Rather than rush headlong into emerging markets, snapping up sovereign debt of Colombia (yielding 9 per cent), Spain (4 per cent) and Italy (3.75 per cent), investors can get exposure to Latin America and other world markets simply by buying Bank of Nova Scotia shares yielding 3.6 per cent, he says. Scotiabank common shares offer plenty of upside potential.
"BNS is a good runway for investment in emerging markets," he says. "It's offering a very attractive yield relative to fixed income."
"The key message is balance," says Michael Crofts, lead portfolio manager, bond and money markets, at Mawer. "If you put together a balanced portfolio of strong companies with good balance sheets run by competent people, regardless of how the economy plays out, the portfolio is going to be resilient."
At KCM Wealth Management in Vancouver, Adrian Mastracci, president, is advising conservative clients to put preservation of capital first, investing in a ladder of one- to three-year guaranteed investment certificates yielding 1.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Those with a greater appetite for risk may want to consider corporate bonds or even real estate investment trusts, he adds.
He thinks interest rates will be rising in three or four years' time. "I don't want to hang my hat on any one investment," he says.
Harry Levant is also finding yield close to home, at the local burger joint. Mr. Levant is founder of IncomeTrustResearch.com, and his top pick for yield is A & W Revenue Royalties Income Fund, which yields 6.7 per cent, he said in an interview. He also likes Firm Capital Mortgage Investment Trust, which yields 7.9 per cent.
A & W has a strong brand focus, it is opening more outlets and the fund has had 29 consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth, Mr. Levant says. Firm Capital, a mortgage investment corporation, has a tax structure that allows a full tax deduction for distributions paid to unitholders, he points out. "Firm Capital provides above-average security of capital and regular monthly income generated by a well-managed mortgage portfolio."
Eric Takaha, co-lead manager of the Franklin High Income Fund, is finding value in bonds issued by U.S. energy companies, which comprise more than 10 per cent of the fund's portfolio. Although the U.S. consumer is suffering, "corporate America is doing okay," Mr. Takaha said in an interview from San Mateo, Calif.
The top pick for yield for Terry Carr, vice-president of fixed income at MFC Global Investment Management (Canada), is Southern States Cooperative Inc. bonds maturing in 2015 and yielding 9.25 per cent. Southern States is a Richmond, Va.-based retailer and wholesaler of agricultural products and services. "It's a solid, strong performer with additional potential," Mr. Carr said.
Credit risk and stock market risk are only two parts of the fixed income puzzle. Reaching for yield in a low-rate environment has one overarching risk that investors must consider before committing their hard-earned money. Everyone thinks interest rates are going to fall further or at least stay flat.
But if they were to jump, perhaps because of concerns about the U.S. dollar, its trade deficit or financing its debt, bond prices around the world would fall.

Full text: A whopping $8-billion a year in startup funding comes from those closest to entrepreneurs
"Love money" is a friendly way to describe an investment made in budding entrepreneurs by those with the closest connections to them: family and friends.
But love money is also serious money for funding businesses in this country. A whopping $10-billion a year is invested in new companies in Canada using informal financing sources, and of that amount about $8-billion comes from family and friends, said Dr. Allan Riding, the Deloitte professor in the management of growth enterprises department at the University of Ottawa's Telfer School of Management. The remaining $2-billion comes from angel investors, experienced entrepreneurs who back new firms.
Dr. Riding said investments from family and friends are vital to the economy. While many of the funded companies are small-scale and local, Toronto real estate firm Evton Capital Partners grew a multimillion-dollar company.
"It's not the norm," Dr. Riding said. "We don't have research that tell us the dynamics of family and friend investments [whether they are becoming more sophisticated] and whether change is involved. Family and friends is such a mixed bag. I would say [Evton] is on the extreme end, in a good way for them."
Evton Capital was established in 1995 by Michael Bunston and his partner, Bill Evans, to focus on the purchase of commercial B-class real estate, older but serviceable office buildings in the GTA and southern Ontario region.
Mr. Bunston said its approach succeeded because of previous experience and from showing investors that they themselves would be taking on financial risk.
"We really grew our business on that model. We had a good track record and we had all these long-standing relationships who like the commodity of real estate. Obviously, the trust factor between us and our investors was there because they had known us for a long time and had seen us do business successfully," Mr. Bunston said.
An initial property purchase in Brampton, Ont., led to the involvement of two investors who were close friends with the partners. Commercial B-class properties were thought to be poised for growth, and over the years, Mr. Bunston said, the success had a snowball effect. The key, he added, was to involve more family and friends who wanted property in their portfolios and who trusted the partners.
"The sales process becomes tough if you are having to educate them on the commodity of real estate," Mr. Bunston said. "The next project brought in a mix of family and friends who wanted to become involved, first five people, the next one 10. If you have positive results you get referrals."
Price points for purchases, Mr. Bunston said, have been between $5-million and $50-million, with the company now valued at $77-million after acquisitions this year. A fund was established by the firm in 2005 "to provide investors with tax-effective cash flow and long-term capital appreciation," with family and friends given key opportunities and roles in investing in it. The quarterly distribution paid out to investors is a return of their original capital, Mr. Bunston said.
Was it a challenge to bring in investors with an emotional tie to the partners? Mr. Bunston called it "an opportunity."
"We just worked out fannies off, 24/7," he said, laughing. "We made sure we did the right things, and what we said we were going to do, we did. We've never lost money for our investors, but when we were in a situation where a deal wasn't going according to plan, we'd communicate this to our investors: what went wrong and what we'd do to fix it."
Their success is now leading to growth on a wider scale, beyond family and friends, with the aim of raising $20-million for future projects, starting in October.
Dr. Riding said Evton Capital set a good example for the development of a more sophisticated approach to the family and friends model. "The more successful models we can illustrate, the fewer failures we are going to have. People learn from successful models."
Dr. Riding co-authored a federal study in 2006 on informal financing of small and medium-sized enterprises. Covering businesses started in 2004, it is the most current information available on informal financing. He said statistical information on the two segments of informal financing is generally poor.
"It's not a well-researched topic. There is a growing body of work on it. Internationally, we are only just coming to an agreement of what informal investment and financing means."
While as a group of informal investors "family and friends" was an eponymous description, Dr. Riding described business angels as wealthy investors who can provide start-up capital and mentorship to a business. "This is way more than venture capital invests in early stage firms."
The two types of informal investors are quite distinct.
"Angels tend to be repeat players, funding and mentoring multiple times. Family and friends, for the most part, tend to be one-off investments. You make an investment in your son or your daughter, and it's opportunistic. It's not year by year, three or four investments per year."
The rates of return for business angels were good, Dr. Riding said, as they made money more often than they lost it. Rapid growth was also an aim for them, while family and friends typically just want to see the company survive.
Family and friends typically lose more than they make. It is, Dr. Riding agreed, a labour of love.

Abstract: [Anthony] and [Liz] are invested mainly for income, Mr. Small notes. Yet they say they don't need to draw on their investments to complement their monthly pensions. Altogether, the family's gross income is about $73,000 a year, including Anthony's daughter's disability pension.

Full text: At 63, Anthony is retired and living comfortably in southwestern Ontario with his wife Liz, whom he married in 2009, and his 31-year-old daughter, who has Down syndrome.
His late wife was an American citizen, so when she died, her social security payments went to Anthony.
When Anthony's father died a couple of years ago and left him an estate valued at $485,000, he wasn't quite sure what to do with the money. Like many Canadians, he had little experience investing. He and his wife have only modest registered retirement savings plans - about $20,000 each.
"I should be happy to receive this windfall, correct?" he writes in an e-mail. But his new-found wealth has led him to fret about the income tax he and Liz pay on their investments. She has a $300,000 portfolio of her own.
When he first got the bequest, Anthony took the money to his local credit union branch and invested it in GICs, income-producing mutual funds and dividend funds. Liz's money is invested with a full-service investment dealer, so she has a fairly well-balanced portfolio that is a tad heavy on income trusts.
"How can we invest in a tax-efficient way?" Anthony asks. Naturally, he and Liz also want the highest possible returns.
We asked Allan Small, senior investment adviser at Dundee Securities Corp., to look at their situation.
What the Expert Says
Anthony and Liz are invested mainly for income, Mr. Small notes. Yet they say they don't need to draw on their investments to complement their monthly pensions. Altogether, the family's gross income is about $73,000 a year, including Anthony's daughter's disability pension.
So the first step would be for Anthony and Liz to draw up some investment goals: What do they want to do with the money?
Next, they have to honestly assess their risk tolerance, Mr. Small says. If Anthony opens a brokerage account, he can draw from a wider array of investment options. Instead of parking $100,000 in a three-year GIC paying 3.9 per cent, he could buy some corporate bonds, which have higher yields than GICs, or some quality bank preferred shares for the low-risk portion of his portfolio, Mr. Small says.
With GICs, "after subtracting inflation and taxes (GIC interest is fully taxable as income), Anthony will barely make any money." Dividend income from preferred shares, however, is lower because of the dividend tax credit.
Together, Anthony and Liz have investments of roughly $760,000, Mr. Small notes, so they do not have to limit themselves to mutual funds, with the possible exception of a global fund for international diversification. Instead, they can invest in securities directly.
He suggests either professional money management or a fee-based account with an investment dealer where the clients make the investment decisions. Anthony's funds are fairly high cost, Mr. Small notes. Their management expense ratios range from 1.55 per cent to 2.6 per cent. These fees are not tax deductible.
With a fee-based account, fees would typically range from 1 per cent to 2 per cent - an amount that would be deductible for tax purposes. With fee-based accounts, Anthony and Liz would have "portfolios that are specifically designed for them," he says, "in essence, their own tailored mutual fund based on their risk level and objectives."
Mr. Small recommends diversified portfolios comprising stocks, real estate income trusts, good quality preferred shares, corporate bonds and international funds for exposure to emerging markets. How much of each asset class will depend on their individual risk tolerance.
His suggested portfolio would be heavy on dividend payers and companies that return capital. As well, it would hold growth stocks of companies that are leaders in their sector, pay good dividends and are trading at a discount to their underlying value.
Anthony and Liz may also want to consider how they will provide for his daughter once they are no longer alive.

A star is (re)born on the Danforth

Abstract: It's a healthy mix of restoration and reproduction, and it's worth noting that what was re-fabricated was done either by measuring original pieces or with the help of dozens of archival photographs: "It's not like we were extrapolating or making things up and asking 'What would this have been like?' " says Mr. [Philip Evans].

Can one building transform a neighbourhood?
A half-century ago, the intersection of Danforth and Greenwood avenues was a vibrant place, with the 775-seat Allenby theatre serving as its hub. Movie theatres had that sort of pull back then. Even as recently as the late-1970s and 1980s, the renamed Roxy was still enjoying success as a revival theatre with a new crowd of punk rockers and new wavers gathered for late-night screenings of the Rocky Horror Picture Show .
But at some point in the 1990s or early 2000s, the area stopped being a place to gather. The Roxy suffered through a succession of owners and insensitive renovations, surrounding businesses closed and even a popular fast food chicken outlet was reduced to the look of a bombed out ruin, its skeletal bucket-shaped signage now a beacon for decay.
In 2006, however, ERA Architects got a call from new owners Imperial Oil, who had little experience with heritage buildings. Plans were afoot to turn the 1936 Kaplan & Sprachman design into one of the most popular gathering places of the 21st century: a coffee shop. ERA associate Philip Evans remembers getting excited at the prospect of getting involved: "Wow, interesting site, it's on the subway line, it's a kind of an abandoned main street thing and it would be really interesting to contribute to it." Things got even more interesting when Mr. Evans and the rest of the ERA team convinced Imperial Oil to save more than just the façade, even though that was all that was required by the city.
A vital detail was "the whole entry sequence from the street," he explains, which meant retaining a good chunk more. Once the project is completed in a few weeks, Tim Hortons customers will walk under the meticulously recreated marquee by Teksign of Brantford (based on the decaying original that was still underneath modern backlit signage), past the recreated ticket booth and onto the original terrazzo - note the stylized 'A' for Allenby - then glace up to admire the restored scalloped ceiling as they open the original Art Deco doors. And if they don't notice the recreated Vitrolite glass on the outside (it's hard to miss those striking black stripes on a cream background), they'll surely notice, on the inside, the glass cases where lobby cards would tease moviegoers with upcoming features.
It's a healthy mix of restoration and reproduction, and it's worth noting that what was re-fabricated was done either by measuring original pieces or with the help of dozens of archival photographs: "It's not like we were extrapolating or making things up and asking 'What would this have been like?' " says Mr. Evans. And while those under age 60 might question going with the original name, it was an easy decision for ERA: "We really wanted to do the Allenby lettering, the old neon style, and that was never done with the Roxy," he explains. "We're a conservation practice ... we're trying to be consistent."
And that also meant repairing things many people wouldn't notice. Most of the stepped parapet had to be reconstructed by qualified heritage masons due to extensive water damage caused by a leaky roof. Bricks from the original supplier in Pittsburgh were located, and, like the originals, mortar was applied in the "raked joint" method (meaning half an inch was removed to 'float' the brick). Modern aluminum windows were removed and replaced with recreations of the originals featuring horizontal sashes that echo the wide, dark brick banding above the marquee.
A quick glance at the east or west elevations reveals just how much of the original building remains and, to further distinguish old from new, the new portion was set back slightly. "We referenced the original volume and mass of the theatre portion of the building," explains Mr. Evans, pointing to the new buff brick addition that contains the "On the Run" convenience store. "We worked with Esso to develop a consistent material palette; their typical treatment is either stucco or a faux, split-faced stone."
The change from just a few years ago is astonishing, and it's likely that were it not for an owner with deep pockets, the Allenby/Roxy would have been left to rot and then, eventually, would have come down in yet another case of demolition by neglect. "Just the fact that this has been done, and what it contributes to the street, and it is an icon, and it actually reinforces more of an identity than Tim Hortons could ever express," offers Mr. Evans, "they understood that there was value in this."
And the locals, it seems, are paying it forward. Even before final touches are complete (such as the installation of the marquee lights, which will flash in the original sequence), already there is a sense of rebirth in this neighbourhood. As a matter of fact, Mr. Evans sensed it himself a few years ago and moved his family from Parkdale to the immediate area.
"This is, like, the hangout," says Mr. Evans with a laugh. "I came here on site a couple of weeks ago [and] I couldn't get into the building! The lineups were like it was an old movie theatre or something."

Abstract: The home showcases many of [Arthur Erickson]'s signature contemporary design elements, including "sandblasted concrete exterior surfaces, the use of clear cedar both indoors and out, floor-to-ceiling windows, floating concrete staircases with the treads cantilevered out from the walls, seamless indoor/outdoor living spaces, a reflecting pond, and a sense that the structure has been part of the landscape forever," says Mr. Goodwill.

The action:
Arthur Erickson is known as one of Canada's most influential contemporary architects and when he designed this 4,754-square-foot home in 1972 for the Eppich family, it fast became an iconic residence featured in architectural magazines around the world.
The house was originally constructed as a four-bedroom family home but was renovated into a three-bedroom by the previous owners.
"Because of the unusual layout, the smaller number of bedrooms, as well as the lack of a big ocean view, which is more typical of higher-priced homes in West Vancouver, this home had been on the market for over six months without attracting an offer," says agent Jonathan Goodwill.
"We were able to negotiate an excellent price for what is considered an iconic piece of architecture by one of Canada's most famous architects, sited on an exceptionally large lot in the heart of Ambleside," he says of the sale, which closed Thursday for $945,000 under the list price.
What they got:
The home showcases many of Erickson's signature contemporary design elements, including "sandblasted concrete exterior surfaces, the use of clear cedar both indoors and out, floor-to-ceiling windows, floating concrete staircases with the treads cantilevered out from the walls, seamless indoor/outdoor living spaces, a reflecting pond, and a sense that the structure has been part of the landscape forever," says Mr. Goodwill.
The home has been updated over the last five years. The previous owners added double-glazed, full-height, commercial-grade windows and sliding doors and replaced all of the exterior cedar beams and posts and the roof. They also updated the mechanical, electrical, heat and hot water systems. New hardwood flooring has been laid on the lower level, and the bathroom and kitchen fixtures have been replaced.
"Private terraces add considerably to the finished area, effectively eliminating any barrier between indoors and out and drawing the landscape into the home," says Mr. Goodwill.
"The property includes a creek that feeds a reflecting pond, which is beautifully landscaped with a small beach, reeds and lily pads and provides a home for local and migrating birds. An infinity-edge outdoor pool seems to cascade from the terrace into the pond. Specimen rhododendrons, old growth firs, and an eclectic collection of sculptures complete the landscape," he adds.
The agent's take:
"The buyers, serious fans of contemporary architecture, fell in love with this home and the grounds, a 1.1-acre park-like setting in Ambleside, offering incredible privacy and extensive outdoor living areas," says Mr. Goodwill.
The new owners have plans for some minor renovations.
"Originally built as a family home with a three-bedroom children's wing on the upper level, an extensive living area in the middle, and a den and master suite on the lower level, my clients plan to renovate in order to add a nanny suite, and make the home suitable for a growing family once again," he says.
A home in this price range is often valued for its ocean views and number of bedrooms, says Mr. Goodwill. For this home, it was about waiting for the right buyer.

Calling this area the Riverside District is a slight bit misleading: The Don River is not far to the west, to be sure, but about eight lanes of traffic on the Don Valley Parkway stand between the water and the new housing.
Still, the neighbourhood's funkiest lofts, antique stores and cafes owe their existence to the Victorian-era warehouses that once brimmed with goods transported along the waterway.
The area is a slice of South Riverdale. You'll find yourself there immediately upon traversing the DVP on the Queen or Dundas St. bridges. The eastern boundary blurs into Leslieville at about Logan.
It's a good place for ...
Recreation (humans and dogs)
The Royal Canadian Curling Club is undergoing renovation but is set to show off the new ice bed in November.
How many times have you wished you could take your dog swimming at an indoor pool? Fit Dogs on Broadview has one. If your pooch prefers to play outside on the grass, Riverdale Park on Broadview is not only vast, it has a view of the downtown skyline. And the Jimmie Simpson Recreation Centre has an indoor pool for humans.
Transportation
Streetcars rumble right through this neighbourhood on the main streets. Drivers are well-connected with the DVP, Lakeshore and Gardiner just a hop away.
Schools
There's some creativity in education here: First Nations School of Toronto and SEED Alternative Secondary School are two of the unconventional choices. There's also Dundas Junior Public School, Withrow Avenue Junior Public School, Bruce Junior Public School, Queen Alexandra Middle School, Quest Alternative School and East Alternative School.
What took so long?
At one time, there was a stigma to living in proximity to a notorious prison. In days past, Munro Street was home to the hangman at the Don Jail, local lore says. A row of cottages on that street housed the wives and families of prisoners after the jail was built in the late 1850s.
But the former jail building and the old Riverdale Hospital have been incorporated into the enlightened vision for Bridgepoint Health, under construction at Broadview and Gerrard. Also in the murky past, the segment between the DVP and Broadview was the domain of jobbers and auto parts suppliers. Those brownfield sites have been redeveloped and rows of new townhouses are filling in the area.
Broadview and Queen has the adult entertainment lounge Jilly's, which is a place you may not feel like boasting about to your folks - unless you're talking about the architectural merits of the building.
Harbingers of Change
Java joints, brunch spots and bohemian art galleries are joining long-established diners such as the Real Jerk. F'Coffee on Queen has a sweet backyard patio. Celebrity chef Lynn Crawford is drawing foodies to Ruby Watchco.
A restored 1905 bank building on Queen now accommodates the fashion boutique and studio of Stephan Caras Design.
Merchants of Green is an off-the-beaten-path coffee lounge for the Macbook Pro set.
You'll find it on Matilda St. in an antiquated red brick warehouse just above the Parkway. You're likely to encounter three or four web content specialists operating from the wooden tables. Some of the highly-caffeinated patrons check in at their digital imaging studios and galleries on Davies Ave., where Mercedes and BMWs line the curb.
Market values
Many developers are cashing in on the demand for living space close to downtown. Lofts and townhouses can be found for less than $500,000. On the side streets, old worker cottages and row houses can still be found in the $350,000 range.

The action: This two-and-a-half storey house fetched the asking price of $1,250,000 on the first day offers were accepted.
What they got: The 2,375-square-foot, centre hall residence features wood trim and hardwood floors throughout, as well as wainscoting, French doors and leaded glass windows.
* On the main floor, there are living and dining rooms, a den and an eat-in kitchen, plus an exit to a rear deck and stairs to a lower level rec room and one of three bathrooms.
* Four bedrooms occupy the second floor, while two more bedrooms complete the third floor.
The agent's take: Agent Andrea Morrision praised the seller's preservation of the home's architectural integrity and the addition of modern conveniences such as the new Marcon bathroom and kitchen. The property is one of few in the neighbourhood with a garage. The need for a car is minimized because the home is located near numerous amenities. "It's close to parks and local renowned schools, like Pius Catholic School and Humbercrest for French immersion," says Ms. Morrison.

Abstract: "We've said since this conversation started earlier this year that the MLS is a robust platform that allows users to the most listings in Canada," said Gino Romanese, a senior vice-president at Royal LePage. "The key is that information must be vetted, and people stake their reputations on the accuracy of that information. There have to be consequences if it's not right."

Full text: Real estate group's settlement with competition watchdog allows sellers to list homes for flat fees
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Canadian homeowners will be able to list their homes on the Multiple Listing Service for a flat fee, but they'll still have to compensate any real estate agent who brings a buyer to their doorstep, according to the confidential terms of a deal between the industry and Ottawa's competition watchdog.
That compromise is the cornerstone of a landmark settlement between the Canadian Real Estate Association and the Competition Bureau of Canada, say people briefed on the matter. That settlement is intended to bring peace in a months-long battle between CREA and Competition Commissioner Melanie Aitken, who had accused the real estate association of blocking its members from offering services that would lower costs and commissions for people who are buying and selling homes.
The key issue in the dispute has been MLS, the popular website and listing service through which the majority of Canadian homes are done. Conventional real estate agents, who usually charge a commission of between 4 and 5 per cent of the selling price of the home, have been the gatekeepers of that system, locking out alternative providers of less-expensive real estate services. Ms. Aitken saw that as anti-competitive and took the case to court.
The tentative deal reached by the two sides on Sept. 30 allows sellers to hire an agent to post their property on the MLS and then conduct the rest of the sale on their own, if they choose.
But details of the settlement make it clear it won't be a completely free ride, as sellers will be expected to tell real estate agents up front what they will be paid if they find a buyer.
The deal also makes it clear that the system isn't being thrown open to the public. As always, only licensed agents will be able to post listings. Sellers who pay a flat fee for a listing won't have their contact information posted on Realtor.ca, the public hub for MLS listings, although the listing can provide links to other sites that contain contact information.
CREA wouldn't comment on the proposed settlement, the details of which haven't been made public. Instead, it has been cloistering the leaders of its 101 local boards and briefing them ahead of the Oct. 24 vote.
The Competition Bureau has also refused comment, citing the impending vote.
The settlement also states that listing agents will be responsible for the integrity of each listing, which means they could be held legally responsible for any errors or problems that arise later. This is seen as an essential requirement by those in the industry, because it will prevent the system from being flooded with erroneous postings and misleading information.
"We've said since this conversation started earlier this year that the MLS is a robust platform that allows users to the most listings in Canada," said Gino Romanese, a senior vice-president at Royal LePage. "The key is that information must be vetted, and people stake their reputations on the accuracy of that information. There have to be consequences if it's not right."
While the settlement has been kept quiet, there aren't any sweeping changes that would catch the industry off guard. The two sides were close to a deal earlier this year, when CREA agreed to allow agents to post listings on MLS without handling the rest of the deal. They are also allowed to offer individually priced services, instead of charging a flat commission regardless of which services a client wanted.
Even though a handful of companies started flat-fee listing services within days of the decision, the Competition Bureau felt it needed to move ahead with hearings before the Competition Tribunal because it wasn't confident CREA wouldn't change its rules at a later date.
The deal, if approved, would be binding for 10 years.
The settlement will face its first major test before it's even enacted, however, as the country's largest for-sale-by-owner company nears a deal with a brokerage to post its Ontario listings on the MLS. Moncton, N.B.-based Propertyguys.com has long wanted to place its listings on the site, where 90 per cent of the deals done in Canada take place.
But having for-sale-by-owner properties on the country's premier listings website has long rankled the rank-and-file agents who pay for its upkeep. Many agents suggest it's akin to someone driving their car to a private dealer's lot and slapping a "for sale" sign in the windshield.
The deal hasn't been signed, but already the company has received mail from local agents warning it to stay off of MLS. "Every time we ventured towards any solution that that involved working with agents, we basically got blocked," said president Ken LeBlanc. "We hoped that the anti-competitive behaviour could some day be broken, and it looks like that day may have come."
***
THREE WAYS TO SELL
There's more than one way to sell a house in Canada. With a deal between the Canadian Real Estate Association and the Competition Bureau pending, three competing models have emerged for consumers to consider
1. TRADITIONAL: $15,000
The agent: Tina Forbes, a ReMax agent, Stoney Creek, Ont.
The deal: She usually charges 5-per-cent commission - but that is split between herself and the agent for the buyer. That works out to about $15,000 on the average home. For the money, a seller can expect Ms. Forbes to consult databases to arrive at an asking price, post a lawn sign, arrange a posting on the Multiple Listing Service, create online picture galleries, hire a stager, set up and handle viewings, run open houses, and handle negotiations.
The reason: "I pride myself on the level of service I'm able to provide to my clients. I like how this job allows me to be creative, and really focus on the ways I can help. This is a full-service job, and I'm literally working all the time. If I'm at a family function, I'll have my phone with me."
2. FLAT-FEE: $649
The agent: Mayur Arora of Oneflatfee.ca, Surrey, B.C.
The deal: For $649, Mr. Arora will post any house in the province on MLS. If sellers want additional services, they can buy them à la carte - a lawn sign costs $100; professional photos, $149; handling negotiations, $500. If a seller decides to go the full-service route, it costs $4,999.
The reason: "We offer the best of both worlds - selling on your own and they can also be on the MLS. Without MLS, it's hard to sell. But if they do it this way, they can offer some sort of commission to the agent that finds a buyer."
3. DO-IT-YOURSELF: $399
The agent: Mike Shanks, Propertyguys.com, Waterloo, On.
The deal: Propertyguys.com helps owners sell their homes without an agent. The basic package gets sellers a lawn sign, a listing on the website and access to local representatives who will point sellers toward additional resources if they have questions. It also offers a more robust package at $3,500 that includes traditional advertising, photo galleries, lawn signs and more hands-on help with things such as staging.
The reason: "We've been proving for 14 years that you don't need the MLS to sell a property, you need product placement and exposure. We do that at a low cost, and leave people in control of their own situations. "

Full text: Entrepreneurs who take the time to build relationships can make it in a country that is 'tough to get into'
With a greying population and a stock market only one-fifth its 1989 value, Japan has seen its share of foreign business people decamp for the booming economies of China and India.
But many Canadians who have remained in Japan say the key to success boils down to one word: Patience.
"Japan is tough to get into and easy to leave," said Wilf Wakely, who has 35 years experience in Japan as an entrepreneur, trade representative and business lawyer. "When the bright lights are on in India and China, the moths fly that way. But Japan is a fruitful place to do business. Turn the tap on, it's real dough coming out. It's an enormous economy and there are gaps in a number of important areas."
Japan is home to many Canadian entrepreneurs with profitable ventures in fields as diverse as music licensing, fashion photography and real estate. With patience and determination, they are bucking downward trends in the Japanese economy, where many "zombie" corporations (so called because taxpayer support is the only thing keeping them alive) and government ministries ran up debts and burned out their staffers during the 1980s boom. Meanwhile, underdeveloped industries such as travel and tourism remain mired in the Lost Decade of the 1990s.
Though its economy was recently eclipsed by China's, Japan's remains the world's third-largest and, according to Mr. Wakely, its best-kept secret. "There's a Mount Fuji of savings. There's a vast wealth of retirees. For me, there's great opportunity in a place that is rich, wealthy, established and changing."
Stephen Huggins, a former football player at the University of Western Ontario, is pooling some of Japan's enormous supply of capital into "land banking" real estate investments in Southern Ontario. He said his TSI International Group has about 50 employees and annualized turnover of about $50-million.
While his five years in Hong Kong were like a master's degree in "the speed of the deal," he said his 11 years in Japan have been like a PhD thesis in "the value of a relationship."
"Having a short-term view [less than five years] is almost suicidal," he said. "Ten is preferable." He said even brash Wall Street titans have learned that "you can't bully or buy your way into the market, as it takes time and patience."
He said his Japanese associates, who have nicknamed him "the Foreigner that Won't Run Away," won't even consider dealing with companies until they show "a strong commitment to the market," which he said means "years of presence." He said Japanese are more cautious than investors elsewhere in Asia. "If I'm in Hong Kong, the potential client will ask me, 'How much money can I make,' and in Japan, they will ask me, 'How much money can I lose?'" he said. "In Japan, providing comfort and security is crucial."
Benjamin Parks, 33, a fashion photographer and studio owner whose $20,000 initial investment has grown with the help of about a dozen local hires over the past six years, said the Japanese way of doing business is very appealing - honourable, conscientious, punctual and fair - even though they often won't say why they like or dislike a supplier's services.
"This isn't a country where you're likely to be ripped off, lied to, or taken advantage of through some hidden wording in a business contract," he said. "The Japanese think carefully about all relationships, especially business ones. Then, once you're doing business and a plan of action is decided upon, they work hard to fulfill the plan and to make both parties happy."
He said forming business relationships takes a lot of work, and networking is a slower process than in the West. "The Japanese don't like the idea of sudden, spontaneous, risky partnerships. They prefer a more step-by-step approach, where trust is strengthened little by little, and where consensus is arrived at gradually."
A University of British Columbia law graduate, Mr. Wakely often advises Canadians on what works - and doesn't work - in Japan. He said his first venture, the Pizza Patio fast-food chain, hit hurdles after an American lawyer on his side "pounded the table" and scared off further investment by the Japanese side.
But he didn't give up on Japan. Working at the Canadian embassy in the 1980s, he helped get Mitsubishi Trust and other Japanese investors to construct Canada's avant-garde embassy building in central Tokyo, which the Japanese corporations also rent out as office space.
While a trade officer for the British Columbia government, he stayed after the 1995 earthquake shook his home and office in Kobe and destroyed a major global port city. He also stayed after Japan's revolving door of prime ministers shut down a special cabinet committee where he and 20 other leaders of foreign businesses were able to tell senior bureaucrats face-to-face how to make Japan more user friendly and attractive to investors. Currently working with the Vancouver Board of Trade and as Secretary of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Tokyo, he said he's involved in about 15 projects in Japan, including a joint-venture partnership with TMI Associates, a major Japanese law firm.
Mr. Wakely said entrepreneurs should take advantage of Japan's greying society of seniors who are willing to spend on services such as health care, credit cards, pet training, learning yoga, or flying sport planes. "A lot of people over 60 have a lot of time on their hands. When people retire, the wife can't stand having the husband at home. The old man has to get out and do something. They can only do so much golf and pachinko."
He also recommends hiring Japanese seniors, rather than relying on headhunters to poach young staff from other companies. "Quite a number of Japanese seniors have international experience. You might have a wonderful product, but there's an enormous barrier in terms of language and street smarts. It's tough to navigate the labyrinth without some experience, and these seniors have it."

Dividend may be key to Whistler IPO

Abstract: The success of the Olympics are a big part of the pitch in the documents. "According to 29 surveys conducted by Tourism Whistler, top of mind awareness grew from 19 per cent to 42 per cent in Germany, from 48 per cent to 62 per cent in Australia and from 32 per cent to 45 per cent in the United Kingdom following the Olympic Winter Games," the documents say.

It's official. Whistler Blackcomb Holdings Inc. plans to go public.
The initial public offering (as reported in The Globe and Mail last week) is designed to capitalize on the success of the Olympics at the site.
Intrawest , the parent company of Whistler, will continue to own a stake in the resort, while a slice will be sold to the public via a listing on the TSX. The documents filed with regulators don't give a size for the offering, but they do provide plenty of interesting numbers that give a look inside the ski business.
The success of the Olympics are a big part of the pitch in the documents. "According to 29 surveys conducted by Tourism Whistler, top of mind awareness grew from 19 per cent to 42 per cent in Germany, from 48 per cent to 62 per cent in Australia and from 32 per cent to 45 per cent in the United Kingdom following the Olympic Winter Games," the documents say.
Also a big part of the pitch are Olympic-related improvements to local infrastructure that will benefit Whistler, such as the money spent on Vancouver's airport and on the highway from the city to Whistler.
However, for investors, the reality is in the numbers.
The first item of note is that prior to the Olympics, there isn't much growth.
The resort generated revenue of $218.7-million for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2009, according to the filings. That's down from $223.9-million the year before, and in line with the $219.5-million in revenue the year before that.
The bottom line is similar - steady but no discernible growth. Profit in the past three full years is $51.9-million, $60.7-million and $52.4-million. In the first nine months of the current fiscal year, a period that included the Olympics, profit was $52.1-million.
That's likely most of the year's earnings, given that the business is still heavily winter dependent.
In fiscal 2009, just under half of total revenue, or $104.3-million, came from lift operations. An additional $20.6-million came from ski school operations. About 90 per cent of lift sales were ski lift tickets, with the remainder coming from summer activities.
So how much will investors in a wary IPO market pay for this operation, a leader in what the owners call a "stable, mature industry"?
The key is likely to be the dividend. In a yield-hungry market, Whistler plans to pay on and estimates that it could in fact pump out to investors most of the earnings it generates. The company estimates it generated about $38-million to pay dividends in the year up to June 30.
Price the IPO so that there's a juicy enough yield, position it as a real estate type play, which has been popular, and the fact that there's not much growth may not bother some investors.

Full text: Take time to build relationships and trust, say Canadian pioneers who followed in Trudeau's footsteps
FINANCIAL SERVICES REPORTER
Years after former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau went out on a limb and established diplomatic relations with Chinese Chairman Mao Tse-tung's regime, he got annoyed.
Ottawa had effectively built Canadian corporations a bridge into a wondrous world of opportunities. Mr. Trudeau didn't understand why more of them weren't crossing it.
He reached out to Paul Desmarais Sr., who was the chief executive officer of Montreal-based Power Corp. at the time.
"My father said 'You know what, you're right. You have led the way and we're going to follow behind you,'" Andre Desmarais, the current CEO of Power Corp., recounts. "That's what led him to set up his first mission there, and I was lucky enough to be his executive assistant, so I was on that trip and had the fun of preparing it with some other Power executives and others."
The year was 1978, and a Who's Who of Canadian business wound up making the trek, including Ian Sinclair, then the CEO of Canadian Pacific Ltd., David Culver, the head of Alcan, Robert Scrivener of Nortel, Cedric Ritchie, the CEO of Bank of Nova Scotia, and Petro-Canada CEO Wilbert Hopper.
The groundbreaking trade mission led to the creation of the Canada China Business Council, and promises to dramatically boost the amount of business that Canada did with China.
"That was a very fortuitous thing as it turned out, because it ended up being the first really senior trade delegation ever going there from any country," Mr. Desmarais says.
The relationships that Canada forged in the 1970s gave this country's corporations a head-start in what is now a full-on sprint to do business in China. But, as any company that has sought to enter the Chinese market can appreciate, the road was far from smooth.
Indeed, Power Corp.'s first real breakthrough didn't come until 1986. The company wanted to invest money in China, but it was nervous that another revolution might wipe out its investment. Thanks to the ties that it had worked at establishing, it was able to arrange a meeting with Deng Xiaoping, then the leader of the Communist Party of China, through CITIC, a state-owned investment firm.
"We suggested to them that what they should do is buy a plant in Canada - a pulp mill, a business that they need, a business that they knew," Mr. Desmarais says. "Then we would invest the same amount of money in China...
"The idea was that if there was a revolution in Canada, they could take our assets in China, and if there was a revolution in China, we could take their assets in Canada."
It's a tripartite lesson that many business people have learned: to succeed in China, relationships, patience and trust are paramount.
Following those talks, CITIC made its largest investment to date outside of China, buying a half-interest in a pulp mill in Castlegar, B.C., in a joint venture with Power Consolidated (China) Pulp.
The investment was a major breakthrough for Power Corp., and marked the beginning of a series of deals that each turned a profit, but the company learned lessons along the way.
"I went back so discouraged so many times you wouldn't believe it," Mr. Desmarais says.
In the early days, the company was offered the chance to buy a piece of land right next to the Forbidden City. Chinese officials were adamant that it had a bright future. "This was 1978, we said, 'It will be at least 50 years before that will ever happen.' Well, we couldn't have been more wrong," Mr. Desmarais says.
When Power Corp. had the chance to team up with CITIC and develop a plot of industrial real estate in Pudong, it took it.
"One of the things that I've learned about China is be very very careful, because there are a million arguments about why they can't do something," Mr. Desmarais says. "For many years I doubted them a lot, saying 'There's no way they can achieve these plans at the speed at which they're able to achieve them.' But I think I've found, with the history of having to be able to go so often, that they have a fantastic planning system, they have tremendous determination, they have courage, and a huge amount of brain power to achieve their goals."
These are lessons that Power Corp. has been able to impart to other Canadian businesses. Over the years, it has paired up with a number of companies to smooth their entry into China - and make money, by selling its investment in the ventures to the other firm once the project is established.
For instance, Power Corp. partnered with Bombardier Inc. on its original train deal in China, Mr. Desmarais noted. The companies worked together to win the contract. Bombardier then built the trains and bought out Power Corp.'s stake in the joint venture that the two firms had established with China National Railway Locomotive and Rolling Stock Industry Corporation.
"It took some time, I don't think we saw any significant business until four or five years ago, so it required a lot of patience," says Pierre Beaudoin, CEO of Bombardier Inc. "Because we believed in the long-term growth potential, we invested a lot to build relationships there."
For Bombardier's businesses, China is the country where Mr. Beaudoin sees the most growth potential of any in the world. And that means that Bombardier's relationship with the Chinese government is of the utmost priority, because items such as trains and planes are largely bought by state-owned companies.
"In many ways in China it is very clear who is the customer," Mr. Beaudoin says. "It is a communist country, the government does centrally control decisions."
While that might have been self-evident to Bombardier, not everything was.
"The challenge is understand, understand, understand," adds Jianwei Zhang, the president of Bombardier China. "Be clear. Understand the needs of the customer, understand the Chinese needs."
He recalls being asked by a Chinese customer why there wasn't a return clause in the contract for a train, enabling that customer to return the train to Bombardier if something was wrong with it. "For them it was very difficult to understand that you can't return a train," he says. "In practice, it's impossible. If there's a problem then you correct it, but how do you return a train?"
Another anecdote: A few years ago Bombardier executives were ready to sign a contract that had been under negotiation for several weeks. Just before the signing ceremony was scheduled to take place, they stumbled upon the realization that the two sides had different understandings of when the delivery date would be. The problem stemmed from a mistranslation of the English word "shipment." Bombardier's negotiating team thought that referred to the delivery from its facility to the port, while the Chinese translation was that the trains were put on the ship to China at that time. They had to renegotiate.
There are other hurdles. Chinese companies in a number of industries have quickly learned from their foreign competitors, and they are increasingly forces to be reckoned with. Bombardier's main competitor in China is now a Chinese firm. It can deliver an order in months, not years, and has lower costs.
Bombardier has more than 4,000 employees in China now, and by and large it requires them to understand both Chinese and English. As a result, its labour costs are higher than its Chinese competitor.
But the immensity of the Chinese market means there's enough business to go around. And for all of the energy that they've poured into China, Canadian companies are starting to reap rewards.
Nevertheless, most still describe their ventures in the country as investments for the next generation.
"China is a long-term play for us," says Bob Cook, who heads up the Asian business of Manulife Financial, which has made tremendous inroads in China's insurance and wealth management industries. "The contribution to the bottom line is not going to be huge in the next few years, but I think our shareholders know that. I think they know that what we're trying to do here is lay a foundation."
Manulife broke into China in the mid-'90s, and worked hard to promote the still-relatively-foreign concept of life insurance. Manulife-Sinochem Life Insurance Co. Ltd. is the first Chinese-foreign joint venture life insurance company established in China. Former Chinese premier Li Peng and former Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien attended an opening ceremony for the company in 1996.
Manulife executives quickly learned that while labour might be abundant in China, professionals who could work in the life insurance business were not.
When Mr. Cook came to Asia, he says, "I told my colleagues back in North America, 'You guys are engaged in a mild skirmish for talent, the real war is going on out here in Asia.'"
What Manulife realized it had in its back pocket were employees with a Chinese cultural background who happened to be living in eight different countries. It was also able to move some sales people from its operation in Taiwan to China, taking advantage of their language skills.
"Long term, in order to feed the ongoing growth of the business, you have to be able to develop local talent," Mr. Cook says. It's a sentiment shared by Bombardier, which invests a significant amount of money and resources into training Chinese staff.
Manulife-Sinochem is now in more than 40 cities, but it's been tough slogging.
Canadian executives say that Ottawa's relationship with Beijing is crucial. "We love it when there's things like the minister of finance comes over to visit, because that often is just the last little push we need to get the approval in order to expand our business," Mr. Cook says.
In March of this year, Manulife bought a 49 per cent stake in what is now called Manulife TEDA Fund Management Co., an asset management firm. For Mr. Cook, that deal is the most exciting thing that Manulife has accomplished in China thus far.
"The reason we won is because of the investment we've been making over the last 15 years in partner-relations and in government-relations," he says. "We paid a full and fair price, but price alone was not why we won the deal. It was the investment we had made in relationships in China that we were able to leverage in order to get this deal."
Marc Sterling, who was hired by Manulife 17 years ago to get the company into China and who is now the chairman of Manulife-Sinochem Life Insurance Co., says the realization that Manulife had made it in China dawned on him about three years ago.
That's when Chinese officials allowed Mr. Sterling to take a four-hour drive with a police escort - and sirens wailing - to the Wolong Panda Reserve, where he and his family were allowed to play with six giant pandas.

CANADIAN ADVICE
Canadian executives whose firms have succeeded in China all tend to agree on the most important piece of advice for those who want to follow in their footsteps: patience
Andre Desmarais
CEO of Power Corp.,
honorary chairman of the Canada China Business Council
"We believe that if you do things well over the long-term, you can make a lot of money there and really build a fantastic franchise. But don't go if you're going to go quickly, because you'll have problems.
"If you look at who blows their brains out in China and gives a bad reputation to investing in China it's the people who see huge opportunities, get absolutely excited about them, and then put in the money without doing proper due diligence. You need to take the time to meet the people, start small, and as you get the confidence, as you move along, then grow your business."
Pierre Beaudoin
CEO of Bombardier Inc.
Mr. Beaudoin says companies that want to succeed in China must continually prove to their local partners and government that they're there for the long haul.
"Sometimes you need to repeat it very often, so that you get to a point where you're believable and you develop a trust," he says. "Don't expect that you can come to China, land, land a contract of billions and make money and just go on," he adds.
"It's going to take a few years, they've got to make sure that you're honest, that you can be trusted. I understand that, because many people came to their country thinking that they'd make a fortune and left."
Jianwei Zhang
President of Bombardier China
Mr. Zhang tells people that more than 60 per cent of the problems that foreign corporations have in China stem simply from misunderstandings.
"If we use a North American way to understand Chinese practices, they're very difficult to understand," he says. "The culture, the background, the practices, the languages are different."
The solution: Double-check and triple-check that you are on the same page in negotiations.

Full text: CITY HALL BUREAU CHIEF
Depressed by the choices for mayor? Try looking to one of Toronto's most prominent pockets for a little democratic solace.
While the citywide contest has been focused on electing what many view as the least bad of a disappointing lot, the contest in Ward 27 (Toronto Centre-Rosedale) is all about selecting the best of an impressive crop. Fifteen candidates will be on the ballot Oct. 25, several of whom would be excellent additions to Toronto City Council.
The field is so strong that Kyle Rae, the 19-year council veteran whose departure convinced so many to run, isn't fussed about who will succeed him.
"If anything were to be threatened, it would be threatened by a really blundering mayor," Mr. Rae said. "I think there are very good candidates in my ward. That's why I'm not so anxious about it."
Chances are Mr. Rae will be replaced either by his preferred candidate Ken Chan, a Brunei-born gay former policeman who has advised mayoral candidate George Smitherman and London mayor Boris Johnson, or Kristyn Wong-Tam, a Hong-Kong-born lesbian real-estate agent, gallery owner and community activist.
If there's an upset, the likeliest to pull it off would be Chris Tindal, a former Green Party candidate; Joel Dick, a lawyer; or Simon Wookey, a developer and former film cameraman who has been the most pointed in his attacks on the front-runners. The field also includes sentimental favourite Enza "Supermodel" Anderson and transgendered activist Susan Gapka. Rounding out the ballot are Ben Bergen, Jonas Jemstone, Gary Leroux, Robert Meynell, Perry Missal, Ram Narula, Ella Rebanks and Paul Spence.
The calibre and number of the candidates doesn't mean the race has lacked for controversies, some of which have garnered citywide attention.
Ward 27 encompasses Yorkville, Rosedale, the Yonge Street strip, Ryerson University, the gay village and the homeless shelters that anchor the south end of the ward. It's an area that matters to all of Toronto, not just the nearly 68,000 people who live there. As well, local issues such as the Jarvis bike lanes and the participation of Queers Against Israeli Apartheid (QuAIA) in last summer's Pride parade have cropped up in the mayor's race.
Much of the controversy in Ward 27 has swirled around the bright and well-spoken Ms. Wong-Tam, a co-founder of the Church Wellesley Village Business Improvement Area. She's been accused of hiding her connections to prominent labour organizations and to QuAIA.
"This is part of that perceived front-runner smear campaign to say that I'm not forthcoming," she said in an interview. "Quite honestly, I've never once hid the fact that I'm supportive of unions, just as much as I've talked and tweeted endlessly about my support of arts organizations and arts funding."
Although not a union member herself, Ms.Wong-Tam has scored endorsements from the powerful Toronto and York Region Labour Council and the Canadian Union of Public Employees' Toronto District Council, both of which are now disclosed on her website.
However, in a televised debate on Rogers TV last week, she fudged when a caller asked which candidates were endorsed by or affiliated with a union.
"Kristyn Wong-Tam, affiliated with any union?" host Dale Goldhawk asked as he surveyed the contenders.
"No membership with a union," she replied. Asked the same question, two other candidates, Mr. Dick and Mr. Wookey, disclosed their union endorsements. (Mr. Dick is endorsed by the Central Ontario Building Trades, OPSEU Local 500, which represents health-care workers at CAM-H, and CUPE 4400, which represents education workers. Mr. Wookey is endorsed by a film union.) Ms. Wong-Tam was also, until recently, listed as the registered owner of QuAIA's website. Although she supports the fringe group's right to march in the Pride parade, she said she's not a member or founder. She simply lent her credit card when someone asked for a favour.
"Literally I had someone call me and say, 'Kristyn, we don't have a credit card. Can we borrow your credit card?' And I said, 'Sure.' If people looked at my history of giving back to the community, it's a very natural thing for me to do. ... It demonstrates that I haven't been grooming myself for political office."
Mr. Rae isn't buying it. "I thought she was just disingenuous, completely. I don't know anyone who wanders around giving away their credit card unless they mean it," he said.
Of course, Mr. Rae has a horse in this race. He endorsed Mr. Chan early and still thinks he's the best candidate. However, he called Mr. Chan's vow to remove the Jarvis bike lanes "shortsighted."
The Jarvis bike lanes are probably the most contentious strip of asphalt in the city. Most of the serious candidates for Ward 27 have railed against the process that led to their $59,000 installation and the removal of the thoroughfare's reversing centre lane. Mr. Chan didn't take a firm position until late in the campaign.
"I disagree with the decision to put the bicycle lanes in," Mr. Chan said. "[I'd like to] to come up with a solution that would see the removal of the bicycle lanes. Not simply just going back to what used to be, but finding ways of improving traffic flow." Ms. Wong-Tam has said she would keep the lanes.
Mr. Wookey, who would rip them out and reinstate the centre lane, accused Mr. Chan of being indecisive on tough questions.
"It's like he's always waiting for a committee to report," said Mr. Wookey, also the first to point out Ms. Wong-Tam's connections to QuAIA. When it comes to QuAIA, Mr. Chan has also refused to take a stand, saying he's waiting for a city manager's report that will determine whether the group violates the city's anti-discrimination policy.
"What I find challenging with 15 candidates running and with a number of candidates who are not running with the expectation to win, it's very easy for them to make promises on all different issues," Mr. Chan said. "For me, before I say yes or no to something I take the time to sit down with my team and just to look at the possibility of fulfilling that commitment. Having worked in government, I think a lot of it comes down to being honest about what's really doable."

Full text: Ken Follett's doorstopper confirms his uncanny talent for making history fun
Fall of Giants: Book One of the Century Trilogy
by Ken Follett
Dutton, 985 pages, $40
If you were to describe Ken Follett's new novel as a cross between his grand medieval epics and his 20th-century spy thrillers, you wouldn't be far off. As with the former, Fall of Giants involves a huge cast of characters (six pages' worth) and interweaves the personal and political in a tale that is as much a family saga as a detailed historical blockbuster. And for fans of Eye of the Needle , it offers the same pulse-pounding action scenes, propulsive suspense and intriguing depictions of ordinary people transformed by war.
Yet this near-1,000-page doorstopper is more ambitious still. Encompassing an even larger geographic scope and recounting a world-changing sequence of events from many different angles, it provides a panoramic view not just of the First World War and the Russian Revolution, but of the entire era. With the recent wrap-up of the Pillars of the Earth miniseries, readers are primed and ready for more, and this book delivers, tunnelling through a complex historical period with insightful precision and nary a dull moment. If the next two volumes of the Century Trilogy are equally impressive, the series could become Follett's most significant accomplishment.
The plot centres on five families of varied nationalities and social backgrounds. In 1914, the Welsh country estate owned by the Fitzherberts - the ninth-richest man in Britain and his wife, a Russian princess - serves as the initial gathering point for most of the major players. While Earl Fitzherbert ("Fitz") analyzes the potential for war with his German former schoolmate Walter von Ulrich and his Austrian cousin Robert, military attaches for their respective nations, Gus Dewar, a politically well-connected American, contributes his country's perspective.
Ethel Williams, the Fitzherberts' striking young housekeeper, seeks to rise above her station, sharing confidences with Fitz's liberal-minded sister, Lady Maud, and beginning a reckless affair with Fitz himself. Her younger brother, Billy, becomes a hero after a deadly explosion at the local mine. Meanwhile, in St. Petersburg, Russia, brothers Grigori and Lev Peshkov remember the unjust deaths of their parents, make the best of their dreary existence and dream of immigrating to the United States.
Over the next four years and more, each gets pulled into the conflict. Family squabbles ensue, as do illicit relationships, hasty marriages, underhanded conspiracies and pointless sacrifices. Well-wrought set pieces transport readers smoothly from elegant London soirees to the Foreign Office in Berlin to the seamy side of Buffalo, N.Y. The characters' prominence in the story reflects their countries' involvement in the war, meaning the Dewars don't take centre stage until later.
On his website, Follett says he aims to write transparent prose, and there's much to be said for his unpretentious style. He clearly lays out the intricate chain of alliances, defensive postures and subsequent reprisals that draws most of Europe into the fighting. From the Russian workers' march on the Winter Palace (recounted in flashback) to the October Revolution, and from Archduke Franz Ferdinand's assassination through the interception of the Zimmermann telegram and after, he serves up history in easily digestible form. It gets didactic in places, but the human aspect of war remains primary, as does the immense human cost. Billy Williams's brutal initiation into trench warfare is an especially potent rendering.
Just as the protagonists of Pillars build a magnificent Gothic cathedral, those in Fall of Giants become architects of change. One of Follett's major themes is the empowerment of the disenfranchised, as seen through Maud and Ethel's fight for women's suffrage. The wretched poverty endured by the Russian people packs an emotional punch, making it easier to understand why they found the Bolshevik movement so appealing - at least at first.
In stark contrast, the royals, all woefully out of touch, appear incompetent and silly. Britain's George V and Queen Mary require a servant's advice on etiquette, for example. Follett skillfully mixes them and other real-life characters in with his fictional ones, though saves the best lines - and most perceptive observations - for the latter. "The degradation to which you subject others comes back, sooner or later, to haunt you," Maud thinks, a statement that pithily summarizes a good deal of this book and can serve as precursor to the next, which will cover the Depression and the Second World War. Everyone speaks the same brand of colloquial English, a clever way of keeping them on the same footing.
As the characters traverse the globe on their missions, their paths sometimes cross, making for some unlikely meetings. In fact: "This is amazing - what a coincidence!" exclaims one of them, spotting a friend-turned-enemy in no man's land during the famed Christmas truce on the Western Front. Occasional contrivances aren't uncommon in novels of this sort, but the frequency with which they occur here becomes increasingly distracting.
This issue aside, few novelists besides Follett can make such a broad sweep of history so accessible and consistently entertaining. A splendid evocation of a transformative period, a war novel tailor-made for those who would otherwise avoid them, and a wonderful story all around, Fall of Giants should fulfill expectations and then some. And at a time when the Great War is quickly fading from our collective living memory, it offers a reminder about the victories achieved and struggles endured by this earlier generation.

You've seen them.
No, really, you have, because they're everywhere. You just haven't noticed them. A few weeks ago in these pages, Adele Weder wrote about the "Vancouver Special" - low-cost, basic, boxy 1970s-era houses enjoying a renaissance as west-coasters discover their adaptability.
Toronto has something quite similar, but there's no catchy nickname and they're not found in areas of high-concentration like in Vancouver. They are the hundreds of large, boxy, hip roofed, large-windowed infill homes built from the 1950s to, perhaps, the late-1970s in practically every older neighbourhood, usually by immigrant builders in batches of two or three.
Michael McClelland, a founding partner of E.R.A. Architects, has noticed them. So much so that, six years ago, he got together with two friends who were renters like he was - "I'd always put all my money into my business," he explains - to purchase one on Merton Street.
You've heard of Mr. McClelland.
No, really, you have, if you follow heritage architecture, because his firm is everywhere: the Don Valley Brick Works, the Distillery District, the King Edward Hotel, the Don Jail and the Carlu...just to name a few (some with partner firms).
Wait a minute, that Michael McClelland? Shouldn't he be living in Cabbagetown or something?
"I think when people talk about heritage they think of Cabbagetown," he begins. "For me it would be totally retardaire to buy a house there and fix it up - I'd be so reinforcing values that are already there. These buildings," he continues, looking around his living room, "people drive by and say 'Gah, ugly building' and I'm thinking 'Dream building.'"
Victorian homes, although beautiful, are out of most people's financial reach, and buying this triplex was a way to prove to others (as well as to himself) that there is room for more than one dream: "Can you get a building stock that's reasonable, that's good and solid and just isn't appreciated enough?" he asks, rhetorically, thinking of the wide lot, expansive floor plan, ample parking and no-nonsense construction. "It's a bit like how antiques work, where you go and buy the Formica table and no one gets it, and then you say, 'Well, actually, it's really cool'- this is the Formica table of houses," he says with a big laugh.
And, like Formica, the home was inexpensive to purchase. More importantly, only minimal renovation was required to tailor the three units to the lifestyles of the three new owners. How inexpensive? Try $300,000, all in, for each floor: "It's a little bit of an experiment about how you can live cheaply in the city," he offers. "I like to work really hard, then, when I come home, I like to read and relax and I don't want to bring all that home and do house renovations."
And it is a supremely relaxing place, whether Mr. McClelland finds himself practicing classical guitar in the huge master bedroom, spying joggers on the trails of Mount Pleasant Cemetery from his huge deck, trying new recipes in the well-appointed kitchen or stretching out with a book on the Eames lounger in the wide and welcoming living room.
Even the journey up to Mr. McClelland's third-floor suite is relaxing. Since the 1959 building was designed as a three-apartment rental at the outset, it benefits from a wide, light-filled, small-office-building-style staircase and a bank of large, light-loving windows to illuminate the way.
What wasn't effortless was the paperwork required to transform the property into a legal condominium, since despite its size it's governed by condominium rules that apply to 30- or 300-unit condominiums: "It's a bit of a pain," he says. "It would be better if there was legislation that allowed you to have mini-condos." Luckily, his purchasing partners just happen to work in the city's planning department, so their expertise, combined with design work handled by Mr. McClelland's firm, smoothed over many of the wrinkles.
Combining the intimacy of a single-family home with the convenience of condo life the place feels "a bit more like Montreal than it does Toronto. And everyone has keys to everyone else's apartment, and we have parties and we use everyone's oven."
Celebrating a small slice of architecture that's underutilized and undervalued, Mr. McClelland is celebrating local heritage, in a way, since Toronto has always been a pragmatic place that prides itself on finding housing solutions for the masses (think of the concrete towers of the sixties and seventies that the E.R.A. office is working hard to save with the Tower Renewal Project).
"The thing is," he asks, "can you somehow popularize certain ideas about architecture and make it more acceptable to folks?"
This home proves that you can. But in order to make it the next big renovation craze, Mr. McClelland will have to come up with a name that's catchier than the "Toronto Special."

Listing agent:
Brad Leslie, Re/Max
The Action:
After serving as a family home for 23 years, this 4,131 sq. ft. house will now serve as a community service care home for seniors and the handicapped, says agent Brad Leslie. "Within an hour of the sign going up, I got a call from a top local realtor."
What They Got:
"[The realtor's] clients were a local community service organization caring for seniors and handicapped people. They were looking for more space, and what better than a seven-bedroom house with a huge living room and a huge recreation room. They have rooms for all their needs and activities."
The home was constructed by an Italian builder in 1978 with a curved staircase with marble detailing. While it is has a Vancouver Special floor plan and a lower level with extra bedrooms, there is also an unfinished attic that can be converted into living space. With nine-foot ceilings in the basement and rooms that are, "twice as big as any you might find in a usual home," it was a perfect fit for the new owners, says Mr. Leslie.
The Agent's Take:
"The new owners were as giddy as kids at Christmas when this home hit the market," he says. It may have taken over a month to finalize financing for this community service project but, in the end, "It was my first call, within the first hour of this home hitting the market, that made the sale."
"It was serendipity," says Mr. Leslie, and "both parties are very happy with this transaction."

Full text:   Turning their backs on snazzy project names with instant cachet, housing developers have found value in connecting to local history
kgold@globeandmail.com
It's a shame Henrietta Anderson isn't around to see the condo project that will be her namesake.
Anderson Walk, the upcoming three-building project in North Vancouver, is named after the long time principal of Lonsdale Elementary School, where the new condo project will be built. Not many people would know of Henrietta Anderson - she worked at the school until 1933.
She came from Scotland in 1912 as a mail-order bride, but once she arrived at the dock her supposed fiancé told her he'd married someone else. She didn't want to return to Scotland and be pitied, the story goes, so she stayed in Canada and became one of B.C.'s most respected teachers, earning a PhD while she was working at the school.
It's the perfect local hero story for the marketing of a condo project on the former site of an old school, and it illustrates the trend toward celebrating Vancouver's own history and culture.
"Anderson Walk is paying tribute to one of the more popular teachers going back to the 20s," says Polygon Homes president Neil Chrystal. "Mostly we did that because we are next to the new school district building."
Anderson Walk is a three building, 234-unit development project that started presales about three weeks ago. More than 40 of the units in the first phase have sold, mostly to local North Vancouver buyers who are looking for homes, not only investments.
Mr. Chrystal says local context gives more power to the development. If a developer can work a local story into a project, it has more impact on the buyer and the community. Polygon also preserved about 30 or so of the 100-year-old chestnut trees that ring the property, and commissioned local wood-making sculptor Brent Comber to create public art projects.
Not long ago, when Vancouver was undergoing a real estate boom, it seemed that condo names were as shallow as the instant lifestyle they were supposed to represent. Instead of representing an evolving culture and community, an urban core was quickly transformed by developers as it filled up with names of buildings that would imply exclusivity, wealth and sophistication. Condos with names like the Beresford, the Brownstone, the Brava, Espana, the Elan and the Moda fed the fantasy. It all sounded so New York or European that it didn't matter what the names really meant.
"Almost all of those names I would venture to say are generated by some marketing group coming up with something snazzy and catchy," says Salient Group president Robert Fung, who has made it part of his business philosophy to tie project with community.
"Really, our goal is for something that is going to be strongly identified with the community. Not something pulled out of the air."
Developer Mr. Fung does extensive archival research on his heritage revitalization buildings, combining marketing with historical detail. His heritage buildings stick closely to their roots, such as the Flack Block office building at Cambie and Hastings, or the Alhambra in Gastown.
"With Gastown, the heritage context part is to show people that there is a history here and something to know about those buildings," says Mr. Fung. "Thomas Flack started the gold rush - this is not American history, it's Canadian.
"The Alhambra Building is significant - the people that were there are the people who built our entire city and I think that is significant and we try to draw on that."
His Paris Block condo project is named after logging boot manufacturer Pierre Paris, circa 1919. But even if the building is not an old restoration, he'll find a local reference, such as the Varsity project on W. 10th Ave., where the Varsity Theatre once stood before it burned down.
"The goal is always to do a project that adds to the community, and to the local area," says Mr. Fung. "And to create [projects] that are strongly contextualized."
These days, with the market no longer in a frenzy and Vancouverites basking in the afterglow of Olympic Games pride, it seems more common to take a grassroots approach to condo marketing.
Community leaders, old-time shopkeepers, beloved schoolteachers and politicians are being acknowledged with a condo namesake. Rize Alliance's the Rolston, a tower to be built on Granville Street, is named after an admired cabinet minister named Tilly Jean Rolston, who introduced sex education into schools, among other major reforms, before she died in 1953. The 23-storey tower will be constructed on Rolston Crescent, the current site of the Cecil Hotel.
"It gives the condo personality," marketer Bill Szeto says of the name. "It has emotion attached to it, like the Kerry [in Kerrisdale] or the Sophia [on Main Street]. It creates a better story for us. It's a much better story to blend in with the community. The Rolston had a history with the community and there was a lady named Mrs. Rolston who was part of the city."
Others are more obvious. The Beasley is named after celebrated former city planner Larry Beasley, and Concord Pacific's The Erickson is named after Vancouver's most famous architect, Arthur Erickson. The iconic Hudson's Bay store in Victoria is being transformed into The Hudson condo building, including restoration of its striking terra cotta façade, by Merrick Architecture.
Mr. Chrystal concurs that the Olympics helped fuel the spirit.
"I think the Olympics changed everybody. And it's all for the better, too. People have more sense of pride in their towns and their communities, and they're not ashamed."
His company hasn't always stuck to local references, mind you. They've fallen under the spell of the California dream.
"We've got the Santa Barbara, the Catalina, the Sausalito and the Monterey - we've been down the California route."

QUESTION AND ANSWER / JACK (A.J.) DIAMOND

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/question-answer-jack-j-diamond/docview/756940278/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Perhaps because we live with it we don't recognize the tremendous strengths of the physical layout of this city: Just contrast it, for example, with almost any other North American city. Those cities are characterized by a dense core - high-rise buildings clustered in a small area of the city, but most of the city as flat as a pancake. The contrast in scale and segregation of uses are notable. One could call that a uni-centered city.

Full text:   Designer of the recently-opened Corus Quay, the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts and many other Toronto buildings, A.J. (Jack) Diamond is one of the city's most prominent architects. He recently published a watercolour memoir, Sketches from Here and There . He spoke with Deirdre Kelly
*****
Q: You've lived and worked in Toronto since 1964. So, what makes Toronto so special?
A: Perhaps because we live with it we don't recognize the tremendous strengths of the physical layout of this city: Just contrast it, for example, with almost any other North American city. Those cities are characterized by a dense core - high-rise buildings clustered in a small area of the city, but most of the city as flat as a pancake. The contrast in scale and segregation of uses are notable. One could call that a uni-centered city.
By contrast Toronto is a multi-centered city. The stark contrast in scale between the uni-centered city and its surrounding areas is absent here.
Q: What brings it all together?
A: Toronto has a more nuanced, integrated and convenient arrangement of sub-centres that accommodate regional functions, in turn linked by arterial roads that carry a mix of local commercial services mixed with mid-rise residential uses, and, within super blocks, a hinterland of protected low rise, exclusively residential, uses.
The transportation grid is calibrated exactly to this arrangement - citywide movement by subway, with stations at the sub-centres, local movement by streetcars and buses that feed the metropolitan reach of the subway, or simply to provide for shorter-range movements.
Such a mix of uses and appropriate scales of development result in stable neighbourhoods, high transit ridership and appropriate scales of development.
Q: And our topograpical
layout - that plays a role too?
A: What might otherwise be seen as a relentless grid is broken by the ravine system of the city, green lungs that meander in contrast to the grid.
The grid is also broken by buildings of public importance. We give pride of place to such institutions: Queen's Park at the head of University Avenue, Osgoode Hall, the law courts, at the head of York Street and old City Hall closing the vista of Bay Street, are good examples of this fine gesture.
This is why Toronto works. This is why we have safe streets, with buildings providing streetscape continuity and informal surveillance of the sidewalks. This is why the street grid is not overpowering and why, in true Canadian fashion, we balance private and public interests.

Full text:   The following short reviews of films screening today at VIFF are by Guy Dixon, Liam Lacey, Marsha Lederman and Fiona Morrow.
Star ratings are on a scale of four.
FORCE OF NATURE:
THE DAVID SUZUKI MOVIE
Sturla Gunnarsson (Canada)
****
Constructed around a speech that David Suzuki gave at the University of British Columbia, this documentary could be the most persuasive argument yet that saving the environment is the most critical fight for human rights occurring today. The speech can indeed be compared to Martin Luther King Jr.'s I Have a Dream when describing the air we breathe and the atoms we share as an irrefutable commonality - a bond with the past, present and our children's future. By seamlessly incorporating stories of Suzuki's life and how he came into science and environmentalism, the film accomplishes the difficult task of accentuating Suzuki's extraordinary speech and yet not distracting from it. G.D.
Oct. 7, 4 p.m., Granville 2
DOWN TERRACE
Ben Wheatley (U.K.)
***
You really haven't seen anything quite like this before. Sure, the deadpan English pathos may evoke memories of Mike Leigh or Ricky Gervais; and the casual violence perhaps has shades of Tony Soprano's crew or those old Reservoir Dogs. But Wheatley's bravura gangster flick adds up to far more than the sum of its pop-culture references. Set almost entirely in the small row-house where co-writer and star Robin Hill grew up, Down Terrace follows the gradual disintegration of a local crime family. Karl (Hill) arrives home from jail to find mom Maggie (Julia Deakin) chain-smoking gloomily, dad Big Bill (played by Hill's own father, Robert) pondering the loss of sixties psychedelia, and the girl he had a brief fling with heavily pregnant. Paranoia soon sets in for Big Bill and, as it escalates, so too does the brutal body count. Bold, hilarious and shocking (in a good way), this is a cult classic in the making. F.M.
Oct. 7, 9:15 p.m., Granville 4
ROUTE 132
Louis Belanger (Canada)
***
Part buddy comedy, part grief-therapy tale, this eccentric hybrid begins on the day a sociology professor, Giles (François Papineau), chooses not to attend his five-year-old son's funeral to get drunk. At the bar, he unexpectedly meets an old crony, a small-time con man named Bob (Alexis Martin) and they decide to go to the country to rob banks. When that doesn't pan out, they begin a Don Quixote-like adventure through an arbitrary gauntlet of oddball characters, from a small-town doper with an Asian fetish, to a smug priest and a group of former Bosnian peacekeepers maintaining a strange vigil. Various sequences range from mawkish to juvenile slapstick, with a few reflective moments in between. Bob, as the Sancho Panza of the pair, is a consistently entertaining character, an honest crook who will be friends or fight with anyone. L.L.
Oct. 7, 6:20 p.m., Granville 3;
Oct. 12, 4 p.m., Granville 2
THE YELLOW BITTERN:
THE LIFE AND TIMES
OF LIAM CLANCY
Alan Gilsenan (Ireland)
***
Folk singer Liam Clancy takes centre stage one last time to tell the amazing tale of the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. Like so many before them, the lads emigrated from poverty in Ireland to hope in America, but anything typical about this story ends there. Liam winds up in the clutches of a Guggenheim heiress, then goes on with his brothers and their mate to folk-music fame, earning the praise of Bob Dylan, the attention of John F. Kennedy and a guest spot on The Ed Sullivan Show . Even if you've never heard of them - even if you hate the music - you'll be drawn in by Liam Clancy's honest, vivid recollections. His storytelling prowess elevates this documentary from an exercise in nostalgia to an intimate work of poetry. Director Gilsenan handles the ending, which will be well known to fans, masterfully. M.L.
Oct. 7, 2:30 p.m., Granville 4; Oct. 13, 9:30 p.m., Granville 7
DEAR PRUDENCE
Rebecca Zlotowski (France)
**
Left home alone after her mother's death and her father's flight to Canada to settle the estate, Prudence does what any grieving, confused and abandoned teenager would: She goes off the rails. Ditching school, shoplifting, hanging out with the local biker crowd - Prudence checks off all the self-destructive boxes in an effort to transplant the real pain with something else. It's a promising debut from director Zlotowski, and she elicits a suitably sullen performance from Lea Seydoux as the troubled teen. Interesting, too, are the few scenes at Prudence's aunt and uncle's home at Rosh Hashanah, with subtly played tensions around both her refusal to observe Jewish mourning rituals and her male cousin's sexuality. But the central conceit is well-trodden, and Zlotowski fails to bring anything substantially new or different to the subject. F.M.

Globe Real Estate's fall home value survey, published today, reveals which Toronto neighbourhoods have appreciated in the first 9 months of 2010 and which have lagged. At www.globeandmail.com/realestate you can see how your area measured against the rest.
Sure you have reason to feel smug if you bought in High Park, Beaconsfield or the Annex a decade ago, but more recent upstarts stood out in the first three quarters too. Brock and Dundas, for example, was just a shabby intersection before real estate prices in the side streets began to take off and the area was rechristened Brockton Village.
But where to alight next if you're looking for real estate in the city? Which pockets still have potential?
"It sometimes takes some adventurous people to come in and make some changes," says Realosophy broker John Pasalis, who helped to guide us through five neighbourhoods that seem to have unstoppable momentum.
We know you don't want to hear this, denizens of Brockton Village, but your favourite dingy hang-out is about to be discovered.
BICKFORD PARK
Priced out of the Annex? Here's an oasis of good value downtown
Bickford Park is up-and-coming if you've been priced out of the posh parts of the Annex, say, or Seaton Village. But compared with more distant outposts, the big money has already arrived.
Sitting just south of Bloor Street and Christie Pits, Bickford Park itself is a smaller green space hidden behind the Bob Abate Community Recreation Centre. The surrounding neighbourhood stretches to College at the south, Ossington to the west and Bathurst to the east.
On the side streets that spread out from the park, house hunters can find surprisingly good value for a neighbourhood that is so vibrant and close to downtown, says John Pasalis of Realosophy.
The Bloor Street strip along here was the city's original Greek Town and it amazes Mr. Pasalis that the sports bars held gentrification at bay for so long. But now there are many opportunities for creative disposition of wealth in the yoga studios, bistros and boutiques.
HIGH POINTS
Community spirit: You can hardly move for all-terrain strollers in the playground at Bickford Park, and the off-leash dog area is one of the friendliest in the city. The Kadampa Buddhist Temple on Crawford embraces all seekers of happiness and wisdom at its meditation centre.
Transportation: It's very well-connected with the subway zipping through. Say you're sitting in your kitchen noticing for the first time all the scuff marks on your shoes. Ten minutes later? Shopping at Yonge and Bloor. With Harbord, Ossington and College along your borders, you'll probably walk to your favourite haunts anyway.
Schools: They're solid, with such elementary schools as Dewson Street Jr. ranking well in standardized tests. There's also Montrose Jr. Public School, Delta Alternative Sr., Central Commerce Collegiate Institute and Harbord Collegiate Institute.
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT:
* The area can feel like a compromise: It lacks the stately houses of the Annex and the breathing space of High Park. Parking is scarce and when it does exist, it's often in a back lane. Lots are tight and, on a sweltering summer night, the urban density can be oppressive.
MARKET VALUES
* If a detached house with a driveway is your ideal, you'll have trouble finding it here - at least for less than $1-million. Even most semis are listed for more than $800,000. First-time buyers can gain a toehold for less than $500,000 in a loft or condo.
BROCKTON VILLAGE
A lunchbox village withan arty, relaxed vibe
Remember when Lula Lounge drew revellers out to the sketchiest part of Dundas St. West way back in 2002? It seemed so out-there. But the maverick Latin music and dance club brought many followers.
There's no posturing here. Many residents refuse to call the area anything but Parkdale, but Brockton was a genuine village before it was annexed by Toronto in 1884. At the intersection of Dundas West and Brock, the former Brockton town hall still stands (as a bank branch, naturally).
But the transformation is inevitable. Hidden in a back lane is an über modern box designed by Cecconi Simone and currently for sale with an asking price of $2.25-million. Listing agent Paul Johnston, of Right at Home Realty, figures the buyer will be someone who appreciates the transitive authenticity of the neighbourhood.
"Early mornings you still see workmen with their lunchboxes off to the site," says Mr. Johnston.
HIGH POINTS
Artistic cred: Jessica Bradley Art + Projects is the eponymous exhibition space of a curator for the Art Gallery of Ontario and National Gallery of Canada. The design shop Lubo creates furniture from recycled and reclaimed wood. Beadle is the boutique for handmade jewellery. And everywhere artists are gravitating toward bits of cheap space as their studios and lofts in other parts of town are turned into condos.
PLACES TO HANG
* Naco for Mexican food and revolving installations created by emerging artists. Henhouse for booze and brunch. Chef Nathan Isberg migrated from more jaded Queen Street West to cook in an overhauled Portuguese tavern under the banner Atlantic Restaurant.
CAVEATS
* There is a downside to so much authenticity and that is the genuine poverty of some residents. Real estate values are likely to suffer from the railroad tracks running through the area and in a market downturn, edgy areas like this can more easily slide back into seediness.
HARBINGERS OF CHANGE
* Head down the first alley north of Dundas at night and you'll find the Port, which serves ice cream from the back entrance of Zoots Café. All over, people are finding quirky uses for improvised space.
* Bohemian parents order cupcakes with brown butter icing at She Takes the Cake.
MARKET VALUES
* Higgledy-piggledy semis can be had for $450,000 on side streets such as Florence and Gordon. Less common detached houses will fetch more than $500,000.
DANFORTH MOSAIC
A friendly mash-up of cultures forging a new identity
This is a stretch of Danforth where you can stroll along on a Saturday afternoon, marvelling at how peaceful, kid-friendly and unhurried the neighbourhood seems. Then you return to your car and find it blocked in by a couple of police cruisers.
It's like that on the length of high street between Greenwood and Main that is forging an identity as Danforth Mosaic.
It's more unpredictable than la-di-da Riverdale to the west and the more mono-cultural Beach to the south - and cheaper, too.
Robert Riley and Ruth Heathcote decided to open Wag on the Danforth across from East Lynn Park after watching it change from a scruffy patch where teenagers congregated to a lively meeting place for kids and dogs.
The park is a perfect example of the changes taking place in the neighbourhood, says Mr. Riley: "It was pretty dreary," he says of his early days there in the 1990s. "You wouldn't want to hang out there at night."
Now he knows the neighbourhood pooches - and some of the kids - by name.
"It's a huge family scene at the playground."
HIGH POINTS
Real diversity: It's exactly as the name suggests, this eastern stretch of the Danforth - a little Utopia of Ethiopian, Moroccan, Greek, Italian, Hakka, Mexican, Thai and Tunisian entrepreneurs. Institutions like the Only Cafe, Royal Beef and Celena's Bakery have loyal customers.
Ease of movement: Bicycles, cars, trucks - all circulate freely here. Compared with Greektown, you won't believe the lack of traffic chaos.
Sustainable living: Organic foods are available at East Lynn Park's farmer's market Thursday afternoons. On the Danforth there are shopfront meditation gurus.
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT:
Materialistic signifiers: One homeowner says the area has really improved in the more than five years he has been there, with lots of lesbian couples and families with young tots moving in. "I wish some of my neighbours would be a little more curb-appeal conscious," he admits. "And I'm still waiting for a Starbucks to open."
Foodie chic: People in the neighbourhood have to travel down to Queen St. when the occasion calls for lavish entertaining.
Schools: Solid enough, but not distinguished.
HARBINGERS OF CHANGE
* The Madina Mosque's towering minaret and geometric forms have brought new life to a previously drab streetscape.
* Nearby, the facade of the old Allenby Theatre has been preserved and now houses a Tim Horton's.
* The One in the Only Coffee House is as idiosyncratic as its beloved sister, the Only Cafe.
* The Sunset Grill has opened a location here.
MARKET VALUES
* This is one area where you can still buy a cute house for $459,000, live close to the subway, and maybe keep your car for driving out of town on the weekends. If your price bracket is closer to $659,000, well, you'll have your pick of well cared for detached homes.
THE JUNCTION
A former fringe 'hood, this west end triangle needs no re-branding
Anybody who meandered through the Junction Arts Festival a few weeks ago could see immediately that the people who live in this west-end triangle have a heartfelt connection to the 'hood. Some real estate agents will euphemistically call this Upper Bloor West Village, but when the Junction's own identity is so dynamic, why sink to this kind of re-branding?
Dundas St. West's merchants, photographers, antiques dealers and chefs are clearly invested in keeping the momentum going.
John Pasalis of Realosophy figures that the wicked prices in Bloor West Village and High Park will keep pushing people towards this former fringe.
HIGH POINTS
Housing stock: Elegant Victorian and Edwardians line the grander streets and they often come with a nice spread of land.
Antiques and collectibles: There are too many dealers to name them all, but Eclectic Revival Antique Lighting and Post and Beam Reclamation are worth a browse if you're refurbishing your Arts & Crafts bungalow.
Parks and recreation: High Park is a brisk stroll to the south and the West Toronto Railpath Park is an example of creative urban renewal.
LOW POINTS
Crime: Anti-gang activist Kenneth Mark was shot to death in front of a pizzeria in 2009. Police called Mr. Mark's murder a targeted hit in a generally safe area, but it brought attention to lingering social problems.
Heavy industry: The smokestacks and storage yards north of the tracks are disappearing, but much of the area is still a blight.
HARBINGERS OF CHANGE
* The purveyors of fair trade chocolate at Delight recently took over another shop front and opened Junction Fromagerie for Ontario artisanal cheese. The dog will drag you to Tailwaggers for organic dog cookies and the kids to Little Bird Fly for clothes and toys.
Market values
* A grand Queen Anne-style house with a turret on winding Laws St. might fetch $1-million - on the rare occasions they come on the market.
* A detached five-bedroom house on Maria St. is currently listed for $499,900. It will help if you like trains.
LAKESHORE VILLAGE
The Beach on theother side of town
Never heard of Lake Shore Village? Perhaps you knew it as the gritty, industrial town of New Toronto. In recent years the neighbourhood has marched toward respectability and now many see it as a more peaceful and affordable alternative to its cross-town rival, the Beach.
The "village" is the stretch of Lake Shore Boulevard West between 22nd Street and Dwight Avenue.
With its single-storey brick buildings and cheerful wooden lighthouse, the strip could easily stand in for a seaside town in the 1950s. That must be why film production trailers so often line the boulevard.
HIGH POINTS
Furthering your education: The 19th century Mimico Lunatic Asylum eventually became Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital and now it's a Humber College campus. (At Halloween they invite the neighbourhood for tours of the tunnels and haunted Victorian-era buildings).
Transportation: The TTC 501 Streetcar trundles the length of Queen Street, through the Humber Loop and then along Lake Shore Boulevard West all the way to Brown's Line. The GO Train whisks you between Mimico Station and Union Station in about 15 minutes. Drivers can cruise Lake Shore Boulevard to downtown in 20 minutes or so.
Parks: The Western Beaches line the shore nearby. Further west you'll find Colonel Samuel Smith Park, which boasts rocky beaches, quiet marshes and the first Wetlands-Wildlife Restoration Trail on the Great Lakes. In between, little slivers of green parkland at the foot of many streets give residents a route down to the water.
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT
Crime: Residential burglaries are fairly uncommon but there have been a couple of robberies on Lake Shore. Some tough characters roll out of the bars late at night.
Culture: Transplanted downtowners may suffer symptoms of withdrawal when they can't find the galleries, independent book shops and repertory film theatres they're used to. And you can't imagine the Eastern Beaches containing anything as rough as some of the drinking establishments here.
HARBINGERS OF CHANGE
* The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company plant employed the masses for decades and filled the air with a distinct tang. A few years ago it was razed and replaced with government-assisted housing. Now lots of decommissioned factories are giving way to condos and townhouses.
* Shopper's Drug Mart is here but mostly the area is devoid of chain stores and marquee coffee shops, which may be a curse or a blessing.
* Big Guy's Little Coffee Shop recently hosted an open-mike night of poetry readings, stories and music.
* Many local faves, such as Sweet Olenka's chocolate shop, have spiffed up their premises.
MARKET VALUES
* The industrial area spreading north from Lake Shore Boulevard squeezes the traditional residential real estate into a tight little pocket to the south. This scarcity of properties could push up values in years to come, says Realosophy president John Pasalis.
* Currently there's a three-bedroom house right on the lake (yes, right on the lake!) listed for $1.1-million. It needs work, but imagine sliding open the patio door and strolling under willow boughs to your private stretch of Lake Ontario shoreline. The waterfront here has no boardwalk to attract day trippers.
* The new townhouses on Lake Shore Boulevard change hands for about $299,000. On the side streets running north from the water, you can still buy a detached house for less than $600,000. Try getting that in the Beaches.

A Western style based on sophisticated simplicity

Author: Deck, Kelly

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/western-style-based-on-sophisticated-simplicity/docview/755908626/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: As a designer, it's exciting to live in a city where a gigantic talent like Ms. [Alda Pereira] is working. The Westernness evident in her design is, I think, something that will grow in influence. Why? Because in a world ever busier and more complex, the allure of simplicity and elemental connection can only deepen. More of what's essential, less of what isn't - and with room to breathe in the negative space. Congratulations, Alda Pereira.

I was a judge this year for the Western Living Magazine Awards in the category of interior design. The issue hit newsstands a month ago, and, in it, I joined esteemed designers Robert Ledingham and Paul Lavoie in reviewing an impressive shortlist of candidates with an eye to identifying this year's best.
Alda Pereira is that designer. Hardware is nothing new to her - the 40-something Portuguese transplant has won many awards since opening shop in 1988. And while her portfolio includes hotels and corporate offices, she made her name in the crazed Vancouver condo boom of the middle aughts. In what was rapidly becoming a cookie-cutter market, her design-forward approach challenged developers to raise the bar for small-space living.
Of the five categories on which we graded designers, one in particular may interest readers of this column: Westernness. What is it? Tricky question. Canadians have a hard time locating their national identity without vague references to hockey, socialized medicine, and not being American, and, it turns out, articulating a regional design ethic is just as slippery.
The editors of Western Living defined Westernness as "design that expresses living in the West, furthers a regional design aesthetic, and uses local materials or techniques." As a designer, that makes immediate sense, but I recognize it is - as a non-designer friend of mine said - a bit like defining "spicy" as "that which possesses spiciness."
Terminology aside, there's no doubt Alda Pereira deserves top marks as a defining Western designer. Here's why.
She uses elemental materials in a refined and modern way
The West was founded on extraction - of fish, minerals, and wood - and our lifestyle and aesthetics connect us to the landscape in a raw and relatively unprocessed way. In Western design of the past, this meant bringing timber (even trees) inside and using chunks of granite or river rock for fireplaces and architectural features. Today, the materials are the same, but the bent is toward greater refinement - the wood cut finer, the stone sliced and honed. Westernness is, at root, about truth to materials - the desire to appreciate a natural object for what it is and not overwork or disguise it.
This sophisticated simplicity is evident in Ms. Alda's design of a West Vancouver interior that came as part of her submission package. The interior finishes incorporate layers of grey stone, glass, and warm wood. On the main floor she used huge rectified tiles of polished limestone, and on the home's rectangular columns a chiselled granite ledge stone that adds ruggedness and texture to the space. The mood is refined, yes, but nothing feels labored or fussy.
She blurs the threshold between indoor and outdoor space A crucial tenet of Western design is, in my opinion, a desire to be immersed in the environment - not blocked off from it. Whether in glass towers reaching into the sky or cantilevered homes dangling over rocky expanses of coast, when we're indoors, we want to feel as much as possible like we're outdoors. For indications of this in design, look to elements - in colour, shape, light, and texture - that diminish the boundaries of the home, drawing the eye outside.
The raw structure of the West Vancouver home created the perfect opportunity for boundary-blurring, and Ms. Alda executed it elegantly. Not only do the chiseled stone columns pass through the home's envelope and join the exterior façade, the floor-to-ceiling glass allows the grey limestone floor to blend seamlessly with the concrete of the outdoor living spaces. And the wall colours and furnishings are a wash of dove grey and smoky blues, just like the West Coast sky. Beautiful.
Her designs avoid flourish
and embellishment
The European roots of eastern Canada have broadly influenced the architecture and interior design found there. It's common to find traditional homes, fancy details, and an apparent appreciation for finery. In the West, though, more evident is the instinct to pare down to the essentials. Here, an elegant informality takes precedence over complexity, ostentation, and reverence for tradition.
Every interior Ms. Alda included in her submission displayed exquisite furnishings and poignant contemporary artwork. The pieces were refined, certainly - with luxurious finishes and fine craft and materials. But none was ornate. The sofas are boxy and approachable. The chairs are substantial. And the character of the spaces, if it speaks of anything, speaks of careful editing - nothing extraneous, no clutter.
Unlike traditional homes, which often have too many small, leggy furnishings in different finishes and patterns, Ms. Alda's approach is a careful curation of form and art. She only strings together enough pieces to hold a space together, and, importantly, there's nothing superfluous in the gaps - negative space is as much a part of the design as the pieces themselves.
As a designer, it's exciting to live in a city where a gigantic talent like Ms. Alda is working. The Westernness evident in her design is, I think, something that will grow in influence. Why? Because in a world ever busier and more complex, the allure of simplicity and elemental connection can only deepen. More of what's essential, less of what isn't - and with room to breathe in the negative space. Congratulations, Alda Pereira.

Abstract: "On a 25-foot lot, this is probably the biggest [house] you can fit," Mr. [Boris Kholodov] says. "It's important that you have a layout that makes the best use of the space, and in this case, that was certainly done."

The action: This 2,500-square-foot residence is smaller than many homes on neighbouring lots more than triple its width, but the craftsmanship was big-budget, says agent Boris Kholodov. "It has all the high quality finishes that you would expect in a newly constructed home these days," he says of the two-year-old house.
For instance, hardwood floors, wainscoting and Juliet balconies are some of the luxuries of this yellow brick Georgian, which was efficiently designed by local architect Peter Higgins.
What they got: The main floor features a foyer, powder room and open living and dining rooms, along with a combined kitchen and family room with an island, upscale appliances, a gas fireplace and double doors to the patio and double garage.
* All three bedrooms on the second floor have access to one of two bathrooms, and two have walk-in closets. The third floor bedroom contains a private bathroom and a walk-in closet.
The agent's take: "On a 25-foot lot, this is probably the biggest [house] you can fit," Mr. Kholodov says. "It's important that you have a layout that makes the best use of the space, and in this case, that was certainly done."

Little shop of wonders

Author: John Bentley Mays

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/little-shop-wonders/docview/755908207/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: There are rooms with doors in this small area, to afford some useful psychological separation for the two adults and two small children who occupy it. The living room on the second level of the building is really a refuge from the beating heart of this project, which is the bright, sociable kitchen. The design of fixtures in this central room, as you might imagine, is by [Antje Bulthaup]. Featured here is the company's flagship b3 line.

Corner stores dot the otherwise residential streetscapes of many old neighbourhoods across downtown Toronto. In their day, these little shoe repair places, greengrocers, candy stores and such lent coherence to local communities - everybody on a given street shopped there - and they balanced the concentration of retail activity along important avenues.
This original culture of the corner store has largely disappeared in Hogtown, but the recent transformations of this building type have certainly not been all bad. Some new owners have turned whole storefronts, including the former retail space on the ground floor, into homes. Others, however, have kept alive the spirit of the corner store by leaving the apartment that customarily occupied the second and third floors for residential use, and leasing the ground floor to a café owner or restaurateur, or to some other community-minded entrepreneur.
A good example of the latter kind of architectural transfiguration can be found on a shady corner of Sorauren Avenue, not far north of Queen Street West. Constructed in 1928, the small, sturdy three-storey brick building housed a bakery for many years, then served as a beauty salon for several decades. It changed hands most recently in 2007. The new owners decided early on that they would live on the top two storeys, and let out the ground floor to a suitable tenant.
But their scheme was frustrated, most of all, by the sorry condition of the building they had bought. The apartment was cramped and dark, and the retail level had scarcely been touched since the building's career as a bakery. The electrical and plumbing systems were in disrepair because of their great age.
Major surgery was called for, so the couple turned over the job to the able Toronto designer Antje Bulthaup. (Trained in architecture in Europe, the German-born businesswoman is best known in Toronto as the manager and co-owner of the top-end Bulthaup kitchen showroom on King Street East.)
Ms. Bulthaup's $300,000 prescription for the building involved stripping it back to its bare-bones brick shell, and starting again from almost zero. Flour chutes that formerly serviced the bakery were shut. A large window on the Sorauren Street façade, facing west, was installed, and several other new windows opened up the once-gloomy interior to light and fresh air. An expansive glass-fronted, copper-clad dormer, intended to catch the morning sunshine, was added to the third storey, effectively pushing out the space available in a bedroom.
But Ms. Bulthaup's renovation of the interior was the most sweeping, thoroughgoing aspect of her plan. Hewing to the minimalist, highly functional aesthetic of her family's famous kitchen designs, she made every inch of floor and wall space available for some practical use. She demolished the walls that made the apartment a tight squeeze and painted every surface in stark white, while stopping short of doing a classic modernist open-plan arrangement of the space.
There are rooms with doors in this small area, to afford some useful psychological separation for the two adults and two small children who occupy it. The living room on the second level of the building is really a refuge from the beating heart of this project, which is the bright, sociable kitchen. The design of fixtures in this central room, as you might imagine, is by Bulthaup. Featured here is the company's flagship b3 line. It's the Mercedes-Benz option in terms of price, but it comes with Bulthaup's usual panoply of convenient, ergonomically designed cabinets, drawers and shelves. The oven, dishwasher and fridge are by European manufacturers, who produce appliances somewhat smaller than their North American counterparts - introduced into this project to save precious space.
Like the upper levels, the ground floor and fully outfitted basement are spartan, but inviting. Their bare, stringent demeanour is certainly suitable for the current tenant, a yoga instructor who holds her sessions there.
As far as corner-store culture goes, a yoga studio sounds just about right for this time in the life of downtown Toronto. Yoga is not as nuts-and-bolts as the baking and hair-curling that used to go on in this place, but neither is the area the working-class neighbourhood it once was. Its graceful Gothic family homes, packed tight along the street, have been taken over by information workers who might appreciate the peace and inner balance that yoga promises, quite as much as older generations enjoyed fresh bread and a pep-up of the old hairdo. The venerable tradition of the corner storefront is alive on Sorauren Avenue, and that's something Torontonians can be happy about.

Signposts of a new Toronto cool

Author: Leblanc, Dave

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/signposts-new-toronto-cool/docview/755908199/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "I take notes, I do sketches, then I go to the library to look up some history," says the bright-eyed, 60-something artist, a self-confessed "visual learner." When folks purchase a print, she provides a "cheat sheet" that reveals the identity of buildings and the inspiration for the text. Ms. [Lynn Golding]'s mandalas are currently on display at El Barrio restaurant in Kensington Market.

Just as one cannot bestow a nickname upon oneself and expect it to stick, a city cannot declare itself cool. Cool is a collective thing built by many hands, often working in isolation from one another.
It's my opinion that Toronto has been cool for a long time. Naysayers that hold Montreal up as the Capital of Cool until Toronto trumped it some time in the 1980s have no memory of Painters 11, the beatniks of Gerrard Street Village, Yorkville, Moses Znaimer, SCTV or the original CFNY.
Today, Toronto is cooler than ever, and much of its cool currency lies in what artists and graphic designers have discovered: it has more layers than an onion. Reflected in every neighbourhood and its signage is an Anglo core with a dozen or more layers applied by waves of immigration; John Graves Simcoe's rigid street grid explodes into unexpected parks or is stymied by meandering ravines; and old industrial lands are breeding grounds for new types of living.
In 2005, I wrote about David Vereschagin's love of the original TTC typeface and his quest to preserve it by releasing a font package. The good folks at Spacing magazine continue to elevate everyday urban infrastructure into aesthetic objects worthy of our attention. Artists paint portraits of our neighbourhoods (some covered here in August, 2009), and Rob Croxford uses his brush to compare and contrast the urban jungle with the ever-distant farm fields of the 905. Photo-bloggers continue to document our layers, from the demise of the Canary Restaurant to our abandoned factories and power plants.
And I keep finding more.
A novel way to represent the city's layers is with a mandala. Lynn Golding has been painting her "neighbourhood mandalas" since first attempting to organize the chaotic nature of Kensington Market with the ancient shape in 2007. At centre is a Victorian home, then, surrounding it, a jumble of images that are "tattooish and graffitish and so on," says Ms. Golding, with a nod to beloved local businesses such as the used clothing shops, bakeries and fish markets.
After positive response, Ms. Golding decided to continue. To date, she has painted 25 mandalas of Toronto neighbourhoods, from tony Rosedale and Deer Park to Leslieville and Leaside. Many include representations of local architecture and small swirls of print containing snippets of neighbourhood history. Alongside images of Kay Gardner Beltline Park and the historic Balmoral Street fire station in the Deer Park mandala is text that reads: "1837 Heath family purchased 40 acres of northwest corner and named it Deer Park. 1846 was subdivided and sold off by 1874. Annexed 1908." Leaside's mandala celebrates its early history as an aviation hub.
"I take notes, I do sketches, then I go to the library to look up some history," says the bright-eyed, 60-something artist, a self-confessed "visual learner." When folks purchase a print, she provides a "cheat sheet" that reveals the identity of buildings and the inspiration for the text. Ms. Golding's mandalas are currently on display at El Barrio restaurant in Kensington Market.
Equally playful but much more rigid is the Toronto neighbourhood map by Ork Posters. Three years ago, Chicago designer Jenny Beorkrem came up with the idea after a failed search for a piece of Chicago-inspired art. After tackling 10 other U.S. cities, she divided up Toronto's familiar trapezoid shape into 178 neighbourhoods; in order to fit neighbourhood names into the rather awkward shapes, letters were rotated, expanded or shrunk, which gives the effect of an optometrist's chart seen in a funhouse mirror.
"The design is clever, clean and modern," says Ian Gillies, owner of Leslieville's Telegramme Prints, who adds that the poster has been "one of the top two or three" sellers since it was brought in last month.. "[T]his poster is a party, all about neighbours and neighbourhoods. It brings all of us together in one diced-up salad without being political or caught up in a debate."
TTC fetishists can find further satisfaction with the Toronto Transit Series by Walloper. Easy-to-apply vinyl letters representing every subway station (as well as a few way-finding phrases such as "Southbound" or "Next Station St. George") are available as wall decals. Not only are these cool, they're perfect for that second bathroom that's crying out for some character.
With all this cool cachet, it's time for a new nickname for Toronto. Since Hogtown and Muddy York are so last century, and the T-Dot is so last decade, what will it be?

Full text: It's bread and circuses at the local condo sales office as developers vie for buyers' attentions
Beset by stiff competition and uncertain buyers, condo builders are turning more and more to theatrics to attract customers and keep them interested as their buildings rise out of the ground.
By day, their sales centres display floor plans, miniature buildings and model suites for visitors to browse. But by night, these showrooms are being transformed into circus tents with roaming buskers or galleries of fine art, fashion and race cars, or private dining rooms catered by celebrity chefs.
"Given this hyper-competitive condo market, developers are looking at ways to distinguish their projects and expand their communications approach beyond traditional advertising, social media and earned editorial," says Danny Roth, whose company, Brandon Communications Inc., helped three builders throw parties this week.
"As a result, we have been increasingly called upon to work with clients to help them create events - opportunities to connect with their consumers - that drive awareness and understanding of a new condo's unique message and brand positioning."
Vicki Griffiths, who is a principal of Vicbar Marketing, also has an increasing number of builders asking for assistance organizing events throughout the year.
"If a project is having a tough time selling, then they're going to turn to events to figure out how to get people in here," she says.
Those who accomplish that feat understand the marketing power behind public praise of a well-manufactured soiree.
"If you go back to what we did at DNA 1 and 2, our whole philosophy was word-of-mouth marketing," says Riz Dhanji, who is the vice-president of sales and marketing for Canderel Stoneridge.
"We want it to be a talking point between them, their friends, their co-workers and their family."
For a preview event held yesterdayfor the project's third and final phase, the builder created a facsimile of DNA-3's rooftop terrace inside its 7,000-square-foot sales office, complete with sand, cabanas and daybeds, plus models in bathing suites.
"We want to show people what DNA is about and why it's so different," says Mr. Dhanji. "We're really going to showcase the lifestyle of living at DNA."
Guests were also encouraged to use a mini studio to "express their DNA" and take home a personalized souvenir. "They'll be able to have an ad done of themselves with their own DNA and take that home with them and show their friends," Mr. Dhanji explains.
Putting together a fun and entertaining event can be easy, but an effective one involves a great deal of strategic planning to successfully attract a project's target audience.
Earlier this week, Mr. Roth organized an event called "Haute at the Republic" to draw attention to Tridel's mid-town condo tower Republic, featuring a stylishly designed new model suite with furnishings from the nearby Art Shoppe; cuisine courtesy of celebrity chef Mark McEwan and North 44; and couture represented by models dressed in gowns by Yorkville boutique Hugo Nicholson.
"They're trying to draw attention to a new model suite for their Signature Collection, which are their bigger, more expensive units," says Mr. Roth, who notes that prices start at $1-million. "So, you had to do something upscale, something that had style and cachet."
Forming partnerships with restaurants and shops not only cross-promotes local attractions, but also illustrates that a priceless experience is possible by being resourceful.
"You could spend $100,000 or do to it for $5,000," says Ms. Griffiths. "Sometimes you need to go big and other times you don't."
During the development of Festival Tower, the film-inspired condominium completed above the Toronto International Film Festival headquarters, Daniels Corp. threw annual events to coincide with the excitement surrounding the festivities in September.
At last year's party, guests were given security passes and walked the red carpet lined with paparazzi. They could also pose for professional photographers in vignettes from Ghostbusters , Saturday Night Fever and The Wizard of Oz , complete with costumes, props and life-size character cutouts.
"There were lineups for these things," says Rhoda Eisenstadt, who is a partner at the Communications Group Inc., which has handled about 180 events for developers like Daniels in the past year.
"We try to do something that's very memorable and fun, and often, there's also a picture that you could take away."
On Wednesday, Graywood Developments, gave potential buyers at the Residences at Ritz-Carlton a taste of the finest vintages and delicacies to be served at the five-star hotel below the luxury residences.
"Chef tastings are always very popular," says Ms. Eisenstadt.
"[These events] can cost substantially less than an ad in The Globe and Mail, or substantially more, depending on how many people are invited and what's involved."
"Our clients spend hundreds of thousands - upwards of $1-million - on their sales centres because when you ask someone to make one of the most important decisions of their lives ... they want to come in and get an experience," says Mr. Roth.
At the sales centre for River City, a master-planned community on the former West Don Lands, Urban Capital will host three public forums with high-profile speakers to engage purchasers and local residents.
Earlier this week, former Ontario premier and 2015 Pan Am Games bid chairman David Peterson and Vancouver 2010 Olympic Village architect Stuart Lyon led the first discussion on the impact of major sports events on residential communities.
In suburban neighbourhoods, events are often geared to strengthening the bond between builders and buyers.
Halminen Homes and more than 100 volunteer tradesmen built a 2,300-square-foot house in five days in the low-rise community Courtice Homestead to raise funds for the new critical care unit at Lakeridge Health Bowmanville.
"You could actually stand there and watch this house being erected before your very eyes," says Ms. Griffiths, who spread news of the achievement to the press in August. "It engages new purchasers, the community and the media."
At the Traditions sales office in Milton, Heathwood Homes regularly organizes events such as yoga classes and movie nights for neighbours to meet and socialize.
"This shows a real commitment to establishing a sense of community, which is so important in low-rise building," says Ms. Eisenstadt.
"This past summer and the summer before, they had Camp Heathwood up there, which was open to all the children of the residents," says Ms. Eisenstadt. "It was a two-week day camp ... with tons of activities."
In other cases, the developers don't have to do any extra work to bring in a new crowd.
During the Toronto International Film Festival, the luxurious sales office for Pears on the Avenue in Yorkville was used by Toro magazine to host a series of exclusive events, from a VIP lounge to a gallery space for the New York Times Canadian Photo Archive exhibit curated by Caitlin Cronenberg.
"People who might not have ordinarily come into the sales office are exposed to the project," says Ms. Eisenstadt. "You may not want to buy, but you may have a friend looking."
In 2002, Canderel Stoneridge went so far as to construct a 2,000-square-foot event space next door to its DNA sales office with everything from a bar to audio/visual equipment.
"We'd give this out to event marketers and allow them to use the space at no charge as long as they brought in the clientele and the events that fit our demographic," says Mr. Dhanji.
The venue has housed Indy cars and fashion designers, as well as a South Asian home show the builder co-hosted with social networking website MyBindi.com. "That brought in a different demographic of people and that really worked out well for us," says Mr. Dhanji.

Full text: University business parks provide fertile ground for startups, which in turn help keep academic programs up to date
When Terry Stepien, president of Sybase iAnywhere, moved the firm to the University of Waterloo's Research and Technology Park as one of its first tenants in 2005, he was merely hoping for better access to the school's legions of software developers.
Unbeknownst to Mr. Stepien, moving the database management software firm, a subsidiary of Sybase Inc., to the 120-acre park would provide a plethora of business benefits beyond those he'd envisioned - namely, access to an entire community of like-minded tech companies.
"The real estate has to be there, you have to have that in place, but it's only one of about a dozen ingredients you have to have to make one of these parks work," Mr. Stepien says.
As the demand for skilled workers in knowledge-based industries grows, high-tech firms such as Sybase are being joined by scores of other leading Canadian and international companies clamouring for space on any of the 25 university campus-based or affiliated research parks across the country.
Universities, on the other hand, are looking for ways to remain sustainable by producing relevant research and workers trained to meet industry's needs.
To the chagrin of some academic purists, these research parks blur the lines separating academia from corporate Canada. Optimists say the parks provide a way for the two sides to share ideas and flourish.
Either way, they offer a unique atmosphere for business. As the saying goes, once you've seen one research park, you've seen one - each has its own features.
Parks do, however, share some traits. They are typically funded in part by federal, provincial and local governments, along with the private sector. Buildings are usually built and operated by the universities, or, as in the University of Waterloo's case, by developers who negotiate long-term land leases with the school.
In almost every instance, universities pick the tenants to ensure an ideal mix - often a combination of large and smaller firms who stay for as little as a year or, as in Sybase's case, half a decade or more. They are likely to be focused on research and development with a handful of complementary service providers such as law firms thrown in the mix.
The 10-building University of Waterloo park hosts more than 50 companies including BlackBerry maker Research In Motion, search-engine behemoth Google and enterprise content management software-maker Open Text Corp., along with about 25 startups.
Many of the buildings have been built to reflect the innovative and dynamic nature of their occupants, says Laird Robertson, a principal at Toronto-based Robertson Simmons Architects.
The Robertson Simmons-designed Accelerator Centre, for example, was decorated with exposed and unfinished elements to convey the idea of change and constant innovation. Movable partitions allow suites to be configured as tenants change or grow.
But the question remains: Why put a business on university-owned land when equivalent space exists elsewhere?
The answer is the availability of talent.
"I listen to C-level executives from Canada and the U.S. explain what their pain is, and every meeting is the same," says Carol Stewart, business development manager for the University of Waterloo Research and Technology Park, and president of the Canadian Association of University Research Parks. "It's about finding talent," she adds of the tech and engineering all-stars these tenants so desperately seek.
Tenants at parks such as Waterloo's can easily tap the school's world-renowned co-op program, plucking students out of university to save recruiting costs.
"About 95 per cent of our development team in Waterloo are University of Waterloo graduates," Mr. Stepien says of the roughly 120 co-op students accepted by his 350-person firm each year.
Then there's access to cutting-edge research. Sybase's staffers regularly attend university-programmed seminars and work with researchers from the school.
Another benefit lies in the very community that a research park creates and nurtures. Mr. Stepien points out that with RIM and Open Text on Sybase's doorstep, new business opportunities are constantly emerging.
For Kurtis McBride, the University of Waterloo park helped kick-start his traffic data software firm, Miovision Technologies Inc., in 2006.
Mr. McBride and his two engineering partners rented space and tapped free seminars at the Accelerator Centre, which provides training on everything from human resources to financial management.
The company left the park for a larger location in nearby Kitchener in 2008, but Mr. McBride has only good things to say about the experience.
"Our sales are up about 2,400 per cent since we left, and I'd definitely say the business structures we started setting up when we were in that building were largely to credit for that."
For developers, building in such parks has both risks and benefits. While the university retains control of the land and tenant mix, developers enjoy favourable long-term lease agreements and can build on land without worrying about costly infrastructure development.
Skeptical developers need only take note of the high occupancy rates at his park and others across the country for evidence of their potential, explains Dale Gann, president of the University of Victoria's Vancouver Island Technology Park.
"The reason why developers would consider working with a park that's run by a university is that we have the power of place, this common community of like-minded individuals co-located on a physical asset that's a very advantageous space for companies and their people," he explains. "Like building universities was in the past, this is the next part of the continuum. I definitely see more of this trend in the future."
Although the unsubsidized rents at the University of Waterloo's park start at market rates of $18 to $20 a square foot, Ms. Stewart estimates that the 120-acre space - which will cap out at 15 buildings and 1.7 million square feet for up to 10,000 people when phase one of the project is completed over the next few years - will generate about $2-million in annual revenue for the university.
While the rental income is meagre compared with that generated by some commercial developments, she says the park's success will be judged on its ability to help further the university's status as one of North America's leading research and development hubs.
"This is an extension of what the university's been doing for the past 50 years, so this is a natural for us," she says. "We don't see this is a money maker, but can it contribute to the university's long-term sustainability? I think so. It's all about relationships."
And if Mr. Stepien is right, the nurturing of those relationships will only grow as Canada continues to shift to a knowledge-based economy.
"If you can get that focus and that collaboration going between the university and industry, it's good for all parties involved, but it's a challenge to do it," he says.
"Waterloo had that culture of working with industry in place, allowing the park to flourish much faster because there wasn't as big a gap between what industry was thinking and what the university was doing."

Full text: Investors' attention has long been focused on the mega-cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. But it is the second-tier urban areas such as Hangzhou that are powering the country's next wave of economic expansion. Andy Hoffman reports
Standing outside the freshly built "MixC" mall, retail executive Janet Qian points skyward to one of more than a dozen condominium towers sprouting in a sparsely populated section of this thriving metropolis on China's eastern coast.
"Some people will have views of the river and others will wake up each morning and see Louis Vuitton," she says, nodding toward the French fashion house's latest, and as yet unopened, retail location in China. The LV store serves as a velvet tent peg holding down a rear corner of the high-end shopping centre, which boasts a two-storey Imax cinema and an Olympic-sized ice skating rink.
In China, the boom that has spawned the well-known mega-cities of Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen is on the move. As the world's second-largest economy enters its next phase of growth, the so-called second-tier cities are expected to do the bulk of the heavy lifting.
Dubbed the "Long Tail" of the Chinese dragon, these mushrooming metropolises pack astounding heft. While a new skyscraper seems to bloom in Shanghai every other month, scores of other towers are popping up just as fast in places most Westerners never consider.
Including Hong Kong and Taiwan, there are already 60 Chinese cities with populations greater than one million.
By 2025, according to consulting firm McKinsey & Co., there will be more than 220 cities with more than a million people each.
In North America, investors worry about the possibility that Chinese growth might slow, bringing with it lower demand for commodities and other goods, but boom towns like Shijiazhuang, Baotou and Zibo provide evidence that a vast reservoir of opportunity remains to be tapped. These second- and third-tier cities will drive demand for raw materials from commodity-rich countries like Canada as China's expanding municipalities erect new buildings and build more bridges and railways.
Global retailers are already rushing to capitalize on the new affluence on display in China's emerging urban centres. It was, after all, the consumption habits of residents in scores of second- and third-tier cities with names like Kunming and Chongqing that pushed China to become the world's largest auto market this year.
With growing prosperity, though, comes anxieties about the corrosive effect of disparities in wealth. The runaway real estate markets that have elicited so much hand-wringing from Chinese government officials are not confined to Shanghai and Beijing. Potential real estate price bubbles are also forming in much smaller, lesser-known locales.
Take Hangzhou. With 6.7 million people, the Hangzhou district is already larger than Boston, Madrid, Sydney or Toronto. Its population outnumbers Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba - combined.
"I can't afford an apartment," laments taxi driver Wu Liang Liang, who says the cheapest flat in Hangzhou now costs at least 200,000 Chinese yuan ($31,000). "If I go back to my hometown, I could create a valley with that much money."
Rife with social challenges and economic opportunity, second-tier cities like Hangzhou will define China's future. But for foreign companies looking to break into the Chinese market, these lesser-known urban centres already stand out as some of the country's most attractive markets.
'More purchasing power'
When Intel broke ground on its first major manufacturing plant in China in 2007, it was in Dalian, a second-tier city in Liaoning province. The microchip behemoth's decision to locate there is just one indicator of how investment patterns are shifting in China.
For three decades, four mega-cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen - spearheaded the country's remarkable economic progress and attracted the bulk of foreign dollars. In the first half of this year, these first-tier cities continued to perform, expanding their local economies by an annualized average of 12 per cent.
Their double-digit growth, though, seems tame in comparison to the breakneck pace of activity in provincial capitals such as Changchun, Hefei and Yinchuan. Gross domestic product growth in these second-tier cities averaged 18.5 per cent during the same period. Rich in resources and with a more stable labour force than China's mega-cities, smaller municipalities like these have been the major beneficiaries of China's $585-billion (U.S.) stimulus package, designed to spur infrastructure building and economic development.
In Hangzhou, stimulus projects have widened many of the city's largest streets and are helping build a metro system, with two lines slated to be completed by next year. The new infrastructure is expected to stimulate economic activity and consumer demand.
Major retailers and manufacturers are taking notice and many are shaping their growth strategies around these smaller but fast-growing urban areas.
Ms. Qian is a merchandising manager for Central Department Store Ltd., a retail conglomerate from Thailand that is using China's second-tier cities as the launch pad for its expansion into the massive Chinese market. The company just opened its first department store in China, the anchor tenant for the MixC mall in Hangzhou. Central is now planning on building more stores in cities like the steel-producing hub of Wuhan, and in Shenyang, an aerospace manufacturing centre. It hopes to add between 30 and 40 locations over the next decade in China's second- and third-tier cities.
"There is more money to be made in the second-tier market," Ms. Qian explains. "The second-tier cities have more purchasing power. The terms are all better as well, such as leasing costs and manpower."
The Chinese expansion plans of some of the world's biggest retail names and service industries are also focused on second- and third-tier cities. Last month, Asia's largest luxury hotel group, Shangri-La Hotel, unveiled a strategy to open 10 hotels over the next two years, mainly in second-tier cities such as Yangzhou, Chongqing, Lhasa and Changzhou. Shangri-La is focusing on these locations because of their "great potential," Zhu Kent, the company's head of sales and marketing, told a Chinese publication.
Nike Inc. and adidas AG are also targeting smaller cities for their next phase of retail locations in China. "We are planning to introduce low-priced products in the second-tier, third-tier and even fourth-tier cities in China to appeal to more Chinese consumers," Charlie Denson, Nike Brand's president, said on a recent conference call.
Swedish furniture giant IKEA already has eight stores in China and is planning to build four more over the next two years. It says a store in the second-tier city of Chengdu posted revenue growth of 135 per cent last year, the best sales increase among the company's 300 stores around the world.
"That indicates the huge potential in China's tier-two cities and provides us confidence to go further to tier-three cities," Gillian Drakeford, IKEA China's retail president, told China's People's Daily.
And it's not just middle-market brands that are turning to China's smaller cities. In addition to its new location in Hangzhou, luxury goods maker Louis Vuitton has opened stores this year in the second-tier cities of Xian, Xiamen and Tianjin.
Ms. Qian of Central Department Stores says the appeal of China's second-tier cities like Hangzhou is obvious. Buoyed by the area's rich factories and resources, Hangzhou boasts the eighth-highest per capita GDP in China, and the sixth-highest retail sales and disposable income levels. "We expect these second-tier cities to keep growing," she says.
Real estate speculation
The continued growth of second-tier cities is vital to China's future, according to economists. The major coastal cities of Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou now boast productivity levels that could soon rival the world's highest. Productivity in those cities is unlikely to keep increasing at the same rapid pace as it has done in the past. For China to continue growing, the baton must be passed to cities in the interior, where productivity is much lower.
China's government has embarked on a program to encourage development in the country's still rural western region. It has also vowed to relax its hukou registration system of residency permits, allowing workers from more backward regions to migrate to productive areas and still receive medical care and other social services.
The hope is that such efforts will not only boost productivity, but also spread prosperity more widely through the country. "The success of programs that intend to reverse China's rising income inequality is critical if China is to sustain its rapid growth of GDP and living standards," writes Gary Jefferson, a professor of economics at Brandeis University in Boston.
Purchasing power is already migrating beyond the coastal regions. Coal-rich Inner Mongolia, for example, posted the strongest per capita retail sales growth in 2008 among Chinese provinces. Retail sales increased 23.9 per cent, topping Beijing's 23.1 per cent rise.
Real estate speculators are also shifting their attention to second-tier cities. In downtown Shanghai, Song Hui Yong sighs wearily as he lays out the impact of the government's policy initiatives to cool the real estate market in China's mega-cities and the surprise effect they've had on smaller centres.
The director of property developer and reseller Centaline China says sales of second-hand apartments in Shanghai have plunged by 70 per cent since the government introduced policies that boosted down payment levels and imposed a sales tax on properties sold within two years of purchase. Prices are starting to fall too, dropping from an average of 26,000 yuan per square metre to 19,000 yuan.
Mr. Song figures there are 6.5 million square metres of new apartment space sitting empty in Shanghai right now, as owners hope to wait out the slump. Another 138,000 second-hand apartment units are unoccupied, he says.
So where have all the buyers from Shanghai's real estate market gone? Mr. Song believes that some of the speculative money has shifted to second-tier cities such as Xian and Wuhan where local enforcement of the government policies has been more lax.
"I am very worried about the enforcement of the policies in second-tier cities," he says. "There is certainly a strong possibility that the speculators have gone to the second-tier cities."
Xuzhou, a dusty mining and steel city that sits halfway between Beijing and Shanghai, is just one of China's unlikely boom towns. The city's new prosperity surprises even the locals.
A cab driver who gave only his surname Li pointed out the greening and beautification projects designed to transform Xuzhou's image as a dirty industry town. In the centre of the city, which is home to about two million urban residents, he drives past the man-made lake built to rival Hangzhou's more famous (and natural) West Lake.
Mr. Li says the value of his apartment in Xuzhou increased to 8,000 yuan per square metre from 5,000 after the city built new bridges, roads and new businesses moved here. "This is the best city in China," he beams.
Many residents of China's smaller cities are feeling the same way as they watch their local economies bloom. Even as the mega-cities and their property markets slow down, China's second-, third- and fourth-tier cities are picking up the slack, contends Celia Wang, an analyst with research firm Shanghai Metals Market.
China's rush to urbanization is far from over, she says. And she has a bit of advice for observers concerned about the country's growth prospects. "You don't need to worry so much," Ms. Wang says. "Chinese economic development is on an upward spiral that will last for 20 or 30 years."

Return to the man cave

Author: Raymaker, Derek

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/return-man-cave/docview/751136224/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Mr. Field is prompt, skilled and good at explaining his understanding of the project and what he intends to do. He works alone, and likes it that way after many bad experiences with unreliable apprentices. I've helped him carry in big objects, but that's about it. If he needs to drywall the ceiling, he'll construct a makeshift brace out of two-by-fours to keep one end in place while he screws in the other end. Much cheaper than a $20-an-hour helper.

Full text: As single guy Derek Raymaker's reno creeps along, painful decisions keep the process moving. Part two of a three-part series
We are now three months into the three-headed beast known as the man-cave project. It was supposed to take 2 ½ months, and we are still deep in dust, disruption, and decisions, decisions, decisions.
The good news is that my contractor, Douglas Field, has broken the back of the project and that it is generally taking shape the way I had hoped and instructed. The delays flowed from the rickety and outdated quirks in a 91-year-old, 2½-storey in Roncesvalles Village.
Other delays have been caused by my own making, such as my great difficulty in choosing tiles for the kitchen floor.
The not-so-good (though not necessarily bad) news is that now that the holes are in the wall, it is gut-check time. Actually, that time has long since passed. I'm increasingly anxious about whether my choices - design, fixtures, colours - will pan out in the end.
I am told by people who have been through a major renovation that this is quite normal. But it is quite unlike me.
The project now has a daily routine to it. Mr. Field arrives at 7:55 a.m. on the button every morning. At this point, I am finishing up my second coffee from my makeshift kitchen in a spare bedroom. We have a chat about what's been done, what needs to be done, what decisions are pending on my end, and what may be causing him problems or delays. Sometimes these chats are pretty rushed before I have to schlep off to work at 8:15 a.m. This has caused a couple of misunderstandings, but nothing serious.
Mr. Field is prompt, skilled and good at explaining his understanding of the project and what he intends to do. He works alone, and likes it that way after many bad experiences with unreliable apprentices. I've helped him carry in big objects, but that's about it. If he needs to drywall the ceiling, he'll construct a makeshift brace out of two-by-fours to keep one end in place while he screws in the other end. Much cheaper than a $20-an-hour helper.
After two decades in the business, Mr. Field is also set in his ways and there are some things he won't even consider, even if you have your mind set on it. One of those no-go zones is small tiles in the bathroom and kitchen. Too much grout gets used, he says, meaning it breaks down faster and makes a hash of the whole area in no time. Luckily, small tiles weren't in the cards on this project anyway, but the logic of his position made sense.
As I have been known to be a crusty old bear who is also set in his ways, I admired this at first. But it did lead to some lively discussions.
One such issue was sound-proof insulation. I asked to have it installed in the ceiling of the basement at the outset, thinking this was obvious enough considering its planned function as a music space. So I was somewhat peeved to see the ceiling drywall going up without the insulation. There was a minor disagreement over whether the insulation was confirmed in the original estimate, but Mr. Field relented and off we went to Home Depot to purchase some soundproof insulation.
The man cave - the basement flex space to serve mostly as a music-rehearsal space and general guy clubhouse - was first on the docket, and everything went smoothly. There was nothing complex about it, just insulating, drywalling, new windows, painting and walling in the furnace and water heater. The forced-air bulkhead was already pushed off to one side of the room.
The big decision here was flooring. I went with a laminate faux-wood plank flooring recycled from sawdust available at Home Depot under the brand name Revolution ($400 for about 300 square feet). It looks and feels warm and soothing, and I was pleased with the quality of the product considering it was on the low end of wide price range for such things.
The challenge in pulling off an aesthetically pleasing man cave will come after the actual renovation. There will be much anguish over purchasing area rugs and furnishings making it suitably manly, while also devising storage systems that will accommodate bulky drum kits and guitar amplifiers to keep it relatively tidy.
In the northwest corner of the basement, the bathroom is taking shape. I wanted to install ceramic tile flooring to match the rustic ones going up on the wall, but due to the slope of the concrete floor and my limited budget, I was told that they would crack in no time. And so the first real compromise is made: laminate square tiles. It will take some getting used to.
The bathroom's main fixtures were all purchased by myself, with some consultation with Mr. Field, and have turned out to be pleasing and functional: a Crane European-style low-flow toilet from Home Depot ($200), and an Aciflex frameless-glass corner shower kit from Rona ($700).
I impulsively purchased a Crane basin sink on a stylish dark-wood pedestal for the bathroom from my local Home Hardware on Roncesvalles Avenue for $395 - more than I was planning on spending. They were having a tough time due to road construction, so I thought I'd do my bit for the neighbourhood hardware store. It's definitely the most stylish piece in the entire basement, and I was quite proud of myself when my girlfriend endorsed the purchase.
For the most part, the basement is taking shape with few setbacks. Plumbing has passed muster, and no new drainage needs to be installed.
The big drama is occurring in the kitchen. Half the wall has been torn down to open it to the dining room across a proposed breakfast counter. This is where my nerve and Mr. Field's patience are tested. There is 91 years' worth of plaster over plaster to tear away, and it is a nightmare of dust that coats every flat surface of the house, no matter how much we try to contain it.
We are headed into the homestretch. Surprisingly to me, the kitchen will overtake the basement man-cave as the centrepiece of the project, producing more hand-wringing and design challenges than I anticipated.

Full text:   Nicolas Sarkozy's move against the Roma is unworthy of France - but it's not unprecedented, and it's very much a sign of the times, write Robert Zaretsky and Olivia Miljanic
On both sides of the Atlantic, commentators and activists have reacted with growing fury to the French government's expulsion of hundreds of Roma, or Gypsies, to Bulgaria and Romania. Many critics liken these expulsions - as well as the threat to strip lawbreakers of their French citizenship - to the deportations of Jews organized by France's Vichy regime during the Second World War.
It's hard to know what is more outrageous: the policies practised by President Nicolas Sarkozy or the analogies proffered by his critics. Vichy has no monopoly on xenophobic reflexes and exclusionary policies in the history of modern France. Over the 20th century, it was the French Republic that laid the administrative and legal foundations for official discrimination against the Roma.
As in real estate, so in history: Location - in this case, temporal location - counts for a great deal. In 1912, the French republican government passed a battery of laws ostensibly aimed at vagrancy. Yet, the government revealed its hand when it created an identity card that specifically targeted Gypsies. While the French law did not specify "Gypsies," instead using the term "nomads," the instructions to local officials lent themselves to racial identification. (This has recently been repeated in Arizona's proposed anti-immigrant law.)
The identity cards allowed French authorities to track the movements of Gypsies during the First World War, but they were rarely interned in camps - a policy that soon changed. By the mid-1930s, with the great influx into France of political and religious refugees from central and eastern Europe, the republic created a new kind of identity card that, as the historian Pierre Piazza notes, sought "to delimit more rigorously the contours [of the national community] and to better locate those who did not make up part of it."
With relentless logic, there followed the creation of dozens of "special centres" - soon to become concentration camps - for refugees recently arrived on French soil. At the same time, the republic passed a law empowering officials to strip recently naturalized citizens of French nationality. Finally, shortly before the German invasion in the spring of 1940, the republican government ordered local officials to herd "nomads" into assigned areas. In justifying its action, the government declared: "Wandering individuals generally without a home, a homeland, or an actual profession, constitute a danger for national security ... that must be removed."
When Vichy came into existence a few months later, it built upon policies and structures introduced by the now-defunct republic. But the popular view of Vichy - as a rupture in history, four years that had nothing in common with what went before or what followed - cedes to a more accurate rendering, which shows important and unsettling continuities between democratic governments and authoritarian regimes in France.
Of course, the republic would never have applied a racialist policy toward Gypsies and Jews as Vichy did, much less participate in the systematic deportation of the two groups to the death camps. In this respect, Vichy and the French Republic have nothing in common.
Nonetheless, the continuities between democratic and authoritarian phases in French history lead to a more general observation, often overlooked: the tendency of all democracies to isolate and discriminate against certain minorities. Democracies are as likely as authoritarian states to practice xenophobic or racist politics. Mr. Sarkozy's policies may be unworthy of the French Republic, as his critics insist, but they are not unprecedented.
Thinkers from Plato to Tocqueville have commented on the dangers inherent in the rule of the majority - especially when the majority is swayed by the passionate actions and speeches of the few. The lot of the Roma in contemporary France and Romania is a case in point. While these democracies do not subject their Roma populations to the punitive, at times fatal, policies pursued by Petain's France or Ceausescu's Romania, they do relegate them to the margins of societies.
In present-day Romania, the Roma population has a poverty rate three times higher than the national average, with low life expectancy, low rates of literacy and 100 per cent unemployment in some areas. Since becoming a candidate and then a member of the European Union, the Romanian government has reluctantly designed initiatives aimed at facilitating integration of the Roma. Affirmative action programs and the appointment of local level educational and health mediators have been the most publicized. But the effectiveness of these programs has been limited at best, and anti-Roma sentiments continue among Romanian policy-makers, reflecting local public-opinion trends.
Romanians now see the French expulsions as proof that integration of the Roma into any European society is mere utopia. So the actions of the French government are undermining the already frail attempts at implementing policies that would target Roma discrimination in Romania.
As for France, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, leader of the European Green Party, says Mr. Sarkozy has "taken the French for fools" in pursuing his anti-Roma policy. Perhaps. But according to recent polls that reveal a nation evenly divided over the issue, Mr. Cohn-Bendit's claim means that nearly half the French population are fools.
We need only consider earlier republican laws aimed at the Gypsies, passed in 1912, 1938 and 1940, to see that xenophobia flared at those moments when France faced the threat of war. Moreover, on the eve of both world wars, France was awash in fears over the nation's declining birth rate and its capacity to maintain its historical legacy as a dominant economic, cultural, political and military power.
While the French Republic doesn't now face the prospect of war, it does face other crises: economic stagnation, decaying inner cities and a top-heavy state staggering under the increasingly unrealistic expectations of the public. It must also wrestle with perplexing questions of national identity and national security provoked by an EU that continues to extend its writ. Here's the rub for Mr. Sarkozy, and blessing for the Roma: The EU, long criticized for its "democratic deficit," may now become the defender of last resort for Europe's last stateless people, the Roma.
Robert Zaretsky is a professor of history at the Honors College, University of Houston, and with Alice Conklin and Sarah Fishman, author of France and Its Empire Since 1870. Olivia Miljanic, born and raised in Romania, is a lecturer at the University of Houston.

This detached, 2.5-storey Edwardian is located in one of the best possible spots in a mature, leafy neighbourhood by High Park and Lake Ontario, says agent Jill Stewart.
"Wright is a premium street in High Park/Roncesvalles," she says. "It's only a block from Roncesvalles ... another two blocks to the park, and then it's very close to the Gardiner."
The unique appearance of this century-old house also captivated buyers and locals alike.
"This particular house has always been a head turner with nice, pale yellow brick, which is not seen that often in Toronto," she says. "Its façade was very interesting with a lot of different rooflines, peaks, a chimney and large veranda."
The interiors are equally memorable with original leaded glass windows and hardwood floors in areas like the living room, pocket doors to the dining room and a fireplace in one corner of the grand foyer.
Some modern changes include the replacement of the boiler and electrical work to the renovation and expansion of the kitchen with a new breakfast area and double doors to a deck and private backyard with a playhouse and gardens.
But more importantly, the basement, which has a workshop area and a gym, was excavated to create a built-in garage, "which is very unusual in a 100-year-old house," adds Ms. Stewart.
The second floor has a full bathroom, a family room and office, which can be entered from two bedrooms.
The third floor houses two bedrooms and a bathroom with vaulted ceilings and multiple windows by a whirlpool tub and sliding doors to a secluded, tree-shaded deck.

Asian investors and condo buyers keep GTA flush with rental units

Just who is buying all those new condos now on sale in the GTA is hard to track down. Until the move-in day or deadline to decide specific finishes comes, builders have little idea whether a purchaser is an investor or will occupy the suite. As a result, knowing what is going on comes down to anecdotes and educated guesses.
Right now those anecdotes and that guesswork say Chinese - indeed mainland Chinese - buyers are having a major impact on condo sales.
"First understand that the GTA still attracts about 100,000 new Canadians a year," says Scott McLellan, senior vice-president sales and marketing at Plazacorp. Right now about 80 per cent of them are from Asia and about 80 per cent of that 80 per cent are from mainland China.
"In past we have gone through periods when the majority were from South Asia - from India and Pakistan. Now it has shifted to China with the result being Chinese are having a very large impact on new condo sales, both as end users and as buyers."
Jim Ritchie, senior vice-president sales and marketing at the Tridel Group, agrees. "Chinese play an important role in projects in certain areas of city where there is a significant Chinese community, but it is not something we can easily measure. What I can say is that if we have a project in an area where there is a Chinese community, we advertise in both Cantonese and Mandarin and they do indeed become buyers both as investors and for their own use."
What both men agree on is that new Canadians make up the lion's share of investors.
"First they are used to and understand condo living," says Mr. Ritchie. "And they seem to have greater confidence in the future than native-born Canadians have."
Mr. McLellan says mainland Chinese often purchase a condo with an eye toward five or seven years into the future. Often they buy a suite for a child going to school here to live in, but plan to emigrate to Canada themselves at some point. "What they buy depends on how they see using it in future," he says. "If it is just for a child attending school then it will be a one-bedroom and den, but if their plan is to come here in five to seven years, they will buy a two-bedroom or two-bedroom and den."
Others buy now, knowing it may take three years to reach the live-in stage, at which point they will rent the suite until they are ready to come here themselves, he says.
"The Chinese are very savvy investors. It is all about need and price. Optimally they want a suite where rents will carry their costs until they need the suite themselves. What they look at is long-term equity appreciation and they can see that even at today's prices."
Currently there is a special interest among Chinese for projects in new areas such as the Queen West neighbourhood. Plazacorp has a project ready to go at Queen West and Lisgar near the Drake Hotel. Already Chinese buyers are queuing up, Mr. McLellan says.
"What they see is low prices because it is a pioneering project. But at the same time they know that by the time move-in day arrives or by the time they will be ready to use it themselves the surrounding neighbourhood will be fully developed and be a great place to live."
To protect buyers who plan to be end-users and do not want a lot of renters in their building, major companies like Tridel refuse to sell more than three units to any buyer, says Mr. Ritchie. "Having lots of investors buying is not a problem in many projects. If you have a mid-market project in an area where you know the suites will be taken up by locals looking for downsize, like our Republic condo at Yonge and Eglinton, then there will be very few, if any, investors.
"If, however. You are creating lots of one- and two-bedroom suites right downtown or in a high-density area near a subway stop, then investors can take up a third or more of the total suites."
It is worth noting that without investors, the GTA's rental stock would be very slim indeed. Since the mid-1980s, when rent controls persuaded builders not to create any more rental projects, investor-held new condos have made up about 98 per cent of all new apartments, suggests Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.
Without a healthy investor demand, apartment vacancy rates would be paper thin.

Abstract: That differs from Pyramis's 2008 survey, released just before equity markets crashed, a time at which fund managers were simply watching growing volatility and had "a desire to understand it and monitor it," Young Chin, Pyramis' chief investment officer, said in an interview. Today, they are driven by "the urgency, the immediacy of trying to do everything possible to avoid another downdraft."

Full text:   Worries about pension funds' abilities to meet their retirement payments have subsided since financial markets stabilized, giving managers time to re-think their investing strategies.
Their biggest future concerns? Protecting against downside risk and market volatility, according to a survey of managers of defined-benefit pension funds conducted by Pyramis Global Advisors, an arm of Fidelity Investments.
The survey canvassed more than 460 corporate and public pensions across North America and Europe. It found that Canadian fund managers say their top three lessons learned since the markets stabilized are: adding downside protection; better matching of assets and liabilities; and improving risk management.
That differs from Pyramis's 2008 survey, released just before equity markets crashed, a time at which fund managers were simply watching growing volatility and had "a desire to understand it and monitor it," Young Chin, Pyramis' chief investment officer, said in an interview. Today, they are driven by "the urgency, the immediacy of trying to do everything possible to avoid another downdraft."
Make no mistake: Defined-benefit pension funds that make guaranteed payments to beneficiaries aren't in the clear. In Canada they can cover 89.5 per cent of their required payments, down from 97.1 per cent in 2008. But the current level isn't as dire as it was when markets were plummeting and the fund managers have some breathing room to re-work their portfolios.
In coming months, 35 per cent of Canadian managers said they will put more emphasis on fixed-income products. Mr. Chin referred to this as liability-driven investing, in which the pension funds match their long-term liabilities with safe, long-term assets such as 30-year Government of Canada bonds. In the past, he said, the funds focused on getting a maximum short-term return from equities, and that contributed to big shortfalls when equity markets nosedived.
Pension funds also expressed an interest in different asset classes such as private equity investments and real estate, which aren't so market driven and can be held longer-term. They also plan on limiting their "home market bias."
"People are more open than ever to expanding beyond local borders," Mr. Chin said.
Subtle differences exist between North American and European fund managers. In North America, the survey found pension funds are focused on downside protection while longer-term risk management dominates across the Atlantic. But Mr. Chin said their ideas overlap. "All plans are focused on the same things, just in different orders of priority."

HOUSE-HUNTING WEBSITES COMPARED

Abstract: Because agents have to opt-in, the listings aren't as robust as Realtor.ca. That means anyone relying solely on the site could be missing out on good opportunities. Browsers must also take the listings at face value, since they aren't appearing on an "official" CREA site.

Full text:   Canadians looking for a home online have long lacked the technological options of their American neighbours. That's because in the United States, the data needed to fill the websites with useful information flows freer. But Canadian sites are trying to beef up, and the largest real estate brokerages in the country (and the largest cable company) are playing a big part. Here's how some U.S. and Canadian sites stack up
ZILLOW.COM (U.S.)
The gold standard for real estate portals, the U.S. housing site was founded by the same person who helped take down the travel industry with Expedia.com.
Upside: The site gives real-time data to browsers, including maps that show how much each house on the street sold for the last time they were on the market. It also keeps track of how long each house has been on the market, and keeps track of changes in the asking price.
Downside: While hugely popular, Zillow has yet to turn a profit. It's surviving on venture capital. It has received about $87-million(U.S.) so far, which buys an awful lot of website.
REDFIN.COM (U.S.)
Working on the assumption that consumers who do all their own legwork should pay less to real estate agents, this U.S. site tries to make it easy for prospective buyers to find their dream homes.
Upside: The site crunches data from Multiple Listing Services across the country to provide rich profiles of many of the country's major markets. It also seamlessly integrates demographic information, letting users find out which schools are close by or how many single people live in a neighbourhood.
Downside: To get at all of the site's information, users must join as members. That's because the MLS-generated information is still owned by the real estate industry. "The local MLS allows us to show you the full listing only if we've established that you are genuinely interested in buying a home." Sorry, looky-loos.
REALTOR.CA (Canada)
The official website of the Canadian Real Estate Association, Realtor.ca compiles listings across the country and puts them all on one website for Canadian consumers.
Upside: Because the industry maintains the site, every listing is vetted by a licensed professional who is accountable for what is online. That means room sizes are accurate, asking prices are actually the asking prices and the agents are actually agents.
Downside: The technology is clunky, and searching can be frustrating. It only includes listings from agents, which means no for-sale-by-owner listings. To get information on former sales and days on market, a user must contact an agent.
ZOOCASA.COM (Canada)
Funded by venture capital from Rogers Communications Inc., Zoocasa allows agents to post their listings for free and makes its money through advertising and upgrading them to fancier packages.
Upside: Technology makes this site stand out, with a special feature called "Walk Score" particularly useful for browsers. It tells would-be buyers how far away amenities such as coffee shops, transit stops and bookstores are from any listing and provides basic demographic information as well.
Downside: Because agents have to opt-in, the listings aren't as robust as Realtor.ca. That means anyone relying solely on the site could be missing out on good opportunities. Browsers must also take the listings at face value, since they aren't appearing on an "official" CREA site.

Full text:   Saskatchewan writer
It's harvest season here on the Prairies. Between digging up batches of my organic beets, I'm dealing with the side effects of pesticide abuse.
Out for my morning run recently, I encountered Groundskeeper Willie near the nursing home. He sported a massive pesticide tank and clasped the spray wand with his bare hands. I wheezed, turned away and shouted: "This town is wacky about weeds!"
"It sure is," he replied without a trace of irony.
I lurched home, chest tight, as my sense of indignation mounted. I vowed to pack an inhaler next time. Gone was the promise of fresh, clean country air featured in country real estate come-ons.
Never mind the firearms registry. What about the spray gun? It's not just the conspiracy theories and the long-gun debate that divides urban and rural Canada; it's also the mighty pesticide wand.
Although Saskatchewan boasts the highest number of organic producers per capita in North America, we have no cosmetic pesticide spraying legislation. Those most at risk - asthmatics, dogs, small children - run a toxic gauntlet every time they leave the house.
The whole province is Round-Up ready. It leaves indolent sprayers more time to sprawl in front of their widescreens to cackle at Hiccups and Dan for Mayor .
Can we trace this weed obsession to Saskatchewan's agricultural roots? That simplistic argument makes the whole region one giant farm operation and its hapless residents mere fodder for some sci-fi terrarium experiment.
Finally, this spring, after extensive lobbying by activists, Regina designated three city parks pesticide-free as a test case. The rest of the province remains on a stoic mission to eliminate all weeds - even if it makes them all sick and out of step with the rest of Canada.
Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick are all provincewide no-go zones for cosmetic spraying. And I can hear my neighbours' snarky retorts now, as they obstinately shout over the back fence when I tell them that, "Well, Patricia, why don't you move there?"
As urban sodbusters frequent farmers markets and plaintively ask small producers, "Are these strawberries organic?" their polar opposite, the retired industrial farmer, is on a misguided mission to perfect his lawn and garden.
Pesticide spraying is the smoking habit of our era. You don't have to be a yurt dweller or a Birkenstock-wearing Utne Reader subscriber to support a ban on cosmetic spraying. Even the mainstream Canadian Cancer Society has declared cosmetic pesticide use a health hazard.
As an asthmatic who gardens organically, I've paid a social price for my rebellion. Just last month, the bylaws-guy-turned-paparazzo was boldly standing on my sidewalk with a digital video camera recording my yard for a possible bylaw violation. Big Brother was taping the grass between my raspberry canes because Wakaw has retrograde bylaws prohibiting weed growth and unsightly tall grass.
I can be quietly cooking meth in my kitchen but as long as my weeds are controlled, I'll be left alone. It's Breaking Bad meets Lawn and Order .
In November, American organic activist Maria Rodale will appear at TCU Place in Saskatoon to lecture the locals. Let's hope she can convert more of us to the cause. Ms. Rodale will probably encounter the same resistance as the hypnotist did in Wakaw when he tried to solicit volunteers to come up on stage and cluck like a chicken.
Why can't they exile these sprayers to the Island of Dr. Moreau ? They should all live together in their toxic soup while the rest of us breathe easy.
Stephen Harper, instead of persecuting listless pot smokers with tougher laws, why don't you criminalize cosmetic pesticide spraying? If you do, I'll send along some of my organic pickled beets for you and the family to enjoy.

ALDO'S GLOBAL FOOTPRINT

Full text:   Canadian shoppers are familiar with Aldo shoes. But few realize that this Montreal-based retailer has quietly built an empire that spans 1,500 stores in 55 countries. Marina Strauss explores one of this country's least-known success stories
Aldo Bensadoun peers at rows of strappy high-heeled shoes, bejewelled sandals and soft loafers.
Standing in a mock retail space in his headquarters in Montreal, the founder of Canada's least-known global retail juggernaut is pondering a window display destined for his Aldo shoe stores more than 10,000 kilometres away.
He suggests dropping a few styles to simplify the presentation. The changes made, an employee snaps a photograph of the reworked display and e-mails it abroad. Within a week, the exact same parade of footwear will appear in scores of his Middle East shop windows.
Welcome to a typical day at Aldo Group Inc., Mr. Bensadoun's $1.5-billion-a-year international shoe empire. Anyone who has stepped into a Canadian mall knows the company's namesake Aldo brand, as well as its FeetFirst, StoneRidge and Spring chains. But few appreciate the breadth and depth of this company that has quietly sprouted 1,500 stores in more than 55 countries.
With remarkably little in the way of fanfare, it has become one of the most successful shoe retailers in the world. In a tough economic environment, its emphasis on bringing products to markets lightning fast and constantly tempting customers with new trends is making this low-profile powerhouse a beacon to other merchants.
Mr. Bensadoun built his global footwear empire by constantly re-inventing his privately held company. Nobody is quicker at adjusting shoe styles, retail concepts and factory sourcing to suit the demands of fickle, fashion-obsessed customers. His team races to stay on top of the latest trends by chasing down street fashions and runway hits in fashion capitals.
Once it spots a workable idea, Aldo requires a mere five to 12 weeks to get shoes to stores, compared with an industry average of 17 weeks. "You have to be fast and you have to renew yourself constantly," Mr. Bensadoun, 71, said in a rare interview. "Our strength is to adapt. As the customer is changing, we're adapting to the new face of the customer."
Mr. Bensadoun has adapted his fast-fashion formula not just to different market segments in Canada, but to countries around the world. Aldo is prospering in the United States - where most other Canadian retailers have flopped - and in Europe and Asia as well.
"This is the most successful global retailer that Canada has ever built," said Tim McGuire, a senior partner at consultancy McKinsey & Co., which has advised Aldo. "They're the best in the world at what they do, and they're doing it everywhere in the world."
The numbers tell the story: By spotting emerging trends and jumping on them faster than competitors, Aldo manages to produce $1,000-plus sales per square foot in Canada, more than twice that of other mall shoe chains.
Even rivals pay homage to Aldo's prowess. "They're great in the world they live in - they're the best," said Stephen Applebaum, president of the group that runs Nine West and other shoe chains in Canada.
But Mr. Bensadoun can't rest on his laurels. Today, battling for much the same customer as cheap-chic chains such as Zara and H & M, and facing limited growth opportunities in North America, he's raising the stakes by moving in new directions. His company recently launched an upmarket chain called Locale. It also set up a wholesaling division to supply shoes to U.S. retail heavyweights, while starting to help other companies set up shop beyond their borders.
"Everybody has shoes - there is no shortage of competitors," said George Hartman, a former retail analyst on Bay Street and now a partner in investment banker Capital Canada. So how will Mr. Bensadoun find success? "He has a sense of control of where he's buying and whom he's targeting as his customers - better than anyone else," Mr. Hartman said. When he's not re-jigging window displays, Mr. Bensadoun and his team must spot the trends that will allow his company to reinvent itself yet again.
Master of change
Mr. Bensadoun never intended to follow in the footsteps of his father, a shoe retailer in Morocco and France, or his grandfather, a cobbler in Algeria. He attended boarding school in Paris and studied engineering at Cornell University in the U.S. But after falling in love with Montreal on a weekend visit, he transferred to a commerce program at McGill University.
He later took a job at a plastics company and sold a shrink-wrap system to Yellow Shoes, a Montreal retailer that wanted a way to protect shoes from pilferage. The work was so appreciated that the CEO hired him. The young executive was put in charge of the Salon Six shoe chain; then in 1972, he mortgaged his house to buy the shoe division of Montreal-based fashion retailer Le Château Inc.
That was the year Mr. Bensadoun's footwear career was truly launched, when he noticed hippies in Europe wearing wooden-soled clogs. He sensed that the footwear could become a hot trend in Canada, and he was right. Crafted in Italy and shipped to Le Château, the clunky footwear became a hit, with 500,000 pairs sold.
"I'm a strong believer that fashion starts on the street with political and economic events happening in the world," Mr. Bensadoun said. His team recently introduced combat-style boots. "You have so many wars going on in the world."
The success of the clog also taught him another important lesson: He needed to produce something different and run fast with new styles before others caught up to him. "If we were the same as every other retailer, then we never would have succeeded."
He started his Aldo chain in 1980, rushing to find the next new fashion at an affordable cost - in effect, practising fast fashion before the industry coined the term.
In an era when retailers depended on domestic middlemen to source products from European manufacturers, he went directly to the source. After taking lessons in Italian, he travelled to plants in Italy, putting in his own orders and modifying a heel, sole or buckle as he saw fit.
His practices didn't make him popular with the Canadian middlemen he was replacing, but they helped bolster profit. "He just broke the rules," said David Bensadoun, 40, heir apparent and the elder of two sons who are on Aldo's executive team today. "The reward was that his prices were sharper and his margins were a bit better."
Today, Aldo sources about 60 per cent of its products in China. It also has shoes made in other Asian centres as well as in Brazil, Eastern Europe and Italy. Being able to switch quickly to a factory with the capability to produce, for example, wooden-based clogs - as the company did last year - is an advantage in an industry where success depends upon getting the latest fashions on the shelf within weeks.
Mr. Bensadoun insists on staying nimble in other ways as well. He runs multiple retail chains, each of which caters to different customers. His constantly shifting mix of banners and brands allows him to test new looks and adjust quickly to trends. "They are far better at understanding, interpreting and leading fashion trends than any other retailer I've seen," Mr. McGuire said.
Aldo remains the flagship banner, geared to serve 18- to 30-year-olds with a bit of disposable income. To draw a younger customer with less money, Mr. Bensadoun started Transit (now called Spring). "He defines segments of his business and he very astutely targets his stores to serve those different segments," Mr. Hartman observed.
If a chain isn't working, Mr. Bensadoun doesn't hesitate to change it. "The worst thing is to run a concept that has gone stale," his son said.
Case in point: FeetFirst, which the company launched in the early 1990s to appeal to baby boomers who wanted comfortable shoes. Today, boomers want fashion first rather than "granny shoe" comfort, David said. "So we figured out we just needed to make fashionable shoes that are secretly comfortable." Starting late last month, Aldo began to convert its FeetFirst stores to a new higher-end chain - called Locale - which the company sees as its next global brand.
Beyond Canada
Aldo's bumpiest ride came in the mid-1990s, when it struggled to break into the cutthroat U.S. market. Snatching prominent store locations was tough because landlords were unfamiliar with its name. Its handful of U.S. stores gave it no bargaining power.
That's when Mr. Bensadoun took the unusual step of spending about $1-million to hire McKinsey to advise his tiny firm on its transformation into an international player. The high-power global consultancy rarely works with small private companies.
What did McKinsey see in Aldo? "Even when Aldo was only in Canada, its fashion footwear business was better than anyone in that segment in the world," Mr. McGuire said.
McKinsey's advice to Aldo was simple: Go big in the U.S. or go home. It moved rapidly to open U.S. stores. With a minimal marketing budget, it managed to make a splash by buying up billboard space at just one conspicuous spot in each big city it entered.
In New York City, for instance, it invested in a "killer billboard" at the edge of the trend-setting Soho district, David recalled. "A lot of people said, 'Wow, they must be a big player because they're on this amazing billboard.' But we didn't have any other billboards anywhere. We just put all our money into that one."
Pinching pennies on advertising helped to preserve one of Aldo's key advantages: lower prices. By selling its products through its own stores, it could undercut competitors such as Nine West and Steve Madden, which sold much of their merchandise through department stores.
While offering low prices, Aldo was also careful to invest in well-designed stores, removing any perception that it was merely a discounter. "People want style and they want it at a good price, but they don't want it to be perceived as cheap," said Tony Grossi, a New York retail real estate consultant.
Today, Aldo operates 475 stores in the U.S. and another 471 in Canada. It is also a force in the U.K., Mexico and much of the Persian Gulf. In its core English-language markets, stores are company-owned; outside of those markets, Aldo teams up with seasoned local retailers as franchisees.
Those local retailers provide head office with a window on local preferences that can tilt footwear selection. In its Persian Gulf markets, Aldo stocks more men's loafers and open-toed sandals than it does in North America, because Muslim men like footwear that can be easily slipped on and off for prayers five times a day.
Back in North America, though, sales growth is slowing. Aldo's competition includes discount titans such as Payless and Wal-Mart, as well as the fast-fashion trendsetters like H & M and Zara. It is also up against a sluggish economy, especially in the U.S.
To find new avenues for growth, it is trying to sharpen its fast-fashion advantage in what it internally calls Project Sunshine. "It's actually not that hard when you're growing at two stores a week to hide your mistakes," David said. "Now that we're not growing as much, we need to be a lot sharper with how we do our buying and inventory management."
Head office now gets hourly - rather than weekly - sales data, allowing it to make faster decisions about restocking top sellers or ditching losers. The speedy updates shave the time it takes to get shoes on the shelf by as much as 30 per cent.
Mr. Bensadoun wants to expand in North America without the huge spending needed to open new stores. The solution: Wholesale products to other retailers. His company recently struck deals with department stores Kohl's and J.C. Penney and online retail giant Zappos.com. And starting next spring, Aldo will ship its revived Pegabo line to the Bay department stores.
In yet another evolution, it is using its savvy to help companies such as Italy-based Miss Sixty run their shops in foreign markets. "We said, 'There's got to be other ways to make money than just keeping on opening stores,'" David said.
Aldo itself is eyeing new markets, including China, Japan, Brazil, Italy, Germany and France. It believes it can double annual sales to $3-billion within five years. "It's a playing field that's in constant evolution and we're always trying to change our recipe to fit into it," he said.
*******
HIT AND MISS
Aldo is not the only Canadian retailer to enter the U.S. market. But it's one of the few to succeed.
HIT
Lululemon Athletica
The Vancouver-based yoga wear chain expanded rapidly in the U.S. after it went public in 2007, and now operates 75 of its 130 stores south of the border.
MISS
Le Château
Montreal-based Le Château entered the U.S. market in 1985, but has struggled since. This spring it closed one of the four U.S. stores it had left and will shut the remaining three when their leases expire.
Danier Leather
In 2005, the Toronto-based leather chain closed three struggling U.S. stores after four years in the market.
La Senza
In 2005, the then Montreal-based lingerie retailer was forced to shut its five U.S. stores after about two years in the market. Almost two years later it was taken over by the U.S. parent of rival Victoria's Secret.
Mark's Work Wearhouse
The Calgary-based work and casual wear chain entered the U.S. market in 1981 and peaked at nine stores before the U.S. operation filed for bankruptcy six years later.
Canadian Tire
Toronto-based Canadian Tire wasn't able to turn around a U.S. chain it scooped up in 1982; it failed again in the early 1990s in its second attempt at the U.S. market.

First-timers drawn to Etobicoke towers for affordability

Author: Yu, Sydnia

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/first-timers-drawn-etobicoke-towers-affordability/docview/749303646/se-2?accountid=14656

The affordability of contemporary suites at Tridel's latest condominium development in Etobicoke has been a key factor behind the swift sale since its spring launch of 70 per cent of the first tower and the early release of the second tower shortly after.
"We were going to open the second phase one year after the first, but we had an opportunity to move that ahead because of the acceptance of the community in the first phase," says Jim Ritchie, senior vice-president of sales and marketing at Tridel. "We're able to bring in that second phase relatively quickly by bringing in virtually the same offerings that were in the first."
The popular one-bedroom plus den and two-bedroom plans that initially sold out in the 27-storey tower will be offered in the adjacent 30-storey tower, along with some new two-bedroom designs. Prices start as low as $252,000.
"It represents affordability in a new form of housing," says Mr. Ritchie. "Given our price point, in many circumstances, it's probably a [buyer's] first opportunity for home ownership." By fall or winter of 2013, these towers will be the first completed in the master-planned community, called West Village, which will house two more buildings, a central courtyard and pedestrian-friendly walkways on Eva Road off The West Mall, just north of Bloor Street.
"[It's] like a little village within the city," says Mr. Ritchie.
Most buyers are local residents familiar with the area's wealth of parks, schools and recreational facilities.
"There's a very established neighbourhood immediately to the west of us," adds Mr. Ritchie. "There are a lot of shopping available there and employment opportunities."
Residents will also be able to navigate the city fairly easily with TTC and GO Train stations nearby, as well as highways 427 and 401.
Amenities within the two towers will be share, including a two-storey lobby, a theatre and fireside party room with a bar, kitchen and access to one of three landscaped terraces. A gym, a swimming pool and whirlpool tub will be located on the second floor.
For the most part, individual suites will have one-bedroom plus den and two-bedroom designs, however, buyers can find some larger two-bedroom plus den units in the first tower, and smaller one-bedroom suites in the second tower.
Models generally offer open principal rooms with balconies, kitchen peninsulas with extended breakfast bars and master suites with walk-in closets or private bathrooms depending on the plan.
Standard finishes will consist of plank laminate floors in most areas, 40-ounce broadloom in the bedrooms and ceramic tiles in bathrooms and laundry areas. Kitchens will be stocked with stainless steel Energy Star appliances, ceramic tile backsplashes and quartz or granite countertops.
Like Tridel's other projects, this one will be registered with the Canada Green Building Council to pursue certification by the LEED Green Building Rating System. As a result, suites will incorporate environmentally-friendly features, such as energy efficient windows, paints with low volatile organic compounds and low flow, high-pressure showerheads. Utilities will also be individually metered.

Full text:   Barry and Linda Coutts say they're finished with the restoration of their historic Georgian-era mansion - almost
Have you ever opened up a wall during a renovation and found some vintage newspapers, or a child's toy? Imagine peering up into the rafters of your basement and finding a lieutenant-colonel's scarlet military jacket from the War of 1812.
That happened to Barry and Linda Coutts in the early days of renovating Nelles Manor, their Grimsby, Ont., mansion, one of the oldest continually inhabited homes in the province. The fact the manor was built between 1788 and 1798, at a time when other pioneer families in the Niagara Peninsula were slapping up log cabins, makes their home that much more special.
It's so special to the Coutts family, in fact, that they've been renovating for 39 years. And while Barry estimates the project is 90 per cent complete, he's not sure when - if ever - it will be done.
"We've gone through a lot of tense times, learning to live with constant renovation," says Linda. "There's many a day we've stood in that front window and said, 'who wants this place? Ten cents and it's yours.'"
Barry and Linda, now in their 60s, have eschewed "cutesy Victorian" in favour of a style that reflects the home's Georgian-era roots.
They say if Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Nelles returned to the place he built and inhabited until his death in 1842, they would want him to feel right at home.
To achieve that, the Coutts knocked down 1950s partitions that were thrown up when the 7,000-square-foot house was converted to eight apartments, uncovered original flooring, plaster and woodwork, and opened up fireplaces, including an immense cooking fireplace in the cavernous old kitchen.
"We've listened to what the house tells us," says Linda. "And we followed those instructions as closely as we could."
That includes replicating original paint colours - often blue, beige and a deep burgundy red - and using scratches on floorboards to place doors in their original locations.
Their pride and joy is the drawing room where Colonel Nelles kept his study during his years as a British military man, storekeeper, mill owner and justice of the peace. The room is refurbished with a masculine panache that conjures up cigar smoke and fine, golden whisky.
"We've set up dinner parties in there," says Barry. "One night we had 60 candles lit and a guest chef preparing dinner for 10 people. It put you back 200 years." Adds Linda: "It was magical."
But while aspects of the house resemble a museum - except older than you'd find at Upper Canada Village - this is a family home. The couple frequently host school groups and historical societies keen for a glimpse into Canada's pioneer days, but when the visitors leave, Nelles Manor is the Coutts' home.
Theirs has been a four-decade odyssey, which began in 1970 when an ad in The Globe and Mail caught Barry's eye. The next year, the couple was summoned for an audience with the elderly owner, a Nelles descendant. They passed muster, and she sold it to them for $75,000.
As chief contractor, Barry, whose background includes technical sales and more recently operating a powder paint company, "drew where everything should be. I did schematics. Then we got to work on one room at a time."
They moved into one of the apartments and, as other units came available, incorporated them into the project. Today, the main part of the house is all theirs, with just two apartments - one in the attic and one in the carriage house - remaining. Their goal is to turn the manor back into a single-family dwelling.
The original home consisted of Robert Nelles's drawing room, a parlour, dining room and kitchen on the main level, three second-floor bedrooms, plus servants' quarters over the kitchen. The attic might have been used for storage, a play area or extra sleeping.
A carriage house, added around the end of the War of 1812, was later attached, a "modern" kitchen was built in the 1930s, then dormers and a two-storey addition came in the 1950s.
"When we first moved in," explains Barry, "to get upstairs to the bedrooms we had to go outside and up the steps."
Adds Linda: "Our son's bedroom was in the kitchen of one of the apartments, with the cupboards and sink and tile floor. But he didn't think anything of it. It's just the way it was. We've all made sacrifices for the house."
They encountered plywood and linoleum over black walnut and pine, partitions and drywall over old plaster. Layers of paint were meticulously scraped from banisters and woodwork. A stove had been placed where the old kitchen fireplace once sat. When they tore through the wall to uncover it, decades of soot began to billow into the room.
Piles of woodwork, chair rail, handrail and nails were found in the basement. This became Barry's supply depot, visited whenever he encountered a repair job. A local carpenter warmed to the task of replicating missing pieces of trim and spindles.
"What we're down to now is the redecorating," says Barry. "The rest will be sanding, repainting."
Linda pipes up: "Barry, the master bedroom still has a wall down the centre of it."
Barry smiles. "Easy fix."
Returning the home to its original era has not always been smooth sailing. For example, an 1870s reno job in the parlour saw wide-board pine floors replaced by random-width maple. In the same room a corner fireplace - which backs onto a similar one in the adjacent dining room - was fitted with Victorian-era tile over the 1790s black plaster molding.
Another modernization saw original muntined windows at the front of the house replaced with two-piece sash models. While the couple grimaced and accepted the parlour renovations, they returned the windows to their original style by replicating those at the back of the house - some of which, they believe, still contain 1790s panes of glass.
"The idea is not to take everything down, but to save everything possible that was part of this house," says Barry. "We spent 500 hours in the drawing room and 500 hours in the hallway, only on the plaster, fixing all the cracks, putting lathing back in the walls and plastering on top of it."
The realities of the modern world raise their ugly heads occasionally. A 1790s home has no closets, so they've done without. Plumbing, steam heat pipes and electrical wiring had to be incorporated into a house of stone walls that range from two to three feet thick. On occasion, that's meant having to box in those modern touches. In the colonel's study, wiring conduit was hidden behind a Union Jack flag.
The rubblestone exterior, covered with a soft cement, has withstood its more than two centuries in remarkable shape, but wooden details - including windows - need constant repair and painting.
The couple can't begin to guess how much they've spent and say they're at a loss to put a modern-day price tag on their home. Across the street, an 1836 Canterbury cottage that's less than half the size and sits on a smaller property is offered for $660,000.
How does a marriage survive four decades of renovation?
"It became an important part of life for all of us," says Linda. "Our son was quite indignant a while ago when he thought we might consider the house's future without consulting him, too."
Adds Barry: "I still find myself eager to come home from work and pick up my tools and get started on the next project."
But part of the answer is that while it has consumed much of the couple's 47 years of marriage, Barry and Linda have stayed adamant that they not sacrifice their family life.
"We haven't let this be the only thing we've done, because there's more to life than having a restored house," Linda says. "We insisted on time together, with the family, with friends, travel, community involvement. You can't lose perspective."
Colonel Robert Nelles
Colonel Robert Nelles was born in New York's Mohawk Valley in 1761, one of four sons of Hendrick (Henry) Nelles. Robert grew up with Joseph Brant's son and the two were lifelong friends. He served as a British scout during the American Revolution and was a frequent guest of the Indian superintendent, Sir William Johnson.
One story tells of Nelles and four natives having to dive into the frigid February waters of the Oswego River to avoid a force of Continental soldiers. With bullets whizzing above their heads, they reached the other side but had no means of changing their frozen clothing until they reached Fort Niagara.
When the United Empire Loyalist Nelles family moved to Niagara in what was then the western part of the Province of Quebec in the 1780s, Robert recalled details of Johnson's Mohawk Valley home and incorporated them into his own grand mansion at the new settlement of The Forty.
His original log cabin was later incorporated into a home that still stands near the manor.
Robert Nelles built a grist mill, sawmill and store at The Forty, which would later be renamed Grimsby. He rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and commanded a detachment of the 4th Regiment Lincoln Militia during the War of 1812.
Nelles Manor, built at the base of the Niagara Escarpment along an Indian trail, was a frequent drop-in spot for passing native people.
Some say the spirit of Robert Nelles still inhabits his grand mansion. A woman who knew nothing of the home's history moved into the apartment in what had been Nelles' study. She reported awakening during the night to the unsettling sight of a red-coated military man and two Indians in her bedroom.

Abstract: Kicked off the stock exchange, Posluns joined his brothers in their clothes manufacturing business and became interested in real estate. When he tried to buy the art deco headquarters of his grandfather's old rival, Tip Top Tailors, he met with resistance from the Dunkleman family, who wanted to sell their entire business. His accountant put Posluns in touch with Winnipegger Jimmy Kay, who wanted to buy the failing clothing business but not the real estate.

Full text:   Consortium drew on power of the shopping mall to bring multiple retail businesses, each with a unique identity, under the same roof
Whether he wanted it or not, the garment trade was in the blood of Wilfred Posluns. The grandson of a Polish tailor who had travelled to Canada by cattle boat in the early 1900s, Posluns grew up in the shadow of Toronto's rough and tumble clothing business.
Posluns was a toddler when the International Ladies' Garment Works' Union went on strike against the family's Superior Cloak Co. in the summer of 1934. Determined to break the union, his father, Louis, and Uncle Joe locked their 200 workers out and moved the operation from Toronto to Guelph, Ont. The firm hired non-union workers and continued to produce high-end women's coats behind a line of police and company security men. Rocks were thrown, cars smashed, tear gas fired and several strike breakers were hospitalized.
Forty years later, Wilfred Posluns managed a much different style of company. His Dylex Ltd. was a gargantuan fashion consortium of clothing factories and big-name chain stores - including Fairweather, Tip Top, Big Steel and Suzy Shier - that revolutionized Canada's retail business. At its peak, Dylex claimed up to 12 per cent of the country's clothing dollars. But dreams of $5-billion sales figures failed to materialize and, by 1987, the empire was collapsing.
Wilfred Posluns died on Aug. 15 after suffering from a blood disorder for several years, according to a friend. He was 78 and revered by his friends and family as a gentle, upbeat and brilliant man. He is credited with raising about $100-million for charity over his lifetime. Many of those millions came from his own Posluns Family Foundation.
Toronto clothier Harry Rosen jokes that Posluns was a master at eliciting donations, especially "if you were a friend of Wilfred's. And particularly if he knew how you were doing."
Posluns was born April 4, 1932, to Louis and Leah (Granatstein), the youngest of three sons. His two brothers followed their father and uncles into the clothing business - grandfather Abraham had launched Superior Cloak in 1916 after several years at the T. Eaton Co. - but Posluns headed into the investment industry.
His eldest brother, Irving, recalls that "Wilfred was a very precocious youngster. He was entrepreneurial from the time he was six years old." That was the year that he roamed his neighbourhood with a toy trumpet to raise money for poor children just as he had watched the local Salvation Army band do. Eventually, he admitted that he was the poor child in question.
While his brother Jack attended New York's Fashion Institute of Technology, Posluns studied commerce at the University of Toronto, Irving's alma mater, and graduated in 1955. Midway through the program, he married Joyce Eleanor Cohen.
By 1960, Posluns was a stockbroker with Bay Street's R. A. Daly Company and had also acquired a minority interest in Morton Shulman's Lido Investments, which specialized in the relatively arcane field of trading share options, a high-stakes leverage game that could produce huge gains - and losses. (Shulman became well known as the wealthy and outspoken chief coroner for Ontario.) When a Daly client's investment in 570 options ended badly for the investor, security investigators discovered that Posluns had resold the client's money-losing options in New York for a significant profit to Daly, Lido and himself.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's Board of Governors fined the company $5,000 and demanded that Posluns resign quietly or have his trading privileges revoked publicly. Posluns refused, arguing that he was being made a scapegoat because he was Jewish. He sued the TSE for $2-million and took his fight all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled against him seven years later in 1968.
His son David remembers those years with admiration. "To him it was a matter of principle and he was a principled person. ... He didn't like being backed into a corner, notwithstanding the fact that he was dealing with the Canadian establishment."
Kicked off the stock exchange, Posluns joined his brothers in their clothes manufacturing business and became interested in real estate. When he tried to buy the art deco headquarters of his grandfather's old rival, Tip Top Tailors, he met with resistance from the Dunkleman family, who wanted to sell their entire business. His accountant put Posluns in touch with Winnipegger Jimmy Kay, who wanted to buy the failing clothing business but not the real estate. After a lengthy meeting, the two men created Dylex, an acronym for "Damn Your Lousy Excuses," that absorbed the Posluns company and Kay's Fairweather stores.
While the partnership would end in acrimony decades later, the pair were well suited to turn Tip Top around. Within a year, clothing sales at the chain's 52 menswear stores had risen to $37-million.
In 1968, Posluns asked Harry Rosen to drop by the Tip Top factory to assess a new designer's work.
Retired but still a consultant for the upscale stores that bear his name, Rosen says, "That led to further discussions and culminated in my joining them. They bought my business outright. I was the first acquisition they made."
Rosen became the model for Dylex's future acquisitions - he supervised the store and advised the partners on a range of practices from design to merchandising. He later returned to manage the Rosen store full-time and eventually bought back a 49-per-cent share. He regained full ownership in 1992.
Through the 1970s, Dylex bought controlling interests in clothing chains but left the stores in the hands of the entrepreneurs who had been running them. It treated an acquisition's management team as part of the business's assets.
"Wilfred never made an entrepreneur who came into their business feel anything less than independent and free to exercise his creative abilities. Never once did he regiment people to think in a particular corporate style," Rosen recalls.
The flexible management formula worked and money rolled in. By 1980, annual sales rose to $650-million. Five years later, Dylex had 2,700 stores across Canada and the United States. The company had interests in more than a dozen Canadian businesses, both manufacturing and retail. Each store had very specific customer demographics and didn't compete with one another even though they were side by side. Families spent Saturdays wandering from one Dylex store to the next, unaware of the corporate connections between Harry Rosen, Town and Country, Thrifty's and the discounter BiWay.
One of the keys to Dylex's success in the 1960s and 70s was Poslun's understanding of the power of the new suburban shopping mall. In one negotiation, Dylex could hammer out a good price for a dozen different clothing stores in a new development.
To keep up with the growth, a generation of retailers had to be trained. Bonnie Brooks, CEO of Hudson Bay Co., describes herself as a graduate of the Dylex School of Retail. Another alumna of the Fairweather chain was Elizabeth Evans, now director of Ryerson University's Ted Rogers School of Retail Management.
"It was groundbreaking," Evans says. "He built a corporate entity of diverse fashion companies most of which had been created by individuals with a strong sense of fashion, ... and provided them [with] financial power."
Jeanne Beker, CTV's resident fashionista, recalls her teenage introduction to stylish clothes: "The fare at (Dylex's) Big Steel was cool and empowering. It brought a little piece of the London groove to my local mall. ... Finally, we didn't have to drive to Buffalo to buy our hip clothes."
According to Rosen, Posluns was incredibly smart. And a good listener: "He could be tough but not unreasonably tough, and always very considerate of the position of the other person. In my experience working, there was never a time when I came in with an idea that he couldn't jump on right away and understand it. He had a terrific comprehension of business, period."
Even with its dizzying growth, Dylex could not fully satisfy Posluns's ambitions. Outside of the partnership, he became wealthy investing in real estate, shopping malls, technology, medical businesses, and oil and gas companies.
Despite the frenetic pace of his career, Posluns always found time for favourite charities. He served on the boards of several, including Mount Sinai Hospital and the Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Health.
The eventual collapse of Dylex was spectacular, providing blood sport for the Canadian business press through the early 1990s. The move into the United States in 1984-85 had involved the leveraged purchase of almost 1,400 chain stores, and the previous magic of having a multiple retail presence in a single mall wasn't working. Interest rates were high, consumer sales were low and Posluns and Kay were embroiled in a court battle over control of Dylex.
A loyal family man, Posluns looked to his family's arsenal of MBAs for help. By 1990, his 30-year-old son David, who had managed the U.S. business for three years, was back in Toronto as senior vice-president of corporate development, secretary and treasurer. Daughter Lynn became Fairweather president at age 31, a year later.
By the time the Dylex empire sought bankruptcy protection in 1995, its stock had dropped from $20 to mere pennies and there were only 700 stores left.
"It was a demeaning time," Irving Posluns says.
The board members resigned and Posluns took his family and friends into his new investment company, Cedarpoint Investments, which continues today. Dylex struggled for another six years under new management and eventually sold off its remaining assets in 2001.
Posluns leaves his wife, Joyce, his brother Irving, and children Wendy, Lynn and David.

With gold pricey, sharp investors should look at oil

Abstract: A colleague reports that Fort Mac is starting to boom again. So why isn't oil, and the oil sands in particular, viewed as a store of value? In May of last year, this space said Canadian Oil Sands Trust looked interesting for the long haul. It's the only pure oils sands play that is producing and it has decades of reserves and potential reserves. The units are worth a little less today, but does that really matter?

Gold is the only commodity in the world whose rising price can be so quickly self-defeating. Indians, who usually buy lots of it, have turned into sellers because it's more enticing to sell at $1,220 (U.S.) an ounce than to buy. So the local markets are awash in bangles and other jewellery. Fortunately for gold lovers, investment demand is soaring so the price stays high, for now anyway.
But what are investors overlooking when they fixate on gold as a store of value? It's better than real estate right now, most likely. Maybe better than government bonds too, given the state of the public balance sheet. But there are alternatives to gold as a store of value. What about oil for example?
Unlike gold, oil's value comes from its scarcity. You find it, you produce it, and then you burn it. Scrap gold makes up 40 per cent of the world's gold supply (mining and central bank sales contribute the rest). There is no scrap oil. It's gone after we use it.
And we still use a lot of it. Despite the great recession, oil consumption has remained pretty strong.
In 1999, the world consumed 76 million barrels a day. In 2009, it was 84 million barrels, which wasn't even 2 per cent less than the year before. U.S. consumption, which is about a fifth of the total, was down 5 per cent and may have peaked there and in the developed world by and large. But the developing world is making up most of the difference, and will keep growing.
Oil consumption in China and India on a per capita basis is still a small fraction of what it is in our world - roughly one-fifteenth - and it's still rising briskly.
And while it's true that reserves are still growing - there are 30 per cent more proven barrels today than there were 20 years ago, according to the BP Statistical Review - it should be clear to any informed person that these new barrels are not like old barrels. The new stuff is in the Gulf of Mexico, for example, where there was another explosion yesterday. Or they're in places where people or governments or mobsters just take them from you without so much as a thank you very much.
Our oil sands are not without their baggage of course but nothing is going to stop their development. Oil is a filthy business but technology will solve some of the problems in northern Alberta. And nothing will replace oil for a long, long time. Electric cars are a novelty that will never take serious market share from gasoline varieties. Besides which, they run on coal.
A colleague reports that Fort Mac is starting to boom again. So why isn't oil, and the oil sands in particular, viewed as a store of value? In May of last year, this space said Canadian Oil Sands Trust looked interesting for the long haul. It's the only pure oils sands play that is producing and it has decades of reserves and potential reserves. The units are worth a little less today, but does that really matter? In 20 years, you won't care much that you paid $27 (Canadian) or $25 for them. A store of value should be something you can buy and hold. With many gold producers trading for more than the value of their reserves, I'm not sure they qualify, although the metal might.
Maybe a better, more direct way to make the case is this: When oil was at its all-time high, gold was $950 an ounce and anyone who bought then is up very nicely. Investors should have bought gold when oil was hot. With gold at $1,220 (U.S.), they might do well to buy oil.

Abstract: Once Zipcar entered Toronto, it scaled up quickly: It had 100 cars within a month, and close to 300 after two years, besting AutoShare's fleet. "Toronto seems to be off the charts relative to anything we've seen before," [Scott Griffith] said of the growth six months after the launch. Zipcar's Toronto general manager, Michael Lende, recalls that, initially, when he'd walk into a room to talk about his operation, "people didn't know what car sharing was.

Full text:   Determined to do good, Kevin McLaughlin claimed a chunk of green frontier by launching AutoShare. Then came a bitter split with his partner and the rapid evolution of the car-sharing sector from co-operative to cutthroat. And now Hertz and Ford want in?
To get a sense of where Kevin McLaughlin's sympathies lie, one need look no further than the magazine selection in his Toronto company's lobby: Green Living, Vegetarian Times, Momentum ("for self-propelled people" ) and Viva, a women's health title. Yup, the president of AutoShare, one of the pioneers of car sharing in North America, is as green as Kermit the Frog. He ventured into the industry with a mission to reduce car pollution, promote environmental consciousness and provide low-cost mobility to the masses.
In McLaughlin's 12 years with AutoShare, however, the business has thrown him several curves. To wit: "We thought it'd be great for low-income people and immigrants, but they haven't taken it up," says McLaughlin, a slim, bespectacled man with a toothy grin and earnest manner. "Thirty dollars for four hours is still a luxury for them."
The eco-pitch also didn't stick. "It took us years to figure out that the green part is not the reason people were joining. People were joining because car sharing was convenient and saved them money."
Most unpleasant of all, he's found the car-sharing industry's communitarian ethos melting away in the face of aggressive, well-funded and shrewd entrants-most notably Zipcar Inc., a Boston-area company that now controls three-quarters of North American market share.
While co-ops remain a major force in car sharing, both Zipcar and AutoShare look to profit from this still new concept. In essence, car sharing is short-term car rental-for as little as 30 minutes-aimed at urbanites who generally get around on transit or under their own locomotion, but occasionally need a vehicle for a meeting or a trip to Ikea.
Once they've paid a small membership fee, customers can book a car online or over the phone, with gas, insurance and roadside assistance included. It's a fully self-serve transaction: Walk to one of the parking "pods" dotted around downtown, unlock your car with a smart card or a key from a lockbox, and off you go.
The model has proven appealing: Seven years ago, AutoShare had about 1,000 members. Today, some 10,000 Torontonians use its roughly 220 vehicles. That dramatic growth, mirrored by other operators' experiences in major cities, is expected to continue. Research firm Frost & Sullivan projects that revenues of North American car-sharing operations will soar from $253 million (U.S.) in 2009 to $3.3 billion (U.S.) in 2016, and membership will grow tenfold as high gas prices, hefty vehicle ownership and insurance costs, parking hassles, a sluggish economy and guilt about fouling the atmosphere spur households to ditch their cars-or at least their second cars.
But along with growth, the industry is about to experience a dramatic realignment. Car-rental agencies and auto manufacturers are ramping up their incursions into car sharing, and new entrants are experimenting with more efficient business models. To prepare for the upcoming fight, Zipcar has announced its plan to go public. McLaughlin and other trailblazers have conflicted feelings about their larger rival: They acknowledge it's greatly raised awareness of car sharing, but view it as an unwelcome interloper into the markets they developed. Beneath the resentment lies a fear that, as often happens, a rapid industry evolution may sweep away the pioneers. AutoShare could be among the casualties. But, then, so could Zipcar.
Kevin McLaughlin - a former aspiring environmental reporter and director of a nature non-profit, a man who volunteers at bird rescues and only briefly owned a car - is a distant relative of auto-industry pioneer Sam McLaughlin, whose McLaughlin Motor Car Co. was subsumed into General Motors Canada.
It's a nice irony, but the 43-year-old entrepreneur is no hippie: He graduated from Queen's University in business, hoping to become a real estate tycoon-until he took a trip to Asia and had an epiphany when he saw plastic bottles despoiling an idyllic island. He co-founded the non-profit group Evergreen in Toronto to foster urban green spaces, and then moved to Vancouver to open a branch there. But by the mid-1990s, he was tired of "begging for money."
McLaughlin read about car-sharing ventures in Europe, where pilot projects date back to the 1960s. Inspired, in 1997 he helped found the non-profit Co-operative Auto Network in Vancouver, an organization that has since expanded to serve nearby communities. Seeing an unexplored business opportunity, he returned to Toronto and partnered with Liz Reynolds, a former co-op housing advocate, to launch AutoShare. They based it on the example of for-profit Communauto in Quebec, the first car-sharing operation in North America (see story, page 16).
AutoShare had 16 members and three cars when it launched in October, 1998. "It was so mission-driven in the early days," recalls McLaughlin, seated in his bare-bones office in a downtown Toronto loft building, where he and his 14 staffers moved last fall. The first members were true believers who treated their $500 insurance deposit-cum-membership "like giving us a donation or buying a share in a windmill," he says. Those fees were AutoShare's primary source of capital, the biggest chunk of which went toward leasing cars. No bank would lend to such an untested venture, so board members signed the leases personally.
During the taxing early years of the company's life, the two partners' relationship grew toxic. One morning in April, 2002, McLaughlin arrived to be confronted by Reynolds, accompanied by a security guard and businessman Dan White. The pair announced that Reynolds was taking over.
In the ensuing legal battle, Reynolds and McLaughlin appeared before several judges-including Justice James Farley, who was also presiding over the Air Canada bankruptcy and couldn't hide his incredulity at AutoShare's teapot tempest. Eventually, an auction was held, McLaughlin won and, with begged-and-borrowed money, bought out Reynolds. The struggle had cost him $40,000 in legal fees. "The first thing any entrepreneur should be taught in business school is, have an exit agreement," says McLaughlin ruefully. (Reynolds and White launched a short-lived rival, Dashcar, in 2003. She is no longer in the industry.)
Growing the company proved more difficult than McLaughlin expected. "This is an immensely, ridiculously capital-intensive business to start as a small operator," says McLaughlin. AutoShare pays about $1,000 a month for every car it has on the road, to cover the lease, insurance, parking, maintenance and gas. The original business plan had AutoShare breaking even with 200 cars after three years, but while the company did start breaking even, the fleet goal kept getting pushed out. McLaughlin was particularly disappointed that, for all their green tub-thumping, governments gave AutoShare little help. "I would go to the City [of Toronto] every year for five years, but they didn't see us as credible," he says. Meanwhile, American car-share companies received millions of dollars in public support.
McLaughlin tried to raise venture capital, but couldn't deliver a big enough business plan to attract interest. Meanwhile, he kept tweaking the operating model. AutoShare started off charging $2 to $3 an hour because that's what the co-ops charged, but it soon had to raise rates to survive. The company was thinking too small, too narrow, and McLaughlin believes this tunnel vision cost AutoShare the opportunity to raise funding that it could have used to expand beyond Toronto.
Still, by 2005, AutoShare was profitable, and later that year, Zipcar sent out feelers about a partnership. McLaughlin squired around CEO Scott Griffith and his entourage, showing them his operation, the choice neighbourhoods harbouring eco-conscious, condo-dwelling hipsters and the parking lots that rented space to shared cars.
Since Zipcar was an ally in the car-sharing cause, McLaughlin was amenable to coming under its umbrella. Zipcar's purchase offer of $450,000 and 220,000 shares, however, was so low as to be insulting, he says. "They lowballed me, and two months later, they launched here."
Zipcar, now in its pre-IPO quiet period, refused to comment on financial specifics, other than to say, "As the market leader, Zipcar keeps in touch with other players in the market."
Zipcar didn't lack a grand vision. Since its launch in 2000, the firm has raised a reported $50 million (U.S.) in venture funding, enabling it to require minimal upfront membership fees. When research showed that Americans weren't big on sharing, the company dropped the word from its promotional material in favour of a convenience sell: "wheels when you want them." The firm grew fast, spending up to $4 million (U.S.) to launch in each new market and snapping up rivals like Flexcar, the second-largest American player.
Once Zipcar entered Toronto, it scaled up quickly: It had 100 cars within a month, and close to 300 after two years, besting AutoShare's fleet. "Toronto seems to be off the charts relative to anything we've seen before," Griffith said of the growth six months after the launch. Zipcar's Toronto general manager, Michael Lende, recalls that, initially, when he'd walk into a room to talk about his operation, "people didn't know what car sharing was. Some 18 months after we came, I'd walk in and they'd report the definition to me."
Having his company treated as irrelevant and his market as practically virgin terrain was merely irritating to McLaughlin compared to the pain of the Great Parking Land Rush that followed. Offering numerous convenient locations-be they private and municipal lots or just a few spaces rented from a restaurant, a gas station or the like-is a key competitive advantage in this business. When, shortly after Zipcar's arrival, McLaughlin told a reporter that AutoShare was paying $75 a month per spot to park its cars at a Loblaws on the east side of downtown, Zipcar offered more.
The same pattern repeated elsewhere. As a result, AutoShare's average parking cost jumped from $80 a spot to $200. "Now, there's a new category at every parking company called 'car-sharing,' that Zipcar created, that's fixed and extremely expensive," says McLaughlin. (By way of response to the parking imbroglio, Zipcar PR head John Williams says, "Our goal is to make our cars broadly available to as many members and potential members as possible, and parking spots are obviously important." )
McLaughlin admits that Zipcar's intensive marketing grew the market for both companies. But as AutoShare tried to keep up-lowering prices, adding cars and tripling its annual marketing budget-it dropped into the red.
And the bad blood has continued, at least on McLaughlin's side. The two firms recently teamed up to lobby the city for permission to park their cars on the streets. "The minute something gets signed, they come out with a press release saying, 'Zipcar has got Toronto's first on-street parking spot,'." fumes McLaughlin. "So, okay, now I have to put out a press release saying AutoShare did that too? It would have had better impact to do it together." Lende's take on the rivalry: "We have a very healthy competitive situation, and consumers benefit by having more choice."
But if Zipcar is aggressive, it's also smart. The company has long focused on university students, offering cars to people as young as 21 (most rental-car agencies don't rent to drivers under 25). Not only do students tend to lack vehicles but, after graduation, they gravitate to coastal cities where the company also has outlets. Zipcar now has pods at more than 150 campuses in North America. Most of these are exclusive deals, with the institutions guaranteeing the company a minimum monthly revenue.
As well, the Zipcar fleet tends to be trendier than that of its rivals, including models such as Volkswagen Beetles and Golfs. It's also newer: Most of its vehicles are less than three years old, while other car-shares generally spread their car investments over six years.
To streamline the rental process, Zipcar has plowed money into technology, offering keyless car entry (instead of keys in lockboxes), a sophisticated online booking system and mobile phone reservations. Its investment in choice parking has paid off with greater customer convenience. "I can usually get a car within a 10-minute walk, max, of my home or office," says Lesley Grant, a Toronto television executive who signed up with Zipcar after checking out both companies. "The cars are kept in excellent condition and there are a number of models available."
Four years after its arrival, Zipcar dominates the Toronto market, with about 350 cars-64% more than AutoShare. Today, Zipcar has more than 400,000 worldwide members in more than 50 cities-Vancouver being the only Canadian operation besides Toronto-and $130 million (U.S.) in revenues (2009).
But Zipcar's rivals like to point out that the company has yet to turn a profit-it lost $5 million (U.S.) in the quarter ending March 31. It's also fighting a class-action suit over additional fees that are alleged to be unlawfully high. In an SEC filing related to the IPO that it is making in a low market, Zipcar acknowledges that it plans to use the funding to cover debts and pay back venture funders (notably Goldman Sachs).
The intensification of competition is not over yet. Hertz, Enterprise Rent-A-Car and U-Haul have all launched car-sharing operations in the past few years. Hertz has been particularly aggressive on the college front. "In the markets where Connect by Hertz operates, [car share] prices tend to be lower," notes Nima Samadi, an analyst with research company IBISWorld.
Enterprise has fewer locations than Hertz, but once it ramps up, Samadi believes it could become a huge force because it already has many city-centre outlets. Rental-car agencies-a $24-billion (U.S.) industry-can leverage their existing infrastructures in a way that's impossible for car-sharing outfits. And with a multinational presence, the big companies can globalize a business that to date has been largely local.
Car makers are also intrigued, seeing car sharing as a way to tap future buyers, test new technologies and paint themselves green. In 2000, Ford Motor Co.'s chairman told a British newspaper, "If you live in a city, you don't need to own a car." (The quote is now posted on many car-sharing websites.) While Ford has yet to introduce car sharing, Daimler AG started Car2Go in Austin, Texas, last year, and several other automakers have launched pilot projects or subsidiaries overseas.
Meanwhile, car-sharing's customer profile is changing, with business and government increasingly signing up. Zipcar's Lende says a number of companies, large and small, have set up corporate accounts with his firm, drawn by the significant savings over cab fares and the convenience of having cars nearby. Condo developers are also looking to partnerships with car-shares to help them reduce parking spaces and even to get LEED points.
Now that all North American cities with subway systems have at least one car-share operation, the industry's focus is shifting to smaller centres that are much harder to crack. Frost & Sullivan analyst David Zhao estimates that a car-sharing business requires density of 1,000 people per square kilometre and car usage rates of 45% for weekdays and 60% for weekends. Canada's sparse population has made for-profit car sharing a challenge outside the three biggest cities. Only Ottawa's Vrtucar and CarShareHFX in Halifax operate as businesses. The dozen or so other outfits around the country are non-profits and co-ops.
Smaller cities and suburban markets may have to wait for new car-sharing models to evolve, such as so-called peer-to-peer car sharing, where individuals enroll their cars in a pool from which others can rent when they're available (think Napster for transportation). Because the operator does not own the cars, the upfront investment is minimal. McLaughlin calls it "the software solution," because the key element is the online system for managing vehicle inventory. The concept is young and has many uncertainties: Who deals with roadside breakdowns? How do you handle insurance? But if the idea gains traction with consumers, Zhao believes "it will change the whole picture of urban transportation."
McLaughlin, however, sees peer-to-peer as a transitional solution with a built-in flaw. "If you own enough car to share, why own the car at all?" Instead, he sees companies like his that already have the customer-support infrastructure one day renting vehicles from individuals-on weekends, say, when some owners don't use their cars much but AutoShare experiences high demand. It's just one of many innovations integrating car sharing, carpooling and public transit that he believes will emerge to solve the growing problems of congestion, pollution and high transportation costs. Urban transportation visionaries predict a general shift away from car ownership to using cars as a service.
But the legal framework, especially in Canada, is lagging market innovation. McLaughlin points out that the same Ontario bill that made it illegal to send text messages while driving also finally lifted the legal cloud hanging over carpooling. But some methods for sharing rides-such as airport shuttle buses-remain illegal in Toronto. And don't get McLaughlin started on the subject of parking. "We're building condos with parking for the car culture from the 1950s," he says with a shake of his head. Toronto, however, recently approved the first condominium in the city that proposes to eliminate parking except for a few spots for shared cars. (City regulations set out minimum ratios of units to parking spots, yet many developers end up with unsold spaces.)
While environmental consciousness has taken a back seat to convenience and savings in car sharing's promotion, the green credo remains strong. Car-shares mainly use small, fuel-efficient cars, and are expected to lead the transition to electric vehicles, with one in five new shared cars being electric by 2016 in Frost & Sullivan's forecast.
Still, as the industry motors toward mainstream success, it faces a paradox. Most car-share operations cite research showing that vehicle sharing reduces driving-though the numbers vary wildly, each shared car is being credited with replacing anywhere from six to 30 private cars. Yet if shared cars become as ubiquitous and convenient as AutoShare envisions-"a shared vehicle within a five-minute walk of anywhere in the city; at every [subway] station; and at the end of your street" -would we really drive less? We'd need fewer cars, but lots of people without vehicle access today would be able to take to the road.
Tensions, meanwhile, are emerging as an industry that began as a community effort adjusts to an increasingly profit-driven marketplace. McLaughlin is one of the founders of an international association that is closed to anyone "who might steal our ideas and use them against us," he says, but there's debate whether it should welcome the likes of Zipcar and Hertz.
And there is McLaughlin's own conflicted situation. He says that the non-profits are wary of the for-profit operators selling out to those enemies, but adds, "Everyone's got a price." Even if you're as crunchy as granola, he argues that it may be sensible to use sale proceeds to pursue your goals more effectively.
At the same time, he refuses to see Zipcar as simply a more successful, better-funded and arguably better-run version of AutoShare. Zipcar's service happens to bring green benefits, says McLaughlin, but he insists it's an organization that "could just as easily be selling McDonald's hamburgers." Yet, like AutoShare, Zipcar was the brainchild of green acolytes. Its founder, Robin Chase, remains a fervent advocate of car reduction who now guides one of the peer-to-peer start-ups, GoLoco.
McLaughlin seems saddened by the shift to a harsher market climate. "When I started in this business, it was a movement," he says wistfully. "Initially, everyone helped everyone."
It's a fundamental dilemma at the heart of green business-wanting to do good but also wanting to do well. The environmentalist in McLaughlin may feel virtue is on his side, but the entrepreneur in him can't hide a touch of envy, even respect, for Zipcar's success. He points out that AutoShare now generates annual revenue of $5 million and has been in the black for the past four years. Asked what's more important to him, that the company be profitable or socially constructive, he laughs: "The beauty is that I don't have to choose."
But he doesn't take the question lightly. "Until I pay off all my debts, I need for this to be profitable," he says. "For me, what's important is to be sustainable." For a green businessman, that's a well-chosen word.
***
In Quebec, a distinct advantage
On June 1, the day Zipcar Inc. revealed its intention to go public, another announcement ricocheted around the car-sharing community: Communauto, the Montreal-based company that pioneered the industry in North America, hailed a deal to add 50 Nissan Leafs to its fleet-the first car-share to significantly commit to electric vehicles. It's a huge investment, considering EVs' untested cold-weather performance and the scant infrastructure for charging the cars. But at the press conference, Communauto president Benoît Robert proclaimed, "We want to change behaviour. We don't think technology [alone] will change the automobile problem."
Finding innovative ways to lower car usage is the rallying cry of the whole car-sharing industry. What's distinct about Communauto is its exceptional success at accomplishing that end profitably.
Robert was a student at Laval University in Quebec City when he launched a car-sharing club in 1994. Within a year, he turned it into a business with "an environmental, social and human mission," according to Marco Viviani, Communauto's director of business development and Robert's top lieutenant.
Today, Communauto is North America's second-largest car-share, after Zipcar, by vehicle and member counts. Communauto operates in just four cities, all in Quebec-Montreal, Quebec City, Sherbrooke and Gatineau-and has grown organically, with a modest marketing investment. Its fleet boasts more than 1,000 vehicles, and in some Montreal neighbourhoods, more than 5% of residents are members of Communauto.
The company's success is due in part to Quebec's relatively low insurance rates. Communauto can offer significantly lower rates than most car-shares. The low cost, in turn, draws more customers. Communauto's cars have usage rates of 11 to 15 hours per day, compared to the industry average of seven to eight, says Viviani.
The company has woven itself into the urban fabric by partnering with local transportation organizations. Members who have transit passes get rebates on car-shares. Communauto is also running a pilot project with Quebec City taxis, enabling members to get discounted vouchers for cabs through their Communauto accounts. The company has a discount deal with Montreal bike-sharing service Bixi. "The idea is, don't own a car. Have different solutions in your pocket," says Viviani.
Robert is known in the industry as an idealist who draws a sharp line between car-shares that emphasize the public good and those that stress profits. But for those he deems allies, he's happy to offer assistance and partnership. Communauto has teamed up with the smaller Ottawa car-share Vrtucar to allow members to use both organizations' vehicles. The company is also not averse to partnering with potential rivals. For example, during busy summer months, when Communauto sometimes runs low on vehicles, it sends clients to Enterprise Rent-A-Car, to name one collaborating agency, where they can rent cars at reduced prices (Communauto gets a cut of the transaction). It's even tapped the so-called peer-to-peer car-sharing model, and is planning to launch a pilot project that enables members to rent their cars to others.
Communauto's deep roots have discouraged rivals from entering Quebec. Though Zipcar visited Communauto a few years back, it has so far stayed out of the province.

Retail rubber hits the road at Ontario pit stops

Author: Kryhul, Angela

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/retail-rubber-hits-road-at-ontario-pit-stops/docview/748333158/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: When all 23 stations are converted to the Canadian Tire brand, the pumps will generate more than 6 million 40-litre fill-ups a year, says Mr. [Bruce Allen]. "That's 6 million opportunities to interact with Canadian motorists and hopefully create a very positive experience. And we see an opportunity to cross-merchandise into Canadian Tire stores, Canadian Tire financial-services credit cards, and so on," Mr. Allen says. "There is terrific brand exposure."

Full text: Builder-operator of 23 new service centres finds a lucrative demographic along two of Canada's busiest highways
You're zooming down the highway trying to reach your destination quickly, but with low fuel, hungry kids and a near-bursting bladder, you're due for a roadside break.
Then you picture the rest stop - dingy building, greasy food, scary washrooms. Maybe you can hold off till the next service centre, or the next?
If you had the chance to redesign a chain of rest stops along a major highway, what would they look like? Ontario is in the midst of overhauling its 23 service stations lining highways 401 and 400, which are Canada's busiest motorways. The goal is to redefine the rest stop experience for the 500,000-plus young, affluent and well-educated motorists who drive these routes every day.
The winner of the 50-year contract to design, build, finance, operate and maintain the chain of service centres - Host Kilmer Service Centres (HKSC), a partnership of Maryland's HMSHost and Ontario's Kilmer Van Nostrand Co. Ltd. - is tearing down 20, 1960s-era centres and replacing them with stone, wood and glass buildings designed to LEED Silver environmental standards.
Come September, when seven centres are fully operational, and by 2012 when an additional 13 come online, travellers can expect the following: two convenience stores per site; more than a dozen quick-service restaurant brands throughout the network; roomier washrooms; free WiFi service; and pet exercise areas. Some of the parking lots will have kiosks where local farmers will sell fresh Ontario produce. The new centres also present a retail opportunity that comes around once in a lifetime.
A study commissioned by HMSHost Corp. found that more than 50 per cent of motorists on highways 400 and 401 are non-commercial travellers made up of regular commuters, summer tourists, cottage owners and weekend travellers. Drivers are predominantly 25 to 40 years old, college- or university-educated, and have families with young or teenage children. The average household income is more than $75,000 a year.
As retail opportunities go, the chance to get in on something like this is very rare, says Bruce Allen, president of Canadian Tire Petroleum. HKSC picked Canadian Tire to manage the fuel service stations and to install convenience stores adjacent to the pumps. The conversion of all 23 sites to the Canadian Tire gas brand will take place over time as leases with the previous fuel providers expire. The gas stations at 20 of the service centres will have converted to Canadian Tire by 2011.
The highway service centres are a first for Canadian Tire Petroleum, which manages 272 gas stations and 267 Gas+ convenience stores across the country. The deal makes business sense, Mr. Allen says, because these highway drivers are also Canadian Tire's target audience.
Their needs will be reflected in the Gas+ merchandise mix, Mr. Allen says. Besides the usual assortment of beverages and snacks, there will be kids' games and toys, DVDs, books on CD, sunscreen, insect repellent, propane for barbeques and some camping gear.
The 24-hour pumps will be the first LEED Silver gas stations in Canada, Mr. Allen says. The company has even installed the infrastructure for electric vehicle charging stations. "We wanted to be pro-active for when we need to satisfy consumer demand," he says.
When all 23 stations are converted to the Canadian Tire brand, the pumps will generate more than 6 million 40-litre fill-ups a year, says Mr. Allen. "That's 6 million opportunities to interact with Canadian motorists and hopefully create a very positive experience. And we see an opportunity to cross-merchandise into Canadian Tire stores, Canadian Tire financial-services credit cards, and so on," Mr. Allen says. "There is terrific brand exposure."
HKSC has signed up more than a dozen international and Canadian-owned fast-food restaurant brands, including Tim Hortons, Casey's, East Side Mario's, Extreme Pita, Pizza Pizza, Teriyaki Experience, Yogen Früz, Cinnabon, Starbucks Coffee, A & W, Burger King, Brioche Doree, Cold Stone Creamery and Quiznos.
The selection will vary from centre to centre, according to HMSHost: "We take into account the size of the centre and the lineup of quick service offerings from end to end of the highways. The intent is to create different choices at each centre to encourage several stops along the way and provide variety to travellers who may want one meal when headed in one direction, and a different meal upon the return trip."
The choice of restaurants is meant to add variety and healthier foods. It may also reflect exclusive relationships that HMSHost already has with such companies as Tim Hortons, Burger King, Quiznos and Starbucks. Drilling down even further, Tim Hortons has its own co-branding arrangement with Cold Stone Creamery.
It will be interesting to see how HKSC mixes its anchor tenants with complementary food service providers, says analyst Jim Danahy, managing principal at consultancy CustomerLAB.
Pairing a mainstay like Tim Hortons with Cold Stone Creamery, for example, could add "a little sizzle to the steak," he says. However, getting the combinations right could be tricky: "I bet it will take a couple of years to shake out who makes it and who doesn't."
Pusateri's, the Toronto-area gourmet supermarket, is an intriguing name on the food-service roster, Mr. Danahy says. The grocer and HKSC are still in negotiations and declined comment on how the partnership will take shape.
Among the options, Mr. Danahy says, are Pusateri's-branded grab-and-go foods sold in convenience stores. Or Pusateri's might set up a pasta bar or even a mini-grocery store, Mr. Danahy suggests.
"The notion of mini-grocery is a rapidly expanding component of convenience and gas retailing," Mr. Danahy says. "It is a major retail category that's been growing in real estate and square footage for five years."
As far as the overall user experience goes, the province says it will keep a close eye on the service centres. "The provincial government will monitor conditions and services at the centres, while HKSC is required to submit monthly reports about the performance of the service centres and will measure customer satisfaction on a regular basis," says Ministry of Transportation spokeswoman Emna Dhahak.
"It'll be interesting to see if they have now created a holistic view of the rest stop for the 21st century," Mr. Danahy says.
**********
REST-STOP FACTS
* The redevelopment cost for the first 20 service centres is about $300-million, of which the Ontario government is putting up $200-million and HKSC, $100-million.
* Total sales revenue for owner-operator HKSC is projected to be $100-million a year, or $9-billion over the 50-year term.

Full text: jaryan@globeandmail.com
There's an old adage in the publishing trade, attributed to William Randolph Hearst, that any magazine with a picture of a beautiful girl, a dog or a baby on the cover will be eagerly snapped up by the public. On television, all you need is the baby. Or several babies.
Quints by Surprise (TLC, 10 p.m.) is the newest entry in big-brood reality series designed to tug at viewer heartstrings. If only the Dionne quintuplets could have cashed in like this.
Naturally the new show originates from TLC, the U.S. cable channel that previously gave viewers such family-friendly fare as Jon & Kate Plus 8, 19 Kids and Counting, Table for 12 and Kids by the Dozen . Most likely Planned Parenthood canvassers give the TLC building a wide berth.
In this instance, viewers are introduced to a decent enough young Texan couple named Casey and Ethan Jones, who spent considerable time and money on fertility treatments to have a baby a few years back.
Not long after the birth of their daughter, Eliot, they decided she needed a brother or sister, so they tried the same fertility procedure again. Nine months later, the family of three was a family of eight, and suddenly reality-TV cameras were all over the house. Ain't that America? But hey, it's a blessing. The quints arrived in January, 2009, and the Jones clan was first introduced in a Discovery Channel special titled Too Many Babies?
Now the kids are at the 18-month stage and unbearably cuddly. Tonight's special is their coming-out party, of sorts, before the show settles into a regular Monday timeslot next week.
In some ways, it's amazing to see how far the multiple-bassinet genre has evolved in the few short years since Jon & Kate Plus 8 became a hit with viewers.
Tonight's introductory special naturally follows the quints tumbling around like cute little teddy bears at a picnic, but there's equal time devoted to the cold reality of having to pay for five tiny tots.
The concept does not shy away from the financial problems, and filming took place around the same time the real-estate market dropped in the Austin, Tex., area where they reside. Although their family is bursting at the seams, the Joneses are forced to sell their large home and downsize.
Big family shows are a narrow slice of the reality genre, of course, and regular viewers are already intimately familiar with the woes of the Gosselin clan, particularly their messy divorce.
There doesn't seem much likelihood of that happening in the Jones household. On first glance, Casey and Ethan appear to be solid, if slightly bewildered, life-partners, and fully devoted to launching these kids into the world. Like most parents, they're making it up as they go along.
As reality shows go, it feels more honest than the old Jon & Kate show, in case that matters. And there's more of the same coming soon.
Yes, it's true. TLC will expand its reality family even further with the upcoming series Sextuplets Take New York , which has a due date of Sept. 14.
The new arrival will follow the daily lives of Victor and Digna Carpio, a working-class couple raising cute-as-a-bug sextuplets - four boys, two girls - in downtown Queens, N.Y. In recent promos, TLC is deriving great mileage from the fact that the family is billed as America's first Latino sextuplets. Ay caramba .
Oh, and whatever happened to those eight Gosselin kids? The kids are a few years older now and the show has been transformed into a single-mom travelogue series called Kate Plus 8 (TLC, 9 p.m.).
Papa Jon seems to have disappeared into the ether, but Kate is still around and keeping her profile up to pay the bills. Last night, you may have noticed, she was working the red carpet for Entertainment Tonight . A single mom does what she has to these days. Check local listings.
John Doyle will return.
********
Also airing
Lie to Me (Fox, Global, 9 p.m.) recently switched to a later timeslot, which actually makes sense considering some of the storylines. In tonight's new episode, human lie-detector Cal Lightman (Tim Roth) ventures into the seamy adult-film industry to find a missing girl.
Dating in the Dark (ABC, CITY-TV, 10 p.m.) is still going on and still defies belief. Tonight, six of the remaining singles put on swimsuits to spend time together on a makeshift beach set in a pitch-black darkroom. As before, the infra-red footage makes them look like deer caught in the headlights.

of Northern Lights
TVO, 7 p.m.
Joanna Lumley explores her inner wanderlust in this offbeat BBC documentary.

Week after week, this series has been delivering some of the best Canadian documentaries of recent memory. Tonight's chapter, titled Dads Who Fought Back , follows the emotional and acrimonious child custody battles of two desperate fathers.

Til Debt Do Us Part
Slice, 9 p.m.
Arguably the strongest show on Slice's nightly lineup, this series relies on the common-sense advice of financial planner Gail Vaz-Oxlade.

The Captain Bligh
Conspiracy: Revealed
History, 7 p.m.

Comedy Central Roast
of David Hasselhoff

REALITY
Intervention
A & E, 7 p.m.

At an early age, Joe was taught how to obtain a cheap high via the "choking game," in which an individual uses his hands to cut off his oxygen supply.

FOOD
Glutton for Punishment
Food, 7:30 p.m.

The rules allow amateur stompers five furious minutes to produce as much wine as possible. Always game for a challenge, Blumer takes lessons from a pro stomper, and then boldly ventures into the vats. COMEDY
Hot in Cleveland
CTV, 8 p.m.
Riding on the heat of Betty White, this series is the hottest TV sitcom since Modern Family - even though it emanates from the lower-rung cable channel TV Land. The concept involves a pure seventies-style sitcom setup: Faded 40-something glamour gals Melanie, Joy and Victoria (Valerie Bertinelli, Jane Leeves, Wendie Malick) are en route from L.A. to Paris when their plane makes a stop in Cleveland, Ohio.

Shaq Vs.
ABC, CTV, 9 p.m.

Primetime: Crime
ABC, 10 p.m.
Yet another limited docu-series airing under the Primetime banner launches tonight.

The opener profiles several people who have lead double lives, with varying degrees of success.

TEEN
Victorious
YTV, 7 p.m.
If pedigree still counts, this new series is already a hit. Developed for Nickelodeon by teen-TV kingpin Dan Schneider - who previously created the series iCarl y , Zoey 101 and Drake and Josh - the sitcom setup this time revolves around aspiring pop singer Tori Vega, played by Victoria Justice, who lives in the shadow of her pop-star older sister while attending the elite Hollywood Arts High School. Tori's classmates include the aspiring ventriloquist Robbie (Matt Bennett) and a very nervous girl named Cat (Ariana Grande). The show debuted to record numbers on Nickelodeon last spring.
REALITY
Masterchef
Fox, CTV, 8 p.m.
Has anyone else noticed that TV chef Gordon Ramsay is kinder and gentler in this series compared to his earlier programs like Hell's Kitchen and Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares ? Most likely it's because he's dealing with home cooks and stay-at-home moms instead of amateur chefs. In this week's team challenge, the contestants venture outside the kitchen and their comfort range to cater a swanky wedding. All is going swimmingly until somebody misplaces the main course.
DRAMA
Criminal Minds
CBS, 9 p.m.
Originally broadcast last season, tonight's episode of the sturdy crime procedural is the 100th in the series - and one of the most nerve-wracking. Special agent Rossi (Joe Mantegna) and fellow members of the Behavioural Analysis Unit work overtime to help special agent Hotchner (Thomas Gibson) save his family from the serial killer known as The Reaper before it's too late. Eighties movie fixture C. Thomas Howell delivers a nasty guest turn as The Reaper.
DRAMA
Rescue Me
Showcase, 10 p.m.
It's back. This gritty comedy-drama returns for a sixth season of stories set in the world of New York firefighters. The new season begins with central character Tommy Gavin (Denis Leary) still shaken by his brief glimpse of the afterlife. At the same time, he's suspicious that his wife Janet (Andrea Roth) has been unfaithful during his absence. Elsewhere, the rookie Damien (Michael Zegen) begins to question his future as a firefighter.
THURSDAY

FOOD
Restaurant Makeover
TVtropolis, 6 p.m.
Fast and funny for a food series, this show has a blessedly simple format: Each episode in the series challenges two restaurant hotshots to renovate and relaunch an eatery fallen on hard times. And that's it. Tonight's episode focuses on a Big Apple restaurant named Ristorante Roma, which needs the help. Owners and real-life couple Laura and Biaggo have run the place for 30 years, but business has dwindled and the pressure is putting a strain on their marriage. Celebrity chef David Adjey and designer Cheryl Torrenueva provide them with some much-needed restaurant therapy, and a makeover.
MOVIE
Once Upon a Time in the West
TCM, 8 p.m.
Although Italian director Sergio Leone is better known for the films The Good, the Bad the Ugly and A Fistful of Dollars , this movie is his masterpiece. Released in 1968, the story casts Claudia Cardinale as a widow whose land is being sought by a greedy railroad magnate. Her only defenders: A steely-eyed gunslinger (Charles Bronson) and an affable outlaw (Jason Robards), who eventually cross paths with the magnate's ruthless hired gun, played by Henry Fonda in a startling against-type performance. The musical score by Ennio Morricone is letter-perfect. MUSIC
Rise Up: Canadian Pop Music in the 80s
CBC, 9 p.m.
If you grew up as a teenager in the eighties, this program will bring back memories. A combination of concert clips, music videos and interviews, the special recalls the heady days when Canadians actually listened to Canadian pop music, as performed by the likes of Men Without Hats, Glass Tiger, Cowboy Junkies and Red Rider. There's also proper attention paid to those Canadian talents who reached success around the world, including Daniel Lanois, Leonard Cohen and, of course, Neil Young. Narrated by CBC's Jian Ghomeshi.
HISTORY
Trashopolis
History, 10 p.m.
Launching tonight, this five-part series looks at the histories of the world's great cities - and how they dealt with their trash. The first episode focuses on London, and rewinds the clock all the way back to 43 AD, when workers used mounds of trash to support the docks of the Roman outpost of Londinium. As the city of London grew, so did the daily output of garbage. And were you aware that an Englishman invented the world's first toilet? It's true.

Abstract: Woodlawn was in this injured state when the present owner bought the property in 1995. His ongoing contribution to the house and its history since around 2000 has been a mix of historical preservation and sensible modernization. He has restored the principal doorway to its central place on the long side of the house's volume, where [John George Howard], following Palladio's example, had intended it to be.

Full text: John George Howard-designed mansion a beautifully restored reminder of Toronto's past
jmays@globeandmail.com
For many well-to-do politicians, lawyers and businessmen in early Victorian Toronto, the perfect house was a rural villa up Yonge Street, on the picturesque rise of land north of the built-up village of Yorkville, and far from the busy wharves, warehouses and immigrant tenements of Front Street.
Some of these people hired fashionable local architects, constructed and lived in their dream homes for a while, though almost all the mansions vanished when the once-expansive estates on which they stood were divided into small residential lots in the later nineteenth century. If these pleasant houses, with their handsome stables and orchards and gracious sociability, are remembered at all today, it's because they have left a trace in the names of streets and neighbourhoods such as Summerhill, Farnham, Humewood and Rathnelly.
But at least one still exists. Last week, I visited Woodlawn, as this brick architectural survivor has been known since its construction on a 12-acre site in 1841. (Today, it is nestled deep among sturdy family homes built later along Woodlawn and Walker avenues.)
Designed by high-society Toronto architect John George Howard, who had earlier done Colborne Lodge on his suburban estate of High Park, the original parts of Woodlawn embody the ideals of Georgian taste in country-house building. These sober, anti-urban values include the very plain, symmetrical façade treatment popularized by Palladio in his rural projects, enormous windows (the better to frame views of the gardens and countryside), and a shallow veranda with ornamental Gothic ogee arches between slender pillars.
The interior of what's left of the original house speaks even more clearly about the Palladian roots of Howard's Georgian style. The rooms used by the present owner as a study and a formal dining area are not vast, but they are majestically proportioned. Especially in the study, the crown moulding and tall windows - which have been preserved from John Howard's time - are elegant and restrained components of this highly successful room.
As you can imagine, Woodlawn has undergone numerous changes over its long career, not all of them favourable to Howard's 1841 scheme. The first of these transformations took place after 1845, when ownership of the estate passed from Howard's client, the prosperous lawyer William Hume Blake, to the future railway magnate Joseph Curran Morrison. A horticulturalist as well as a powerful businessman, Morrison built a conservatory and heated greenhouses adjacent to the house.
Subdivision of the estate by Morrison's heirs might have been the end of Woodlawn's story - had it not been for a certain reluctance on the part of these heirs to see the dwelling demolished then and there. They saved the house, while stripping back much of the land on which it stood.
But they did not remain kind to Woodlawn. In 1886, a Morrison child lopped some 1,200 square feet off the 7,300-square-foot original structure. (The reason is not known.) Around the same time, a "modern" two-storey annex - viz., ordinary to the point of being factory-like - was tacked on perpendicular to the long axis of Howard's plan.
Woodlawn was in this injured state when the present owner bought the property in 1995. His ongoing contribution to the house and its history since around 2000 has been a mix of historical preservation and sensible modernization. He has restored the principal doorway to its central place on the long side of the house's volume, where Howard, following Palladio's example, had intended it to be. But he has also retained certain embellishments of owners after Howard's time - a florid staircase that sweeps up to the upper storey, for example - and faithfully cast and reused some later Victorian mouldings.
And at the owner's request, Toronto architect Peter Turner brought back just over 2,000 square feet to the garden façade of the building. This addition has been done with effective sensitivity to the architectural fabric of John Howard's original structure - the exterior is clad in a modern compound that mimics very well the rugged plaster of lime, shells and pebbles used to cover the oldest brick surfaces - but it brings the interior up to date: The part of the house facing the garden is now an open-plan ensemble of kitchen, informal dining room, and living room, all opening outward through tall French doors.
Today, Woodlawn is what an old house should be: not frozen in time or reconstructed with archaeological accuracy and rigour, but a richly layered document of the many lives lived within its walls.

Property firm building foundation for dividend

Author: Taylor, Fabrice

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/property-firm-building-foundation-dividend/docview/747416939/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Mr. [Bob Dhillon] doesn't rule out a dividend, but he seems reluctant to go in that direction now (technically, it's the board's decision, but he's chairman and major shareholder so he has veto power). He says he wants to finish stabilizing his units (that is renovating them), get rid of rental incentives that are running at $4-million a year, spend some money on maintenance and squeeze some more rent out of his properties.

Full text: Fabrice Taylor is a Chartered Financial Analyst.
It's time we stopped using the S & P TSX index to measure the health of the stock market. It's deeply flawed. For starters, it goes down way too often. How is that helpful?
Not all stocks are going down though. Dividend stocks are stealthily rising - some of them, anyway. Look at BCE or Atco (both recommended in this space, I hasten to add). Investors apparently want to own companies that send them cheques every three months or so.
Stocks that might pay dividends are also doing relatively well. You wonder why more companies don't. Take Mainstreet Equity, a real estate concern out of Calgary that focuses on smaller rental properties.
The company has about 10 million shares outstanding and a market cap of $110-million.
Although most of its buildings are in places where the local economy is sensitive to commodity prices - Alberta and Saskatchewan, notably - the company has done surprisingly well. It emerged from the recession in better shape than it went in by some measures, generating enough cash to buy back four million shares.
And while it has a very good record of buying and occasionally selling properties, it's been a laggard operationally, with stubbornly high vacancy. But that's changing too, and fast: the vacancy rate fell to 10 per cent from 19 per cent last year. Mainstreet's business model means it will always have a relatively high vacancy rate but it was higher than necessary before management rolled up its sleeves and beat it down to much more profitable levels. It's still falling fast.
Funds from operations on a per-share basis are rising nicely, up 36 per cent in the nine months to June 30, to 45 cents.
By and large, things are looking up for this company, whose stock I own. Most investment dealers that cover it rate it a "strong buy" with big upside.
I think it should pay a dividend. The company can probably generate 80 cents a share of cash in relatively short order. Despite having spent $26-million buying back stock last year, it has $6-million in the bank.
And it can finance unmortgaged properties and refinance existing debt to put another $60-million in the coffers - in total, that's more than $6 a share. Plus it's generating a growing stream of cash flow. I think it could pay a dividend, and I'm not alone.
TD Newcrest says Mainstreet could pay a 34-cent dividend in 2011, giving the stock a roughly 3-per-cent yield using today's price. "A dividend would be a positive catalyst for the stock," says the analyst, whose target is $14. The stock is $11 now.
Buying back more stock isn't really an option. CEO Bob Dhillon owns about 40 per cent of it and the float is already pretty thin.
Mr. Dhillon doesn't rule out a dividend, but he seems reluctant to go in that direction now (technically, it's the board's decision, but he's chairman and major shareholder so he has veto power). He says he wants to finish stabilizing his units (that is renovating them), get rid of rental incentives that are running at $4-million a year, spend some money on maintenance and squeeze some more rent out of his properties. (Mainstreet's business model is to buy up low-rent buildings, spruce them up and raise the rents.) More importantly, he wants to acquire more properties when prices are low and financing is cheap. He says he can borrow five-year money for less than 3 per cent and prices are softening.
But if so, why did the company buy back four million shares? That buyback didn't stop Mainstreet from buying buildings.
"Because it was the best use of cash at that time, when the stock was about $6. Now the best use is to bulk up," he says.
I think he could do it all, and I suspect he might. It would be good for the stock price.
Mainstreet Equity
Thursday's close $11.18, up 18 cents

Making a profit from problem properties

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/making-profit-problem-properties/docview/746403173/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "We always pay market value when we take over a property and we never sell low because there's no need for us to engage in fire sales," said Gordon McIvor, Canada Lands' vice-president of strategic acquisitions. "We have the luxury of time and remediation. When we sell, we are getting maximum value for those assets."

Full text: REAL ESTATE REPORTER
The Dominion Building in downtown Charlottetown was every landlord's nightmare when the federal government declared it surplus to its needs.
The feds had built a new home for its employees on the island, leaving the run-down six-storey building without a single tenant to occupy its 176,000 square feet of office space. The 55-year-old property was in need of some major repairs and would be unlikely to fetch much beyond its scrap value on the open market.
There was only one real option: sell it to Canada Lands, a Crown corporation that has been discreetly disposing of problem properties for 15 years. It was a good call - Canada Lands sold the building last week for $1-million, twice as much as it paid in 2007.
The agency has been working behind the scenes for 15 years, but has suddenly found itself the subject of global interest as governments from around the world send delegations to learn how Canada turns a profit on properties that would be difficult to sell without improvements and updating.
In the past few months it has hosted delegations from China, the United States and Eastern Europe.
They are all interested in the same thing - how to redevelop government properties such as abandoned army bases in a way that they earn profits for the taxpayers instead of only the developers.
"We always pay market value when we take over a property and we never sell low because there's no need for us to engage in fire sales," said Gordon McIvor, Canada Lands' vice-president of strategic acquisitions. "We have the luxury of time and remediation. When we sell, we are getting maximum value for those assets."
Foreign governments are interested for one main reason - Canada Lands has never received a cent of federal funding and has paid $370-million in dividends to the state. It has spent about $61-million on environmental improvements to its properties, and every building and piece of land in its sizable portfolio will eventually be sold to the private sector.
Mr. McIvor points to an executive order issued in June by U.S. President Barrack Obama in which he called for the government to undertake a review of its properties with an eye of unloading surplus space onto the private sector as a sign the Canadian government has been ahead of the rest of the world in dealing with unwanted properties.
Here at home, the government's decisions about what is and is not surplus has led to the creation of a quirky portfolio of properties for Canada Lands to deal with. It owns five military bases (it has already redeveloped and sold six others), a trendy housing development in Calgary, a bustling industrial park in Burnaby, B.C., and plots of land in the downtown cores of many of the country's largest cities.
In each case, it buys the property and then consults with the local governments about what each site's best use would be. If there are environmental issues - many old military homes are packed with asbestos, for example - it will take care of them before marketing the site to developers.
Its most high profile holdings are in downtown Toronto, where it inherited the CN Tower, the Metro Toronto Convention Centre and the Intercontinental Hotel as a side effect of CN Rail's initial public offering in 1995.
The properties could be sold at any time, at least in theory, but Queen's University real estate professor John Andrew said Canada Lands is a convenient way for the government to park valuable properties it doesn't want to be seen as holding onto as a landlord. "The role of Canada Lands is a bit odd because on the surface of it their job is to dispose of real estate assets, yet they hold some for a long time and others are really not for sale," he said.
"Some of these are so unusual that it is difficult to determine their fair market value, or for any buyer to offer what they might be worth to the government," he said. "If the asset is of great value to a wide range of potential buyers - an office building with government tenants, for example - one wonders why the government is selling it at all."
Mr. McIvor insists every property is on the table except the CN Tower. Everything else in downtown Toronto - the hotel and convention centre as well as an office tower - will make it to market at some point.
"Since the company does not engage in fire sales and because of the serious economic downtown last year, the properties have not yet been put on the market but we intend to do so in the near future," Mr. McIvor said.
That could happen as soon as this fall. The Canadian commercial real estate market rebounded sharply in the first half of the year from the recessionary lows of 2009, up around 60 per cent compared to the year earlier period.
If ever there was a time to sell, he said, this may be it.
"The interesting thing about being a large national organization is we can have a balanced approach to development and hold on to things until the time is right," he said. "You'll see three very big commercial announcements from Canada Lands this fall in three different areas of the country."

PORTFOLIO SNAPSHOT
CN Tower, Toronto
Inherited from CN Rail in 1995 when the company left government hands via an initial public offering, Canada Lands also took over the Metro Toronto Convention Centre and the attached Intercontinental Hotel. It also owns the land beneath the Rogers Centre.
CFB Calgary
The former 200-acre army base is now divided into three hip sub-divisions called Currie Barracks, Garrison Woods and Garrison Green. They will collectively have about 5,000 housing units, with some retail mixed in for good measure and are built to LEED Gold environmental standards.
Glenlyon Business Park, Burnaby, B.C.
Located on 133 acres bordering the Fraser River, the business park was also acquired by Canada Lands from CN Railway in 1995. Tenants include Nokia, Future Shop/Best Buy and Ritchie Bros. When fully developed, it will consist of over two million square feet of office, research and development space.
Pleasantville, Nfld.
A former U.S. and Canadian military base in St. John's, built during the Second World War. The 64-acre site has been rezoned to allow for a residential development with a mix of town homes, single family homes and condominium units.
Senneville, Que.
Former site of the Senneville Lodge, located on the western tip of the island of Montreal. The 60.5-acre property had been owned by Veterans Affairs Canada and is the site of a former veterans care facility which operated from 1946 until its closure in 1990. There are no redevelopment plans yet.

Burying our heads in the sand

Abstract: That design got the go-ahead despite the fact that an independent committee of experts, struck to review the proposed revitalization design, heavily favoured a competing submission.

Full text: Sugar Beach is fab, but the building next door, and a new 'hood down the street, are less than visionary
lrochon@globeandmail.com
Blurred, soft, faint and flowing: Flou is a French word of such import that it should be a required addition to the English language. Because Toronto's new Sugar Beach is flou , it yields an impressionistic landscape rarely attempted in the hard-edged cities of North America. Don't confuse the pale pink umbrellas rising from the cream-coloured sand as design weakness. The advantage of flou - besides allowing for willow trees, granite rock and pink parasols to be read as sensory touchstones of colour and texture - is that it emphasizes the rigidity of Corus Entertainment corporate headquarters constructed next door.
It's a bit like spying Jackie Kennedy sheathed in shell-pink chiffon and sparkling sequins sitting next to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in a shapeless black suit. On a tiny, two-acre (eight-tenths of a hectare) park on Toronto's central waterfront, Montreal's Claude Cormier Architectes Paysagistes has accomplished a mesmerizing distraction from the dark green mask of Corus.
Such is the unsettling truth of the central waterfront as it is being currently rolled out - beautiful moments in its new public space marred by the construction of ordinary architecture. The chunky green-glass Corus building was one of those Waterfront Toronto cloak-and-dagger secrets, once referred to mysteriously and misleadingly as Project Symphony. Its architect, Jack Diamond of Diamond + Schmitt, had been hired without a design competition by the Toronto Economic Development Corporation (TEDCO), a city agency that owns more than 60 per cent of the 1,000 acres in the city's downtown brownfields known as the Portlands. Diamond had previously worked as a consultant for TEDCO on the precinct plan for East Bayfront, just next door to Toronto's Harbourfront.
Given that Diamond has made a career of creating buildings designed to fit into the streetscape rather than express something individualistic or exuberant, the match was made in heaven: Emotional architecture is not what TEDCO wanted. Flou ? Feed it to the seagulls. In its wisdom, TEDCO - representing the Toronto taxpayer - wanted something glassy and generic.
Why? "The market pays for view. View was paramount," says project architect David Dow. Still, was it really necessary to promote something this indistinguishable on one of the city's grand-finale waterfront sites? "It had to be a generic enough office building that it could satisfy other tenants in the future," explains Dow. Imagine for yourself the hint of regret in his voice.
In response, Diamond + Schmitt created two glass office buildings linked by an atrium. Hardly a jewel, but, nevertheless, a competent design solution. The glass is dark green - not the golden colour of glass kissed by the sun, as it appeared in one of the earlier renderings from 2007. It's sustainable, smart design; but to the eye, it's a corporate clunker.
Corus Entertainment is one of Canada's largest media-and-entertainment companies, owners of radio stations Q107 and The Edge, animation house Nelvana and Kids Can Press. Its new office and broadcast centre is planned for completion in late September, although a majority of its 1,200 employees has already moved here from disparate sites across the city.
In the earlier renderings, there's a groovy permeability to the headquarters: The big glass doors on the building's west side are opened wide, allowing masses of people, gathered on the stone promenade and sitting on the massive Sugar Beach hump of a rock, to look in at the TV studios. You can almost picture Lady Gaga arriving to flaunt her latest headdress.
But for now, the ground-floor glass is sheathed in some kind of reflective, anti-ballistic coating, so it's difficult to see in. It would be delightful if the monumental sliding doors facing the lake would regularly expose the building to the winds and the sounds of the water - alas, and I hope that Corus proves me wrong, that's unlikely, given security concerns. The tiny café at the north of the building, meanwhile, is too narrow and, during the morning rush, overcrowded. Still, the sense of flou resonates powerfully, thanks to Waterfront Toronto, in the public spaces around the Corus building. Double allees of maple trees and timber benches by Dutch landscape magicians West 8 now grace part of the East Bayfront promenade. A restaurant with breathtaking views along the waterfront edge of the building is still to come. And tiny motorized fish, by fantastic British design firm Troika, running the length of the ceiling in a public corridor inside Corus, are about to be turned on.
The building interior is being outfitted by Quadrangle Architects and is stoked with walls clad in wood recycled from the old Queen Elizabeth docks. What could have been an airy atrium, with clear views to the waterfront and a living green wall, is being clogged with stuff: a boxy recording studio; and a multi-
storey, careening tube slide for the daring employees of Corus.
But let's slip from the interior, privatized world of Corus and head outside and slightly east to Bayside, the largest new residential neighbourhood along Toronto's waterfront, poised to begin construction. Waterfront Toronto announced this week that an American development-and-design consortium has won the bid to build out the largest development parcels in East Bayfront, comprised of 10 acres between Lower Sherbourne and Parliament streets.
Hines, a large international real-estate firm, has partnered with American architect Cesar Pelli (renowned for his sky-scratching towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) and Stanton Eckstut, one of the master-plan consultants of New York City's Battery Park City waterfront development. Adamson Architects are the local affiliates.
The Hines-Pelli consortium was favoured by a committee that included Waterfront Toronto CEO John Campbell and the city's deputy city manager, Richard Butts. I'm not exactly sure why. The financials, which are strictly confidential, must have seriously impressed, because the design itself is largely polite and formulaic but uninspired.
That design got the go-ahead despite the fact that an independent committee of experts, struck to review the proposed revitalization design, heavily favoured a competing submission. That vision - featuring smaller commercial buildings and glass residential studios engaged in an urban dance - was produced by homeboy architects Peter Clewes and Bruce Kuwabara, who joined forces with Walker Corporation of Australia and Cityzen Development Corporation (currently building the Marilyn Monroesque tower in Mississauga). In their report, the committee recommended the locally produced scheme for its permeability and heightened sense of Toronto, including lovely slips of water cut from the lake into the mainland. Unforgivably, the process leading up to the naming, this week, of the winning Bayside development partner has been shrouded in secrecy. All players - including all consultants - have been required by Waterfront Toronto to sign confidentiality agreements, provoking secret, hushed exchanges of information. Officially, I don't know anything. Bayside is the largest residential development to plant itself on Toronto's waterfront in decades. But, though it spreads over publicly owned land, none of its new residential designs has been seen or debated by the public. Keeping the Toronto waterfront as a secret harboured by only a very few is an old idea that smacks of Toronto in the 1980s. Definitely not flou , just tragically, dangerously passé.

Abstract: Even by this show's usual grim standards, tonight's episode is a hard one to sit through. The subject, Amy W., is afflicted with bipolar disorder, anorexia and self-mutilation - much of it stemming from the fact she was sexually molested as a child. To ease the pain, Amy routinely downs two bottles of vodka a night. Her friend Jessica tries to rally Amy's family for a last-ditch intervention before it's too late. BEAUTY PAGEANT

FRIDAY
AUGUST 20
REALITY
House Hunters
HGTV, 7 p.m.
The housing market in America has never been healthier, or at least so it appears in this U.S. cable series hosted by Suzanne Whang. The veteran real-estate agent is a calming presence for couples and families for whom price never seems to be an object. Tonight, Suzanne counsels Gina and Rich, a young couple ready to buy their own place in scenic Summerville, South Carolina. The trick is finding a domicile that is move-in ready and suitable for their two demanding dogs. DRAMA
Pretty Little Liars
MuchMusic, 8 p.m.
Originating on ABC Family Channel a few months back, this cable series repeats in its entirety, starting with tonight's pilot episode. Based on the bestselling novels by Sara Shepard, the soapy series follows four teen high-schoolers - Spencer (Troian Bellisario), Hanna (Ashley Benson), Aria (Lucy Hale) and Emily (Shay Mitchell) - whose clique crumbles when their queen bee Alison disappears without a trace. One year later, the quartet are rattled to receive e-mails and text messages from Alison - now threatening to expose their darkest secrets. DRAMA
CSI: NY
CBS, CTV, 9 p.m.
Big Apple crime-lab boss Mac Taylor (Gary Sinise) and his team are handed a bizarre murder case: A woman turns herself into the police after stabbing her philandering husband to death. The subsequent investigation reveals that the supposedly spontaneous murder was in fact premeditated, and forensic evidence connects the woman to a vicious accomplice with ties to nearly two-dozen other violent crimes. Curiouser and curiouser, as they say. FOOD
Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives
Food Network, 10 p.m.
If you only know Guy Fieri from his hosting duties on NBC's Minute to Win It , be sure to catch him in his natural habitat in this lively Food Network series. The spiky-haired gourmand tours across the U.S. in search of greasy-spoon eateries famed for their specialties. Two typical shows air tonight: First, Fieri hits Boise, Idaho, to visit a family restaurant serving authentic brick-oven pizza. In the second show, he's at a Boston eatery where three brothers carry on their father's tradition of clam chowder and chipotle/pastrami sandwiches. SATURDAY
AUGUST 21
DOCUMENTARY
Curveball: W.P. Kinsella
Bravo!, 7 p.m.
A heartfelt profile of Canadian author W.P. Kinsella, best known for his 1982 novel Shoeless Joe , which was later adapted into the feature film Field of Dreams . Kinsella waxes eloquently on his childhood years growing up in Edmonton and reveals the inspiration behind his lifelong fascination with the great American game of baseball. MOVIE
The Sting
TCM, 8 p.m.
The con is on. Winner of seven Academy Awards - including Best Picture - this 1973 caper flick marked the perfect on-screen reunion for Paul Newman and Robert Redford. The former Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Newman and Redford were perfectly cast as Henry and Johnny, respectively, two Depression-era hustlers trying to avenge the death of a fellow grifter by scamming a thuggish Irish gangster (Robert Shaw). The standout support cast include Eileen Brennan, Ray Walston and Charles Durning. MYSTERY
The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes
PBS, 9 p.m.
The great detective assumes rather unseemly duties in the 1992 story The Master Blackmailer . As Holmes (Jeremy Brett) tries to bring in the nefarious blackmailer Charles Augustus Milverton to justice, he's willing to impersonate a lowly plumber in order to infiltrate the Milverton estate. The stuffy Doctor Watson (Edward Hardwicke) is not amused. DOCUMENTARY
Fixing My Brain
CBS News Network, 10 p.m.
Consider the strange but true saga of Barbara Arrowsmith. Although she was born with a brilliant memory that stood her well through university, she still couldn't tell her right from her left, or read a clock. Instead of giving in her to limited abilities, Barbara created exercises to stimulate the weak areas of her brain. After several months, she was able to tell time. Every great journey begins with a single step. SUNDAY
AUGUST 22
DOCUMENTARY
The True Story of Black Hawk Down
History, 7 p.m.
If you've seen the 2001 movie Black Hawk Down , this documentary tells the rest of the story. The film recalls the factual events of the infamous Battle of Mogadishu, which resulted from a failed raid by U.S. military personnel trying to capture Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. The program includes interviews with eyewitnesses who were there that day and perspective from author Mark Bowden, who wrote the book that inspired the feature film. SCIENCE
Secrets of the Secret Service
Discovery, 8 p.m.
What's the history behind the law enforcement agency assigned with protecting the American president? This documentary provides heretofore unshared insight into the life of a Secret Service agent. Most of the program is devoted to the agency's use of cutting-edge technology, including specially-designed firearms and bulletproof fabrics. The sunglasses are, of course, standard issue. REALITY
Undercover Boss
CBS, 9 p.m.
One of last season's unexpected hits, this show follows corporate big shots as they slip anonymously into the rank and file of their own companies. Tonight's show focuses on Dave Rife, owner of the White Castle fast-food chain, who feels rather sheepish after accidentally ruining thousands of hamburger buns. Rife is more concerned by the level of low morale among employees working at his company. REALITY
Dancer with Tiny Legs
TLC, 10 p.m.
JoAnne Fluke is a study in perseverance. The 34-year-old was born with a rare birth defect - the bottom half of her spine is missing. As a result, she has tiny webbed legs and stands roughly the height of a 10-month-old child. Undaunted, Ms. Fluke has defied decades of predictions of her imminent demise and has steadfastly pursued her passion for dance.
MONDAY
AUGUST 23
REALITY
Intervention
A & E, 8 p.m.
Even by this show's usual grim standards, tonight's episode is a hard one to sit through. The subject, Amy W., is afflicted with bipolar disorder, anorexia and self-mutilation - much of it stemming from the fact she was sexually molested as a child. To ease the pain, Amy routinely downs two bottles of vodka a night. Her friend Jessica tries to rally Amy's family for a last-ditch intervention before it's too late. BEAUTY PAGEANT
The 2010 Miss Universe Pageant
NBC, 9 p.m.
Good heavens, is this still around? Once a huge TV event with ratings in the range of an Oscars broadcast, the annual beauty pageant has lost some of its lustre in recent years. One clue: This year's show is hosted by rocker-turned-reality-star Bret Michaels and Today correspondent Natalie Morales, who will host the live broadcast from a Las Vegas casino. As in years past, the contestants will hail from more than 80 countries and will compete in the three traditional categories: interview, evening gown and swimming suit. Musical guests include John Legend and the Roots. REALITY
Chainsaw Ice Sculptures
TLC, 10 p.m.
Were you aware the art of ice sculpting had become a very competitive field in recent years? It's true. This special was filmed at the World Ice Art Championships that take place in Fairbanks, Alaska, each year. How it works: Each four-man team is handed 10 enormous blocks of ice to be carved into sculptures by chainsaws, chisels and blow torches. Strangely, one of the favourite teams to win the championships hails from the state of Texas. MOVIE
Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf?
TCM, 11 p.m.
Released to theatres in 1966, this movie was adapted from the stage play by Edward Albee. The story cast real-life couple Liz Taylor and Richard Burton as Martha and George, a 40-something academic couple at a small New England college. George is a hard-core tippler and Martha is a crude flirt, so naturally they are constantly squabbling. The fighting intensifies when a young couple (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) spend time with the lovebirds following a faculty mixer. TUESDAY
AUGUST 24
FOOD
Ricardo & Friends
Food Network, 7 p.m.
Often referred to as the Quebecois equivalent of Jamie Oliver, chef Ricardo Larrivee is a huge celebrity in la belle province. In this series, he's constantly searching local suppliers for fresh ingredients that can be transformed into fabulous repasts. In tonight's episode, Ricardo invites a gaggle of family and friends over for several of his specialty desserts. The high-calorie menu includes caramelized Asian pears, crème caramel and chocolate genoise with ganache.
SCIENCE
NOVA
PBS, 8 p.m.
Was there truly a time when flying dinosaurs existed? Tonight's episode follows up on several unique fossils found in China's Liaoning Province. Among the strangest findings is the fossil of a small dinosaur with a set of wings on both its arms and legs. The microraptor is the smallest adult dinosaur ever found. NOVA brings together a team of paleontologists, aviation engineers and computer artists to determine whether the tiny creature really was capable of winged flight. DRAMA
NCIS: Los Angeles
CBS, Global, 9 p.m.
One of last season's hottest rookie hits, NCIS: Los Angeles focuses on a covert U.S. military team specializing in slick underground missions. In tonight's episode, special agents Callan (Chris O'Donnell), Hanna (LL Cool J) and the other members of the NCIS team race to save one of their own after receiving disturbing video evidence of a fellow agent being held hostage. This time, it's personal. REALITY
Growing Up Twisted
A & E, 10 p.m.
This new reality series starring 1980s heavy-metal rocker Dee Snider comes to an end tonight. Sticking to the template created by Gene Simmons Family Jewels and other A & E reality shows on faded rock stars, the concept follows Snider, wife Suzette and their four kids living under the same roof in suburban Long Island. In tonight's finale, Suzette makes the mistake of interfering in the romantic lives of her two teenaged sons. Ratings for the first season were not spectacular, so don't expect a second act.
WEDNESDAY
AUGUST 25
PROFILE
Private Screenings: Lauren Bacall
TCM, 6:45 p.m.
TCM host Robert Osborne sits down for a lively chat with screen legend Lauren Bacall in this special. In her typical candid manner, Ms. Bacall reveals how her experience modeling for Harper's Bazaar lead to her contract with Warner Bros. and a starring role in To Have and Have Not . The 1944 feature also marked Bacall's first meeting with her future husband, Humphrey Bogart. The program includes ample clips from the five films starring the couple, including Dark Passage , The Big Sleep and Key Largo . FOOD
MasterChef
Fox, CTV, 8 p.m.
Tonight's episode of the homespun cooking competition runs two hours - which is a lot of Gordon Ramsay to digest in one sitting. The bombastic Ramsay challenges each of the remaining home cooks to bake a single cupcake, a task that turns out to be much more difficult than it sounds. In the same show, the contestants are taken from the studio kitchen and transported to a truck stop to cook for truckers. Celebrity chef Cat Cora shows up to sample the diner-style grub.
DOCUMENTARY
Frontline
PBS, 9 p.m.
Airing days before the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, tonight's edition of the acclaimed documentary series examines serious charges levied against the New Orleans Police Department. According to this report, in the days and weeks following the devastation of Katrina, the New Orleans police readily used lethal force against citizens and then tried to cover up their actions. The Frontline team takes a closer look at the allegations. DOCUMENTARY
Inside the Saudi Kingdom
CBC News Network, 10 p.m.
First broadcast on the BBC, this film boasts a rare chat with one of the most senior royal princes in Saudi Arabia. The filmmakers interview Prince Saud bin Abdul Mohsen bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, who talks frankly about the difficulties of maintaining Bedouin and Islamic traditions in the face of new technology. THURSDAY
AUGUST 26
REALITY
Wedding SOS
Slice, 6:30 p.m.
If she ever tires of television, wedding planner Jane Dayus-Hinch could easily find a career as a professional mediator. Every episode in this engaging reality series features Ms. Jane responding to a plea from couples asking her to assist with their chaotic wedding plans. Tonight she's called in to help Rhonda and Ray, who wanted to celebrate their storybook romance with a grand ceremony out of a Danielle Steel novel. Instead, Ray is edgy, Rhonda is depressed and the big day is weeks away. REALITY
Chuck's Day Off
Food Network, 7:30 p.m.
Not your typical TV chef, Chuck Hughes was working in advertising when he fell in love with the restaurant business. Next came cooking school and finding his true calling as the chef-owner of the popular Garde-Manger eatery in Old Montreal. In tonight's episode, Chuck hooks up with his best friend, a tattoo artist named Safwan, for a stove-top clambake on the hottest day in the year. To help beat the heat, Chuck whips up a batch of his deadly Tequila Lemonade.
MUSIC
Innovators in Music
Bravo!, 8 p.m.
One of the best Canadian music programs in years, this documentary series profiles six musicians from diverse backgrounds. The format explores how the creative process behind their songs is also expressed in other art forms. Tonight's episode profiles Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, who has enjoyed considerable success outside the music field as a painter and author. Hart also reveals her personal theory on the connection between percussion and the Big Bang theory.
HISTORY
Did the Mob Kill JFK?
Discovery, 9 p.m.
Nearly a half-century after John F. Kennedy was murdered in Dallas, speculation on the parties responsible continues to run rampant. This special works off the theories of an informant who recently surfaced with alleged "inside information" on JFK's assassination. In lurid fashion, the program paints a conspiracy mosaic that includes involvement by the U.S. Justice Department, the CIA and, of course, the Mafia. FOOD
BBQ Pit Masters
TLC, 10 p.m.
One of the strangest entries currently on TLC's schedule, this series follows a handful of barbecue fanatics vying for the lofty honour of best BBQ chef in America. Five teams are showcased in the competition, which bestows a cash prize of $100,000 to the winners. In tonight's outing, the chefs have to adjust their usual methods when challenged to prepare beef brisket. Watch tempers flare when some of the chefs have trouble firing up the coals.

On a prestigious cul-de-sac lined with one-of-a-kind houses, this renovated two-storey residence catches the attention of passersby with its unique design and layout on a premium corner, agent Heather Lemieux says.
What's immediately apparent is a brick façade covering the front of the 31-year-old house, while the rear addition is encased by a board and batten exterior with double garage doors and veranda to a side entrance.
Cathedral ceilings and a floor-to-ceiling wood-burning fireplace are featured in the family room addition off the eat-in kitchen, which was updated with custom cabinetry, Corian counters and sliding doors to a gated yard with a flagstone patio and perennial gardens. The kitchen was also outfitted with hardwood floors, as were the living and dining rooms in the original section of the house, which has three upper bedrooms.
The master suite has a walk-in closet and access to the largest of three remodelled bathrooms. On the east side of the house, the sellers - and original owners - had local award-winning architect John Robert Carley design a conservatory with a circular layout, ceramic floors, full-height windows and exits to the yard and lower level.
The basement was professionally finished with a workshop and media room with bi-folding closet doors to hide a gym and a sewing room, plus a kitchen disguised behind another set of doors.

Commercial real estate deals soar in first half

Author: Ladurantaye, Steve

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/commercial-real-estate-deals-soar-first-half/docview/744155916/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "It is important to note that midyear figures from last year were far lower than the historical average, due to the global economic crisis that characterized much of 2008 and 2009," the report said. "When comparing the current national midyear figure to midyear 2005 - a year more reflective of the country's normal commercial real estate activity levels - volume is up by 22.8 per cent."

Full text:   REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Canada's commercial real estate market rebounded sharply in the first half of 2010, with the value of deals increasing by 60 per cent as the debt markets recovered from the recession.
Commercial real estate company CB Richard Ellis said in its midyear national investment report that $7.8-billion worth of deals were done from January to June, compared with $4.9-billion during the same period in 2009.
There were a total of 2,243 commercial deals done, compared with 1,565 at last year's halfway point.
"It is important to note that midyear figures from last year were far lower than the historical average, due to the global economic crisis that characterized much of 2008 and 2009," the report said. "When comparing the current national midyear figure to midyear 2005 - a year more reflective of the country's normal commercial real estate activity levels - volume is up by 22.8 per cent."
Real estate investment trusts and local private investors handled most of the deals, CBRE said, adding that they "led the charge using available debt aggressively."
Buyers were active across the country, CBRE chairman John O'Bryan said. "Unique to this year is the fact that market activity is consistently up across all major cities - a trend that does not happen often," he said. Here's a look at major centres:
TORONTO
Toronto recorded the highest midyear commercial real estate activity volume of all major cities, with $2.9-billion in transaction volume, and 563 deals. Current debt levels and available capital gave the Toronto market a boost - factors that have been missing from the market since 2008's economic downturn. The REIT and private investor groups have been particularly active in Toronto's commercial real estate market over the past several months. As one of the last-standing tax shelters, REITs have been extremely active in the market since the recession occurred.
VANCOUVER
In the January-to-June period, 632 commercial real estate transactions took place, totalling more than $1.6-billion in volume. Market activity was up across the industrial, retail and multiresidential classes - a trend unique to this year. The greatest year-over-year increase was recorded in small to mid-size buildings.
MONTREAL
The city continued to rebound positively in the first half of 2010, with increased market activity across all asset classes. During the first two quarters, 446 real estate transactions took place, totalling over $1.1-billion.
CALGARY
During the first two quarters, 188 real estate transactions took place, totalling more than $680-million.
EDMONTON
The commercial market recorded 161 transactions in the first half of this year, totalling $754-million.
OTTAWA
The capital city continued along its steady and stable course, recording 83 transactions totalling $267-million in investment volume.
HALIFAX
Halifax recorded significant deal flow over last year's activity, with 32 transactions totalling $111-million in volume.

Abstract: Ab and Flo bought a beautiful but rundown farm in Fullarton Township, Ont., in 1944 and moved there in 1946. Cash was in short supply but help came from the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority, the Veterans' Land Act and the Ontario Agricultural College. Ab was willing to try innovative farming techniques such as contour plowing to stop erosion, organized crop rotation and the building of a farm pond.

Full text:   Husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, pilot, farmer. Born May 25, 1920, in Portage la Prairie, Man. Died Aug. 1 in Stratford, Ont., of renal failure, aged 90.
Albert Bowman, or Ab as he was affectionately known, was a city boy who developed a lifelong love of farming. When his father, Albert Bowman, died in 1923, his mother, Hazel MacDonald, was left to look after four small children with the help of family.
During these years in Portage la Prairie, Man., Ab became friends with a local farmer and liked to visit the farm to help out. When his mother remarried in 1929, the family moved to Toronto.
An excellent athlete, Ab competed in running, lacrosse, hockey and softball. In his later teen years he worked at Ontario farms during the summers.
Ab enrolled at the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph, Ont., but the Second World War interrupted his studies. He joined the air force and became a flying instructor, serving in southern Ontario. He retired from the air force at the end of the war and finished his studies at Kemptville Agricultural School.
In 1942, Ab married Florence Greenwood. They had eight children, Nancy, Keith, Jim, Peter, Judy, John, Marg and Ross.
Ab and Flo bought a beautiful but rundown farm in Fullarton Township, Ont., in 1944 and moved there in 1946. Cash was in short supply but help came from the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority, the Veterans' Land Act and the Ontario Agricultural College. Ab was willing to try innovative farming techniques such as contour plowing to stop erosion, organized crop rotation and the building of a farm pond. His farm was used as a demonstration site to show these new techniques to other veterans and farmers.
Over the years the farm improved as Ab built up a dairy herd of 35 to 40 milking cows. Because of his difficulties in borrowing money from the banks, he became interested in helping to organize the Mitchell and District Credit Union and was elected its first chairman. Ab served on the board for 25 years.
In 1962, Ab took a job away from the farm, first with the Ontario Federation of Agriculture and then with the Veterans' Land Act. He also became an accredited real estate appraiser. The farming continued but he phased out the dairy business and moved into beef and hogs. He retired from the VLA at 65 but continued to do real estate appraisals until he was 83. Along the way Ab also became a real estate developer and built several houses in the Mitchell, Ont., area.
Ab was always involved in community activities. In 1990, after they sold the farm and moved to Stratford, Ont., he volunteered with the Horticultural Society and with their church.
Ab accomplished much in his lifetime, but his proudest legacy was his family.
James Albert Bowman is Ab's son.

Toronto condo market hits the 'down' button

Author: Ladurantaye, Steve

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/toronto-condo-market-hits-down-button/docview/743957692/se-2?accountid=14656

Full text:   Though prices remain firm, sales have slowed and supply is surging in Canada's condo capital
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
The developer thought it was a brilliant idea: Build a penthouse on top of an existing condo building in a chic Toronto neighbourhood to take advantage of the city's insatiable lust for expensive real estate.
For $1.8-million, the new owner could walk into a brand new, 1,800-square-foot condo designed to her specifications. That was the idea, anyway. But the listing in prime Rosedale hit the market in February, just as sales were beginning to slow for real estate of all kinds, and no one was interested in the unit its agent has dubbed "Project Perch."
The property is still for sale, but it no longer comes with an actual condo. Before a single brick was in place, the developer gave up and decided to try a different approach. For $599,000, a prospective buyer now gets blueprints, a stack of planning approvals and a list of local builders who can finish the project on the cheap.
"My gut instinct tells me the condo market is skewered right now," said Paul Johnston of Right At Home Realty Brokerage, the listing agent on the project. "It's been a hell of a year. At the beginning, we finally had buyers after a year of banging our heads on the wall looking for them. But I think this year's deals have already been done."
Following a spring marked by record sales and prices, growing evidence suggests that the air is finally beginning to go out of Toronto's remarkably resilient condo market. The debate in real estate circles is now this: is it a temporary lull or the harbinger of a more serious decline?
The outlook for one the key economic generators in Canada's largest city - a business that produces large numbers of construction and service jobs - hangs on that question.
Toronto is North America's new condo capital: Last year, developers completed about 16,000 units, twice as many as in New York and three times as many as Vancouver. As such, it's closely watched as a barometer for the sector.
In July, the picture turned negative. The Toronto Real Estate Board said last week the number of sales in the city fell 25 per cent compared with June. While prices have yet to waver, anecdotal evidence of a slowdown is rife. Bay Street office workers point out that many of the newly opened condo towers in the downtown core appear to be devoid of all signs of human life.
Meanwhile, the supply of condos is surging. In the second quarter, buyers had a record 10,997 units to choose from. Another 34,089 units are under construction. Eighty-eight per cent of those units have already been sold, but another 5,000 units are expected to begin construction in the next three months.
An estimated 40 per cent of Toronto condos are owned by investors - many of them from overseas - who often buy multiple units and rent them out. That's in contrast to the rest of the residential property market, which is dominated by people who live in what they own.
If the market were to weaken, and those investors disappeared, new projects would find it much harder to meet their sales and financing goals. Canadian banks typically require that a developer presell at least 70 per cent of the units in each building before the bank hands over any money.
In a worst case, investors might choose to cut their losses and rush to sell their condos rather than stick around and hope for a gradual recovery.
But not everyone is convinced that a downturn would spark a stampede to the exits.
"You hear about how so much of the market is made up of investors, and to me that's not a scary thing," said George Carras, president of RealNet Canada Inc., a tracker of real estate data. "These people aren't investing to lose money; they are patient and plan to stick around."
Condo prices have performed far better than equities in recent years, according to an index compiled by Mr. Carras's company. And he believes the market's fundamentals remain strong. Toronto needs about 40,000 housing units a year to keep up with immigration, he said. Restrictive building policies have made it difficult to build new communities of single-family homes within the city, forcing developers to build up instead of out.
But while demand might be there, it's unclear when the market will bump against the limits of what people can afford. Prices have run up dramatically over the past few years. In 2003, new condos in Toronto sold at $294 per square foot on average. Last quarter, it was $565, or 92-per-cent higher. As unemployment remains high and consumer debt sits at the highest level on record, worries grow that the market is no longer tilted toward the smart investor.
"Condo owners shouldn't assume they'll always be able to sell their units at a profit," said Kurt Rosentreter, a senior financial adviser at Manulife Securities Inc., who has been warning his clients off the asset class for the past year despite surging prices. "You see the big price gains, but you have to wonder about a breaking point - and that would be dangerous for everyone."
So far, prices are holding firm: In the second quarter, the average selling price in Toronto gained 1 per cent to $331,000. And despite slowing sales, developers are asking more for less. The average asking price for the 23 projects launched in the last three months was $565 a square foot, a 12-per-cent increase from the same time last year.
"The big concern is we're continuing to push pricing in the new sale market, and as you look at the rents the investors are able to charge, they certainly aren't moving higher at the same rate," said Ben Myers, executive vice-president of tracking firm Urbanation. "You have to wonder what happens next."

Staking a claim in Muskoka - without breaking the bank

Author: John Bentley Mays

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/staking-claim-muskoka-without-breaking-bank/docview/742632829/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: For the structures of the Muskoka Bay Club, Mr. [Peter Freed] has taken a largely neo-traditional approach to architectural styling, with much local stone and exposed timber framing and gabling on show. Artistically admirable modern cottages have been designed and built in various districts of the Ontario countryside, but, given this development's proximity to a small town, backward-looking, respectful contextualism makes a certain sense.

Though I am not one of them - I always opt for holidays in another city, preferably far away - I know that the vacation dream of a great many Torontonians involves having a perfect house in Ontario's getaway country. But the demand for such places on or near our sparkling northern lakes is high, and the supply is scanty and costly. It's not surprising, then, that some enterprising entrepreneurs have taken to building rural Ontario retreats for city folks that are more affordable than the usual cottage.
The example I'm thinking of today is the Muskoka Bay Club, which occupies an 850-acre site adjacent to the town of Gravenhurst and includes an award-winning 18-hole golf course designed by Doug Carrick. (I understand Mr. Carrick is a master at the art of golf courses.) This four-seasons project (which, like the golf course, has won numerous awards) is the handiwork of Toronto developer Peter Freed, who is best known for his thicket of modernistic residential buildings near the intersection of Bathurst Street and King Street West.
For the structures of the Muskoka Bay Club, Mr. Freed has taken a largely neo-traditional approach to architectural styling, with much local stone and exposed timber framing and gabling on show. Artistically admirable modern cottages have been designed and built in various districts of the Ontario countryside, but, given this development's proximity to a small town, backward-looking, respectful contextualism makes a certain sense. The influence of Muskoka's building practices from long ago is also evident in the old-fashioned 17,000-square-foot clubhouse by Toronto revivalist architect Richard Wengle.
The residences of the club come in three formats. The largest (1,350 square feet to more than 4,000 square feet) are the "homes," which range in price from about $465,000 to more than $1-million. The "villas" go up in area to 2,200 square feet, and they cost about $460,000 to more than $600,000. The least expensive units ($290,000 to about $370,000) are the "lofts," and they enclose spaces from 819 square feet to 1,040 square feet.
When it came to designing the lofts - the most recent offering at Muskoka Bay Club - Mr. Freed has indulged his modernist inclinations more freely than in the other edifices on the property. The two-storey open-plan suites, with their tall rock-framed fireplaces and expanses of glazing, are situated in flat-roofed buildings trimmed in wood and stone. In contrast to the romantic architectural styling of the houses and villas, the loft structures are barracks-like - though their brown cladding and finishes in natural materials could help them blend in a bit with the site's other structural types.
Whatever your taste or budget may be, however, ownership at the club brings with it amenities galore. The clubhouse, for instance, contains an indoor-outdoor dining area, a bar and grill and the Muskoka Room restaurant for finer dining, a fitness centre and spa rooms, and even babysitting facilities. Outside features include a swimming pool and tennis courts. For owners of villas or lofts who plan to live in them only part of the year, the club runs a rental service - a handy program for city-dwellers making a transition to full-time residence in the country.
The one amenity missing in this scheme - some may consider it essential - is direct access from the houses and suites to the open water. But at least for city slickers who don't care for boating or lake swimming, there are certain compensations here. One is the nearness of Gravenhurst, which opens toward Lake Muskoka and features various memorials to the town's ship-building past and a waterfront and wharf recently renovated to the tune of $170-million.
Meanwhile, back in the city core, another one of Mr. Freed's real estate ventures has opened its doors. It's the ultra-cool Thompson Hotel, near the corner of Bathurst and King West. I have heard rumours of a fabulous and very exclusive garden atop the mixed-use condo-hotel complex - a place restricted to hotel guests, condo dwellers and VIPs on a secret list Mr. Freed is keeping close to his chest. If I ever get invited up there, I'll let you know. Since I am devoted to cities and urban life and have no interest in visiting spots where bears and snakes may be lurking, this roof garden may be as close to nature as I ever get in this lifetime.

The signs are all around us. Rush-hour traffic is turning many of the GTA's roads and streets into temporary parking lots. Damage from flooded basements is one of the fastest rising areas of insurance claims, industry officials say. The electricity grid packs it in for big chunks of Toronto when the temperature soars.
The quality of life we enjoy in the GTA just is not sustainable. Aging infrastructure such as roads and sewers, a devotion to gas-guzzling vehicles and a reliance on electricity from generating plants that gobble coal and natural gas are all escalating to the tipping point.
Unless something is done, and done soon, big urban centres such as Toronto and Mississauga will collapse under their own weight, experts predict.
So is there anything any of us can do as individuals to prevent this frightening picture of the future, or at least slow its tide? There is, according to people such as architect Joe Lobko and developer Alex Speigel.
They are two of a growing group of development industry professionals who have embraced the concept of sustainability and are engaged in designing and building projects that reflect their commitment to ensuring there is a bright future for our kids and grandkids.
Mr. Speigel, for example, runs a small $4-million closed-end investment fund called One Development Corp. Part of its goal is to invest in new sustainable real estate projects; right now it is building 35 sustainable townhouses in Picton, Ont. Through his development company, Ideas Development Inc., he is building eight infill sustainable townhouses at Beverley and Cecil Streets in the heart of Toronto.
Mr. Lobko, on the other hand, has focused mainly on commercial structures, but at the same time he is active in bringing the message of sustainability to local neighbourhoods.
Existing neighbourhoods, not new structures, are the key, he says.
"We build new less than 1 per cent of our total housing stock every year," he says. "As far as sustainability goes, that is a drop in the bucket. We talk a lot about it, though, because it is the easiest to deal with; it is the low-hanging fruit.
"What we really want to do is get communities involved. Help them understand there are simple things they can do to move the agenda forward."
One of them is indeed simplicity itself: Just disconnect drain spouts from combined sanitary and storm sewers. Instead of letting all that rainwater rush into overloaded sewers, let lawns soak it up.
Flooding is a problem along the Black Creek watershed in Toronto's west end, yet only 13 per cent of the homes in that area have disconnected their drain spouts, according to Mr. Lobko. If all the homes followed suit, the flooding might either end or be greatly reduced.
Mr. Speigel agrees that much could be done to retrofit existing structures. Part of sustainability is making better use of what we have, he points out.
He has the renovation of an old warehouse at Lennox and Bathurst Streets, just south of Bloor Street West, under way now and cites it as an example of what can be done.
"The envelope is always the biggest challenge," Mr. Speigel says. "There is not much you can do with old, under-insulated buildings with windows that leak heat in winter and bring it inside in summer."
What can be done, however, is to replace old single-pane with higher-efficiency double- or triple-pane windows, replace old heating and air systems with new high-efficiency ones, and then put in place new technology to reduce the structure's footprint on the environment.
For example, a green roof will help keep the structure cool and provide a natural mechanism to remove carbon dioxide from the air. Planting trees around the perimeter will shade the structure.
At the warehouse project, south-facing windows will have awnings with solar cells built in, as will a trellis on the roof. Those solar cells will turn the sun's rays into electricity that will be collected and fed back into the city's grid.
East- and west-facing windows will have shades that can be drawn down to protect against the heat of the sun as it rises and sets.
"Public awareness is key to sustainability," Mr. Speigel says. And there is nothing like linking the cost of energy consumption directly to its use to drive that home, he adds.
He cites Toronto Hydro's new smart meters, which measure when consumption takes place; customers are billed accordingly. We pay more for peak period use, less for shoulder times, and get the lowest rates at night and on weekends.
"Why not extend that to things like water consumption instead of charging on a flat-rate basis?" he suggests. "Smart meters are definitely having an effect on consumption of electricity, so why not extend that to other services as well?"

Baltic stylings on the shore of Lake Ontario

Author: Leblanc, Dave

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/baltic-stylings-on-shore-lake-ontario/docview/742632590/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The Estonian Houses Co. Ltd. co-op buildings were designed in 1952 by Estonian emigré Viktor Tretjakewitsch (1904-1993) while under the employ of Michael Bach, a fellow Estonian and architecture professor at the University of Toronto. Mr. Tretjakewitsch had arrived in Canada from Tallinn three years before with his wife and children, after a promising architecture career and the 1939 family home he'd designed had both been snatched away during the Soviet occupation.

Echoing the scaffolding and massive restoration of the much-ballyhooed and much-filmed 1930s R.C. Harris filtration plant across the street, another, lesser-known Beaches complex - this one from the early 1950s - is in the process of a retrofit.
While never kissed by the Hollywood spotlight, the butter-coloured, butterfly-roofed, three-storey gems at 2368 and 2378 Queen St. E. should be considered landmarks in their own right.
Sitting stoically atop a hill with a commanding view of the filtration plant, the lake and the termination of Victoria Park Avenue, the trapped-in-time twins are currently undergoing replacement of their original, handmade double-pane wooden windows. This will be followed by the restoration of the concrete balconies, the replacement of balcony railings and, finally, a restoration and repaint of the stucco façade.
While these improvements are most certainly causing celebrations within the 33 two- and three-bedroom apartments, local architecture lovers - especially those with a soft spot for Baltic and Scandinavian modernism - should celebrate these buildings for another reason: their fascinating history.
The Estonian Houses Co. Ltd. co-op buildings were designed in 1952 by Estonian emigré Viktor Tretjakewitsch (1904-1993) while under the employ of Michael Bach, a fellow Estonian and architecture professor at the University of Toronto. Mr. Tretjakewitsch had arrived in Canada from Tallinn three years before with his wife and children, after a promising architecture career and the 1939 family home he'd designed had both been snatched away during the Soviet occupation. During the war, he travelled to Germany to work as an aeronautical engineer at Messerschmitt AG.
Choosing Toronto as his new home (along with thousands of other Estonians), he was unprepared for the city's massive postwar housing shortage - which meant life in crowded rooming houses or the expensive option of new suburban construction. So, in early 1951, he joined a group of other newly arrived immigrants to incorporate as a non-profit, limited company to build "something like they were used to in Sweden or Estonia," recalls his daughter, Livia Thoeny, 73, who still lives in the building.
In other words, a little bit of the Baltics or Scandinavia on the shores of Lake Ontario.
Problem was, share-based, apartment-style housing was such a new idea (Mrs. Thoeny thinks the group may have been the first in Ontario to propose a co-operative model) that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. refused to grant the young company a mortgage. It was only after two delegates arrived in Ottawa armed with a dossier of multiple successful European examples that one was granted.
Families moved into the buildings in 1953 and apartment selection was done by lottery. Back then, more than 100 residents called the two buildings home; today, it's about half that number. Following that, Mr. Tretjakewitsch designed a "sister building" on Corinth Gardens in North Toronto for Mr. Bach, and then established his own design firm. After going bankrupt a few years later, he finally found his calling as a consulting engineer.
He lived at the complex until his passing.
It's worth a walk or a hop off the streetcar at the Neville Park loop (the Queen car's easternmost stop) to get a look at these buildings before renovation work is complete. While the new vinyl windows certainly keep the proportions of the originals intact, a little authenticity is lost in translation. To see the building as it was - with its extremely large windows sporting thin, burgundy-painted frames, wiggly teal-green balcony panels (made of asbestos!) and utilitarian stair rails - is to understand the pragmatic modernism of the Baltic and Nordic countries. Indeed, in a comparison between a photograph of Mr. Tretjakewitsch's Tallinn home and the Queen Street buildings, only size and roof shape stand out as different.
While standing on Queen Street gazing up at the buildings, note how they are staggered on the lot. While this sacrifices parking spots (there is a waiting list), it gives oodles back in light penetration: "Every apartment has two exposures ... we get morning light but we get a little bit of afternoon light," Mrs. Thoeny says. Compare that to other buildings from the early 1950s, with their small, punched windows that often have a lovely view of a brick wall.
Mr. Tretjakewitsch may not be as recognized as fellow Estonian Uno Prii, who brought us swooping, futuristic Annex apartment buildings, and he may not possess Elmar Tampold's track record of community advocacy and leadership, but his small contribution to Toronto modernism should not go unnoticed. Had he not brought his pioneering architectural ideas to our shores, perhaps we'd have waited a little longer to embrace the wide-open floor plans and big windows that became commonplace by the late 1950s. Perhaps, in 1958, we'd never have voted for a Finn named Viljo Revell to build our now iconic city hall.
Today, each time the international architectural community shines its spotlight on our city, we should silently thank the many northern Europeans who came here clutching little more than a dream.

Full text:   CITY HALL BUREAU CHIEF
Ever since a group of distinguished Toronto architects threatened to abandon the waterfront over an ugly hockey rink, their supporters have suggested you can't put a price on great design near the lake.
As it turns out the city can, and in the case of the world's first stacked four-pad arena, the price is $88-million - $17-million more than a standard complex and $54-million more than the city has available for the new Port Lands Sports Complex.
The estimated cost of an eight-storey ice palace was shrouded in secrecy until Thursday, when the figures were quietly released in a report that will land at the mayor's executive committee Monday.
Adopting the project could be a last hurrah for David Miller and his left-leaning council, especially if a council led by Rob Ford succeeds them.
The penny-pinching Etobicoke councillor is the only mayoral candidate who balked at the stacked option; the others said they would pay the higher price for iconic design.
"If it's going to cost the taxpayers $88-million," Mr. Ford said, "I don't think we're in any fiscal shape to build that arena."
Disagreements over the arena's design erupted publicly in the spring when Ken Greenberg, a prominent urban designer, quit the team overseeing the project. The entire Waterfront Design Review Panel threatened to follow suit.
The uproar forced the city to ask Toronto's Rounthwaite Dick and Hadley Architects Inc. to return with a new proposal that built up, not out, on the eight-acre city-owned site at Commissioners Street and the Don Roadway.
The revised design, unveiled last month, features four NHL-sized ice pads stacked in a tower, a Zamboni for each level, three high-speed elevators with high ceilings to accommodate hockey sticks, an indoor running track, pro shop, community rooms and small restaurant.
"I'm really, really pleased and gratified that the [city] staff has come around on this," Mr. Greenberg said Thursday. "I think that they're finally looking at the big picture."
Plans for the sports complex have been in the works since 2004, when Ottawa gave the city $34-million for the project, provided it was built on waterfront lands.
The report makes the case for spending $87.8-million on the stacked option instead of $71.5-million on the so-called snowflake design, the sprawling ground-level option that first raised the design community's hackles.
The extra costs for the stacked model include: $12.1-million more for construction; $2.1-million more for underground parking; $1-million for soft costs such as engineering and design; and $1.1-million more in PST/HST.
However, with a footprint about one-third of the snowflake design, the stacked option would free up land that could be developed and the money plowed back into sprucing up the waterfront.
As well, a glass-walled structure with fantastic views would generate $10-million more in tourism-related GDP than a traditional design, the report estimates.
"I think that's low myself," Paula Fletcher, the local councillor, said.
As for funding, the report recommends using the arena's future net operating revenues to debt-finance between $21-million and $25-million of the cost above the $34-million federal nest egg. That leaves the final $29-million to $33-million unaccounted for.
"Mediocrity is not acceptable," said Joe Pantalone, the deputy mayor who is running to replace his boss. "So therefore, of course, we have to accept the excellent design and find a way of making it work."
He suggested the city seek private donations or ask senior levels of government to pitch in more.
Stefan Baranski, a spokesman for George Smitherman, pointed to the value of the freed-up land as another good reason to embrace the superior design. "I think that's going to be a phenomenal piece of real-estate in Toronto and it's going to be an incredible new community and George is quite excited about that."
Both Sarah Thomson and Rocco Rossi expressed support for the stacked design, couched with some concern about where the extra money will come from.

Full text:   The reopening of the Liuli China Museum in this artistic enclave in Shanghai last week adds sparkle to a neighbourhood known for Old and New World flavour
Alandlord rich in real estate around Taikang Road once told a mutual friend that he looked out for three types of tenants: foreign artists, foreign-trained Chinese artists and "beautiful local artists with rich patrons." Perhaps that was just his Shanghai swagger talking. But whatever future he envisioned for this creative hutong , or enclave - once a mess of dark alleys serving damp, narrow dwellings - the reality is that Taikang Road, like the rest of the city, has gone cosmopolitan.
Overzealous developers had other plans for this tiny community of 1930s shikumen stone townhouses. But five years ago residents fought to have it preserved, and the city compromised by rezoning it as a sort of artists' co-op. Secreted away behind the main road, in a forgotten corner of the French Concession, the village attracted humble ateliers, grassroots galleries and tea houses catering to the modest footfall, which grew as word got out about the wealth of affordable arts and crafts to be had.
Japanese papermakers, Danish fashion designers, Hong Kong photographers, even Aussie barmen bought
in quickly (everything in Shanghai happens quickly), adding international polish to the patina. A luxury mall was sited across the street. Then, last week, the Liuli China Museum cut the ribbon on its new Taikang Road home: a glass and concrete cube fixed with a giant stainless-steel peony "corsage" designed by Taiwanese artist Loretta Yang.
Still, Old World flavour prevails in forgotten corners, where traders steal naps on ramshackle wooden chairs, tailors tack together traditional cheongsams (one-piece dresses for women). You can see it in "Chinglish" on sandwich boards, steaming dumplings and some of the last vestiges of vintage architecture in town.
A city-size corsage and gigantic ducks
Only in the construction capital of the world can a museum launch in a bespoke architect-designed building, then
relaunch four years later in an entirely new, custom-designed location. The Liuli museum pulled it off with aplomb. The gallery is named for the colourful glass the Chinese have been crafting for two millennia, yet its new digs are strikingly modern. The peony flourish on the façade nods to the organic glass forms inside, housed in glowing recesses in the ebony walls.
Contemporary works by Loretta Yang (also the museum's co-founder) and a roster of international artists
balance out a collection of artifacts from every dynasty. The gift shop sells blue-and-white notebooks inspired by Ming porcelain, and sleek glass statuettes from $9. But the hottest ticket is a table overlooked by the giant porcelain ducks in the museum café, Xiao San Tang.

Where people are outnumbered by figurines
In some countries, people are outnumbered by sheep; in China, they're outnumbered by toy figurines. You can get SpongeBob and Hello Kitty dolls pretty much anywhere, but at We à the World, a retrofitted atelier the size of a powder room, figurines come in plain white ceramic with a packet of washable pens so you can create your own character. Evidently the Shanghainese have picked up on the Western fondness for DIY.

Frock Couture
Former Parisian Elysee Yang is one of the enclave's coveted foreign-trained artists and a newcomer to this block, one of Taikang Road's few indoor lanes. Yang's bijou boutique is a stylist's fantasy, with tidy racks of colourful silk tea dresses and party frocks, plus simple jewellery and raffia handbags to match. Avoid the selection of designer shoes if your feet are any larger than size 6. If you're petite, though, you could pick up a pair of (so-called) Miu Mius for under $60. Rm. 903 Lane 248, Taikang Road
SIT, READ, SIP
Photographer Deke Erh opened this unusually quiet space - equal parts gallery, library, bookshop and café - as a place to absorb some of Shanghai's finest architectural photography and literature. At the Old China Hand
Reading Room, you can buy exquisite coffee-table tomes by Erh and his peers at the front (Erh's latest, Shanghai: A Bird's Eye View, costs about $70) and browse black-and-white photos on display in back. Then order a cappuccino and sit down for a read on an antique settee. That is, unless one of the regulars has got there first and stretched out for a nap (don't put it past them).
27 Shaoxing Rd. 86-21-6473-2526
BUDDHA FOR YOU
Just a sideways glance on your way to the juice bar down the lane is enough to stop you in your tracks here. Duke Gallery nurtures provocative young Chinese artists who manipulate old political imagery to trigger a visceral reaction. Seen any giant ceramic babies wielding automatic weapons yet? Or squat statues of the Buddha sporting a Red Army cap? We think not, but Duke may have you convinced you absolutely must take one home. No. 8, Lane 274, Taikang Road; 135-6447-6358; www.dukegallery.cn
BECOME A KOMMUNE-IST
You've probably had your share of straight-up Chinese cuisine by the time you get to Taikang Road, so why not enjoy a spot of kitsch?
Kommune, smack in the centre of this labyrinthine village, plays up China's dubious political history with lots of jingoistic art on the Commie-red walls. But a less controversial menu reflects the Aussie ownership (big brunches and evening barbies on the patio).
Down the warren of alleyways you'll also come upon Corner Asia, a lounge-like lunch spot that harks back to 1930s Shanghai with vintage lighting, deco wallpaper and yellowing cigarette ads - and a menu with similar colonial flavour. No. 7, Lane 210, Taikang Road; 86-21-6466-2416. No. 33, Lane 248; Taikang Road; 86-21-6431-7686

Where to stay
Taikang Residence
The only bed and breakfast in Taikang Road covers the upper floors of a traditional shikumen townhouse. Antiques drive home the retro theme in the four
simple guest rooms, which are otherwise adequately modern, with central air and crisp sheets. The ground-floor café is accented with silk cushions and novelty
ceramics sourced from the
EsyDragon gift shop in the next lane. From $73 a night, including sandwich and drink.

Ruijin Hotel
The Taiyuan Villa at the Ruijin
Hotel, a 1920s French-style manor set behind classical gardens and a natural wall of trees, has excellent provenance: It housed American General George
Marshall after the Second World War, and Madame Mao thereafter. A dozen immense guest rooms are swathed in Oriental rugs, with century-old wood furnishings and Tiffany lamps
by the bed. Rates from $133.

Full text:   I just bought some land in Detroit. It's a plot in the Woodbridge neighbourhood, which was hit particularly hard in the economic downturn. My neighbours seem like pleasant people: Amanda is a comic-book artist from Los Angeles. I don't know much about Kevin on the other side, but I think he's from San Francisco.
I own exactly 20 square inches of land. Kevin owns 12. We're all jealous of Amanda because she owns 50 square inches, enough space to put up a shoebox or store a jar of pickles. Welcome to the world of "inchvesting."
Tough economic conditions often act as a catalyst for innovative business models. This is certainly true in Detroit, where Web-game developer Jerry Paffendorf and information scientist Mary Lorene Carter are leveraging cheap real estate into funding for art and social projects.
In 2008, foreclosures went through the roof in Detroit, leaving an estimated 12,000 abandoned homes. In 2009, Mr. Paffendorf and Ms. Carter were able to buy a plot of land for $500. That first property, Plymouth, is 10,000 square inches on the east side of Detroit at 8887 East Vernor Highway and Holcomb Streets, occupied by 600 inchvestors. The couple sold this "micro-real estate" for $1 a square inch. Their 10,000 square inches netted them a healthy profit.
Loveland, as it is known, is a for-profit social enterprise. Investors can track their land online in a SimCity-like environment, meet their neighbours and funnel their investment dollars into arts groups or non-governmental organizations. Loveland uses its profits to fund local artists and refurbish the east-end Spaulding Court apartment buildings.
"We're making it fun for people to invest in something," Mr. Paffendorf says. "Can we create a compelling system for micro-payments? Can we create a cohesive community?" he asks. "I think that it's going to change perceptions about what is possible in the city."
Loveland creates a strong community of artists and investors interested in what happens in Detroit, building relationships with one another and watching their neighbourhood grow (ours is called Hello World).
While investors don't physically own their plots (legally it belongs to Loveland, but it's being sublet - subsold, really - to the "investor"), many visit their plots in real life and turn them into tiny works of art. The idea is to have a series of "microhoods" scattered all over Detroit as tiny art parks.
Every now and then, Mr. Paffendorf and his crew cut the lawn at the site and check up on the art. A new investor is sending 100 metal squirrels for them to scatter around his plot.
As the capital flows in, Loveland wants to increase its scope. "The idea is for residents to look at their neighbourhoods and see what's possible," Mr. Paffendorf says. People could start to "inchvest" to build homes or community centres in their neighbourhoods.
In this way, the city is built online by residents, but maps back into real-life development projects. "We want to empower residents ... to design the neighbourhoods they want."

Peter McCallion's other troubles

Abstract: She also claims in the suit that Mr. McCallion took a secret commission worth $50,000 from Steve Stavro, the late owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs and Knob Hill Farms, on the sale of some land the grocery-store magnate owned on Derry Road in northern Mississauga. What's more, she alleges that it was the mayor who called Mr. Stavro to persuade him to give Mr. McCallion the money, which he collected in the form of three cheques from Mr. Stavro's office.

Full text:   Hazel's son faces a lawsuit involving the Stavros family, a free Cadillac and nude photos
Peter McCallion is an enigma wrapped in a riddle tucked into a black felt hat.
A little-written-about figure, much less a household name, this man in cowboy black is the central figure in an inquiry that has exposed the backroom process behind a major Mississauga land deal. It is also visiting harm on the political legacy of his mother Hazel, one of Canada's most prominent and longest-serving mayors, who pushed hard for the deal and intervened in the affairs of her son's company.
During recent hearings, two competing profiles have emerged of the 57-year-old real-estate agent. On the stand, Mr. McCallion comes across as a shell-shocked bystander, an accidental participant who can't recall dozens of conversations and didn't understand the meaning of crucial legal documents he was privy to. "So far I've asked you about every meeting and every phone call," said Clifford Lax, the barrister representing the city, in a pique of frustration with his witness, "and you've had no recollection of any of them!"
Yet former colleagues add more dimensions, depicting him as a canny, outgoing operator with lots of deals on the go and an enviable access to the local real-estate scene. "He has a reputation of being ambitious in his field," said Tom Urbaniak, a political scientist at Cape Breton University and author of Her Worship , a biography of Ms. McCallion. "His name was everywhere."
Another, darker image has emerged from a 2003 lawsuit, which he denies, in which an ex-lover alleges he took secret commissions and blackmailed her with nude photos to take a larger share of their earnings.
One thing no one disputes is that Hazel McCallion is close with Peter, her oldest son, the divorced father of her only grandchild.
Born in 1953, he grew up in Streetsville, attended high school there along with his brother and sister, Paul and Linda (he never completed his final year), and lives a five-minute walk from his mother's house in the same neighbourhood.
Yet he also displayed an active, independent streak. While younger brother Paul became more heavily involved in the family printing business, Peter McCallion struck out on his own, obtaining his real-estate licence in 1986. He started by selling homes, but by the early 1990s had progressed to buying and selling land for commercial clients.
"He always seemed to have access to big deals," recalls Ettore Cardarelli, owner of Prudential National Realty Centre, where Mr. McCallion worked for most of the 1990s. Mr. McCallion represented both sellers and developers looking for land for everything from warehouses to a banquet hall, Mr. Cardarelli said.
It wasn't just the transactions he negotiated that made his presence felt: By the mid-nineties Mr. McCallion was increasingly seen with his mother at public events, most notably the Mayor's Gala, where he got to know the people who were building the rapidly-growing city.
"Peter has a somewhat different personality than his siblings; he's quite extroverted," said Mr. Urbaniak. "He hasn't shied away from publicity."
In 1997, he met Sherry Douglas, a married, neophyte realtor who worked in the office across the hall from his. Shortly afterwards, they began an affair and, in 1999, both became independent contractors with another Prudential brokerage, which was later bought out by Royal LePage.
According to court documents, the pair's clients included First Professional, a major property management company that hired them to scout land for new Wal-Mart warehouses in Mississauga and Scarborough, and DeZen Construction (First Professional, now SmartCentres, couldn't confirm whether or not Mr. McCallion worked for them but said it had never paid him any money; a man who answered the phone at DeZen angrily declined to answer any questions and hung up).
After their relationship and business partnership ended in 2001, Ms. Douglas sued Mr. McCallion, claiming she didn't get what she was owed on a transaction to secure a piece of land for a Wal-Mart warehouse. In a laundry list of sensational allegations, none of which has been proven in court, she further alleges that Mr. McCallion blackmailed her into agreeing to the deal by threatening to show her "very religious" family nude photographs he had taken of her. (Mr. McCallion acknowledges having taken the photographs, but denies posting them on the Internet, blackmailing Ms. Douglas or short-changing her on the commission they earned.) In 2007, Mr. McCallion attempted to have the case decided by summary judgment, but a judge rejected his motion. No trial date has been set.
She also claims in the suit that Mr. McCallion took a secret commission worth $50,000 from Steve Stavro, the late owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs and Knob Hill Farms, on the sale of some land the grocery-store magnate owned on Derry Road in northern Mississauga. What's more, she alleges that it was the mayor who called Mr. Stavro to persuade him to give Mr. McCallion the money, which he collected in the form of three cheques from Mr. Stavro's office. She also claims that he once accepted a grey, four-door Cadillac in another under-the-table transaction and didn't pay taxes on a $90,000 commission for helping a bingo hall find land. In an affidavit, Mr. McCallion denies ever taking secret commissions and says his mother has never negotiated a commission for him. (Howard Wood, solicitor for Knob Hill Farms, said he would not discuss any of the company's business dealings.)
Whatever troubles he had with Ms. Douglas, the Streetsville cowboy was doing well for himself professionally: According to his filings in the lawsuit, he could command commissions within the tens of thousands of dollars. And within a couple of years, he upped the ante further, setting his sights on what would have been the biggest deal of his career.
The city had long wanted a hotel and convention centre downtown, and Mr. McCallion determined to make it happen. He initiated a long and complicated deal involving a clutch of big-ticket developers, a large pension fund that owned the last big chunk of undeveloped land downtown and the tantalizing possibility of a multimillion-dollar payout for the realtor.
After unsuccessfully trying in the early 2000s to persuade investors in China and Korea to fund his proposal, he brought in Leo Couprie, a businessman from Thornhill, and Murray Cook, a seasoned developer and family friend, to start World Class Developments. At the same time, he was still working for Royal LePage, but didn't close many deals, as he became more involved in his other work.
"He wasn't really producing much. Very few transactions happened here," said Carlo Racioppo, who bought the brokerage in 2004. At the firm, Mr. Racioppo said, Mr. McCallion largely kept to himself, but was known for working on big commercial transactions. "He had other business."
Mr. McCallion's substantial business connections came into play at World Class: In the summer of 1997, he borrowed $50,000 from TACC, a construction company owned by prominent Vaughan developers the DeGasperis family, to put into the company. Shortly afterwards, he brought another experienced developer, Tony DeCicco, into the company as its primarily shareholder.
He also got in deeper. While he started off primarily as the agent charged with getting World Class the land it needed to build, he became part-owner of the company in early 2007. Over the course of that year, he lent the company more than $100,000 of his own money to keep it afloat. In 2008, his financial situation was so dire, he sold his home to Mr. Couprie to pay off a debt. Twice, his real-estate licence was suspended - once in 2007 for failing to complete required courses and once in 2009 for non-payment of fees.
His mother played a role, too - attending meetings with Mr. McCallion and the company's partners and, as the deal looked close to collapse, lobbying the owners of the land to give World Class more time to get the project off the ground. (Ms. McCallion's lawyer doesn't dispute that she tried to get the deal approved, but argues she did so because it was an important development for Mississauga, not because her son was involved.)
The whole thing fell apart in early 2009.
When he appeared at the inquiry, Mr. McCallion didn't much resemble the high-flying deal-maker of days past. For one, the money he received from his substantial commissions (the one he and Ms. Douglas shared on the Wal-Mart deal, for example, was purported to be $500,000) was all gone. The only income he could claim was $60,000 a year for selling some new homes. He hasn't paid income tax in years and needed the city to pay for barristers to represent him at the hearing.
As he sat in the witness box, answering questions in a monotone, he showed none of the business acumen ascribed to him by those who crossed his path. He said he didn't realize he owned the company. When he signed an affidavit listing himself as a principal of World Class, he didn't notice his mistake until his mother called to point it out to him.
Perhaps the only thing that hadn't changed about Mr. McCallion were the cowboy duds. As he strode off after politely declining to answer questions from reporters after his first day of testimony, he cut a rather flamboyant figure, boot-heels clicking on the pavement, hat undoffed.

Not too tall, not too small, Ritchie is just right

Author: John Bentley Mays

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/not-too-tall-small-ritchie-is-just-right/docview/738297691/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Like the building's industrial-strength architecture, the southwest-facing garden courtyard framed by the three residential wings is evidence of sensible contextualism. The surrounding zone is not wholly bleak and drab, after all. Behind the residences along Ritchie Avenue, and abutting the courtyard, are green backyards full of tall old trees.

Full text:   Toronto badly needs more mid-rise housing options - especially of the fresh and clever sort
jmays@globeandmail.com
As the rollout of condominiums from the latest construction boom continues, Toronto finds itself becoming a city of extremes: numerous tall residential towers amid a sea of short, older storefronts and single-family homes.
What's largely lacking in our downtown inventory of housing types is the mid-rise apartment block, bigger than a duplex but smaller than the condo behemoths sprouting up across the core.
The kind of building I have in mind is five to 10 storeys high, cleanly modern in design, knit well into its surroundings. Toronto needs such infill to balance our streetscapes. Trouble is, not much in the way of mid-sized anything seems to be coming out of local architectural offices these days.
Which isn't to say you never find something of the sort in Hogtown. Last week, I visited an interesting new example on little Ritchie Avenue, in the old industrial corner of the city near the junction of Roncesvalles Avenue and Dundas Street West.
Designed by Toronto architect David Anand Peterson and now nearing completion, this handsome six-storey apartment house has grown up in a rough neighbourhood, aesthetically speaking. Right next door is a gas station. Workshops and broad-shouldered old warehouses, some converted into loft complexes, dot the area, and workers' housing from a century ago stretches along nearby streets.
Mr. Peterson has responded to this hard urban landscape with a C-shaped courtyard structure that is just as hard.
The style is Bauhaus modernism, squared off, flat-roofed and flat-planed, rational and efficient. The Guyana-born architect has expended considerable effort to keep the modernist geometry of his volume tight, clear and simple: The side facing the gas bar, for instance, is a flat curtain of metal mesh that falls from the roofline to a point just above the tucked-in car park on the ground level.
And instead of hanging his balconies on the structural framework, Mr. Peterson has punched the terraces on the courtyard side into a sheer exterior wall, making the inner surface of the structure look like a chest of drawers minus the drawers. An imaginative use of vivid colour on the street-side façade and the courtyard walls - it's a kind of chartreuse that turns greener or more yellow in different lights - further reinforces the project's pleasantly tough solidity and its sense of firm grounding in the urban grid.
Like the building's industrial-strength architecture, the southwest-facing garden courtyard framed by the three residential wings is evidence of sensible contextualism. The surrounding zone is not wholly bleak and drab, after all. Behind the residences along Ritchie Avenue, and abutting the courtyard, are green backyards full of tall old trees. Mr. Peterson has invited that lively strip of vegetation to march a little farther northward, into the embrace of his building. (Large cisterns below the two courtyard pools collect storm water for irrigation.)
The 50,000-square-foot expanse of the edifice itself has been carved up into 57 condominium suites, some small, others impressively spacious. At the ground level, the two-storey units open immediately onto the courtyard. All the other apartments, including the two-level suites that begin on the fifth storey, are entered from open-air walkways that run around the outer perimeter, either behind walls or (for most of their extent) just inside the metal screen.
Such "streets in the sky" are not fashionable among architects these days. The designers and developers who create the towers prefer a centralized elevator and corridor shaft. But Mr. Peterson's outlying footpaths afford sweeping views over the city and into the sky, and effectively orient the units away from the edges, inward toward the courtyard and the balconies that overlook it.
Despite certain imperfections in detail - the elevator lobbies are mean for a building of this size, some of the elevated walkways seem too narrow - I like the architectural heft and robust attitude of this work, the way it lands on the ground, its no-nonsense disregard for popular prettification.
But I like even better the example of responsible urbanism it provides. During his time of professional training, Mr. Peterson did a study stint in the Netherlands. There, he told me, he came to a fresh appreciation of the mid-rise apartment complex as a tool for city-building. The structure on Ritchie Avenue comes out of this Dutch lesson, and it has something valuable to teach Toronto about the usefulness of mid-sized residential architecture for creating the livable, walkable density a modern city needs.

Full text:   Cheaper than houses and more diverse than condos, townhouses and semi-detached homes are in big demand in Toronto. So why are so few being built?
Townhouses and semi-detached homes have been one of the mainstays of Toronto's neighbourhoods almost since the city was founded. They were a dandy way for builders to get the biggest bang for their buck and provided an affordable option for families.
My first house was a semi on Balliol Street; I paid $24,500 and held it together with two mortgages.
Now, however, they are fast disappearing from the urban landscape: In the city of Toronto, semi-detached homes have reached almost endangered-species status. Granted they still represent a healthy chunk of the market in the 905 area, especially in Peel and York Regions.
But in Toronto, new semis are few and far between.
They almost qualify for museum exhibit status alongside the passenger pigeon and the horse-drawn milk wagon.
"We just aren't seeing a lot of them built in the city of Toronto," says Steven Hurst, vice-president of analytics at RealNet Canada Inc, which tracks the GTA's new-homes market.
Figures for May show that there were only 34 new semis and 144 new townhouses for sale in the city. Compare that with 387 semis and 976 townhouses on the new-homes market in May, 2000.
The overall GTA figures show an equally discouraging picture. In 2000, there were 5,347 new semis; in the first five months of this year only 979 came on the market. Townhouses fell from 6,207 in 2000 to 2,281 in the first five months of this year.
So why are they not being built? Buyers like them. Just ask Sam Crignano, a partner in Cityzen Development Group. With other builders, he has recently done 40 of them at Aria at Leslie Street and Sheppard Avenue, 20 at The Shores at the mouth of Bronte Creek in west Oakville and 140 at Waterlilies at Dundas Street and Sixth Line in Oakville.
"People love them," he says. "They might not be able to afford a detached home, or even a semi, but they don't want the restrictions of condo living - life on just one floor. Townhouses are the perfect solution."
Builders like building them as well. Townhouses can take only nine months to build compared with two years for high-rise condos. The risk of running head-on into a market downturn partway through a project is considerably less; the builders get their money out faster, and sticks-and-bricks low-rises are a lot cheaper and less complicated to build than concrete-and-steel high-rises.
"We would absolutely love to do more of them," says G.P. Di Rocco, vice-president of Edilcan Development Corp. of Concord. He has 68 townhouses under way at his Valhalla project on the site of the old Valhalla Inn near Highway 427 and the East Mall. "The challenge is finding a site where the numbers work."
That, in a nutshell, provides the answer to why semis and townhouses may still be plentiful in some areas of the 905 but rare as hen's teeth in the city of Toronto: The numbers no longer work.
"The greatest challenge is always finding appropriate sites," says Martin Blake, vice-president at Daniels Corp. "Land costs are just too high; vendors' expectations make being able to get the density you need to be profitable just too high for low-rise. ...
"In the city there are no more greenfield sites left; almost all sites are brownfields and they present challenges with remediation."
So what builders need is a hook, a specific reason to build semis and townhouses that overcomes the need for high density or a new design form that packs more units onto each acre.
While that can be done with townhouses by stacking them or arranging them back to back, it just doesn't work for semis. A semi is a semi is a semi. Put four side by side or back to back and they become townhouses.
Daniels is building 51 affordable stacked townhouses in the heart of Toronto at its One Park West project on Sackville Street just north of Dundas Street East. Its hook is that these homes are part of the city-sponsored Regent Park redevelopment. The city required that affordable townhouses be part of the overall plan, and left it to Daniels to come up with a form of housing that would achieve its goals.
What Daniels is building are stacked townhouses ranging in size from 650-square-foot one-bedrooms to 1,350-square-foot three-bedrooms on two levels. Prices start in the mid-$200,000 range.
"We know there is considerable demand for them," Mr. Blake says, adding that one of the main factors in creating affordable townhouses at Regent Park is the city's support.
Keeping planners happy is the main reason the Benvenuto Group added five three-storey townhouses to its 83 Redpath project on the street of the same name south of Eglinton Avenue West. As it stands today, 83 Redpath also includes a 21-storey tower with 207 units. Original plans called for a taller tower with more suites.
"We were going to put our amenities building at street level but the city said it wanted townhouses," says Mitchell Abrahams, company president. "The planners felt people would feel safer at night walking by houses rather than open spaces."
So Benvenuto reworked the numbers and found that if it built five luxury townhouses selling in the $900,000 range, the end result would be about the same as having more suites in a larger tower.
"It all comes down to economics," Mr. Abrahams says.
But economics is not just what you can sell homes for. It also involves costs, time frames, interest on borrowed money and the speed with which the final project can be sold, Mr. Di Rocco points out. His Valhalla project is a case in point, he says.
The six-acre site could have accommodated four condo towers or three very tall ones. Edilcan looked at the local demand and opted for three shorter towers of 22, 30 and 35 storeys plus 68 townhouses with starting prices at about $400,000.
"When we started to work out the mix of what to build, we realized there was terrific pent-up demand for townhouses in the area. None of the other projects in the area had them; private homes in the area were too expensive for buyers with young families, and by going with townhouses we could stagger the cash coming from the project instead of waiting until each tower was finished."
There is also the risk factor involved with high-rise condos.
"It will take us six or eight months to finish the townhouses, but two years to build a tower," he says. "You can predict as far as six or eight months; doing that two years ahead is a lot more difficult."
It all comes down to making the numbers work, Mr. Crignano says.
"With high-rise you can get 60 suites to an acre; with semis or traditional townhouses maybe 10. If, however, you can convince the city to accept more innovative designs like stacked or back to back or even stacked and back to back, you can get 50 to an acre and then the numbers start to make sense.
"Frankly we would love to do more townhouses in the city; we know the demand is there, but the cost of land is just too prohibitive for just about anything except high-end luxury townhouses. And even then they might not make sense unless they were part of a larger high-rise project," he says.

This 2,697-square-foot home may need some "face lifting" according to its MLS sales pitch, but the new owners could see the potential, agent Keith Roy says.
The four-bedroom, East Vancouver character home was constructed in 1927 and still has original features such as fir and oak floors and iron radiators.
The home was being used as a two-suite rental property with a one-bedroom basement unit and three-bedroom upper unit that generated $1,600 a month.
For the new owners, having a larger-sized home means that they will have "room to grow their family and renovate and restore the house in stages, while living in different parts of it," the agent says.
"The buyers really saw this home as a diamond in the rough," he says, adding that "what makes this home even more unique is its slightly wider lot size."
The house is situated on a 4,068-square-foot lot.
"Most lots in Vancouver are only 33 feet wide, but this home sits on a 36-foot lot, which makes the yard feel significantly bigger," Mr. Roy says.
The house is situated near bike routes, Commercial Drive and local parks, and offers easy access to downtown, Mr. Roy adds.

Abstract: "People are piling up in Chinese cities. I wouldn't have said this five years ago, but there are slums in China. There are places you go where people don't have housing as they should. They don't have proper hygiene because they don't have fresh water.

Full text: For 1,187 residents selected to purchase apartments in the expensive city, it is like winning the lottery. But that luck will spread: China is building 3 million units this year
ASIA-PACIFIC REPORTER
Early on a Saturday morning at a crowded university auditorium, Fang Li Ping is brimming with anticipation as her dreams of home ownership in this notoriously expensive city are about to become a reality.
Beaming in front of a swarm of cameras, it looks as if she just won the lottery. And, in a way, she has.
Ms. Fang and her daughter are among 1,187 low-income residents selected to purchase affordable apartments in Shanghai through a new government housing scheme. It's an initiative that is desperately needed in this city where real-estate prices more than doubled last year amid a runaway property boom catering to the city's wealthy elite.
"We have had great difficulty buying a house," says Ms. Fang, a 65-year-old retiree. "The price is too high for us. We cannot afford the money," she says.
Ms. Fang and her daughter are emblematic of the millions of potential casualties of China's great economic ascendance and rapid urbanization that have gone a long way toward alleviating poverty in the country but also widened the gap between rich and poor.
Brushed up against China's nouveau riche, low-income workers and even middle-class professionals are struggling to afford basic housing in major cities.
Now, in the wake of a series of policies aimed at cooling the rampant speculation in China's high-end real-estate market, the government is planning a massive increase in the amount of affordable housing available to low-income families like Ms. Fang's.
China has vowed to build three million affordable apartments in cities this year for low-income earners and those who currently live in shantytowns, according to the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. Another 2.8 million units will be built in rural areas. The central government has allocated 60 billion renminbi ($9.07-billion) to ensure construction is completed on time, Jiang Weixin, China's Minister of Housing, said at a recent forum for mayors of Chinese cities.
Building affordable housing could pick up the slack in China's massive construction sector, which employs about 250 million people and is a major contributor to GDP growth. The central government has raised the minimum down payment on large homes and second mortgages, which has begun to curb runaway demand. Housing prices in China fell 0.1 per cent in June from the month before, the first price decline since February, 2009, and new construction is slowing considerably as both buyers and developers take a wait-and-see approach. A massive investment in new housing hopes to keep the construction sector humming as high-end developments are on hold.
A surge in new housing units could also quell the threat of unrest and social instability that occurs when hundreds of thousands of migrant workers converge on China's major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Shenzhen each year.
"People are piling up in Chinese cities. I wouldn't have said this five years ago, but there are slums in China. There are places you go where people don't have housing as they should. They don't have proper hygiene because they don't have fresh water. It's hidden and it is a failure of the public sector," says Jonathan Woetzel, director, greater China practice, for consultants McKinsey & Company in Shanghai.
In China, renting is exceedingly unpopular and owning property is viewed as the ultimate safe investment. China is taking a lesson from Hong Kong, where the real-estate market has long been pointed to as a bubble, but has managed to stay aloft, thanks in part to an adequate supply of social housing for low-income residents.
Still, China's government has tried to implement affordable housing on the mainland in the past, only to have the plans fail due to corruption and a lack of funds from local governments.
Just one year after China's real-estate market was overhauled in 1998 to permit the ownership of private property, the government vowed to "make great efforts to build affordable houses for low- or middle-income households." By 2006, however, a wave of criticism had enveloped the programs. Owners would sell low-income houses quickly for profit, and BMWs and Mercedes were soon seen parked in neighbourhoods that were supposed to be for affordable housing.
Corruption, namely the granting of affordable-housing units to government officials, has also been pervasive. In the coal town of Xinzhou this year, nearly all of the 1,517 apartments at a complex designated for social housing were reserved for government officials, many of whom sold their units for a quick profit.
The units at the Shanghai low-income development that Ms. Fang and her daughter are purchasing, however, have very strict restrictions on who can buy them, according to Luo Jiong Ning, the sales manager for Chengtou Corp., the government-backed company that is building the project.
"The household income per person revenue must be less than 2,300 renminbi ($348) per month per person and their current household must be smaller than 15 square metres per person. Household savings can not exceed 70,000 renminbi. These are the regulations, and they are very strict. If you don't meet them, you can't apply," he says.
Under the new plan in Shanghai, owners can't sell the apartments for at least five years. When they do, the government receives 70 per cent of the profits while the owners get the rest.
Mr. Luo concedes his company will make far lower profits building the low-income development than it would by building a high-end complex. However, the government has guaranteed that Chengtou will earn a profit of at least 3 per cent on its investment.
"We are a government-backed company, so we have to take on this task. Without it, our society costs will rise too much. For the living expenses, for the real estate, there will be too many costs," he says.
For Ms. Fang and her daughter, a restaurant worker, low-income housing represents the only viable option to home ownership these days. They had previously owned an apartment in Shanghai - a 25-square-metre flat that housed three generations of the family - but the apartment was given to Ms. Fang's son shortly after he was married.
By luck of the draw, Ms. Fang and her daughter have won the right to choose the first apartment. They select the largest available, a spacious 89-square-metre, two-bedroom unit. The price is 480,000 renminbi ($72,500). Ms. Fang says she could never afford to buy such an apartment in the regular market.
"It would be at least double," she says, pausing for effect.
"At least."

Michigan home sellers find a buyer - in Calgary

Author: Iltan, Cigdem

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/michigan-home-sellers-find-buyer-calgary/docview/734759302/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "We're going to stand by the people of this area with a guaranteed offer to make sure no one comes in to offer them a price for their home at an unfairly low price," Mr. [Pat Daniel] said. "That isn't right and we won't let it happen."

Full text: For a small number of homeowners in western Michigan, where property values have sunk amid the U.S. real estate bust, Pat Daniel has just made an offer they can't refuse.
The CEO of Calgary's Enbridge Inc. said Tuesday the company will buy homes from people who are worried the Kalamazoo River oil spill will reduce their property values.
The offer applies to 200 homes that lie within 60 metres of the river along the 48-kilometre stretch of the spill, or within the local county health department's designated evacuation zone, Mr. Daniel said at a news conference in Marshall, Mich.
Homes that were listed for sale before the spill will receive full list price, while homeowners who would like to move because of the spill will receive the appraised value before the spill, he said.
"We're going to stand by the people of this area with a guaranteed offer to make sure no one comes in to offer them a price for their home at an unfairly low price," Mr. Daniel said. "That isn't right and we won't let it happen."
For people who own homes that would take a long time to sell in an area of double-digit unemployment and depressed real estate prices, that offer could prove to be a godsend.
According to online real estate database zillow.com, home prices in the Battle Creek area have fallen 30 per cent since the spring of 2006. Prices in Marshall, the location of the spill, have fallen about 23 per cent in that time. It used to take about 60 to 90 days to sell a home in the area, but the economy has lengthened the time that homes sit on the market, said Jerry Clifton, a Coldwell Banker agent in Marshall.
The spill will "undoubtedly" affect property values, Mr. Clifton said. As a result, he expects a number of people in the area to take up Enbridge's offer.
"The oil company is making all the right gestures, that they are going to step forward and attempt to pacify the people who feel that they are unable to continue to live in that environment," Mr. Clifton said.
House prices in the area can range anywhere from $75,000 to $175,000, he said. Appraisers will likely offer homeowners the prices of three comparable properties sold in the area the past year to determine home values, Mr. Clifton said.
The offer will be on the table for at least one year, but Enbridge doesn't expect many people to take advantage of it, Mr. Daniel said. The company devised the plan after local residents approached Mr. Daniel and other Enbridge staff to say they were concerned the oil spill would diminish property values, he said.
"We don't expect we're going to be taken up a lot on that offer, primarily because we think this will keep speculators out - those who think they can come and buy at a lower value - and that protects the local resident," Mr. Daniel said.
Enbridge is prepared to purchase all the homes if necessary, Mr. Daniel said.
"We would not expect to ultimately lose a penny on that and that is because of my confidence that we will see no diminution of value," he said. "If we buy a home, we expect to see an asset of at least that value, if not more, going forward."

Rooftop gardens reach new heights

Author: Merringer, Ian

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/rooftop-gardens-reach-new-heights/docview/734445278/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: There's no need to check if any plants on the roof of 401 Richmond are plastic. Tenants of the four-storey building pride themselves on being certifiably authentic and the garden is a natural extension of that. Now 15 years old, it has grown organically to encompass a chaotic vegetative variety. Worn deck boards underfoot attest to this sanctuary's popularity.

Full text: In the midst of a glorious summer weekend, writes Ian Merringer, the city offers some surprising oases
Previously known to rival basements as modern architecture's least hospitable level, flat rooftops are lately being recognized as a fertile supply of extra real estate in downtown Toronto. Owners of private and public spaces are taking sterile expanses of tar, gravel and ductwork and turning them into elevated Edens or high-society hot spots that offer fresh perspectives of the city below.
PUBLIC SPACES
Four gardens offering leafy relief for ordinary downtowners.
City Hall
Queen and Bay
One level above Nathan Phillips Square, at the base of City Hall's towers, a desolate concrete slab served next to no useful purpose for 45 years. That changed at the end of May with the opening of the new one-hectare City Hall Podium roof garden. Low-lying rows of sedum, grasses and perennials unfold in an orderly fashion, complementing the modernist architecture above. It's a restrained array, not the kind of place you might go shoeless to let the moss tickle your toes, but the aroma is pungently earthy, not floral; the crushed-calcite walkways and minimalist benches remind people they should consider themselves welcome at the place where local democracy blooms.
Access: Via the ramp from Nathan Phillips Square or staircases from Bay or Hagerman streets.
401 Richmond St.
Richmond and Spadina
There's no need to check if any plants on the roof of 401 Richmond are plastic. Tenants of the four-storey building pride themselves on being certifiably authentic and the garden is a natural extension of that. Now 15 years old, it has grown organically to encompass a chaotic vegetative variety. Worn deck boards underfoot attest to this sanctuary's popularity. Homemade contraptions that guide creeping vines and hefty baskets of draping plants crowd walkways leading to small groups of tables and chairs in the shade. Pollen isn't the only thing wafting through the air now that the garden has become a Wireless Toronto hotspot.
Access: Follow the hand-drawn signs from the elevator on the fourth floor.
Sheraton Centre
Queen and York
Looking south from Nathan Phillips Square one sees concrete, much of it vertical, but above one flank of the profoundly bleak Sheraton Centre peek the tops of mature birch and red pine trees that have been growing since 1972. A jaunt through the lobby, up the escalators and out into the Waterfall Gardens brings the curious to a three-level garden where the hefty trees compete with the tiered waterfall for attention. Narrow flagstone paths wend through thick shrubbery and a section of walkway that bridges the water course closely resembles a cottage dock, for a lunch-hour fix for anyone who can't wait until the weekend.
Access: Through the main lobby at 123 Queen St. W. and up the central escalators.
Fairmont Royal York
Front and York
Fourteen stories above Front Street, starched chef hats bob between raised planting beds as their bearers tend to the herbs, vegetables and fruit destined for dinner plates inside the hotel. The chefs don't seem bothered by the honeybees coming and going from six hives, each one displaying the Fairmont logo. The garden is designed more for yield than for leisure, but a weekend afternoon tea at Epic restaurant includes a tour of the 4,000-square-foot spot for those who want to see what new flavours are growing.
Access: Epic restaurant, 416-860-6949. To take the tour without the tea meet in the Library Bar at 2 or 4 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.
PRIVATE
Three exclusive rooftops the public can only look up to.
Merchandise Lofts
Church and Dundas
Gardens make up almost half of the 20,000-square-foot amenity space atop the monolith at 155 Dalhousie St. The 130-foot ribbon of undulating perennials renews itself through the season as different plants bloom. The heart of the array has to be the four-by-20-metre marsh garden where the distinguished hemlock tree holds sway. Its sweeping trunk and dense boughs of soft needles mark it as an arboreal gem, rare in Ontario forests and rarer still on Toronto rooftops. It's a note of rustic realism that complements more urban amenities like the glassed-in swimming pool, communal barbeques and canine compound.
Access: For tenants and guests only.
The Spoke Club
King and Spadina
The glass railing guarding the western length of this fourth-storey patio has a clean edge, with no border to impede views - or impart a feeling of structural integrity. It might be disconcerting to those inclined to vertigo, but during rosy summer evenings the aesthetically sensitive clienteledon't want anything getting in between them and the best sunsets in the city. The patio strikes a balance between greenery and seating capacity, with room for 100 members and guests.With no dress code, the pretension level remains below what you would expect at a place that serves watermelon-basil martinis.
Access: Private club. An initiation fee and annual dues are the tickets in.
Thompson Hotel
Bathurst and Wellington
The transition from dark to light is abrupt when the doors of the deep black elevator open to the roof of the Thompson Hotel. In the distance the Toronto skyline reflects the afternoon sun back toward a compact pool surrounded by gleaming bodies on designer deck furniture. But before you can gaze fully upon either spectacle, you have to get past the hostess, stationed to ensure visitors are residents or guests of the Thompson's 336 residential and 102 hotel units. (See story at right for more details)
Access: Residents and guests only.
***********
Nurture from nature
The domed enclosure overlooking Toronto Police Headquarters is not spacious, but then again, sweat-lodge ceremonies are intimate affairs. The squat structure atop the Native Child and Family Services building at 30 College St. is only one way the social workers downstairs use their rooftop garden to help clients connect with native culture in ways that were impossible before.
The garden opened last month and includes a children's play area of grassy mounds and a natural-gas fire pit for group-therapy sessions and gatherings like the sunrise ceremony.
Sweetgrasses (for ceremonial smudging) and cedars (for teas and medicines) line the perimeter, and clusters of Saskatoon berries (for pemmican) and Three Sisters vegetables (corn, squash and beans) dot the communal area.
"The garden allows our clients to connect to their traditional way of life, which can be very restorative, in ways they have trouble doing in the city," says facilities manager Norman Clarke.
A few blocks away at Covenant House on McGill Street, the flowers, vegetables and fish pond of the two-year-old roof garden figure into vocational or academic photography, art, biology and culinary programs at Canada's largest youth shelter. The garden features a living wall and waist-high planting beds and staff use it as a gathering place for therapy, meditation and yoga sessions for many of the 4,000 kids who shelter in Covenant House each year. "Having a quiet and safe place to relax, or being able to nurture a garden can be important steps toward these kids getting back on track," says Covenant House's Rose Cino.

A Canadian key drives a Chinese success

Author: Hoffman, Andy

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/canadian-key-drives-chinese-success/docview/734445013/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "I think the key to Mr. Li's success so far, has been bringing a Western business model to China at a time when the Chinese market is seeking standardization and something they can rely on," says George Kaufman of Chardan Capital Markets, a New York investment bank that was involved in a recent AutoChina financing. "That includes customer service, which is traditionally something that Chinese businesses haven't been known for."

Full text: Yong Hui Li discovered the model for his Chinese truck leasing empire in an Ontario car dealership. His success provides a road map for other Canadian entrepreneurs trying to seize opportunities in Asia
ahoffman@globeandmail.com
Yan Shu Juan waves proudly at the large white bulletin board that displays her credit score to anyone who ventures inside an AutoChina International Ltd. dealership 260 kilometres south of Beijing.
"Look! I have 10 stars [out of 12]," boasts Ms. Yan, the owner of a three-vehicle trucking business that hauls coal from nearby Shanxi province to Zhengding.
A petite 39-year-old, Ms. Yan doesn't look like a budding trucking magnate. But that's exactly what this small business owner has become, thanks in large part to AutoChina, a truck leasing company that is revolutionizing how credit is distributed and vehicles are sold in rural China with ideas borrowed from Canada.
Yong Hui Li, AutoChina's founder, chairman and chief executive officer, is a 48-year-old Canadian citizen who discovered the model for his burgeoning empire 16 years ago while visiting a car dealership in Ontario. "There are many impressions that have been made on me from Canada," Mr. Li says. In addition to his truck leasing concept, he has built a shopping centre in China that is a facsimile of a mall in Burnaby, B.C.
Mr. Li is a so-called transnational - a Canadian citizen living and working abroad. About 2.8 million Canadians now live outside the country, according to the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada. Many of these expatriate citizens, like Mr. Li, bridge two cultures and have become natural conduits for entrepreneurial ideas, taking concepts from Canada and adapting them to new environments.
The ranks of Canada's transnationals already outnumber the populations of many provinces. They are playing an increasingly important role in helping Canada build trade with other nations, and forge cultural and educational links to other societies. Especially in Asia, where 750,000 Canadian citizens now reside, the large number of bi-cultural Canadians provides a natural connecting point between very different societies. "They act as a business and social lubricant," says Paul Evans, director of the Institute of Asian Research at the University of British Columbia, who believes expatriates are an important bridge between Canadian commerce and foreign cultures.
Mr. Li shows how ideas can cross borders. He is taking the truck leasing concept he witnessed in Ontario and adapting it to the realities of rural China with capital he raised on the U.S.-based Nasdaq Stock Market, where AutoChina started trading last year. The story of how he tinkered with a North American business idea to make it work in Asia provides a road map for other Canadian entrepreneurs trying to seize on emerging opportunities in China.
Those opportunities can change quickly - as Mr. Li's career demonstrates. One of six children born to a poor farming family near Shjiazhuang, he managed to win a place at Tianjin University where he earned a degree in laser technology.
In 1985 he returned to Shijiazhuang, but found it difficult to secure a well-paying job. He tried everything from being a technician in a locomotive factory to selling machinery.
In the late 1980s, he decided to go into business for himself. He traded aluminum ingots and set up a car parts operation. Then, in 1994, on his initial visit to Canada, Mr. Li visited an auto dealer in Waterloo, Ont., with a friend from university.
"I was surprised that the Canadian banks and car dealers provided the service of car loans. At that time, China did not have that kind of service. Customers could not borrow enough money to buy a car," he recalls.
When he got back to China Mr. Li was ready to launch his next business.
"I just copied the model of the Canadian car dealerships. The challenge was controlling the credit risks of the Chinese customers."
Mr. Li began to lead a bi-national existence, exploring opportunities on both sides of the Pacific, including an unsuccessful attempt to export log homes from Canada to China. His wife and son immigrated to Burnaby, B.C., and his daughter was born in the Vancouver suburb. Meanwhile Mr. Li flew back and forth between the two countries to tend to his varied enterprises. He was what the Chinese Canadian community calls an "astronaut."
In China, his auto leasing business ran into competition. After the Asian economic crisis of 1997, China's government-backed banks tried to stimulate the economy by providing loans to auto buyers. Realizing his competitors were more interested in juicing the economy than turning a profit, Mr. Li withdrew from the auto financing business and turned to real estate.
Mr. Li focused on Shijiazhuang, his hometown. He built a residential complex and office towers as well as a shopping mall modelled on a complex near where his family lived in Canada. "You will find that my shopping mall is quite like the Metrotown in Burnaby," he says.
In 1999, he was detained by Chinese authorities for more than three months after he tried to buy control of a state-backed company. His wife and family in Vancouver were distraught. After a lengthy investigation, Mr. Li was released. He was never charged. The government officials in Shijiazhuang opposed to his business plans, however, were eventually ousted.
Mr. Li decided to plant his roots more firmly in Canada. He set up an export business in Canada sending double-paned windows back to China and obtained Canadian citizenship in early 2001 under the qualified entrepreneur program, which grants visas to those who invest in Canadian businesses that create jobs.
These days Mr. Li's concrete ties to Canada are slight. His family no longer lives in Canada, he doesn't own property in Canada any more, and he no longer has any business dealings here. But he maintains his Canadian citizenship, speaks fondly of this country, and says that his experience with Canadian business has been crucial in helping him shape the standardized approach that he has brought to his Chinese enterprises.
That approach has been particularly crucial with his AutoChina venture. In 2007, just ahead of a slowdown in the Chinese market, Mr. Li decided it was time to leave the real estate sector and return to the truck leasing business.
The government had exited the truck financing sector in 2002, but not before it had lost millions on bad loans, according to Mr. Li.
"When the customers borrowed money from the banks they thought they were borrowing money from the country. So it was very reasonable that they thought they won't need to return it," he says.
Mr. Li launched AutoChina in March, 2008. It is a cross-cultural hybrid, marrying North American business concepts to the realities of life outside China's major cities.
"I think the key to Mr. Li's success so far, has been bringing a Western business model to China at a time when the Chinese market is seeking standardization and something they can rely on," says George Kaufman of Chardan Capital Markets, a New York investment bank that was involved in a recent AutoChina financing. "That includes customer service, which is traditionally something that Chinese businesses haven't been known for."
With AutoChina, Mr. Li is hoping to cash in on a sweeping national program to improve life in China's countryside. Despite rapid urbanization, more than half of China's 1.3 billion people still live in rural areas.
Zhengding and other rustic centres have densely populated commercial cores, but the surrounding areas give way to stretches of open land, where farms, mines and rudimentary factories dot the landscape. Residents have far lower incomes than those who live in the big cities.
Still, freshly built roads go almost everywhere. China surpassed the U.S. as the world's largest auto market this year. Trucks, such as the ones sold by AutoChina, dominate the underused highways, and sales of the vehicles are booming. Some 650,000 heavy trucks were sold in China in 2009, about five times more than in the U.S. and three times more than in Europe.
The missing ingredient in this otherwise fertile market is a formal credit rating system that would allow people to buy a truck on credit, much as they do in Canada. Many rural buyers of commercial vehicles in China are forced to pay the entire cost of a truck upfront because they can't get financing from banks or dealers.
That's where AutoChina comes in. It operates 184 branches throughout northeastern China. Each retail location provides maintenance, insurance, roadside assistance - and also serves as a one-stop truck leasing shop. Customers make a down payment of about 25 per cent of the truck's value. They then pay the remainder in instalments as part of a 26-month lease.
Such leases would be easy to arrange in Canada, but Mr. Li has had to adapt the system he witnessed in Ontario to make it work in China. The key is using the standardized operating procedures common in North American business, but fine-tuning them for Chinese society.
Staff track the movements of every AutoChina truck using a GPS system installed in each vehicle. Until a lease is paid in full, AutoChina remains the legal owner of the vehicle. If a customer misses payments, the company uses its own keys to take the vehicle back.
In the absence of Canadian-style credit bureaus, AutoChina relies heavily upon its staff's judgment to judge prospective borrowers. The employees at each branch usually know something about each customer's reputation and staff compensation is tied to the quality and frequency of customer payments.
Perhaps most important is the prominent bulletin board at each branch showing the AutoChina credit rating for each local customer. A default on a truck loan results not only in the loss of the down payment - often the life savings of a customer - but also a significant loss of reputation or "face," a key measure of personal value in Chinese culture.
"If the customer is about to default on their loan, their mother, father and sister will all ask or even help to make the payment. If they don't, they will lose face," says Diana Liu, a Taiwanese-born venture capitalist who lives in Vancouver and is an AutoChina board member.
AutoChina has leased 11,000 vehicles since beginning operations in 2008, and it says only 12 customers have defaulted. The company has failed to recover a mere three trucks.
Mr. Li hopes to have 275 branches open by the end of the year and believes there is plenty of room for more. He aims to make AutoChina one of China's first national retail brands - and he believes it will be the concepts he imported from North America that will help it reach that goal.
"We would like to be the McDonald's or KFC of the truck leasing business," he says.
"We don't want to be a Chinese restaurant because for a Chinese restaurant to succeed you need a very good chef and a very experienced manager. So why is it that McDonald's can have tens of thousands of stores around the world? It is because of standardization and that is the point of our new business here."

EXPAT SUCCESS STORIES
It's easy to name famous Canadian entertainers and athletes living outside the country. But expatriate business people have also made their mark. Here are a few:
David Cheriton: This Edmonton-born professor of computer science at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., has a knack for picking Silicon Valley startups. Most notably, he was an early investor in a fledgling enterprise headed by two of his students, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Their creation, Google, did rather well and Mr. Cheriton, 58, is now worth more than $1-billion.
Victor Li: The son of tycoon Li Ka-shing, this 46-year-old Hong Kong-based businessman with Canadian citizenship is the deputy chairman of Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., one of Hong Kong's largest property developers. He lived for several years in Canada, where he worked as an investment banker. He is co-chairman of Husky Energy Inc. of Calgary.
John MacBain: Born in Niagara Falls, Ont., he graduated from McGill, became a Rhodes scholar, earned a Harvard MBA and later built a hugely successful network of auto-trading publications, which he sold in 2006 for $2-billion. Now 52, he lives in Geneva, where he runs Pamoja Capital, an investment firm, and helps direct the McCall MacBain Foundation, a charitable organization.
Jeff Skoll: Born in Montreal, he earned an MBA from Stanford University and became the first president of eBay, the Internet auction firm. With a net worth estimated at more than $4-billion, the 45-year-old devotes his time to philanthropy and movie production. He lives in Los Angeles.

BEACHES / CONDOMINIUMS

Author: Yu, Sydnia

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/beaches-condominiums/docview/734329751/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "There are so many condos when you come around the Beaches, but unit sizes are six, seven or 800 square feet," says Mr. [Mitchell]. "There are a lot of people who don't want to live in an 800-square-foot unit, and at the same time, aren't in a position - or don't want to take home the responsibilities - of taking care of a two or 3,000 square-foot house."

Full text: One Rainsford
Location: Beaches
Developers: Riedel Group and Mitchell and Associates
Size: 972 to 3,227 square feet
Price: $500,000 to $2.2-million
Contact: To register, phone (416) 698-0707 or visit www.onerainsford.com
The development and sales teams behind a boutique condominium residence in the Beaches were convinced that a large, public advertising campaign was hardly necessary to attract widespread attention.
Simply by using word-of-mouth marketing among their collective client base, about 40 per cent of the infill development was sold prior to the official launch late last month.
"It's a very rare opportunity because there are just not many pieces [of land] like this around and certainly not situated where this one is so close to the lake and everything else on Queen Street," says Robert Mitchell of Mitchell and Associates, which is developing the project with the Riedel Group.
"[Plus] it's a different type of project than something you'd find in the Beaches."
Only 28 luxury suites will be built within the six-storey building, which was named One Rainsford after its address at the northeast corner of Rainsford Road and Queen Street.
The site is steps from beaches, boardwalks, parks and trails by the waterfront, as well as pools, tennis courts and a lawn bowling club. Queen Street shops, restaurants and pubs also provide much entertainment, not to mention annual events such as the Beaches International Jazz Festival.
"There are so many things to do here, it's like a village in the city," says Mr. Mitchell, who is also a local resident.
Another major highlight of this mid-rise building - fashioned from glass, charcoal clay brick and natural stone materials - is the amount of space offered in individual suites. They will range between 972 and 3,227 square feet.
"There are so many condos when you come around the Beaches, but unit sizes are six, seven or 800 square feet," says Mr. Mitchell. "There are a lot of people who don't want to live in an 800-square-foot unit, and at the same time, aren't in a position - or don't want to take home the responsibilities - of taking care of a two or 3,000 square-foot house."
To cater to buyers' various needs, models offer one- to three-bedroom plans in single or double-storey layouts. "There are 28 units and we probably have 27 different layouts," says Mr. Mitchell. "They're fairly unique spaces."
Some will have dens, media rooms and two-storey living rooms open to above. However, units will generally have open concept kitchens and master bedrooms with private bathrooms, as well as walls of floor-to-ceiling windows and balconies with gas outlets.
"A typical unit in another building may be 15 to 16 feet wide," adds Mr. Mitchell. "These ... units are 30, 40 or 50-feet wide ... so you get a lot more light coming into the space."
Penthouses will have the benefit of fully landscaped rooftop terraces, which can be customized with features such as infinity pools. Standard appointments in each unit will consist of nine-foot ceilings, crown mouldings and a gas fireplace, as well as a foyer decorated with high baseboards and wainscoting.
Flooring materials will include engineered wood, bamboo, porcelain tile and stone.
Parking and a locker are included in the price of each unit. The building will incorporate many energy-saving initiatives and will not have expensive recreational facilities to operate, which will keep monthly fees below 30 cents per square foot. "It's a fairly low maintenance fee for a building like this," says Mr. Mitchell. Construction begins this year for completion by fall 2012.

Abstract: Alternatives to the census are more costly, more time-consuming and will result in poorer information, says Ms. [Linda Pickard], whose firm, Pickard & Laws, is based in Mississauga, Ont. "The picture of life in Canada will be fragmented," she said. With a voluntary survey, her company "won't be able to provide the same level of service and quality of information as we've been able to do over many years."

Full text: Small business owners depend heavily on the reliable data provided by the long-form census, and worry they'll suffer if the mandatory survey is scrapped
When consultant Linda Pickard advises small businesses on their five-year strategies, the first place she turns is Statistic Canada's reservoir of data from the long-form census.
Ms. Pickard combs through Statscan's databases in search of population trends, local economic indicators, ethnic make-up and education levels - important pieces of market information in planning a company's expansion.
For Ms. Pickard's clients, and hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs across Canada, the census is both a direct and indirect source of reliable information, and helps form a map for where they want to go. Now, small and medium-sized businesses who lack the marketing muscle to conduct their own private surveys stand to be among those most affected by the plan to drop the mandatory long-form census.
Alternatives to the census are more costly, more time-consuming and will result in poorer information, says Ms. Pickard, whose firm, Pickard & Laws, is based in Mississauga, Ont. "The picture of life in Canada will be fragmented," she said. With a voluntary survey, her company "won't be able to provide the same level of service and quality of information as we've been able to do over many years."
The proposed changes have been widely criticized by economists, educators, city planners and religious groups. In hearings in Ottawa Tuesday, two former chief statisticians for Statistics Canada testified that the quality of data will suffer if the census becomes voluntary.
Industry Minister Tony Clement said that the government believes some questions on the mandatory long form invade Canadians' privacy and should not be conducted with the threat of jail terms.
The Conference Board of Canada, the Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices Association and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce are concerned about the change, and so is Roger Martin, dean of the Rotman School of Management and one of the country's most respected experts on competitiveness and productivity.
The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which represents 107,000 small business owners, has expressed "grave" concern to Mr. Clement and asked him to hold consultations on the matter.
It produces a number of studies, including comparisons of public versus private sector pay, which rely on the long-form mandatory census. And its members rely on the long form to make decisions on locations, marketing and local hiring, said president and CEO Catherine Swift.
"This is broadly used by lots and lots of people making business decisions," she said. "I am truly puzzled there was zero consultation. It's very disturbing."
A voluntary survey will lack sufficient response rates to provide neighbourhood-specific information, critics say. It will also worsen the quality of private sector polls and other Statscan surveys, such as the labour force survey, because the census is used as a benchmark for which all other surveys are weighted.
The housing sector is also worried. Peter Norman, senior director of economic consulting at real-estate consulting firm Altus Group, uses census data to advise developers on planning decisions.
He mines the census for insights into traffic patterns, where to put shopping malls, demographic growth and housing sizes by neighbourhood.
"Just about all the questions municipalities ask of landowners who want to bring forward a vision of what they want to do, require long-form census data to address these questions," he said. "I don't know what will happen if we reach a point where we can't talk about, for example, specific demand for detached homes versus semi-detached houses versus apartments."

Full text: Supporters say artist beaten, jailed by police over 'revenge' for social activism
mmackinnon@globeandmail.com
Even in the often-dark world of Chinese police work, it is an unusual perversion of justice. An artist goes into a local police station to raise a complaint about a friend's landlord, is detained and beaten for his trouble, and then is himself charged with obstructing justice.
Calgary native Karen Patterson finds herself struggling to make sense of exactly such a Kafkaesque turn of events. Her husband, avant-garde artist Wu Yuren, is now awaiting trial and could spend up to three years in jail after accompanying his friend to the police station in Beijing's Chaoyang district on May 31.
Ms. Patterson has seen her husband only once since that date. When she went to the police station the next morning to find out what had happened to him, Mr. Wu yelled to her from an open window that he'd been assaulted. A police officer slammed the window shut before he could say anything else. The 39-year-old Mr. Wu later told a lawyer he had been dragged into a room by four or five police officers - his shirt pulled over his head so he couldn't identify them - taunted and beaten.
The police version of events, according to Ms. Patterson, is that it was Mr. Wu who attacked police after they took his cellphone away. Ms. Patterson said Mr. Wu paid for and received an X-ray after his encounter with the police that could provide evidence of what really happened, but the results have not been released to the family or its lawyers. Chaoyang district police have refused to comment on the case.
Ms. Patterson believes the bizarre chain of events that has landed her husband in jail stems from a bold public demonstration he led earlier this year through the centre of Beijing. In February, he and other artists marched down Chang'an Avenue to protest the encroachment of a real-estate developer on an arts district of the city. Chang'an Avenue runs through Tiananmen Square and the heart of the Chinese capital, making it a particularly sensitive place to stage a protest.
"What happened in the police station is revenge for what happened on Chang'an Avenue. The beating happened because of that," said Ms. Patterson, who moved to China 14 years ago and until recently ran a children's boutique in Beijing. Her husband has also spent time in Canada, having taught a six-week summer program on contemporary Chinese art at the University of Saskatchewan in 2004 and spending a semester as artist-in-residence at the University of Calgary two years later. The couple met in China.
A trial isn't expected for another three months, but a lawyer who visited Mr. Wu on Monday said he was in good spirits, and had repeated his denial that he had attacked any police officers. However, Ms. Patterson said she's been told to expect her husband will be convicted since very few Chinese trials - especially those with any kind of political element - end in acquittal.
Mr. Wu is also a signatory of Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic change in China. The main author of Charter 08, Liu Xiaobo, was sentenced to 11 years in prison last December, and many other signatories have been interrogated.
Ai Weiwei, another prominent Chinese artist and activist, says the case illustrates how powerless ordinary citizens are before the law in China. "Wu Yuren is one of those cases where some stupid police at a very low level made a very stupid mistake, and now they're going to sentence Wu Yuren just to justify this decision," he said.
Despite her own pessimism about how the trial will end, Ms. Patterson says she is nonetheless determined to keep raising the profile of her husband's case. She has already written to everyone from Prime Minister Stephen Harper to Fu Zhenghua, Beijing's new chief of police, in hopes that outside pressure might bring about a lighter sentence.
"It sometimes feels a little like, 'Why are we doing all this?' " Ms. Patterson said. "But if it makes a difference between three years [in prison] and one year, or three years and two years, or maybe making sure the cops don't completely get away with it - something has to be done."
Particularly difficult, Ms. Patterson said, has been telling the couple's five-year-old daughter, Hannah, where her father has gone. "She knows he's in a 'time-out' zone for a very long time. The hardest part is telling her when he'll be back, since I just don't know. She asked me a couple of weeks ago, 'Mama, why haven't you got Baba out yet?' "

Condos aimed at minimum- wage earners

Author: Bula, Frances

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/condos-aimed-at-minimum-wage-earners/docview/705599803/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Besides building Woodward's, Mr. [Ian Gillespie] has erected two of the city's swankest hotel/condo complexes in recent years, the Shangri-La and the Fairmont Pacific Rim. He is also the developer of a controversial rental-housing project in the West End, one of eight projects he's working on in the city.

Full text: Developer cuts perks to make new housing affordable
No parking. No fancy finishes. No costly marketing program. No speculators. No one who isn't willing to do some building maintenance.
That's the condo experiment that one Vancouver developer is trying in an effort to build housing in the city priced low enough that a couple working minimum-wage jobs could afford it.
"Our objective was to continue the legacy we started at Woodward's and, at the same time, we didn't want to just bring a bunch of BMWs into the neighbourhood," said developer Ian Gillespie. He submitted his application last week for the unusual project at 60 West Cordova.
It sits on the border of Gastown and the Downtown Eastside, on the neighbouring block to his Woodward's project that combined condos, social housing, a university fine-arts centre and offices in the formerly derelict department store.
Not providing parking has two benefits. It lowers the cost of the units, since a single parking stall typically costs $30,000 to $40,000 to build downtown; that saving will be passed on to the buyer. As well, Mr. Gillespie believes the lack of parking will act as an automatic filter to keep out better-off households.
The 108-unit project is a collaboration involving Vancity credit union, Habitat for Humanity Greater Vancouver and a Downtown Eastside housing group. Habitat will get four condos suitable for families in the building and will choose who gets them. Another eight units, to be managed by the PHS housing society, will go to local community workers.
The remaining 96 condos will go to buyers who will have to prove that they plan to live in the units and who agree to do some maintenance themselves instead of just paying standard condo-maintenance fees. According to the material submitted to the city, nearly three-quarters of the condos will sell for less than $300,000, and more than half will be affordable to people making between $29,000 and $36,000 a year. That's the income of an individual earning $15-$19 an hour, or a couple in which each partner makes the $8-an-hour minimum wage.
Architect Gregory Henriquez said the idea of requiring owners to also occupy the condos as a way to keep prices down is something he adopted from his early days of living in the West End. Then, before the legislation that created individual condo ownership was brought in, the only way for someone to own an apartment was to own the whole building co-operatively with a group.
"Those condos continue to trade at the low end of market because of how they regulate who is allowed to live in them," Mr. Henriquez said.
Besides building Woodward's, Mr. Gillespie has erected two of the city's swankest hotel/condo complexes in recent years, the Shangri-La and the Fairmont Pacific Rim. He is also the developer of a controversial rental-housing project in the West End, one of eight projects he's working on in the city.
The vice-president of community real estate for Citizens Bank of Canada, a Vancity affiliate, said the project is the first of its kind for Vancity, as part of the credit union's new initiative to find ways to build affordable housing in Vancouver. "We definitely have a new mandate to work on this," Stuart Leslie said.
The land, previously owned by developer Robert Wilson, was repossessed by Vancity last year. He had purchased it for $7.9-million in July, 2007, shortly before the city's real-estate market deflated. It's now assessed at $5.4-million.
The Downtown Eastside's most vocal advocacy group says it is opposed to the project because, even though its ownership is geared to low-income households, it will still bring gentrification and increased property prices to the neighbourhood.
"This was a prime lot that could have been used for 100-per-cent social housing," said Wendy Pedersen of the Carnegie Community Action Project.
But Habitat for Humanity Greater Vancouver CEO Anneke Rees said her group is excited because the project gives it a chance to provide housing to low-income households trying to get a foothold the city's pricey market.

Full text:   It has a spectacular view and beautiful forests. It's the site of a future large-lot subdivision after a long, contentious process that saw initial development plans rejected by council. Now Parks Canada is studying it for a National Park designation. Welcome to Bowen Island - an example of how islands dotting Howe Sound and the Strait of Georgia are ripe for land-use conflict
wstueck@globeandmail.com
The sales office for the Cape on Bowen real-estate development is a tent - mounted on a wooden platform, with walls that fold back to accommodate ocean breezes and the view.
That view, past the Cape Roger Curtis Lighthouse and out to the Strait of Georgia, makes up for the relative modesty of the sales office and is sure to be a prime selling point for the 10-acre lots now on the market at prices of up to $3-million.
For the two men who own the 14 lots, part of a 618-acre site that covers the southwestern tip of Bowen Island, the sales pitch is simple: Take a look around. Winning the right to make it, however, was anything but simple.
"It is a jewel," said Don Ho, a Vancouver-based developer who, with fellow developer Edwin Lee, purchased the property in 2004 for $16-million. "There are very few places like this anywhere in the world."
That fact is not lost on Bowen Island residents, who consider the cape's beaches and forests part of the backyard wilderness that gives the island its character. The site's relatively untouched state, and residents' desire to see some or all of it preserved as a park, resulted in a drawn-out planning process and testy town-hall meetings.
That furor has died down, after council last year nixed a plan that would have preserved about half the site as park in exchange for the right to build hundreds of housing units, including some multifamily homes, on the site. Bruised by council's rejection of a plan that had been months in the making, Mr. Ho and Mr. Lee proposed instead a large-lot subdivision, which won approval late last year.
Plans call for 59 "estate" home sites. Phase one, consisting of the 14 waterfront lots, went on sale in June. But even as Mr. Ho and Mr. Lee begin selling their ocean-view lots to the world, some hope that parts of Bowen Island - located at the entrance of Howe Sound, about 20 kilometres northwest of Vancouver, and blanketed by stands of Douglas fir, hemlock and cedar - can still be preserved as a national park.
Parks Canada officials toured the island last year, an early step in a process that could result in parts of Bowen Island being folded into the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve. And, as reported in The Globe on Friday, federal Environment Minister Jim Prentice has launched a feasibility assessment that will finally decide whether to create a national park on the island, a process that will come to a head within a year.
"It's very exciting," said Nerys Poole, town councillor and chair of the council's national park committee. Parks Canada's interest, she said, carries the "potential for a significant part of the island to be environmentally protected and offer recreational opportunities as well."
And while Mr. Prentice made clear the government has no intention if acquiring any privately owned property, since there is already "extensive public land," Ms. Poole said: "I know that Cape Roger Curtis isn't a deal breaker. It's not something that you say, 'Include Cape Roger Curtis or we don't want a national park.' "
Even with expropriation ruled out, the tension on Bowen Island over Cape Roger Curtis underlines the appeal, and vulnerability, of the islands that dot Howe Sound and the Strait of Georgia.
Renowned for their beauty and mild climate, the relatively small islands are ripe for land-use conflicts. Skyrocketing property values over the past 20 years have compounded the pressure.
In the case of Cape Roger Curtis - named for a British admiral - family owners put the site on the market in 2002. Residents formed the Cape Roger Curtis Trust Society to attempt to raise funds to purchase some or all of the property. Mr. Lee and Mr. Ho, who each run real estate-related companies, had not worked together before but were introduced by a banker, who reasoned the two might have something in common.
On visiting the site, they were bowled over. The property was big - about two-thirds the size of Vancouver's Stanley Park - and boasted ocean views and forests, all within a 20-minute ferry ride of Horseshoe Bay.
They purchased the property in 2004, expecting to develop it within a year or two.
Since then, plans for the site have moved through an initial application to subdivide the property, through a contentious neighbourhood plan that would have kept half the site as park but pushed the density of the residential component past limits set in Bowen's official community plan, and - after that plan was rejected - back to a large-lot subdivision.
For some, that's the worst possible outcome.
"People have said Bowen will never be a complete community, and that's probably true. But we could be a more socially diverse. Instead, we seem to be saying, 'No, we're just going to be like Carmel, if we can make it,' " said Neil Boyd, a former Bowen Island councillor and long-time resident who backed the higher-density plan.
Many Bowen Island residents agree it needs a broader range of housing, including seniors' housing, as well as amenities such as a community centre, said Gillian Darling Kovanic, a Bowen Island resident and board member of the Cape Roger Curtis Trust Society. But the number of housing units in the plan - more than 400 - and its location at the opposite end of the island from its ferry terminal and commercial centre made many balk.
Now, Bowen residents are debating an updated official community plan and waiting on a final decision from Parks Canada. (Officials would not comment for this story.) Not everyone is thrilled with that idea: There are worries about traffic and construction and how a national park would mesh with local concerns around, for example, the management of watersheds.
"I am nervous about the implications of a national park," Ms. Darling Kovanic said. "But maybe that is an opportunity for all these disparate voices to come together in a bigger vision."
The developers, meanwhile, are sticking to their plan - which, for the moment, involves selling phase one of Cape on Bowen.
On a sunny day at the site, the ocean air is fresh and eagles wheel above a rocky beach, appearing as if on cue to punctuate the skyline.
"This property will only become more valuable," said Mr. Lee, scrambling up a path from a beach that, under the developers' plans, is to remain publicly accessible. "Because there is nothing else like it so close to the city."
With a report from Rebecca Lindell
**********
ISLANDS TRUST
Bowen Island, with about 3,500 full-time residents, became a municipality in 1999 and is part of Metro Vancouver.
The island is also part of the Islands Trust, which the province created in 1974 to oversee land use and planning on the Islands. The trust is a federation of governments for islands in the area, which takes in the waters between the B.C. mainland and southern Vancouver Island, including Howe Sound. The agency was created with a "preserve and protect" mandate, reflecting concerns at the time about unchecked development on the southern gulf islands.
So when it comes to a land-use issue such as that involving Cape Roger Curtis, which government calls the shots?
In the case of Bowen, which has its own municipal bylaws and regulations, the local government makes zoning and land-use decisions in accordance with its official community plan.
If zoning requires a change to a member's official community plan, that change would go to the Islands Trust for approval. The neighbourhood plan developers proposed for Cape Roger Curtis would have required changing Bowen's official community plan. But council voted down that neighbourhood plan, so the Islands Trust didn't get involved.
Bowen is the only incorporated municipality in the trust. Other islands, such as Salt Spring Island, are governed by a local trust committee, made up of two elected trustees for each island. A third member from another island attends regular meetings and can serve as a tie-breaker.
Not everyone supports the trust structure. On July 4, more than 200 demonstrators gathered on Salt Spring Island to protest what they say are anti-development policies. The protest was sparked after the Salt Spring Island trustees earlier this year turned down a rezoning application from Salt Spring Coffee Co. that would have allowed the company to expand its roasting facility on the island. Critics accuse the Islands Trust of stifling development that could make it easier for young people and families to live on the islands, where the cost of living is high and jobs and rental housing are scarce.
"We have a very educated, active and engaged constituency," said Islands Trust chair Sheila Malcolmson. "On Salt Spring, we heard from a couple hundred [protesters]. And it's great that they're expressing their views. But there are 25,000 residents in the trust area and we more often than not hear the opposite point of view."
**********
PARK PLANNING
Parks Canada has announced a feasibility study for a new national park on Bowen Island. The process will involve consultations with island residents and landowners, municipal and provincial governments and first nations, and is expected to be complete in a year. Some numbers in the mix:
36 square kilometres / size (square kilometres) of the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve, established in 2003
50 square kilometres / size of Bowen Island
15 / number of islands on which land has been designated as part of the Gulf Islands reserve
78 per cent / Land on Bowen Island that consists of natural ecosystems
14 per cent / Bowen Island natural ecosystems existing in a "protected area," such as a park
30 per cent / Amount of land base that should be set aside for conservation under Islands Trust objectives

Woodbine's greatest wager

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/woodbines-greatest-wager/docview/659932915/se-2?accountid=14656

Full text: A $1-billion outdoor complex will bring jobs to troubled Rexdale, but will tourists hoof it out there? Michael Posner checks out the odds
It will certainly be the biggest wager ever made at Woodbine Racetrack.
Some time this fall, the earth will literally begin to move for Woodbine Live - a transformative, $1-billion plan to turn the long-neglected reaches of northwest Toronto into a major tourist destination.
In one mighty pull of the mega-project slot machine, the Woodbine Entertainment Group is aiming to salvage the future of the declining horse-racing industry and, not incidentally, of the polyglot, low-income, high-unemployment, neighbourhood that surrounds it.
A sure bet? Depends who you ask. Despite a robust chorus of local cheerleading, serious questions - about both the project's viability and its possible impact - remain.
Scheduled to open in the summer of 2013, Woodbine Live will sprawl across 81 hectares of real estate owned by the non-profit WEG - part of the largest single tract of undeveloped land in Toronto. Its equity partner: Baltimore's family-owned Cordish Companies, one of America's premier developers, specialists in creating blockbuster entertainment districts.
Entertainment will certainly loom large at Woodbine Live. Although officials declined to confirm details, The Globe and Mail has learned that the partnership is in negotiations with Radio City Music Hall; it would be its first satellite venue outside of Manhattan. As it stands, company information boasts a 6,000-seat concert hall - with no name attached.
That venue would be in addition to a 600-room, four-star hotel, a luxury AMC cinema, a 100,000-sq.-ft. conference centre, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, 800,000 sq. ft. of retail space, a skating rink and 400-metre canal, heated sidewalks and 18 bonfire zones (for winter), an outdoor performance venue - as well as the existing anchor tenant, the racetrack and Woodbine casino, which will soon boast 3,000 slot machines and 60,000 sq. ft. of gaming.
A projected second phase will add a million square feet of office space and 3,000 condo and townhouse units.
In the process, the developers say they will create an estimated 5,000 construction jobs and 9,000 permanent positions, with local residents given first shot at the openings.
But while similar entertainment complexes have worked well in once-moribund, crime-ridden American cities, it's not clear whether the concept can be transplanted to Toronto's remote Jamestown (nee Rexdale), one of 13 "priority" neighbourhoods deemed critically in need.
"It's a site that definitely needs some kind of an investment," concedes Steven Webber, an assistant professor of urban planning at Ryerson University. "But the American equivalent usually takes place in the inner city, with waterfronts or sports venues, and easy accessibility. Here, they're transferring the model to a suburban context."
For the moment, Prof. Webber remains agnostic.
Other issues seem equally problematic. Although acres of surface parking are planned, the developers are lobbying for a much-improved public-transit system, including the now-delayed Eglinton Crosstown LRT and/or a high-speed link to Pearson International Airport, just a few kilometres away. The hope is to lure some of Pearson's 30 million plus annual air travellers.
Also unanswered is whether a vast majority of the new jobs will fall into undesirable categories: menial service positions, low-paying and part-time.
And even if the transformation succeeds, will it do so with a "cripple thy neighbour" effect - transferring local problems, including outbreaks of Bloods and Crips gang warfare, somewhere else?
For the moment, these questions are submerged by a wave of anticipatory euphoria.
For Albion Neighbourhood Services, which caters to a largely immigrant community never far from the poverty line, the definitive argument in favour of Woodbine Live is jobs.
"People here are positive and hopeful," says director Lisa Edwards, "because having jobs allows families to be empowered."
Local politicos echo the cheers. "Woodbine Live," says Etobicoke North councillor and mayoralty candidate Rob Ford, a champion from the beginning, "will revitalize all of Rexdale. It can't happen soon enough."
Mr. Ford's Etobicoke North council colleague, Suzan Hall, says virtually everyone in the area is on-side. "The average citizen is very pleased. The unions had wanted a commitment from the developer on rates of pay, but we can't insist on that."
Instead, Woodbine Live has anted up several millions to underwrite construction of a training and employment centre on the site; it will be run by the private sector.
In return, it has received the most generous tax inducement Toronto has ever offered - an unprecedented waiver of an additional $120-million in property taxes that Woodbine Live would have generated over the next 20 years.
Assuming issuance of building and other regulatory permits, groundbreaking is expected to begin by November.
Predictably, no one is more enthusiastic about Woodbine Live than the developer's point man, Blake Cordish. While his company would not comment which specific tenants were signed for the project, he said that the venture on the whole is a no-brainer: "a unique, strategically positioned piece of real estate, two miles from an international airport, centrally located for Southern Ontario. It already attracts six million visitors a year. This is win-win-win - for business, for the community and for the city."
Mr. Cordish is the fourth generation of his family to be involved in development. His father, David, still logs 90 hours a week, while Blake and two brothers (John and Reed), all vice-presidents, gather every Sunday morning at David's house for a basketball game and business breakfast.
While grim economic realities often derail or downsize other grandiose visions, Woodbine's dream has gone the other way, adding residential housing and commercial offices to the original concept. The more the company dug into the opportunities, Mr. Cordish said in a recent interview, "the more it became apparent what the potential was." The planned expansion, he insists, constitutes a de facto validation that this project is a winner, because "tenants are analyzing the same things and betting along with you."
To those critical of the city's liberal tax concessions, Mr. Cordish says that such trade-offs - needed to help subsidize infrastructure costs - are common practice in the United States. "Remember," he says, "we will still be generating hundreds of millions in new taxes for the public sector. All we're doing is taking a declining percentage of future taxes and using them to help pay for roads, sewers, etc. The entire risk is with the private sector. If the taxes aren't there, we don't get them."
And few question WEG's need to do something with the site. Although the addition of slot machines in 2000 has buttressed Woodbine's revenue base, maintaining the status quo was not an option. North America's horse-racing industry is in the throes of a long-term decline and Internet gaming, legal and otherwise, poses a growing threat to its casino revenues.
Six years ago, concluding that its undeveloped land holdings (275 hectares) constituted its best opportunity to diversify, WEG started looking for a development partner.
If pedigree counts, Woodbine may have found the right one.
Over the past three decades, the Cordish Companies have built comparable urban entertainment districts in Baltimore, Kansas City, Louisville, Houston, Tampa and Hollywood, Fla. All of them, says Mr. Cordish, have become potent engines of job-creation and tax-generation. New ones are now on the drawing board for Philadelphia, San Francisco (on the Bay), St. Louis and Richmond, Va.
When the Cordish Companies first started to build in their headquarters city, Baltimore's inner harbour was a disaster zone of abandoned warehouses and rotting wharves. Today, its Power Plant Live draws 18 million visitors a year.
The story is much the same in Kansas City, says Graham Smith, a local urban planner. There, a wasteland of parking lots and low-value real estate assets has become a multi-block regional tourist destination - even without the pro sports franchise the city is hoping to land. "Other developers people tried for 25 years," says Mr. Smith. "What Cordish has is a recipe that works - resources, connections, capital, relationships. And the spin-off effects in areas around the development have also benefited."
Can a single mega-development in the boonies help repair a broken community and become a regional tourism hot spot? Mr. Cordish is convinced that if you build it right, they will come. "Over 10 or 20 years, tenants will come and go," he says. "So you have to create a genuine experience, a sense of place. That's what people are driven by, not just cool restaurants."
But will tourists flock to northern Mississauga, even when the Arctic winds are howling? Mr. Cordish laughs. With the ice rinks and raging bonfires, "winter," he predicts, "will be our biggest season."

Full text: Eccentric developer from humble roots shocks nation by leaving offspring nothing
Yu Pengnian's journey from poor street hawker to Hong Kong real-estate magnate was already a remarkable one. Then the 88-year-old did something even rarer that shocked many in increasingly materialistic China: He gave it all away.
Saying he hoped to set an example for other wealthy Chinese, Mr. Yu called a press conference in April to announce he was donating his last 3.2 billion yuan (almost $500-million) to a foundation he established five years earlier to aid his pet causes - student scholarships, reconstruction after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, and paying for operations for those like him who suffer from cataracts.
"This will be my last donation," he announced. "I have nothing more to give away."
With that endowment, Mr. Yu became the first Chinese national to give more than $1-billion to charity, now having contributed almost $1.3-billion in cash and real estate to the Yu Pengnian Foundation.
In a stunned China, the question came quickly: Wouldn't his children be angry he had given their inheritance away? "They didn't oppose this idea, at least not in public," the eccentric Mr. Yu says.
He'd been asked the question again during an interview at his foundation's office atop the 57-storey Penglin Hotel in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.
"If my children are competent, they don't need my money," Mr. Yu explained. "If they're not, leaving them a lot of money is only doing them harm."
To make sure that didn't happen, he appointed HSBC as his foundation's trustee and stipulated that none of its holdings could be inherited, sold or invested.
In a society where capitalism is just 30 years old, and charitable giving an even younger concept, Mr. Yu says one of his primary goals in making a show out of giving his money away was to set an example to other rich Chinese. "Everybody has a different view of money. Some do good things with it, some rich people do nothing with it. ...My goal is to be a leader, a pioneer who encourages rich people, inside and outside of China, to do something charitable."
The charitable eccentric
It would be easy to characterize Mr. Yu as an oddball. His hair is dyed jet black and held up in a bouffant. He regularly wears white Mao suits and matching white shoes at which his Western-educated grandchildren quietly cringe. His desk, which sits in the middle of an office he shares with half a dozen of the foundation's staff, is covered with such oddities as a bowl of plastic fruit, a money-counting machine, and a pair of duelling model fighter planes, one Chinese, one American.
He displays little of his wealth - he lives in the Penglin Hotel and eats most of his meals in the buffet restaurant - but sits beneath a giant smiling portrait of himself. Another giant dinner plate emblazoned with a picture of Mr. Yu sits propped up on his desk, gazing directly at anyone who pulls up a chair across from him.
As offbeat as he may be, it's hard to question his generosity. Mr. Yu, who is ranked the 432nd richest person in mainland China, has topped the Hurun Report lists of the country's top philanthropists four years running - and will certainly do so again this year - leading by example as the idea of large-scale giving has quietly taken hold among a growing number of China's superwealthy.
Rags to riches
Mr. Yu says his passion for charity is a result of his own humble beginnings. Born in a small village in China's southern Hunan province, he travelled to Shanghai in his youth hoping to find his fortune. Instead, he found himself pulling rickshaws and hawking trinkets on the streets until he was arrested in 1954 - on the false accusation that he came from a family of wealthy landlords - and sentenced to three years in a "thought correction centre."
After his release, he finally caught a gust of good fortune when he was granted rare permission to travel to Hong Kong. He found a job as a cleaner at a large firm, and even though he spoke no English or Cantonese, slowly impressed his way up into a junior management position, saving everything he earned along the way.
In the 1960s, Mr. Yu and some friends pooled their money together and bought their first property, the beginning of a new career that would see him make millions through shrewd purchases that he would sometimes later sell at 20 or more times the original price. As his holdings grew, he became notorious in Hong Kong as the "Love Hotel King" - a name he detests - because many of the properties he owned were rented by operators of hotels catering to hourly stays. He also won fame for buying the last home that kung-fu star Bruce Lee lived in before his death, a property Mr. Yu later donated back to the Hong Kong government as a museum.
Hard lessons in giving
But in rural China, particularly his native Hunan province, Mr. Yu was developing a very different reputation. When he returned to his hometown of Lou De each year for the Spring Festival holiday, he handed out red envelopes stuffed with cash to the elderly and poor.
Those trips taught him an early lesson about the perils of charitable giving. One year, he enlisted the help of local government officials to help him stuff each envelope with 400 yuan. He found out later that much of the cash had been pocketed by the corrupt bureaucrats, and to this day he insists that the money he donates go directly to the recipients without going through any other charities or government agencies. "In China, I do charity only with my own eyes and hands. I don't trust others," he says.
Mr. Yu's initial foray into wider-scale philanthropy came after he developed cataracts and had a successful operation to repair his eyes in 2000. When he researched the disease afterwards, he found that 400,000 Chinese developed cataracts every year, and many sufferers couldn't afford the required surgery.
He was deeply moved and decided to spend $10-million annually on mobile cataract clinics that drive to the most remote parts of China to perform surgeries paid for by Mr. Yu. His own oversized photograph - his eyes clear of cataracts - is on the side of the "Bright Eyes" vans, which have carried out more than 150,000 cataract operations around the country since 2003.
Mr. Yu says his latest passion is education. He says he wants the bulk of the money from his most recent endowment, as well as the profits from the hotels and other properties he has donated to the Yu Pengnian Foundation, to go to scholarships. "Some for poor students, others for talented students I want to encourage, including foreign students who want to study in China," he said. "Education is very important for a country, very closely related to its prosperity and standard of living."
A legacy project
Mr. Yu is proud to hear his name mentioned alongside such famous Western philanthropists as Bill Gates and George Soros - as well as Hong Kong's Li Kashing, Asia's most famous philanthropist who has given away $1.4-billion of his estimated $21-billion - but likes to point out that he's gone a step further than they have by giving away all his money. However, he admits he wasn't ready to go back to the hard life he lived as a young man.
"I'm not poor, not yet. I still have a credit card - an American credit card - and I take a VIP room in this hotel. And I take business-class flights. I allow myself this," he says, smiling.
As Mr. Yu speaks, his grandson, Dennis Pang, watches with obvious respect and affection. As someone who was in line to inherit some of the fortune, Mr. Pang admits that he was initially bewildered by his grandfather's insistence on giving away what he had earned. But then he took a job as his grandfather's personal assistant, and saw first-hand the good the Yu Pengnian Foundation was doing.
"Before I came here, I was a little confused. But now when I see the people that he helps, I understand that it's special," Mr. Pang said. My. Yu's two sons, both in their 60s, sit on the foundation's board of directors.
Mr. Yu is pleased to have his family's support, but says he would have gone ahead with his philanthropy with or without their approval. "I don't care what others think. It makes me happy to give my money away. I used to be poor."
**********
THE EVOLUTION OF CHINESE PHILANTHROPY
The Chinese government was initially suspicious of an individual such as Yu Pengnian pouring money into an area like public health that had long been its sole domain, and delayed Mr. Yu's application to officially register his cataract-surgery foundation for five years before finally approving it in 2005. Since then, Chinese philanthropy has gradually evolved - thanks in part to the introduction of tax breaks for donations - with the Yu Pengnian Foundation leading the way.
In 2005, Mr. Yu ranked second on the Hurun Report list of China's top philanthropists, behind real-estate magnate Huang Rulun. Pharmaceutical tycoon Li Jinyuan was the only other Chinese to have given more than $10-million to charity.
The 2009 Hurun list named 47 Chinese, led by Mr. Yu, who had given upwards of $10-million over the past five years, including 13 who had donated $10-million or more just in 2009. (Some analysts have suggested the existence of the Hurun philanthropy list - which usually gets front-page coverage each year in the state-owned press when it's released - with inspiring rich and image-conscious Chinese to give away some of their fortunes.)
Rupert Hoogeworf, the researcher who compiles the Hurun charitable list, said there was a definite blurring in China between personal philanthropy and corporate image-boosting, with many of the country's rich making donations via companies that they own outright.
"In my opinion, a lot of their motivations are questionable," he said. "For instance, real-estate developers will - in order to get preferential treatment for plots of land - be very good corporate citizens in that community."
That doesn't appear to be the case with Mr. Yu, he said. "With Mr. Yu, one thing you have to look at is his age. He's obviously not looking to make himself another $1-billion. I think, for Mr. Yu, he's looking to build himself a legacy."
Charitable giving has been slower to take root among the wider population, with the spectacular exception of the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan province, which destroyed entire towns and left some 88,000 people dead. Donations to charities soared by 80 per cent that year to more than $15-billion - more than 90 per cent of it going to earthquake relief - as Chinese responded to the scenes of devastation. Without the impetus of a major natural disaster last year, however, donations fell back to $4.9-billion, only slightly above the 2007 level.
Still, those involved in fundraising are hopeful that Sichuan marked a turning point for charitable giving in China.

SarahPalinUSA: Ground Zero Mosque supporters: doesn't it stab you in the heart, as it does ours throughout the heartland? Peaceful Muslims, pls refudiate. - Tweeted by Sarah Palin
Almost lost in the frequently amusing response to Sarah Palin's use of the word "refudiate" (a dictionarial emendation she had used previously on a talk show) - and her subsequent defence that "Shakespeare liked to coin new words too" - was the cause she was fighting for.
The Ground Zero Mosque, as it has become known, refers to Cordoba House, a proposed community centre and Islamic prayer space that would contain a 500-seat auditorium, a swimming pool and art-exhibition spaces. The site for the building isn't at ground zero. It's a full two Manhattan blocks (Manhattan blocks being the very opposite of New York minutes) away.
Calling it the Ground Zero Mosque is like calling Alaska "the heartland." But Google "Ground Zero Mosque" and you'll see that facts aren't important when there are heartland hearts feeling stabbed heartily.
The Cordoba House site once housed a Burlington Coat Factory, which closed in 1990. Muslims have held prayer sessions there for years, and local residents are mainly supportive of the new development. The community board voted 29-to-1 to support it. It represents a potential $150-million (U.S.) investment in an area that has, let's remember, taken some hits.
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg supports the plan. "Everything the United States stands for and New York stands for is tolerance and openness," he said in response to Ms. Palin's tweets. In other words, when it comes to multiculturalism and coping with terrorist attacks and their aftermath, don't teach your grandmother how to suck eggs.
Ms. Palin's tweet implies that "peaceful Muslims" (a phrase that has a "Jews For Jesus" feel to it, suggesting a conversion from some unrefined state) ought to perpetually atone for the tragedy of Sept. 11, 2001. Sort of the way I, as a baptized Catholic, should distance myself from Mel Gibson, because of course we all pretty much hang out together on weekends, and I should've kept an eye on him.
Is there a piece of paper "peaceful Muslims" should sign that "refudiates" violence? And where are Muslims meant to meet to sign these testimemorials of refudiation, since the places they meet are now apparently inherently suspect? Perhaps in the sewers, or the catacombs?
Just how far Muslims living in lower Manhattan should keep their places of worship from the World Trade Center site, no one has explained. Would five blocks be okay? How about seven? What about three, but they're not allowed to heat the building in the winter?
Maybe they should be allowed to come one metre closer for each Muslim who was working in the Twin Towers when the planes hit? And should these same, newly evolving building-codes-of-conscience be applied in the blocks surrounding the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City because Timothy McVeigh professed a faith in the "core beliefs" of Christianity?
Much of the outrage over the originally uncontroversial centre (now there are protests, and Ms. Palin, noted for her ability to pack vast amounts of bile into 140 characters, can't seem to let this one go) hints at a suspicion that New Yorkers have failed to wring the appropriate amount of rage from the events of Sept. 11.
They've been rather London Blitz about the whole thing - as people often are when confronted with real catastrophe. Very little faith-baiting went on in the aftermath. But now "the heartland" seems to be demanding a kick at the can.
Ms. Palin tweeted several times on this issue. First, she erased her initial tweet (farewell, "refudiate") and wrote "Peaceful New Yorkers, pls refute the Ground Zero mosque plan if you believe catastrophic pain caused @ Twin Towers site is too raw, too real." This would be the second folio, I guess.
The rephrased appeal to "Peaceful New Yorkers" is as disturbing as the original. Does she believe that Manhattan is populated mostly by Huns?
The whole thing feels almost like a corporate takeover, an attempt to appropriate the events of Sept. 11 - the real estate, the story, the characters, the themes and the licence to print rage that logically, but not necessarily, accompanies them.
It's as if the conclusion reached by Ms. Palin on behalf of the "real Americans" she claims to represent is that they could manage this potential resource better, extracting more hate from it. So they're making a serious bid.
In exchange, they're offering something winnable: America likely won't capture Osama bin Laden, but they've got a shot at nixing that Aquafit class.

Asking price: $449,900
Selling price: $556,500
Taxes: $3,175 (2009)
Lot size: 20 by 126 feet
Days on the market: nine
Co-op agent: Nutan Brown, Royal LePage West Realty Group Ltd.
Agent Nutan Brown and her clients were looking for a home renovation project in Roncesvalles Village, where bidding wars were common with so few properties on the market late last year.
After touring nearly a dozen candidates, this semi-detached, two-storey proved worthy enough for the buyers to offer $106,600 more than the asking price.
"Garden is a lovely Roncesvalles street," says Ms. Brown, who points out that many locals are long-time homeowners who frequent the parks, shops, cafes and a cinema nearby.
So it was no surprise that only one family had occupied this century-old home, which was outfitted with a new wiring system, heating and cooling equipment and laundry machines. The roof and front porch were also repaired about three years ago.
"The house had good bones, but it just needed a lot of cosmetic updates," Ms. Brown says.
Nine-foot ceilings are featured on the main floor, where there is a combined living and dining area, an eat-in kitchen and a sunroom with a walkout to a deck and fenced south-facing backyard.
"It has a lovely yard and a garage," the agent says. "To find street parking is not always easy or desirable at the end of the day."
A powder room serves the main level, while a four-piece bathroom is on the floor above, along with three bedrooms, including one with access to a rear sunroom.
For additional living space, the basement could be finished.

Defining - and finding - the 'affordable' home

Author: McGillivray, Scott

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/defining-finding-affordable-home/docview/644062433/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The affordability index has proven to be a good indicator of a possible "bubble." Using the U.S. example, it appears that a real estate bubble begins to grow around an affordability index of 6. As the affordability index increases, so do the chances of the bubble bursting. Of course, there are many other factors unique to each city, but the index provides market watchers with an early warning system.

Full text: 'Affordability" is one of those familiar buzzwords in the world of real estate. But the affordability index is a fantastic metric.
The affordability index is the home purchase price divided by the gross household income. The result is the one number that gives us a look into the real estate health of a household and even an entire city. I have used this tool for years to identify great communities to invest in.
On a city level, a low index indicates that jobs are paying very well in comparison to the price of housing. There's potential for increased value, since residents have the disposable income to invest in their home and community. People moving into the neighbourhood have high incomes and are able to spend more on a home, driving home prices up. I often see home values increase faster than the national average in cities with a low index.
On the other hand, a high index tells me that people are overextended. Housing costs account for a percentage of their income that is much too high. Households find it difficult to save and invest in their homes.
Maintenance becomes neglected as there is no money to pay for it. We may see homes, and even entire neighbourhoods, begin to appear rundown. High index cities can be held afloat by low interest rates in the short term, but home values tend to be corrected down eventually.
What makes the affordability index such a great indicator is that it accounts for local income. Home prices then become relative to income levels, creating an "apples to apples" comparison.
So what is an acceptable affordability index level? Everyone has their rules; these are mine:
* I never buy an investment property in an area where the index is above the provincial or national average.
* I wouldn't advise anyone to buy their home with an index above 4. This means that if you are looking at a $400,000 home, your gross household income should be at least $100,000.
The affordability index has proven to be a good indicator of a possible "bubble." Using the U.S. example, it appears that a real estate bubble begins to grow around an affordability index of 6. As the affordability index increases, so do the chances of the bubble bursting. Of course, there are many other factors unique to each city, but the index provides market watchers with an early warning system.
It is clear that some Canadian cities are now in such a bubble, as affordability has rocketed way out of control: In Vancouver, the index is at 9.46; in Burnaby, B.C., 7.6. Toronto logs in at 4.93. The national average is about 5.35.
I wanted to investigate whether Canadians overextended themselves. I calculated the average affordability across five cities; a city is considered "affordable" if the affordability index is under my acceptable cutoff of 4.
I also profiled two homes from each of these cities to compare what we are buying to what we can actually afford.
We seem to be holding things together - for now. While our national average is approaching bubble territory, we seem to have learned from the sad example of the United States.
A few markets are due for a correction soon, some experts say as much as 20 per cent or more in markets like Toronto and Vancouver. These and the other inflated cities are only sustainable in the short term, because interest rates are so low. As interest rates rise over the next 24 months, we're in for some major changes.

Full text: Modern North: Architecture on the Frozen Edge
By Julie Decker
Raincoast Books, 240 pages, $52
When Canadians talk about going up north, we usually aren't talking about the Far North: It's a long way from Georgian Bay to the tundra. But as we huddle in our living rooms in winter, all those kilometres of ice and snow feel very close, and we want our houses to keep the elements out.
That desire to fight the cold, both physically and psychologically - together with a modernist design vocabulary - ties together the buildings in Modern North .
Author Julie Decker, who is Alaskan, has selected 33 houses, schools and cultural buildings in the Yukon, Alaska, Iceland and across Scandinavia.
There's work by internationally famous designers here, including Norwegian-American architects Snohetta, and a museum project by Britain's David Chipperfield that does beautiful things by reflecting the Alaskan sky and mountains.
But many of the best buildings are houses located in Alaska and Iceland. One in Iceland, the Hof Residence by Studio Granda, is nestled right into the ground, taking its insulation from the earth just like traditional Icelandic and Finnish buildings.
The designers often use materials that are as rough as the landscapes: concrete, raw cedar, local stone.
The dark copper sheathing on the Skrudas Residence, also by Studio Granda, echoes the volcanic rock that rules the Icelandic landscape.
This house in suburban Reykjavik has a similar situation to many Canadian houses - there are neighbours close by and sublime views on the horizon. The architects have responded by using carefully placed windows to frame views to the ocean while obscuring the houses next door.
Along the same lines is the Nearpoint House in Anchorage, a handsome wedge on a hillside that captures mountain views without using too much inefficient glass.
It's a good model for houses in Ontario, where many "cottages" are bigger than they have to be and many modernist houses have big, heat-seeping windows.
The Canadian content is pretty slim. Aside from an introduction by Globe and Mail architecture critic Lisa Rochon, there are four buildings by Yukon-based Kobayashi + Zedda, plus a gorgeous and fairly well-known camp dining hall by Toronto's Shim-Sutcliffe Architects.
That dining hall is a simple form - it resembles a tent - that is gorgeously crafted from several types of wood and clear roof panels that open to let air flow through. It shows how well a building can be integrated with its landscape and still be practical enough to survive a tough winter.
It's thousands of kilometres from the Yukon, so it's not all that northern in location - but it surely is in spirit, which is very Canadian.

Ground zero mosque becomes national flashpoint

Abstract: The centre's backers sound flabbergasted by the opposition it has inspired. "I'd love to see [Sarah Palin] come to Park51 for Friday prayers instead of just sending a tweet," said Sharif El-Gamal, 37, the project's developer. "She'd see that we're just as American as she is."

Full text: Politicians smell opportunity as simmering tensions over building project near 9/11 site come to boil
It's a sunny summer morning on a small side street in lower Manhattan. A cart is doing a brisk business in coffee and pastries, a rundown bar is open for early drinking and shoppers hurry in and out of a corner market.
Almost unnoticed, an older woman in jeans and a white T-shirt approaches the shuttered façade of an abandoned five-storey building. At each column, she places her finger on the peeling paint and makes the sign of the cross.
Her name is Jeanne Jones, a 70-year-old retiree from North Hollywood, Calif. She's made a special detour to this spot, two blocks from ground zero, because it is the site of a proposed mosque and community centre. Proponents say it will be a monument to tolerance and understanding, but she calls it a "poke in the eye."
Asked what she's doing, Ms. Jones replied that she was praying. "I'm asking God to protect this building from unloving stuff," she said. The project "will not bring the peace people think it will bring."
The fact that Ms. Jones was there at all is proof that what was a simmering local issue is now a national flashpoint. Supporters plan to build a new glass-and-steel building to house a large prayer space, a swimming pool and an auditorium. Detractors say the location, so close to the site of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, is inappropriate or worse.
On Sunday, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin waded into the fray. In a Twitter post, she urged New Yorkers to reject the project. "Peace-seeking Muslims, pls understand, Ground Zero mosque is UNNECESSARY provocation; it stabs hearts," she wrote.
Other political figures have also smelled opportunity. Newt Gingrich, another potential Republican candidate for president, assailed the effort on his website Wednesday. "There should be no mosque near Ground Zero in New York so long as there are no churches or synagogues in Saudi Arabia," he said in a statement.
Of course, the project has a political heavyweight of its own in its corner: New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. "The government should never - never - be in the business of telling people how they should pray, or where they can pray," he said last week. "We want to make sure that everybody from around the world feels comfortable coming here, living here and praying the way they want to pray."
The project now goes by the name "Park51" after its location on Park Place. It is the brainchild of Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, 61, who has his own congregation in nearby Tribeca. Long before 2001, he had founded a non-profit organization that fosters young Muslim leaders, pushes to reclaim women's rights in Islam and engages in interfaith dialogue.
The centre's backers sound flabbergasted by the opposition it has inspired. "I'd love to see Sarah Palin come to Park51 for Friday prayers instead of just sending a tweet," said Sharif El-Gamal, 37, the project's developer. "She'd see that we're just as American as she is."
Mr. El-Gamal, who was at ground zero bringing water to emergency personnel in the days after 9/11, said he and Mr. Rauf have been talking about the project for a decade. Last year, his real estate firm, Soho Properties, purchased the building on Park Place for $4.85-million (U.S.). Formerly home to an outlet of the Burlington Coat Factory, it was damaged on 9/11 by a piece of the landing gear from one of the hijacked planes.
Building the centre "is our contribution as Muslim-Americans to the city which has given us so much," Mr. El-Gamal said. "Radical and hateful agendas will have no place in our community centre or in the mosque."
Among those they've consulted on the project: Rabbi Joy Levitt, executive director of the Jewish Community Center in Manhattan. Ms. Levitt said she shared some practical tips: Be sure the design takes into account space for strollers, count on the project running 20-per-cent over budget, and reach out to as many partners as possible. "We're anxiously awaiting the completion of the building so that we can be a partner for them," she said.
The only thing truly standing in the way of Park51 is a considerable fundraising effort, which could seek to raise a sum of $100-million. Mr. El-Gamal said the hope is to break ground some time in the next 18 to 36 months. The city recently held what turned into a raucous hearing on whether the 150-year-old building should be designated a landmark. Even if it were, such a decision, due by next month, is likely to slow rather than stop the project.
That will disappoint people like Ms. Jones, who was taking pictures of the building for her family back in California and wearing a T-shirt displaying the Twin Towers. "I don't want to sound unbalanced or fanatical," she said. "Anywhere within a one- or two-mile radius of ground zero is not appropriate."

Full text: THIS WEEK / HIGHLIGHTS
FRIDAY
JULY 23
DRAMA
Murder, She Wrote
Vision, 7 p.m.
Back in the eighties, this murder-mystery series starring Angela Lansbury as novelist/sleuth Jessica Fletcher was one of the most-watched shows on TV. In tonight's episode, Jessica travels to New Orleans during Mardi Gras to visit her cousin Cal, played by Peter Bonerz, aka Jerry the dentist from The Bob Newhart Show. Upon arrival, she happens upon an ugly murder scene with Cal's name written beside the victim in blood.
DRAMA
Friday Night Lights
NBC, Global, 8 p.m.
Fans of this well-regarded series were annoyed when the show didn't receive an Emmy nomination for Best Drama two weeks ago; the fact that leads Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton both earned acting nods was presumably some consolation. Tonight, Britton's character Tami is aghast when a parent calls for her to resign her principal post at East Dillon High. As well, local football hero Tim (Taylor Kitsch) blows his savings on a big purchase, while Julie (Aimee Teegarden) has her future plans shattered by a single call.
DRAMA
Medium
CBS, CTV, 9 p.m.
Clairvoyant hausfrau Allison (Patricia Arquette) has psychic messages coming at her from all directions in tonight's show. First comes the vision suggesting that her best friend Rosemary didn't die from cancer, but rather at the hands of a hospital worker. Next, Alison is dismayed to discover her own daughter may be blessed/cursed with her own psychic abilities. What's a soccer mom to do?
SCIENCE
Forensic Factor
Discovery, 10 p.m.
Recently returned for its sixth season, this Canadian-made series re-enacts famous criminal cases solved by forensic science. Tonight's episode recalls a case that took place years ago in an upscalecommunity in California. Several elderly women were brutally murdered andthere were no signs of forced entry. Police interrogated the usual suspects, but forensic examiners identified an unlikely suspect.
SATURDAY
JULY 24
DOCUMENTARY
Battle of Wills
Bravo!, 7 p.m.
Does Lloyd Sullivan really own the only known portrait of William Shakespeare? Filmmaker Anne Henderson examines the Ottawa native's bold claim. Scientific testing has confirmed that the portrait is an unaltered painting from the early 17th century, but some skeptics have cast doubt on Sullivan's claim that the portrait is really a likeness of the Bard.
HISTORY
Ancients Behaving Badly
History, 8 p.m.
Turns out some of history's most notorious figures were even worse than their reputations. Tonight's episode focuses on the battles of the legendary Genghis Khan. The program details how his army's sweeping campaign into northern China resulted in the deaths of over 60 million people, making him the most feared and hated ruler Persia had ever seen.
SCI-FI
Doctor Who
Space, 9 p.m.
The latest version of the sci-fi series is drawing to a close and most fans agree that Matt Smith has made a fine Doctor Who. Following up last week's cliffhanger, tonight's episode finds the Doctor sealed inside a prison designed by his greatest enemies. Simultaneously, the TARDIS time-travelling machine is destroyed, which could be catastrophic for the entire universe. Somehow, the fate of billions of people ends up in the hands of a young earth girl with dreams of a star-filled sky.
MOVIE
The Barbarian Invasions
CBC, 10 p.m.
Winner of the Best Foreign Language Film at the 2004 Academy Awards, this feature by Denys Arcand picks up the life-stories of the characters introduced in his 1986 movie The Decline of the American Empire . The story trains sharply on the character of Remy (Remy Girard) and his battle with terminal cancer and the efforts of his son Sebastien (Stephane Rousseau) to make his father more comfortable in his final days.
SUNDAY
JULY 25
REALITY
Big City Broker
Slice, 7 p.m.
In almost every Canadian city, the urban residential property business is booming. This series follows the daily routine of Toronto real-estate kingpin Brad J. Lamb and his team of sales hot-shots as they try to match the right client with the right condo. In tonight's show, Brad appeals the city's decision to cease the development of a new condo project, while Sally deals with a buyer shopping for friends who live out of town. And Nick lands a dream property, but it comes with owners who have high expectations.
DOCUMENTARY
Born on a Bad Day
TLC, 9 p.m.
Yet another TLC variation on a reality theme, this special tells the true tales of women who gave birth during natural disasters and other unpleasant occurrences. We hear the story of a woman who had her baby during a hostage situation, and a woman who delivered her child by flashlight during a horrific tornado. The program includes interviews with the moms, and in several cases, the kids themselves.
DRAMA
Mad Men
AMC, 10 p.m.
Back for a fourth season tonight, Mad Men is set in the New York advertising scene, in the sixties, and has won back-to-back Emmys for Best Drama. Tonight's show opens in November, 1964. Suave ad man Don Draper (Jon Hamm) has split with wife Betty (January Jones) and formed his own ad agency. His secretive ways lead to the cancellation of an interview with a major newspaper that would have given them a boost. Elsewhere, Pete (Vincent Kartheiser) and Peggy (Elizabeth Moss) try to wheedle money out of a client, while Roger (John Slattery) attempts to find Don a girlfriend. Welcome back.
MOVIE
My American Cousin
Family Channel, 10:40 p.m.
This smart and sweet Canadian film earned universal praise when it landed in theatres back in 1985.

REALITY
If You Really Knew Me
MTV, 10 p.m.
For all the mindless fare like Jackas, The Hillss and Jersey Shore , MTV occasionally comes up with a good reality show concept. This documentary series follows the efforts of counsellors who run high-school workshops that are designed to foster friendship and solve problems. The first episode unfolds at Freedom High School in Oakley, California, which has the same problems of every high school today: bullying, cyber-bullying, cliques and so forth.

DRAMA
Doc
Vision, 11 p.m.
In between the time Billy Ray Cyrus scored a chart-topping hit with Achy Breaky Heart and nurtured his daughter Miley to become one of the planet's biggest pop stars, he starred in this low-key medical drama. Running 2001 to 2004, the concept cast Cyrus as Dr. Clint "Doc" Cassidy, a Montana medic who took a job at a high-falutin' medical clinic in New York (the show was really filmed in Toronto). In most episodes, Doc would impart his folksy (and Christian) values to the hell-bound city folk. Tonight, for example, he teaches co-worker Nancy the value of friendship, just like a good ol' boy should.

TVO, 9 p.m.
Sometimes children can be the bravest people in the world. Award-winning filmmakers Steve Bognar and Julia Reichert spent six years chronicling the stories of five families, each with a child fighting cancer, to make this compelling documentary. Every one of the five kids - Tim, Al, Jenny, Alex and Justin - is a different mini-profile in courage and the program also devotes screen time to the medical professionals overseeing their treatments.

Downtrodden lower Yonge on the road to recovery

Abstract: What's missing in all this is Toronto's planning department, which has no strategy for the evolution of lower Yonge or improvements to the public realm. "Yonge Street" - despite its much-touted role as the city's main artery - doesn't even appear in Toronto's official plan.

Full text:   The city's long-neglected strip is seeing the most development since the Eaton Centre was built in the 1970s
After decades of stagnation, the city's longest street could be turning a corner.
Consider the signs: Four substantial high-rise projects are going up along Yonge Street between Bloor and Gerrard streets. A major commercial real-estate firm, Primaris, has bought property on both sides north of Dundas Street, although the company isn't yet revealing its plans. And Ryerson University is moving aggressively to carve out a presence around the intersection of Yonge and Gould Street.
What's more, a growing number of residents, businesses and local politicians are talking openly about wider sidewalks, bike lanes and reducing Yonge south of Bloor to two lanes - especially at Dundas, which has become one of Canada's busiest pedestrian crossings.
As James Robinson, executive director of the Downtown Yonge Business Improvement Area, says, "People are voting with their feet."
What's missing in all this is Toronto's planning department, which has no strategy for the evolution of lower Yonge or improvements to the public realm. "Yonge Street" - despite its much-touted role as the city's main artery - doesn't even appear in Toronto's official plan.
Unlike many of Toronto's downtown retail strips, lower Yonge has been stuck in a rut for decades, even though it is just a block from Bay Street, which has become one of the city's densest residential neighbourhoods over the past 15 years.
Kyle Rae, the area's long-time councillor, says several factors have worked against redevelopment: a large number of very small properties owned by investors reluctant to sell; the presence of the subway tunnel just east of Yonge, which limits large-scale building projects; and the importance of heritage storefronts.
"Yonge Street has been ignored and neglected," observes lawyer Stephen Diamond, who runs Diamondcorp, which is developing a 45-storey condo called Five a block north of Wellesley Street. But the ground has shifted, he says. "The action now is going to happen on Yonge, which is good for the city of Toronto."
Mr. Diamond is a rare breed. While most builders studiously avoided Yonge, his firm had the savvy to propose the heritage-friendly condo tower on a stretch where funky eclecticism long ago yielded to stagnation and decay.
Mr. Diamond's proposal - which council approved last fall - marries density with preservation. The tower is set a few metres back from Yonge, and his firm acquired several historic buildings on both Yonge and St. Joseph Street that will be restored and integrated into the project's ground-floor area. Units went on sale earlier this spring, and a large banner draped across several storefronts signals Five's future presence on Yonge.
That presence was always a goal. When Mr. Diamond pitched the scheme to the community and council, his team didn't just show glamour shots of the building; they took the unusual step of providing slides of how Yonge might some day look with new tall buildings, restored facades, and more generous sidewalks.
"What we were doing is looking up and down Yonge Street and asking what are the opportunities not just for our site but further north and south," he says. "I've always felt that the treatment of what happens in the first three or four storeys and the public realm is far more important than the height of the tower."
Another developer is building a similarly configured tower just a few metres north, on St. Mary Street.
Further south, meanwhile, Ryerson is pursuing an ambitious expansion strategy that aims to transform Yonge north of Dundas into a campus "gateway." In October, the university will reveal the much-anticipated showcase design for the student learning centre that will go up on the old Sam the Record Man site.
President Sheldon Levy has approached Primaris, the real-estate company buying land on Yonge, about some kind of joint development. He is also leaning on the city to "take whatever action necessary" to deal with the semi-collapsed building at Gould Street, which has been surrounded by hoardings since April. He said in an interview that he hopes to buy the property, which is owned by a development company in Mumbai.
There hasn't been so much activity along lower Yonge since Cadillac Fairview built the Eaton Centre back in the 1970s.
City planning officials, who have been working on a downtown "tall buildings" strategy for more than a year, are watching Five closely to see if Diamondcorp's approach can be replicated elsewhere on the corridor. Raymond David, the director of community planning for the downtown area, says the project protected Yonge's historic storefronts while adding new residential units.
But both he and Mr. Diamond say the quirky property lines all along lower Yonge work against a one-size-fits-all solution, which is probably a good thing.
The other piece of the Yonge puzzle is making the street itself more welcoming to uses other than payday loan franchises and dollar stores. South of College Street, the Downtown Yonge BIA has invested in recent years in distinctive light standards and signage, and there's talk of extending the BIA's reach further north.
Mr. Levy, at Ryerson, is pushing the city to allow the block north of Dundas to evolve into a "digital media zone" meant to attract high-tech entrepreneurs and extend the glitzy electronic vibe of Dundas Square north to College. "It's time for the city to take the initiative," he says.
That's a contentious idea, and one candidate running to succeed Mr. Rae, Kristyn Wong-Tam, feels it's important the city not forget about local apartment dwellers. "Yonge belongs to the neighbourhood and the business owners," she says.
But, increasingly, it now belongs to a handful of intrepid condo developers, who know there's still a lot of demand for downtown housing even though Bay Street has been largely built out. "It's a great street and there's great potential," Mr. Diamond allows, "but it's not easy to assemble land and make it all happen."

The vision
PLANS
* Additional entrances/exits for lower Yonge subway stations. TTC chair Adam Giambrone says a new $10-million exit for Wellesley, on Dundonald Street, will go to tender in the fall.
* The TTC is also looking at new exits at Gould (Dundas, to serve Ryerson), College Park (College), and Granby Parkette (College).
DREAMS
* Wider sidewalks, bike lanes and lane reductions between College and Queen to enlarge the Yonge-Dundas Square pedestrian zone.
* Expanding the digital billboard zone outside the Eaton Centre north to Gerrard.
* Extending the reach of the Downtown Yonge BIA north of College.

A perfect marriage (of food and wine)

Author: Beppi Crosariol

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/perfect-marriage-food-wine/docview/614636166/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: For the reds, I suggested: Château Pey La Tour 2008 from Bordeaux ($13.95 in Ontario); Ortas Tradition Rasteau from the Rhone Valley 2008 ($15); and François Lurton Les Hauts de Janeil Syrah-Grenache 2008 from southern France's Languedoc region ($12.95). These are all terrific value propositions, full of fruit flavour yet earthy and herbal in that French way. They also should pair nicely with Mr. [Jamie Kennedy]'s beef-rib-eye main course, which will be served with a herbed jus.

Full text:   decanter@globeandmail.com
The message landed in my inbox last week with one of those red exclamation marks - "Importance: high" - in the iconography of my e-mail program. It was from Ben Sykes, a vice-president at a Toronto real-estate brokerage. He was writing to announce he's getting married this weekend. Besides showing up on time, his main duty as groom, he told me, was to choose wines for the reception.
"Beppi, is there a number I can try you at?" he wrote. "Jamie Kennedy is doing our food and I want to ensure we pair it with a good red and white. We don't want to spend more than $17 per bottle."
I called. Mr. Sykes exhaled with relief. Then, suddenly, I felt my own anxiety mount as the burden of a loyal reader's first test as a married man was transferred to yours truly.
Picking wines for a wedding is no easy feat. Pleasing one person whose preferences you may know is tough enough. Impressing a crowd whose predilections may be all over the map is next to impossible. Some people will love the fruit-forward flavour of Australian shiraz, while others may find it as loud and jarring as a bridesmaid's fuchsia dress. Some are partial to austere red Bordeaux, while others can find the style too tight, like a corset after too much cake.
Yet I was heartened by Mr. Sykes's parameters. Usually, my unofficial role as wedding planner comes with a more challenging price restriction; keep it under $10 per bottle. Seventeen opens up the field considerably. Another factor that bolstered my confidence was the menu. I'm familiar with the culinary mastery of Toronto toque Jamie Kennedy. A missionary for organic, local ingredients and unfussy preparations, he specializes in pure, clean flavours. That style offers considerable latitude where wine is concerned. Game on.
For anyone in Ben's happy predicament, this would be my cardinal rule for wine-and-food marriages: Think Europe. Don't get me wrong, I love Australian shirazes and California cabernets, but not so much for weddings. For one thing, European wines generally contain more food-friendly acidity. For another, they tend to contain less alcohol, and you know what that means - fewer collisions on the dance floor and less likelihood of interminable speeches from pie-eyed groomsmen exhuming details about old girlfriends and the stag party.
Here are the selections I made in a hurry.
For whites I chose: Louis Jadot Mâcon-Villages Chardonnay from Burgundy ($14.20); Grand Gaillard Sauvignon Blanc 2008 from Bordeaux ($13); and Anselmi San Vincenzo from northern Italy ($14.95). The chardonnay in particular is a big bargain and an elegant accompaniment for the menu's fish option of wild salmon with mushroom sauce.
For the reds, I suggested: Château Pey La Tour 2008 from Bordeaux ($13.95 in Ontario); Ortas Tradition Rasteau from the Rhone Valley 2008 ($15); and François Lurton Les Hauts de Janeil Syrah-Grenache 2008 from southern France's Languedoc region ($12.95). These are all terrific value propositions, full of fruit flavour yet earthy and herbal in that French way. They also should pair nicely with Mr. Kennedy's beef-rib-eye main course, which will be served with a herbed jus.
Because Mr. Sykes told me he intended to sample the wines before settling on two, I thought I'd add an easy-to-find New World red option should the fruit-forward character appeal. My only caveat about Penfolds Koonunga Hill Cabernet Sauvignon from Australia ($16.95) is that it contains 13.8 per cent alcohol, a recipe for dance-floor mayhem.
I wish Mr. Sykes and his bride well.
Another urgent solicitation arrived recently. "I have a godson turning 1 year old next week," wrote Ryan Paliga of Ontario. "I would like to buy a bottle of wine that he could enjoy with his father on his 18th/19th birthday. My budget is under $200. Any suggestions?"
Mr. Paliga is not only a generous and loving godfather, but clearly wise in the ways of wine. It's an insufficiently appreciated truth that inexpensive wines generally do not improve with age. Most are crafted to be consumed within one to two years after bottling. There are exceptions, such as the Penfolds wine above.But if you seek a beverage that will result in a wine epiphany 18 years hence, it helps to spend - pardon the expression - like there's no tomorrow.
A budget of up to $200 is not unreasonable, frankly. My big reservation as a consultant here is that even expensive wines can taste ho-hum after 18 years. They're not like those infomercial knife sets. They don't come with lifetime guarantees. And the selection of great labels can be piddling to non-existent at many stores.
So, some general guidelines might be of help to Mr. Paliga.
Stick with great recent harvests from classic European regions, such as 2005 from the Rhone Valley, 2005 for red Bordeaux and 2004 for Barolos from Italy. That said, great producers often craft cellar-worthy wines even from difficult growing seasons; you simply have to know who they are.
Vintage Port, the highest designation for Portugal's sweet fortified wine, is another good bet. The 2003 vintage, examples of which are still on shelves, was superb. It should deliver rewards in 18 years and will likely evolve nicely for twice that long if the bottle is stored in a consistently cool, humid cellar.
And many expensive wines from California and Australia can go the distance, depending on the producer and the district. This past weekend I uncorked a 1992 Chateau Montelena The Montelena Estate Cabernet Sauvignon from my cellar. The iconic red, purchased in person at the Napa Valley winery when it was released, was gorgeous, especially with a T-bone steak and fine company in my garden. Yet it still possessed a tannic toughness, suggesting it could have blossomed further with five more years.
Some selections from current inventory in Ontario:
The Rhone: Domain du Vieux Telegraphe Châteauneuf-du-Pape 2006 ($72.95); E. Guigal Château d'Ampuis Côte-Rôtie 2005 ($149), and Domaine de la Solitude Cuvee Barberini Châteauneuf-du-Pape 2004 ($75).
Bordeaux: Château Leoville Barton ($195, just two bottles at the Huntsville store at press time, alas); Château Montrose 2005 ($197), and Château Figeac 2005 ($186).
Barolo: Bruno Giacosa Falletto Barolo 2005 ($199).
Port: Quinta do Noval Vintage Port 2003 ($94.20).
Wish I'd had a godfather like Mr. Paliga.

Full text:   Pace of expansion decelerates, suggesting impact of stimulus has peaked and China is in for a period of more moderate growth
China's fast-growing economy, which powered through the global recession thanks to a massive government stimulus package, is showing signs of slowing as effects of that intervention are wearing off.
By injecting a whopping $586-billion (U.S.) into the economy in late 2008 - much of it going to infrastructure projects around the country - Beijing defied gloomy estimates and posted impressive growth figures even as demand cooled overseas for China-produced goods. The impact of that stimulus appears to have peaked in the first three months of this year, when gross domestic product grew at a breakneck 11.9 per cent.
New data released Thursday showed the pace of expansion decelerating to 10.3 per cent in the second quarter, the weakest pace of growth since the third quarter of 2009. Many economists believe it's the start of a phase of more moderate growth in China.
"It was inevitable that ... we'd see the impact of [the stimulus] fade over time," said Brian Jackson, a Hong Kong-based strategist for Royal Bank of Canada. "We feel growth is going to slow further in the second half of the year. It's happening quicker than we thought."
The government has also tightened the supply of money in recent months in an effort to apply the brakes to a runaway real estate market that saw double-digit increases in the price of housing in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities. The government introduced new restrictions on mortgages for second homes and moved to curb the flow of loans into investment companies controlled by local governments.
"The liquidity in the system is much, much less than it was last year," said Rosealea Yao, research manager at Dragonomics, a Beijing-based consultancy firm. "We are seeing a clear slowdown in nearly all indicators."
That deceleration - combined with worries about the strength of overseas markets - has prompted calls for Beijing to either loosen those new restrictions on lending, or even consider a second stimulus package. In an editorial published Thursday, the official China Securities Journal warned that the economy could slow more sharply than expected in the second half of 2010.
"In the second half of the year, external demand will gradually weaken and the dividend from the trade surplus will fall. This requires an increase in overall social investment and a halt to tightening of both fiscal policy and monetary policy," the editorial read.
Some believe the real pace of China's growth may actually be substantially slower than the official rate. Beijing publishes growth figures on a year-over-year basis rather than sequential seasonally adjusted numbers that would be a more accurate measure of economic activity.
In a note to clients, Goldman Sachs economists estimated the quarter-over-quarter growth rate to be closer to 8 per cent, adding that "if anything, this 8 per cent growth still overstates the latest activity." Many economists were concerned that industrial output grew by a relatively modest 13.9 per cent in June, down from 16.5 per cent in May while marking the slowest pace of expansion in nearly a year. Export and import growth also fell in June compared with May. However, there was also some good news for the government to focus on, as inflation dipped to 2.9 per cent in June from 3.1 per cent in May.
Beijing signalled Thursday that it is comfortable with, and even welcomes, a more moderate pace of growth.
"Even if [second-quarter] growth slowed, it is still well within our comfort band. It is still a very high figure and is in line with average growth over the past decade," National Bureau of Statistics spokesman Sheng Laiyun told a press conference in Beijing.
The slackening growth could disappoint those in North America and Europe who have been hoping that China could drive a thus-far tepid global recovery and pull some still-struggling economies out of their slumps. "I don't think [China] is going to make a huge contribution to global growth," RBC's Mr. Jackson said.

Full text:   It gets messy for the kids, er, players and fans. Cases in point, the unloving couples who took over the Dodgers and the Padres
Legs crossed and arms spread, Joe Torre perfected the picture of calm in his 12 years in the dugout with the Yankees. In New York, Torre had only to deal with the ever-present threat of the late George Steinbrenner divorcing the manager from the team with a pink slip. In Los Angeles, it's the divorce of the owners that's hogging all the attention, and the drip-drip of related revelations about how their affairs - literally - have come to affect his ball team.
Down the highway in San Diego the Padres have also had their franchise rocked by the owners' divorce proceedings, with Padres fans having learned that owner John Moores favoured a Houston gynecologist with lavish gifts even as the club payroll was being slashed.
Through the lengthy divorce proceedings of Frank and Jamie McCourt - teenage sweethearts who made millions in real estate and who bought the Dodgers in 2004 - Dodgers fans learned about Jamie's affair with a club staffer, a bodyguard, and the couple's seven houses. On the baseball front, when the pair's 30-year marriage dissolved in 2008, the club's ownership was thrown into question.
Frank claims he owns the franchise; Jamie, fired as the club's chief executive officer for her dalliance with a team security officer, argues it's a joint asset and thus she would be owed about $400-million (all currency U.S.) in a settlement, if the Forbes Magazine valuation of $794-million is accurate.
Whatever the root of the split, the owners' marital woes have been an intrusive presence at Chavez Ravine, suggesting that when mommy and daddy break up, it is the kids - the multimillionaire baseball-playing kids - who suffer.
The Dodgers clubhouse has collectively memorized the appropriate robotic responses when the subject of their owners' marital discord is raised - "It's not going to help me or hurt me trying to hit a fastball or call a game," was Dodger catcher Russell Martin's par-for-the-course answer when approached recently - but that might change as the season stretches on.
The Dodgers, putatively the Yankees of the West Coast, are limping along with a payroll of $94.9-million, less than half the Yankees' major-league-leading $206-million, $50-million less than that of the National League-leading Chicago Cubs and about $23-million less than they themselves spent on salaries in 2008. The club stood by in the off-season, failing to make even token approaches to marquee talents such as Roy Halladay. So far, they're keeping pace in the NL West, but third-base coach and Torre confidante Larry Bowa allowed the test will come nearer the July 31 trade deadline.
"When you're playing, you want to believe you're going to get every possible chance to win, and maybe some [players] might think that with the divorce, it's not going to be possible," Bowa said before batting practice recently. "I don't think we can answer that question until we get to the trading deadline. If we don't do anything and the other teams in our division do, then the question is answered."
Marital acrimony is bit of a local theme for Southern California's NL clubs. In San Diego, the dust seems to have settled after the split of John and Becky Moores, who were married in 1963 after meeting in a high-school history class. While the McCourts are still arguing in court over who owns the Dodgers, the Moores settled out of court last year, a process hastened when John Moores sold his share of the Padres to a group headed by Jeff Moorad in a deal that will vest in stages over the next five years.
But there is little doubt about the on-field impact. This time last season, the Padres were in the midst of the baseball equivalent of a selloff of family assets, and the club dumped a series of contracts to arrive at where they are this season: a $42-million payroll that is the second lowest in the major leagues - and $31-million less than their payroll in 2008.
But family trauma has different effects and the Padres' players may collectively be young enough that their owners' divorce will be a vague memory by the time they reach their professional baseball maturity.
"For a lot of these guys, last year was their first year in the majors. They don't have a lot of ties to the other owner, so I don't think it affects much on the field, especially with a younger team like this," said Padres veteran pitcher and San Diego native Kevin Correia. "These guys are all under six years [of major-league service], so they're not pending free agents. They have one job and it's to go play."
Padres manager Bud Black feels his young players, perhaps advancing to the majors ahead of schedule by an ownership group needing to go cheap and young, have benefited. "We've got really good esprit de corps ," said Black, who also has the luxury of baseball's best bullpen. "These guys have come up through the system together and are going through the same things together."
The Padres' fan base is still taking a wait-and-see approach. Attendance at Petco Park, the downtown gem that the Mooreses were able to get built before things began to wobble, averages 23,737 a game, 20th in the majors and just 55.9 per cent of capacity, despite the team leading the NL West all season.
In Los Angeles, the fans keep coming out, but they're not sure what is next. "Who owns the team?" wondered Hector Castillo, a Dodger fan for 50 years, while attending a recent game with his wife of 43 years, Estelle.
These are confusing times in Dodgerland. Torre is in the last year of his contract. But all those years in New York have taught him how to handle his team's psyche.
"My job to make these players understand that we're good enough to win. I know from the outside, people get a different perspective," Torre said. "I know as a player, you'd sometimes think the building was caving in around you, but now from a manager's point of view, I know there's always a ray of sunshine and that's the one thing I've got to exploit."

Full text:   Two women spent decades lovingly renovating an 1875 home without detracting from its original character
58 HOGARTH AVE.
WHAT: A heritage two-storey Victorian-era home in Toronto's Riverdale neighbourhood. The red brick house has four bedrooms and three bathrooms on a double 78.77-by 105-foot lot.
ASKING PRICE: $1.8-million
TAXES: $8,891.26 (2010)
AGENT: Re/Max Hallmark
Realty Ltd. (Maria Jenkins)
When Gerald Whyte, president of the Riverdale Historical Society, heard that Hogarth House had come up for sale, he grabbed his camera, intent on making the most of a rare opportunity to see a unique Toronto home.
Given the chance to tour the home as soon as the sign went up on the lawn, Mr. Whyte is not disappointed. "This is part of the history of Riverdale," he says, clicking away at such vintage details as a tin ceiling in the kitchen and a brick fireplace in a sunken living room lined with built-in book shelves and windows overlooking the award-winning front garden.
"It's one of the oldest houses in the neighbourhood and one of only three houses of this style in all of Toronto," he continues, walking over original pine flooring to focus his lens on two floor-to-ceiling heritage windows that can swing open into the house and be secured in a recessed area in the ceiling above.
"The family who once owned it gave their name to the street, and were prominent members of society," says Mr. Whyte, hurrying to feast his eyes on the dormer windows on the upper floor.
"If I had the money I'd buy it, and then turn it over to the City of Toronto for preserving."
The house is well loved not just by Mr. Whyte, who last year put a heritage plaque on the property commemorating its historic significance, but by much of the neighbourhood.
Agent Maria Jenkins says, "I had a viewing recently, attended mostly by people in the community, and there was one man there who seemed to sum it up for everyone when he said, 'Every time I walk by this house I slow down.' It's that kind of property, very much loved by everyone who sees it."
The reasons are emotional, having much to do with people's feelings of nostalgia for the past. This is a house rooted in local history.
The original owner was Thomas Hogarth, principal of York Township School Section 10, Riverside, who built it in 1875.
An addition was introduced in 1913, resulting in two covered verandahs, on the front and side, in addition to large principal rooms that, despite the presence of cracks in the wall, feel luxurious as a result of a surfeit of space.
Hogarth House stayed in the same family for more than 85 years before being purchased in 1974 by the late Peggy Sampson and Juliette del Junco, who recently entered a seniors' home - which is why the property has now come up for sale.
Over nearly 40 years, both women restored the home without detracting from its original character. Avid gardeners, they created a front lawn so spectacular that Barbara Hall, former mayor of Toronto, singled it out with the Best Old Fashioned Perennial Garden Award, citing the flower bed as "one of the loveliest in the city."
Their ongoing renovations included introducing bathrooms to both the main and second floors of the house to make it more compatible with modern standards of living.
Other than this welcome addition of indoor plumbing (when the house was first built, the lavatories were outdoors), the house looks and feels like a pioneer property.
"It's in the farmhouse style," says Robert Schott, vice-president of the Riverdale Historical Society, which frequently includes Hogarth House on its walking tours. The next one is in October.
"I hope whoever buys it will save it. This is just such a beautiful example of turn-of-the-century living."

Prices in cottage country on rise in a tight market

Full text:   tbelford@globeandmail.com
As memories of the recession dim, city dwellers are again starting to dream of owning a cottage property - maybe on a lake; maybe near a ski hill. A word of advice: Better move quickly because prices are again on the rise in the most popular areas north of the GTA, and since almost nothing new was launched during the past couple of years, pickings are limited.
Also, the closer the cottage is to the GTA, the greater the demand and the faster prices will rise this year. Muskoka, for example, is just now recovering from the slump that started in 2008, but the ski-hill country further south is well into business as usual.
In the Georgian Triangle, the cottage area closest to the GTA and home to towns like Blue Mountain and Collingwood, overall MLS sales were up 40 per cent in the first five months of this year and the average price of a home or cottage sold through the system rose 12 per cent.
Granted, those sales reflect not just recreational properties but also homes snapped up by locals and a healthy chunk of pre-retirement and retirement buyers looking to spend their remaining years in the area. Andres Paara, president of the Georgian Triangle Real Estate Board, figures buyers divide neatly into thirds: A third of the 788 properties sold in the first five months of 2010 went to those looking for recreational properties, a third to locals, and a third to people looking for a retirement haven.
But he also suggests that if you look at specific areas within the Georgian Triangle where cottages are most prevalent, you might get a better picture of what buyers face. For example while in Collingwood, where the market is mainly local buyers, prices rose only 0.4 per cent; in Blue Mountain the up-tick was 10.4 per cent; in the Grey Highlands it was 16 per cent and in places like Stainer and Creemore it was 17.2 per cent.
And while the average price at the end of May was $312,529, recreational properties in the Triangle can run from $150,000 to $1.5-million.
"I think you may see some slowing this summer as interest rates rise and the HST on new homes kicks in," Mr. Paara says. "But working against that is a shortage of supply. There just has not been much spec building here for the past two years because of the recession."
Muskoka, by comparison, is still in the process of recovering from its peak year of 2007, says Don Evans, a sales representative with Royal LePage Lakes of Muskoka Realty Inc. in Port Carling.
"Prices dropped about 15 per cent from the 2007 record year once the recession started," he says. "We are not back to those levels yet but this year we are definitely seeing a lot more activity."
The Muskoka market, he adds, is considerably smaller than that of the Georgian Triangle. The average year might see 200 to 240 cottage properties change hands and the bulk of those will be on the area's big three lakes: Muskoka, Joseph and Rosseau. If you are looking for waterfront property on any of them you will pay at least $1-million and likely as much as $1.5-million, he says.
"On the other hand, if you want a small place inland you can find properties starting at around $115,000," he says.
Of course, few buyers really want that place in the woods, says a recent Royal LePage survey. Every year Royal LePage hires Angus Reid to do a national poll of recreational property buyers' preferences and concerns. It found that 45 per cent of Ontario recreational property buyers want a detached cottage right on the water. Only 5 per cent want an inland cottage surrounded by a forest. While 24 per cent said they would settle for a condo, only 9 per cent preferred a timeshare property.
The real-estate agents also note something that separates today's buyers from those in boom years: Most of them are paying cash on closing.
"I think in many cases what they are doing is refinancing their principal residence or cashing in investments," says Mr. Evans. "For example I just sold a property on Lake Joseph for $1.5-million to a young professional couple with two kids from Toronto. It was an all-cash deal."

CHINA'S LATEST EXPORT: HOME BUYERS

Author: Ladurantaye, Steve

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/chinas-latest-export-home-buyers/docview/609042380/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "The fact is, China needs to be investing more of its capital abroad," said Patrick Chovanec, a business professor at Beijing's Tsinghua University. "The fact that Chinese citizens have limited ability to invest abroad, even as they pile up earnings from exports, is one of the factors fuelling a real estate bubble within China."

Full text:   Next month, 30 Chinese investors will travel to Canada in hopes of finding some well-priced real estate. They're expected to drop half a million dollars each, Steve Ladurantaye reports
Half a world away, a handful of Chinese citizens are feverishly planning a Canadian real-estate shopping excursion.
A farmer, an engineer, a furniture maker and a caterer are among the 30 hopeful investors who have paid $5,500 each to take a real estate tour of Toronto and Vancouver in August.
This isn't about tourism: Each of them expect to drop at least a half-million dollars on downtown condos during their 10-day visit.
While Chinese investors in Canada are nothing new, this delegation is thought by those in the industry to be one of the largest to travel in one group. The trip was put together by Ricky Zhang of TransAsia Investment Partners, a Chinese company that was created to help residents buy properties abroad, particularly in Canada.
He said it was difficult for investment groups to travel together before last December, because Canada and China didn't have a deal that allowed large Chinese tours to Canada. But with a travel agreement now in place, he said interest has increased and Chinese investors are looking to spend heavily while abroad.
"With the rising risk of the bubble bursting in the Chinese real estate market, there is a demand for overseas real estate for diversification, safety and relatively high rental yield," he said.
"The purpose for this trip is to find good deals for immigrants and investors. We do not intend to bring speculators to Canada and, during the promotion events, we always highlight on the market stability as opposed to the great volatility in China."
To ensure investors are serious, he has deliberately set the price tag high.
"They stay in four-star hotels, eat $30 meals," Mr. Zhang said. "I am not sure if this is a really high standard in Canada, but in China it is only affordable by the upper class."
The Chinese government has discouraged its citizens from investing in local real estate, fearing that a surge of speculative buying could inflate a real estate bubble that would have dire consequences if the economy slowed.
In a sign the tighter lending standards are working, Chinese house prices fell by 16 per cent in June.
The restrictions are causing those with excess capital - a large swath of the rapidly growing middle class - to look overseas for safe havens for their capital. This is especially true as China's export base continues to grow and foreign capital pours into the country.
"The fact is, China needs to be investing more of its capital abroad," said Patrick Chovanec, a business professor at Beijing's Tsinghua University. "The fact that Chinese citizens have limited ability to invest abroad, even as they pile up earnings from exports, is one of the factors fuelling a real estate bubble within China."
Canadian real estate is seen as good value in China, even though 2009's 5.2-per-cent year-over-year gain stoked fears of a bubble. But over the same period, prices in Hong Kong gained 27.6 per cent while those in mainland China gained 25.1 per cent.
Prices are expected to fall, however, as a flood of new listings and a slowdown in sales helps to cool what was a hot market. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said yesterday that sales fell 30 per cent in May compared with a year ago, while the Toronto Real Estate Board reported a drop of 20 per cent.
Support from foreign buyers could help to prop up the higher end of the market, agents suggest, because they tend to prefer properties that Canadians consider high end.
The group will visit two condo developers while in Canada - Tridel Corp., and Concord Pacific. Both have catered to foreign buyers, with several language options available on their websites, and multilingual agents to answer queries.
"You often hear they are attracted by the schools in Canada," said Jim Ritchie, senior vice-president of sales and marketing at Tridel. "The other reason tends to be that they want a place to stay when they are here, even if it's not very often."
TransAsia Investment Partners plays up Canada's education system in its promotional materials, and its representatives talked up the country's universities during its information seminars show through the Yangtze River-Delta.
"Many of the visitors are upcoming immigrants or someone who is considering immigration," Mr. Zhang said. "Therefore, most of them plan to live there or send their kids to Canada for education. All the properties we will visit are near great schools and universities. There is still a significant portion of investors looking for safety and the rental income, but this group is smaller."
Barbara Lawlor, president of Baker Real Estate in Toronto, said about 10 per cent of her sales involve foreign buyers. She tends to work with international agents, rather than directly with the foreigners, as most tend to shop from their own countries and make the purchase sight unseen.
"Having large groups come through is an interesting development," she said. "Usually we deal with a buyer's agent, but the investor portion of our market is constantly evolving as families emigrate and look for places to live."

Altus sees expansion through recession

Author: Ladurantaye, Steve

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/altus-sees-expansion-through-recession/docview/607155713/se-2?accountid=14656

Full text:   Toronto-based company able to reach markets that were unlikely a few years ago, thanks to the effects of the recession on the American commercial real estate market
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Prior to the recession, Gary Yeoman thought that cracking the professional real estate services sector in the United States was the unlikeliest of ambitions.
The business - which includes services such as property tax planning, cost consulting and appraisals - is intensely local and it is difficult for a new player to gain a foothold. Takeovers were out of the question, since established businesses commanded too high a price for the chief executive officer of Altus Group Income Fund to consider.
But the recession changed all of that. The commercial real estate market has been hammered in the United States, and the collateral damage spread from landlords and banks to the professional services companies that served the sector.
Markets that were once out of reach are suddenly prime expansion sites for the Toronto-based Altus, which has steadily increased in size over the last five years by acquiring its smaller rivals. When Mr. Yeoman phones, other companies are much happier to take the call than they may have been two years ago.
In the last month Altus has bought Brazos Tax Group and PricewaterhouseCoopers' U.S.-based real estate appraisal management group. The income trust plans to use the acquisitions to start consolidating the professional services industry in the United States, which right now is dominated by brokerages and smaller local players.
"There's now a certain amount of humbleness in the United States," he said. "They're extremely capable and they have great businesses, but there has been a realization that no one is infallible so there's more opportunity today for us to become an aggregator."
There's an advantage to be enjoyed by a company that ties together a national network of offices. By its nature, the tax and appraisal business generates a lot of data. With enough offices, that local data can be repackaged and sold to companies hungry for market metrics.
"The bottom line is the United States market could be 15 times larger than Canada for us," he said. "The impact on revenue will be significant. It will be absolutely dominant. This absolutely, in my opinion, has the opportunity to have a huge impact on Altus and to be strategically successful."
Mr. Yeoman knows about consolidation. After leaving Magna International, where he handled the auto part giant's real estate portfolio, he helped create Altus in 2005 by merging three Canadian companies (including his own property tax consultancy) under the Altus banner.
The company is now in 60 cities in 15 countries, and has taken over more than a dozen local professional services companies in the last five years. Altus typically waits until a rival expands to about 100 employees, and then makes its overture. It has about 1,600 employees.
"These are companies that get in the range of $1-million to $5-million in EBITDA and that's about as big as they can grow," he said. "To reach the next step, they need significant investments in technology and infrastructure."
As an income trust, the company was limited in how it could expand internationally because there are limitations on foreign ownership. So a deal that a corporation could make with stock instead of cash would be problematic, as would compensating management with anything other than cash.
With the tax benefits of income trusts vanishing at the end of the year, Altus proactively decided to convert to a standard corporation. It will mark a new phase in the company's growth, Mr. Yeoman said.
"Being an income trust was basically going to limit us into being a Canadian company so the change was in many ways inevitable," he said, although he bristled at the notion of having to change structures to appease changing government rules.
"It's never a favour when [the government] gives you the privilege of paying $1-million in legal and accounting fees to convert. But ultimately it's probably something we would have had to change corporate structure anyway to meet our needs."
The analysts who follow the company have been generally upbeat about the recent moves, particularly its decision to maintain its distribution in the form of a dividend once it converts to a corporation.
"We anticipated a 20-30 per cent distribution cut given Altus's 81 per cent trailing payout ratio and its desire to continue to grow through acquisitions," wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst Yuri Lynk. "The board's decision to maintain the current distribution implies it sees an improvement in underlying business fundamentals."
***
Taking advantage of a growth opportunity
The company
Altus Group Income Fund provides real estate consulting and professional advisory services. It also sells data associated with its business lines that provide insight into things such as appraisals, cost consulting and land surveying
The strategy
Convert from income trust to corporation, make foreign acquisitions to boost market share and expand data services, particularly in the United States and Asia-Pacific.
The reasoning
"We anticipate significant growth in Asia-Pacific as well as the United States. Countries like China, India and Egypt are absolutely underserved. But it's not easy because you can't just come in and be an expert - you have to have local knowledge. You need to do an acquisition to acquire a history of experience and performance. Then once you get in, you can think about adding to the services you offer," says chief executive officer Gary Yeoman.
The reception
Five analysts cover the income fund, with four "buy" ratings and one "hold." Their price target is $15.15, 17 per cent above Friday's close.
"The trust is well positioned to benefit from a number of long-term trends, including the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards in Canada which will require real estate firms to more frequently value their portfolios, and the potential to provide new, value-added data and information services based on Altus' unparalleled market data," said Alex Avery, an analyst at CIBC.

Full text:   The forest industry staggered when the U.S. market collapsed. Now, David Ebner reports, Canadian lumber producers are looking overseas
Pine trunks rumble down conveyors and sawdust clouds the air. The noise inside the sawmill nearly deafens, but in this remote town of 3,500 people, some 700 kilometres north of Vancouver, there are few sounds as welcome as the buzz and clatter of a mill back at work.
People in Mackenzie have worked in sawmills since the town was carved out of the wilderness back in 1966. For decades, most of the lumber they produced headed straight to the United States - until the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007 and demand collapsed. One after the other, the local mills closed. Mackenzie itself appeared to be on a conveyor belt to extinction.
But salvation has emerged from a faraway source. As a result of growing demand from across the Pacific, Canfor Corp. reopened its Mackenzie mill last year, part of a massive bet by British Columbia's forestry industry on the potential of the Chinese market.
The province's foresters are gambling that new demand generated by China's rapidly expanding economy can wrench towns like Mackenzie out of the worst slump in their history. "The volume China could consume is far beyond our capacity to supply," says Pat Bell, B.C.'s forests minister. "It would be enormous."
Annual exports of B.C. timber to mainland China tripled over the past two years, reaching more than $300-million in 2009 on a volume of 2.5 million cubic metres. In the first four months of this year, exports hit $132-million - 60 per cent higher than a year earlier and more than was sold during all of 2007.
Mr. Bell predicts that China could soon be buying 10 million cubic metres of B.C. lumber a year.
A breakthrough of that size in China would radically reduce the province's dependence on the U.S. market and give the forest industry a second cornerstone for future growth.
Success, though, is far from assured. To win in China, Canada's foresters must convince a nation of 1.3 billion people to begin using wood, rather than concrete and steel.
Canadians must try to accomplish that feat as concerns grow over China's housing bubble. After years of rising prices and speculative building, the supply of apartments in many eastern Chinese cities appears to vastly exceed demand. According to a recent report from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, vacancy rates of more than 30 per cent are common.
As the Chinese government tries to deflate its real estate bubble, the pace of building is slowing. GaveKal Dragonomics, a Beijing research firm, predicts large declines in construction through the rest of this year. For Canadian wood producers, it's a cruel twist: Having been hit hard by the collapse of the U.S. housing bubble, they now face a similar problem in their new market.
But Canada's foresters are forging ahead. They know that the long-term potential of China is enormous. For Canadian companies, China is not a quick profit grab. It is an attempt to ensure the viability of the industry - and places like Mackenzie - for a generation.
A carpenter school
Don Kayne, Canfor's vice-president of wood sales and marketing, has been seeding the Chinese market for nearly a decade. On his first visit to the country in 2001, B.C.'s wood exports to China were worth just 0.4 per cent of the province's sales to the U.S., and China's potential was next to invisible. The country had burned through its own forests to fuel steel factories during Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward in the 1960s. A generation had grown up with no experience of wooden housing.
Mr. Kayne arrived in a China where carpenters were unknown, and where wood was viewed as a flimsy, flammable material fit only for peasants.
His most immediate problem was $70,000 of unsold lumber sitting in a warehouse in Beijing and a local agent who couldn't give it away. Mr. Kayne's bosses were growing skeptical. "I was getting heat, 'We can't keep going like this.'"
Then, through a mutual acquaintance, he met Mayco Lou, a Taiwan-born, North American-educated businessman who had started a small lumber importing business in Shanghai. "I told Mayco the situation and said, 'If you can sell this, I'll give you a shot at being our agent,' " Mr. Kayne says. "So he went away and a week later it was sold, gone."
Mr. Lou hustled, working with his contacts in the region and a young sales team. He moved the lumber to Shanghai from Beijing and dispatched his hungry work force on bicycles, motorbikes, buses and trains to peddle the product wherever they could.
Buoyed by the sale, Canfor went to work. It established "Canfor College" in Shanghai, which trained 250 young people from rural cities to be carpenters. Canfor soon turned over the effort to Canada Wood, a federal-provincial marketing body, which opened an office in Shanghai in 2002 and continues to train local carpenters. Canada Wood worked closely with B.C.'s Forest Innovation Investment Ltd., a provincially owned corporation that aims to develop new uses for B.C. lumber.
In 2005, Canfor bought Mr. Lou's business. "It showed people in the country we were serious," Mr. Kayne says.
To demonstrate his own commitment to China, Mr. Kayne has visited the country about 25 times and is working to improve his Mandarin - vital steps in a country where building personal relationships is crucial. He says foreigners must demonstrate to Chinese locals that they are in the country for the long haul, not just to extract a fast buck.
Proving that level of dedication can require strong nerves. In June, 2009, Mr. Kayne and several other Canadian forestry executives climbed on a bus to the rural counties that had been at the epicentre of the devastating Sichuan earthquake of 2008. In a joint humanitarian and marketing effort, the Canadian government and B.C. foresters had worked together to build wooden homes and schools, designed to resist earthquakes better than the concrete structures common in China.
"You're up on the mountains going through, there's no guardrail, it's just a straight drop off," Mr. Kayne says. "This guy came sailing around, a bus going the other way, there's no room, I'll never forget it. He was right there" - Mr. Kayne motions with his hands - "and I don't know to this day how he missed us. I thought - we all did - we were done."
The experience didn't dissuade Mr. Kayne. He notes that last year the value of B.C.'s wood sales to China surpassed 20 per cent of the province's sales to the U.S.
Even if the country's property bubble bursts, he believes the market is so large, and Canfor and Canadian efforts so relatively small at the moment, that there will be plenty of room for growth. "China's going to be good. I can't see how it can't be. I just can't."
Targeting housing
While China may eventually live up to Mr. Kayne's hopes, even optimists acknowledge that right now the hype obscures the extended slog ahead. "The story in China's being oversold," says Russ Taylor, president of consultants Wood Markets International in Vancouver. "It [sounds like] a great story: All you hear is China is short of lumber and B.C. is the solution."
In fact, China's demand for wood of all kinds has been flat over the past few years. Much of its appetite is for raw logs that go into the country's factories to produce other goods. Russia is a fierce competitor for those sales, as are China's own wood producers, who are expanding their plantations.
Canada's forest industry believes its future lies in selling more valuable lumber for housing. The industry's initial idea, a decade ago, was to promote the use of lumber for building single family homes, but the foray sputtered when it met the financial realities of Chinese society, where only the rich live in such houses.
Since then, Canada Wood and Forest Innovation have ceaselessly worked China's bureaucracy, opening up new niches, such as using wood in trusses to fix the flat, leaking roofs of old concrete apartment buildings. Meanwhile, the industry has relentlessly promoted wood's energy efficiency and the ability of wooden structures to withstand earthquakes. "We're still teaching the Chinese to hammer and saw," Mr. Taylor says. "But if one of these ideas takes off, five or 10 years from now, we might never look back."
The great new hope is that China may begin using wood to construct apartments. Last year, Canada Wood and Forest Innovation won approval for a new wood-building code in Shanghai for six-storey apartment buildings. This year, three of the biggest B.C. forest producers - West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd., Canfor and Tolko Industries Ltd. - are coming together with smaller suppliers to construct a demonstration building in Beijing. The consortium plans to showcase it to the top-tier of China's government, led by Qiu Baoxing, vice-minister of housing and urban-rural development.
The B.C. and Canadian governments are chipping in about $5-million for the demonstration project - an expenditure that elicited a few jeers from critics in B.C. who can't see why Canadian taxpayers should partly fund something that China can easily afford itself. To Mr. Bell, the B.C. forests minister, it's a small ante with an enormous potential payoff.
The minister, whose home base lies in Prince George, close to ravaged mill towns like Mackenzie, became an evangelist for the potential of the Chinese market after his first visit in 2008: "What struck me was how rapidly things were evolving and how entrepreneurial China was. I realized the U.S. was a ways off from recovery - and I knew we needed a new market."
Some people questioned Mr. Bell's enthusiastic projections for Chinese sales, but he has achieved results. He led a group of forest industry CEOs on a trade mission to China last November. Through a connection forged by a friendship between a Canada Wood staffer in Beijing and a person in Mr. Qiu's office, there was a short, but key, half-hour meeting with Mr. Qiu. At the behest of the senior housing minister, the Canadians were back in March for a green-building conference. At a dinner, Mr. Bell was surprised where he was seated. "I was directly beside Mr. Qiu. You'd be hard-pressed to get a federal minister with a Chinese minister at that level. It's all about the value of relationships."
Mr. Bell believes it's crucial for B.C.'s forest industry CEOs to sell themselves to China as a unified group, rather than as a loose cluster of individual firms. "The status quo had always been big companies would go and develop a market on their own," he says. "In China, it's collaborative. We're seen as a single face. It's what's helped us grow in China so quickly."
Small town hopes
The rapid growth in Chinese sales is sparking renewal in small mill towns, such as Quesnel, 300 kilometres south of Mackenzie. Canfor restarted a shuttered mill there in June, solely to supply Chinese customers. For Quesnel, the reopening means a much-needed 155 jobs.
In Mackenzie, where a second shift was added earlier this year, Canfor's mill employs 140 people. Several hundred more jobs are expected when two other Mackenzie mills reopen later this year.
Many forces came together to allow Canfor to revive its Mackenzie operation. Workers agreed to pay cuts of almost 30 per cent (although incentives will reward them if the mill does well). The town provided a generous dose of support, cutting property taxes by 25 per cent for three years. But underlying it all was the prospect of growing demand from China. "It's filled a huge void for us," says Lionel Chabot, general manager of the Mackenzie mill.
After coming close to death a couple of years ago, Mackenzie is in a slow convalescence.
"I saw a lot of friends leave, I saw a lot of friends struggle," says Amber Hancock, a computer consultant and president of the local chamber of commerce in 2008 and 2009.
"But I'm confident. We'll be stronger - not the same and not as big, but stronger. You really see it, everywhere, from Facebook to people talking in the mall."
************
A CAUTIONARY TALE
Years before they began their big push into China, B.C. foresters already had a vibrant second market in Asia. B.C. producers did a brisk trade with Japan, which had a long history of building with wood and a taste for expensive high-grade lumber.
From the late 1980s, when annual exports to Japan were $1-billion, B.C.'s sales to the Asian nation exploded, reaching a high of $2.5-billion in 1995, when exports to Japan were worth 60 per cent of what B.C. sent to the U.S.
Then the 1997-98 Asian crisis struck and Japanese sales plunged. Although there was some recovery, B.C.'s forestry industry turned its attention to the booming U.S. market, abandoning customers in Japan, which sent sales into a precipitous spiral.
Last year, sales of $532-million were off almost 80 per cent from the peak.

Nail by nail, Canada advances
China's appetite for imported wood is flat, but the country is buying more lumber, a higher-value product for sellers. The market has increased 40 per cent in the past four years to 10-million cubic metres in 2009. This year, Canada has taken over the No. 1 spot among suppliers

DOCUMENTARY
30 for 30
TSN, 7 p.m.
Tonight's entry in the sports-documentary series was directed by rapper/actor Ice Cube. The film chronicles the quantum shift that took place in the National Football League back in 1982 when the Oakland Raiders packed their bags and moved down the freeway to Los Angeles. The move coincided with the burgeoning hip-hop music scene in L.A. and galvanized the city's sizeable African-American and Hispanic communities. Suddenly, kids in the South Central area were wearing Raiders jackets. The program features Ice Cube interviewing several Raiders mainstays, including rebel owner Al Davis.

Breakfast Special
PBS, 8 p.m.
Breakfast is still the most important meal of the day in America. This offbeat documentary celebrates the U.S. tradition of the morning meal, which seems to vary from state to state.

COMEDY
Parks & Recreation
NBC, 9:30 p.m.
Like 30 Rock and The Office , rebroadcasts of this workplace sitcom seem to hold up a little better than, say, reruns of Two And a Half Men .

Full text:   B.C. family's Northland Properties expands hotel and restaurant business to Newcastle, England - birthplace of the famous ale
Across from the football grounds in Newcastle, England, Vancouver's Gaglardi family is making the first international foray for its hotels and restaurants business. The setting is an 11-storey building that was previously the headquarters of Newcastle Breweries, maker of the well-known Newcastle Brown Ale.
It's a long way from Smithers, a small town in remote northwestern British Columbia, where Bob Gaglardi in 1967 expanded his fledgling gravel business by opening a 35-room Sandman Inn on a dirt road.
Now, the billionaire Gaglardi family's privately held Northland Properties Ltd. employs 8,000 people and generates $600-million in annual revenue. The company is in its busiest expansion phase ever, one that is largely self-financed through internal cash flow, a cautious strategy borne out of near bankruptcy in the 1980s.
Looking over at St. James' Park - home to Newcastle United Football Club - the family's youngest son, Mitch Gaglardi, 30, is overseeing Northland's international move. The old office building is being refitted as a 170-room Sandman Signature Hotel and a Shark Club restaurant, Northland Properties' sports bar/grill brand, and is set to open next spring.
The aim is to bring what Mitch calls "Canadian hospitality" to the emotional heart of northeastern England, at a site deeply entrenched in the local community.
"Every time I talk about it, someone will say, 'My Dad used to work there,'" Mitch said. "It's got a real affiliation with the town. The location is pretty rock star, right across from the stadium, right downtown."
As with all international expansions, it is complicated by differences in culture, business practice and law. For the Gaglardis, the move has an added challenge: At home in Canada, Northland Properties is a do-it-yourself player. Backed by its own construction division, it designs, builds and operates its own properties. While most other hotel and restaurant developers contract out everything from interior design to permits and construction, the Gaglardis have always been builders.
"They truly do business on their own terms," said Bill Stone, a veteran hotel broker and executive vice-president of real estate firm CB Richard Ellis.
Still, the challenge of terra incognita remains, Mr. Stone said. "Every country is different, with different rules of engagement. It's about understanding about how business is done."
The task of building the same kind of foundation in England was handed to Mitch, who completed his MBA in London and dreamed of leading an international expansion, ever since he went to high school in Italy.
After scouting England, Mitch settled on the Newcastle location, a deal secured in March, 2009, at the depth of the financial crisis. He then began to build up the core operation, bringing over a trusted construction superintendent from Canada and his wife, who serves as an administrative assistant. From there, a crew of about 50 workers was assembled.
Though he's busy dealing with a different development process and building codes, Mitch is already looking at next moves. The immediate goal is more properties in England followed by continental Europe.
"We build our company one nail at a time, with a lot of forethought," said Mitch, who started in the family business at age 13 as a dishwasher, then toiled in construction and eventually rose to management.
It is this ethos, said Mr. Stone of CBRE, that sets the company apart, allowing it to build at a chosen pace "without a group of shareholders pushing them."
"It has the entrepreneurship of a private family and the long-term vision of a pension fund," Mr. Stone said.
The Gaglardi patriarch, Phil Gaglardi - a Pentecostal minister and grandfather of Mitch - was B.C.'s colourful highways minister for 16 years in the 1950s and '60s. His son, Bob Gaglardi, started Northland Properties in 1963 and quickly expanded. Venturing into commercial real estate, Bob proposed a 75-storey tower in Calgary, which to this day would be the city's tallest. But he hit the shoals of debt and fought off bankruptcy under court protection in the late 1980s.
Bob's eldest son, Tom, current president of Northland, was at the University of British Columbia at the time.
"I remember skipping out of UBC sitting in court on big days when the judge would make a big decision whether we were done or not. I was 19, 20, wondering if we had another three months," Tom said.
Tom reinvigorated Sandman, bringing in new restaurant brands Denny's and Moxie's - and Northland has since created more of its own, including Shark Club.
This year, Northland's collection of about 120 restaurants is growing with 22 new outlets. At the same time, nine new Sandmans are in the works, to expand the chain to 45 locations. Many of the new hotels are under the company's upscale Signature brand, such as the Newcastle development.
Still, most of the building remains on Northland's home turf of Western Canada. Of the nine new properties, just one is in Central Canada, where Tom envisions the company's next big push.
Northland chose to go overseas before going south to the United States, following Mitch's passion for travel. But the U.S. is a market that Tom, 42, definitely wants to crack, eventually.
For now, the Gaglardis - whose $1.31-billion fortune is the fourth-largest in B.C. and ranks 39th in Canada, according to Canadian Business magazine - are leaving it to Mitch to make the family recipe work outside the country.
While he has a financial cushion before he opens in the spring, Mitch is frank about the state of the British economy: "We're still in recession. It is very, very bad in England."
But not all bad, as potential opportunities are starting to cross his desk. "Now that they know us as a real entity, a real business, a lot of things are coming our way," he said.
***
A HEAD FOR HOCKEY
Tom Gaglardi loves hockey. In winter, he plays top-tier recreational hockey in the Vancouver region on the Sandman Blazers - the team placed second in the second of 17 divisions with a 14-10-1 record last season - and owns the Kamloops Blazers in the Western Hockey League, along with NHLers including Jarome Iginla.
National Hockey League ownership still beckons. For several years last decade, Gaglardi was embroiled publicly in a bitter lawsuit over the ownership of the Vancouver Canucks, which had been purchased by rivals, the Aquilini family. The case was lost and it's a battle Gaglardi declines to rehash. "Once I start commenting I'll never finish."
Given the family's wealth and love for the game, the Gaglardi name keeps getting floated as a potential NHL owner, most recently for the Dallas Stars in June.
He claims indifference about NHL ownership. "One day if an opportunity aligns with where I'm at, I'd consider it. I love the sport. I like the business. But a lot of the desire I had to own a hockey team was satisfied with the Blazers."
Beyond the ice, there are mountains. Northland Properties was a lender of about $25-million to Revelstoke Mountain Resort, a large new ski hill in B.C.'s interior that aimed become a $1-billion project over 15 years. Barely a year after it opened, Northland took it over during the financial crisis in early 2009. The facility's operations were a mess, Mr. Gaglardi said, but Northland has managed to turn a profit. About $200-million has been spent, and Mr. Gaglardi said he's surprised the ski operations hold their own financially beside the real estate play.
"It's a fun asset to own."
Less successful is the long-time push - outside of Northland - by Tom's father, Bob Gaglardi, and partners to build a mountain resort near Squamish, between Vancouver and Whistler. The application for an environmental assessment certificate was flatly rejected in June because of "insufficient information," the B.C. government said.

Full text:   Saskatchewan writer
I hear that Michael - we like to say Mike in Western Canada - Ignatieff plans to tour our region this summer. Since the Queen only ventured as far as Winnipeg (and for a mere six hours), Mr. Ignatieff's bus visit to rural sodbusters may be the highlight of our brief summer social season. Well, I must busy myself in preparation for his arrival:
1) Take down my tattered Rider Pride flag and replace it with a respectable set of matching JSYK tab-style living-room curtains.
2) Cash in my beer bottle collection and get a cap for my broken front tooth.
3) Affix some steps to the front entrance and replace the faded Please Use Side Door sign.
4) Arrange for comp tickets so Mike can catch Peter Frampton on what I'm calling his "Frampton's still alive" summer tour stop in Saskatoon.
5) Fix the loose fence boards and replace the Reform Party in '88 lawn sign with a Beware of Dog notice from Peavey Mart.
6) Burn a copy of my favourite Internet conspiracy DVD, Bush Knew , to slip into the Liberal Leader's hand.
7) Dig my "I love boxed wine" T-shirt out of the laundry pile, shine my scuffed white cowboy boots and get the dog groomed.
8) Register my unlicensed antique duck-hunting shotgun.
9) Play host to a town hall meeting on maternal health, where we break out the jellied salads, shun the local menfolk and ramp up the resentment.
10) Invite Mike to join my Bible-based investment club, What Would Jesus Short-Sell?
11) Sell off my motley collection of 1956 International trucks on Kijiji to make room for the decorative bathtub filled with purple petunias and the end-cut wishing well.
12) Set aside a pair of size 12 rubber boots for Mike. (I scored them from a deceased relative's estate so Mike can dodge the puddles from Saskatchewan's 60+ days of rainfall when he trundles through the sticky gumbo during farm visits.)
13) Dig through the deep-freeze for some pork chops (we're famous for culinary hospitality on the Prairies), open up a can of mushroom soup and plug in the Crock-Pot.
14) Let Mike know we have a triple lot, so there's plenty of room for his bus. (Remind me to tell his security people not to urinate on the rose bushes, since they're just starting to get established.)
15) Ask Mike to join me on my daily morning walk with Laddie the border collie as we roam the outskirts of town looking for discarded Great Western beer cans. (The lady at the Sarcan recycling depot will have some great on-the-ground policy suggestions for his team.)
16) Let Mike know that, given the fact that some of our more pious marriage commissioners are not keen on marrying Steve and Bill, he's welcome to step in and officiate beside the lake at the regional park.
17) Advise Mike to pack a first-aid kit or bring an in-bus physician. (Our last set of newly minted South African doctors just quit town in a hurry, so the emergency room is basically closed for the summer.)
18) Let Mike know that, since our volunteer fire department is a tight-knit bunch, they may not want to let him ride on their red truck or join them for a BBQ.
19) Reassure Mike that, should he choose to donate some of his massive backlist, our library just got a new roof, so he needn't worry about rain ruining an evening of book signing.
20) Offer to do a house swap with Mike's place in France. (I'm only too happy to let him stay in Wakaw for a month to get a real taste of rural Prairie life. We still need to tile around the new tub, though, so it's baths only for him and Mrs. Mike. John Diefenbaker actually slept in my house during his prime, so he may be able to pick up some electoral mojo.)

Full text:   A revolution and an earthquake haven't been able to flatten the creative spirit in this Mexico City neighbourhood
The Colonia Roma unfolded early in the past century as an aristocratic haunt of wide boulevards and stately homes built in the beaux arts style - until the Mexican revolution of 1910 halted development.
A less bourgeois set arrived shortly thereafter, which included many artists, writers and politically minded folk (Naked Lunch author William S. Burroughs and retired Cuban leader Fidel Castro among them), earning the neighbourhood a lasting reputation for well-cultured denizens. Then, in 1985, a devastating 8.1 magnitude earthquake rocked La Roma, flattening buildings and displacing residents for years.
La Roma gradually rebuilt. Many of the old families moved back, while a new wave of creative types followed.
Today, slightly more than a century after its founding, La Roma is coming full-circle, rediscovering its aristocratic roots. Socialites and the moneyed set are returning - bodyguards in tow - chic restaurants and lounges are opening, and speculators have ignited a real estate boom.
Much of the appeal owes to its central location, leafy streets, architectural gems and several expansive squares - including Plaza Rio de Janeiro, home to fountains, a replica statue of Michelangelo's David and soccer-playing youths.
The appeal is also thanks to an eclectic mix of lowbrow and highbrow establishments, easily visible when strolling Calle Colima. This street is book-ended by a funeral parlour and a smoke-belching hamburger cart, and is home to flower shops, a skateboard store, boutiques bursting with blue jeans and funky T-shirts, chi-chi restaurants and several public and private art galleries.
All the changes in La Roma invite comparisons to the adjacent Colonia Condesa, a fashionable and popular neighbourhood at risk of becoming overrun with cookie-cutter developments, Argentine grills and Starbucks.
Roma locals worry that their neighbourhood will move upmarket too quickly and become another La Condesa, which many artists abandoned because of rising rents. But antiques dealer Emmanuel Picault, owner of the shop Chic by Accident, is more sanguine about La Roma's future. "It's evolving," he said.
Re-Pack your bag
As the name suggests, La Valise draws inspiration from items stuffed into a suitcase. This
bazaar delivers a truly random assortment of goods, which includes classic books, Spanish-language vinyl records and pink boxing gloves.
Zacatecas 126; 52-55-5564-9013
No accident
French expatriate Emmanuel Picault has scoured markets and private collections across the capital - and beyond - for the past decade in search of rare finds inspired by Mexican designers. Current items on display at Chic by Accident include armchairs designed by famed architect Luis Barragan, an oversized papier-mâché skull and clay arboles de vida (trees of life), which depict the story of creation.
Alvaro Obregon 49; 52 55-5511-1312 www.chicbyaccident.com
Get smart
Guru, a design store and gallery, promises "lowbrow, surrealistic pop" and retro offerings - and it largely delivers, stocking everything from ceramic unicorns to notebooks adorned with lucha libre imagery to World Cup-inspired tarot cards.
Colima 143; 52-55-5533-7140
Mexican fashion sense
Dime - pronounced "dee-me" and meaning "tell me" - highlights the creation of young Mexican fashion designers, whose inspiration is frequently culled from national icons, landmarks and myths. Examples include oversized bags emblazoned with Our Lady of Guadalupe and T-shirts featuring images of temperamental soccer star Cuauhtemoc Blanco, who's considered a demigod in some areas.
Alvaro Obregon 185; 52-55-2454-6790; www.dimetienda.com
Tough name, cool clothing
The boutique Sicario draws its name from the Spanish word for the toughs employed by narcotics-trafficking cartels. Little about the merchandise - jeans, funky T-shirts, loads of sneakers and even vintage bicycles - suggests criminal links, however. Sicario also promotes DJs and provides information on shows.
Colima 124; 52-55-5511-0396; www.sicario.tv
Street fare
Perhaps the best street food in Mexico City, hamburguesas a la parrilla are served at a popular grill parked on Calle Colima. A double cheeseburger with a roasted pineapple ring costs about $2.50 and is best washed down with a bottle of Jarritos brand pop. The tamarind flavour is sublime.
Corner of Colima and Morelia
All in the family
The arrival of Sobrinos (nieces and nephews) marked La
Roma's upmarket ascent and it quickly became popular with the young and wealthy - known locally as "fresas" (slang for "snobs"). The most recent outlet in an empire of bistros named for family connections - including Primos (cousins) and Tios (uncles and aunts) - Sobrinos has won as much fame for catering to the glitterati as its
Spanish-inspired fare and decor.

Abstract: "At that time [the NHL] didn't fit Winnipeg," said [Mark Chipman], chairman of True North Sports and Entertainment which owns the six-year-old MTS Centre and the AHL's Manitoba Moose in the city. "It was a remarkable effort and I don't think it was anybody's fault, it just wasn't enough at the time."

THE MARKET
Economy B-

Overall Grade C+
Its economy weathered the recent recession as well as any in Canada. Characterized by slow and steady growth over the past 15 years. Winnipeg's population of about 750,000 is growing at about three times the rate it was when the Jets left town in 1996 and its unemployment rate is well below the Canadian average. Its median household income is in line with the Canadian average. It citizens have shown the ability to pay for top-flight entertainment, making the MTS Centre the third-busiest building in Canada.
Metro population: 741,000
Median household income: $58,128 (Canadian average $59,090)
Average household disposable income: $52,000 (Canadian average $56,000)
Average household net worth: $291,034 (Canadian average $351,282)
Percentage of population aged 25-39: 21 per cent (Canadian average 20 per cent)
Index for watching NHL on television: 104 (Canadian average 100)
CRITICAL FACTORS
Potential Ownership A
Arena and Location B+
Competition and Barriers to Entry A
The MTS Centre has a great downtown location, but with just more than 15,000 seats and 50 corporate boxes, it is small by NHL standards. There is competition of a smaller scale in the CFL's Winnipeg Blue Bombers and independent pro baseball's Goldeyes. Potential owners Mark Chipman and David Thomson combine a strong local presence with immense wealth.
OVERALL VIABILITY
B
Its smallish population base and corporate presence would make Winnipeg vulnerable to an economic downturn or slump in the Canadian dollar. And unlike the six existing Canadian clubs, it couldn't spend to the maximum on players. But the commitment of ownership, new building and resilient economy make this a viable option for the NHL.
************
When the Winnipeg Jets packed up and moved to Phoenix at the end of the 1996 NHL season, it felt like goodbye forever.
The cost of doing business in the NHL was skyrocketing and poor little Winnipeg simply couldn't keep up.
"At that time [the NHL] didn't fit Winnipeg," said Mark Chipman, chairman of True North Sports and Entertainment which owns the six-year-old MTS Centre and the AHL's Manitoba Moose in the city. "It was a remarkable effort and I don't think it was anybody's fault, it just wasn't enough at the time."
Back then Chipman was one of those local businessmen trying to find a way to save the Jets. When the effort failed, he brought an AHL franchise to Winnipeg. And several years later, he began the process of building a new downtown home for the Moose.
Toronto-based billionaire David Thomson, chairman of Thomson Reuters, became an equity partner in True North through his real estate company, Osmington, Inc. (The Thomson family holding company, Woodbridge, has a 40-per-cent interest in CTVglobemedia, whose properties include The Globe and Mail.)
Today the MTS Centre sits downtown at the corner of Portage Avenue and Donald Street, a shining success both as a hockey and entertainment facility. It books the third-highest number of shows in Canada, behind only the Air Canada Centre in Toronto and the Bell Centre in Montreal.
Winnipeggers have proven a willingness to pay top dollar for entertainment. And market research commissioned by True North indicates they would do the same for NHL hockey, giving the company the confidence to try repatriating the Coyotes recently, and to continue pursuing a franchise.
"We've tested it by using pricing that has existed in relative Canadian markets," said Chipman, speaking publicly about the research for the first time. "When we test those average ticket prices, and the suite prices, and the ... corporate sponsorship that you need to sell, it hasn't caused any concern or alarm with any or our existing sponsors and prospective ones."
Last May, Winnipeg hockey fans almost had their dream come true before the NHL arranged a last-minute deal with Glendale, Ariz., to keep the Coyotes in Phoenix at least one more season. But the NHL was prepared to direct the team to Winnipeg, sources say, had Glendale not agreed to pick up as much as $25-million (U.S.) in losses next season.
"There's never been any doubt about the passion of fans, people in Winnipeg," NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said. "So it's always been a good hockey market. Finally they have an arena that is up to NHL standards."
The MTS Centre, with 15,015 seats and just 50 luxury boxes, would be the smallest building in the NHL. But Chipman believes it is ideal for Winnipeg, even though it won't be able to match the revenue generation of the league's other buildings. He subscribes to the theory that it is better to have too few seats than too many.
"It's suitable for our market," Chipman said. "I think your building has to fit your market. We've had this discussion with the league. They are very familiar with the size of the facility and have not expressed any concerns about the size. And I think if I have learned one thing in this business over the past 15 years it's that if your supply outstrips your demand, it's a slippery slope. It's a very difficult business to be in."
The bigger question in Winnipeg is whether there is sufficient corporate muscle - and will - to buy the high-end tickets and luxury suites.
According to Statistics Canada, 128 companies have head offices in Winnipeg, slightly less than half Calgary's total. Research firm Environics Analytics reports there are 272 businesses generating more than $20-million in revenue and with more than 100 employees, slightly more than half of Edmonton's total.
"The size of the community is such that you can get a real good sense of what the corporate community's desire and appetite is for a team," Chipman said. "It's not something we have to guess at. I'm confident it's there."
With a smallish building and population of just 741,000, a Winnipeg franchise would likely have to compete at the mid-range of the NHL's player pay scale (about $50-million U.S.). In contrast, the existing six Canadian franchises in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver all spend close to the maximum, or slightly less than $60-million (U.S.) this coming season.
Further, there would be the inevitable difficulty of attracting players to Winnipeg, a problem that dogged the Jets in the 1990s and plagues Edmonton today.
All of which raises the question of whether the enthusiasm for a team would wane if the team is unable to win consistently, or even sporadically. When the Jets struggled and often missed the playoffs, attendance averaged less than 14,000 a game.
"I think the biggest problem you've got here in Winnipeg is that if you start to put out a product that is not performing to expectations, [fans] start to stay away," said Rob Warren, director of the Stu Clark Centre for Entrepreneurship at the University of Manitoba. "I don't think Winnipegers are that die-hard."
One thing that has changed since early 1990s is the local economy. Winnipeg's population is growing at roughly three times the rate it was in 1996, and its unemployment rate is down by more than 30 per cent.
"If there is an economy that managed to escape the latest recession, it's the Winnipeg economy," said Mario Lefebvre, director of the Centre for Municipal Studies at the Conference Board of Canada. "It has diversified nicely over the years. So I think we have a solid foundation of a whole sort of industries, including manufacturing. It's not a bad story."

Some saucy old gals just keep going. At 88, Betty White's never been hotter.
White's remarkable late-career roll continues with Hot in Cleveland (Monday, CTV at 8 p.m.). Last month's debut of the new comedy series on the U.S. cable outlet TV Land earned the channel its highest ratings ever - nearly five million viewers. The show boasts three other TV veterans in the cast, but everyone knows viewers tuned in to see dear but not-always-sweet Betty.
"It blows my mind," White said in a recent conference call. "I'm blessed with good health and I'm grateful for it, and my energy level is very high ... If I get four or five good hours of sleep a night, that's all I need."
The young stars of Gossip Girl and Glee could learn a thing or two from White. Several weeks back, she became the oldest person to ever host NBC's Saturday Night Live - earning the show its highest rating in two years - which came courtesy of a Facebook campaign supported by more than a half-million fans.
And in the past few years, everyone has come to appreciate White for different reasons. Some loved her appearance in a popular Super Bowl commercial in which she's brutally tackled by football players into the muddy turf (it was stunt double, of course). Others admire White's scene-stealing roles in the Sandra Bullock film The Proposal and the TV series 30 Rock . And still more have become fans of her frequent appearances on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon (where she gamely played "beer pong" with the host) or The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson .
"That's been the most fun of anything I've done," she said. "Craig is just incredible. The only thing is we can't ever dare make eye contact when we're working together, or we both crack up. I don't know why. We just tickle each other."
And White is the reason to watch Hot in Cleveland . The premise involves three fortysomething gal-pals from Los Angeles - novelist Melanie (Valerie Bertinelli), beautician Joy (Jane Leeves) and ex-soap star Victoria (Wendie Malick) - whose high-profile days in the Hollywood fast lane are behind them. The trio are on a flight bound for Paris that makes an unscheduled stop in Cleveland. When locals there fawn and fuss over them, they make the decision to stay and rent a house that comes with a crusty but very funny live-in caretaker named Elka, played by White. Let the games begin.
"Elka is not a nice person," White acknowledged. "When she sees the real-estate agent talking to the three girls, her opening line is, 'Why are you renting to prostitutes?' So that kind of set her character. She's not easy to live with."
Larry King, who announced his retirement this week, was lauded for his 25 years on TV, but that's just getting started: White has been doing this for six decades. Back in 1952, TV Guide profiled the ingenue star of the sitcom Life with Elizabeth , saying: "She is young, pretty without being a coldly chiselled beauty, and has the disposition of a storybook heroine. She is utterly unspoiled. Furthermore, she has talent."
In the sixties, White was a regular on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and other talk shows, and she appeared on nearly every game show on the dial (she met her late husband Allen Ludden while appearing on his game show, Password ).
To a certain generation of viewers, White is best known from her roles on two classic series: In the seventies TV staple The Mary Tyler Moore Show , she played the man-hungry Sue Ann Nivens; in the eighties, she was the dense but adorable Rose on The Golden Girls . She has won six Emmys for her comic portrayals.
And while she's usually sweet as pie, White is not above displaying her ribald side - as she demonstrated most shockingly in The Comedy Central Roast of William Shatner in 2006. To most viewers, White delivered the line of the night: "I once had sex with William Shatner. I remember he was on top of me, huffing and puffing, and I'm like, 'You'd better wrap it up, Bill. The Roast is going to start any minute!' "
But much like the recent SNL sketch where she played a scooter-driving senior who makes out with her own grandson, White can pull off those moments because she's honest and funny and still unspoiled. And at her current rate of career expansion, she could still meet the man of her dreams.
"My fantasy man has been forever and will continue to be Robert Redford," she said dreamily. "I have never met the man, but I just enjoy fantasizing about him completely."
Oh Betty, don't ever change.

BIG ON BUNGALOWS

Abstract: "Steve told us they like quiet architecture, design that isn't loud," [Iain Mant] recalls. "I didn't understand what they meant by that, but once the house was finished I saw that's the word that nails it perfectly: quiet."

Full text: The sloping hills of North Vancouver once projected the distinctive west coast fusion of modesty and flair, in elegantly scaled houses that hugged the site. Those hillside bungalows are getting dug up like turnips these days, their soil tilled to make way for faux-traditional behemoths. But a series of projects by McFarlane Green Biggar is showcasing the power of reno over demo.
With their studio in North Vancouver's Lower Lonsdale neighbourhood, McFarlane Green Biggar (MGB) is a firm that knows the region. Though they're reaching far beyond their own backyard (as co-architects of Bob Rennie's Wing Sang gallery, among other things), their local renovation work has been a key catalyst of their reputation.
Principal Steve McFarlane, lead designer for two of the firm's three acclaimed hillside bungalow renovations, walks the talk, driving around the North Shore in a handsomely aging 1987 Porsche 911 Carrera. It does all fit together within his philosophy, agrees McFarlane: "Why go new when there's all this great stuff around that just needs attention and updating?"
MGB approached the 1954 Glenview House with a view to retaining its essential midcentury character. The owners, Paul Hartley and Holly Purvis, grew up on the North Shore and wanted to stay there to raise their two young children there.
Even at the midpoint of a major architectural update, this 2,400-square-foot, two-storey house near Mosquito Creek remains quintessentially west-coast modern. The ground-floor family room is defined by a wall of glass doors reminiscent of the prototypical 1941 Binning House, and the structural posts and beams have been left exposed throughout the house.
The architects' primary gesture was to gut the central core of the house to create an open staircase. "It used to be like a little asylum," shudders Hartley, "because you'd walk down this horrible dark hallway and there would be 18 doors on either side." With some of the upper walls ripped out and a vertically expanded upper-floor window, daylight now falls on the entire corridor area.
Downstairs, the original shellacked beams were painted white, as a means of further lightening the space. Plans are in the works for the next stage in the renovation: transforming the carport into an outdoor courtyard. That way, the owners can enjoy a more congenial view from their ground-floor kitchen than a close-up of rear fenders.
For the 1959 Ventura Crescent home of Janine Love and Steve Plunkett, the architects had a perfect client: Love is a former room stager for IKEA. She knows the power of layout and presentation. The couple bought the house in the district's leafy Upper Delbrook neighbourhood in 2000 and began the renovation five years later. They loved the vintage charm - all that inlaid oak and cedar clapboard siding. But they couldn't abide all of the vintage values, such as the separation of work and play. "The family room was relegated to the basement," notes Love.
MGB expanded the house at the back, creating a new and spacious family room that acts as a nerve centre for the entire house. One wall is sheathed in bookshelves, another in cupboards and millwork for craft and hobby materials, a third is defined by a computer alcove, and the fourth wall presents a huge picture window towards the verdant backyard. Outside they updated the façade with fibre cement panels.
The changes brought the square footage up to 3,300 and also created a natural gathering place for everyday activities. "We saw this great potential of reaching out to the backyard and engaging the view," says Love. "It's really changed our lives: We're physically close to one another, yet separate in terms of our functions."
After the Sandringham Avenue renovation in Upper Lonsdale was completed two years ago, the project helped MGB snag Western Living magazine's "Designers of the Year" award. The clients, Iain Mant and Nancy South, had no such grandiose notions when they decided to buy an unassuming 1952 bungalow. They didn't need to enlarge it - just reconfigure it into a more appropriate space for their children, now 9 and 11 years old, to grow up in. The 2,800-square-foot house's layout and ambience had been skewed by several hodgepodge renovations from previous years, but a home inspection dubbed it solid, and it was well-sited on the lot.
"We liked that idea of renovating rather than destroying and then building new," Mant says. Environmental reasons informed their decision. But they also appreciated that choosing to reno rather than rebuild would allow them the right to retain the same footprint. For instance, part of the foundation was closer to the lot line than permitted under current regulations.
As per their wishes, the renovation is a shift to a contemporary home, rather than a restoration to a mid-century time warp. Every sightline in the house offers an impossibly elegant vista, from the proverbial ocean view to the shock of a sapphire-blue-tiled bathroom wall. In the living room at the rear, huge sliding doors open onto a panoramic western vista. Outside, the house projects a contemporary face with a streamlined cladding of zinc panels and cedar clapboard. "We like materials that develop character as they age, a patina over time," Mant notes.
The heart of the Sandringham Residence's transformation, though, is the central staircase, reconfigured from what used to be a windowless hallway leading to a rabbit-warren of bedrooms. The rabbit warren has been cleared in favour of open space between the office and corridor (with a deft sliding door for instant privacy when needed). The original staircase had a broom-closet-like entrance in the kitchen and a decidedly dark and spooky descent. The new staircase turns twice and opens up on three sides, illuminated by a generous overhead skylight.
"Steve told us they like quiet architecture, design that isn't loud," Mant recalls. "I didn't understand what they meant by that, but once the house was finished I saw that's the word that nails it perfectly: quiet."
"In our work, we're always looking for longevity," McFarlane says. "The quiet approach expands the horizon for resale, because it's not super-specific and its sense of reserve can act as a foil for the inhabitants and their lives and what they collect. It also makes for good neighbours."

Full text: A perennial candidate for mayor of Delta, B.C., tells the Tax Court of Canada he's only in politics for the money
Mike Reilly is either the most honest politician in the world or the most opportunistic.
Mr. Reilly is a Vancouver-area developer who has run unsuccessfully for local office three times in the suburb of Delta, B.C., most recently in 2008 when he finished third in the race for mayor. He's planning to run again this fall and in each campaign has vowed to be a "new voice" for the community and work on important issues like environmental protection.
But Mr. Reilly has now offered a candid explanation of his real reasons for wanting to get elected. In blunt testimony before the Tax Court of Canada, he said he was out to earn a good salary and promote his business.
"I didn't listen very much to the citizens," Mr. Reilly told the court in a case involving tax deductions for campaign costs that the Canada Revenue Agency disallowed. "I listened to the businesses. That was my - that was what I was intended to do."
Lawyers for the CRA seemed incredulous, according to court filings, and kept insisting that Mr. Reilly must have felt passionate about some issues. "You know, I don't recall being passionate about any issues other than seizing an opportunity to step in and develop a better profile for myself," Mr. Reilly replied. "No. It was strictly business for me."
He didn't stop there. Mr. Reilly said he would love to be mayor of Vancouver. "It's a great job. In fact, the salary is like $100,000 a year, so it's a well-paying job," he said. "You know, for the record, I was after the job of becoming mayor as another job being basically the same as what I do in the real-estate development. It would be a three-year contract. I would earn income during that time. That was my only interest. Not so much what you say about bringing the concerns of the citizens to the community."
During the Tax Court hearing, Mr. Reilly argued that politics was an extension of his business and that he should therefore be allowed to deduct campaign expenses, which he paid himself, from his income. The CRA argued that running for office is a personal decision, born out of a desire to make a difference, and that campaign expenses are not business-related.
Mr. Justice Wyman Webb sided with the CRA. While the judge based his decision on an accounting issue, he commented on Mr. Reilly's attitude toward politics. "It appears that [Mr. Reilly] was not passionate about any issue except increasing his own profile and earning the salary of mayor," the judge said in his decision, which included excerpts from Mr. Reilly's testimony. "He also did not listen to the citizens of Delta and did not appear to have much interest in their concerns. It will probably not be a surprise that he was not successful in his bid to become mayor."
In an interview, Mr. Reilly said the judge took the "easy way out," refusing to deal with the larger question of campaign expenses and being selective in considering his testimony. "There were three days worth of testimony and the judge only took what [he] felt was necessary to protect the tax department," he said. "I'm saying they've taken [the comments] out of context completely and it's for their own benefit."
Mr. Reilly plans to appeal, saying the issues in the case affect other politicians who finance their own campaigns. When asked about what he would do if elected, Mr. Reilly said he has lived in Delta for years and would act in the best interests of the community. "Yes, I'd like to be mayor. I would run it like a business," he said. "If I was mayor I would just quit all my real-estate stuff."
But he allowed that being mayor of Delta would help his business profile. "When you run for election in one community all of the councillors and mayors of the [neighbouring] communities know who you are," he said, referring to the nearby suburbs of Surrey and White Rock. "So what it does for me is it develops a shorter time frame in maybe, you know, getting to the front of the list as compared to the back of the list."
He has already mapped out a new political strategy, starting with a by-election this September for a vacant council seat. "What I would like to do is spend a year or two years on council and make sure that the people in the community know that I served them well," he said. "And then if they are quite satisfied, then hopefully they'll elect me as mayor."

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/two-provinces-sets-hst-rules/docview/577215476/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Ontario's harmonized tax rate will be 13 per cent after combining the 5-per-cent GST with the 8-per- cent PST, while B.C.'s HST rate will be 12 per cent with the 5-per-cent GST and its 7-per-cent PST.

Full text: Residents of British Columbia and Ontario can celebrate a new regional distinction on Canada Day - different rules for the new harmonized sales taxes taking effect in both provinces on July 1.
While both are adopting a single HST to replace the dual provincial sales tax (PST) and federal goods and services tax (GST), the new tax systems will result in some significant tax differences between the two jurisdictions.
Ontario residents, for example, will pay a new 13-per-cent tax rate on gasoline, home heating and electricity with the combined HST. They previously paid just 5 per cent GST and no PST.
In B.C., by comparison, the provincial government is "rebating" its portion of the HST on gasoline at the point of sale, which means the sales tax rate will remain 5 per cent. And the province will also provide a rebate for the provincial portion of tax on home electricity and heating costs, so their tax rate will be 5 per cent.
The new HST is being adopted by both provinces in an effort to streamline the tax system and eliminate the hidden taxes embedded in the price of consumer products, with both B.C. and Ontario arguing the end result should ultimately be lower consumer prices. Quebec and three Atlantic provinces have already introduced a harmonized tax.
Ontario's harmonized tax rate will be 13 per cent after combining the 5-per-cent GST with the 8-per- cent PST, while B.C.'s HST rate will be 12 per cent with the 5-per-cent GST and its 7-per-cent PST.
Both provinces have pledged various income tax cuts and rebates to try to ensure the HST does not boost the ultimate tax cost for consumers - indeed, the B.C. government has pledged residents "won't pay one penny more tax" because of the HST.
Critics have complained the tax burden will inevitably rise with a higher tax level now being applied to so many services that previously were exempt from the PST - including home renovations, taxi fares, real estate commissions, funeral services, hair cuts and dry cleaning.
Ontario says it will not raise the tax rate on children's clothes, diapers, newspapers, books, feminine hygiene products and prepared food and beverages under $4 because the provincial portion of the HST on those items will be rebated at the point of sale, keeping the tax rate at 5 per cent for those goods.
B.C. will begin charging the full 12 per cent HST on newspapers and magazines, but the provincial tax will not apply to books, so their tax rate will remain at 5 per cent. The western province also plans to drop the tax rate for disposable diapers from 12 per cent currently to 5 per cent with the HST.
While Ontario will continue to charge no provincial tax on prepared foods under $4 - but will continue to charge the full 13-per-cent HST on restaurant meals over $4 - B.C. will begin charging the full HST on all snack foods and restaurant meals, raising the tax rate to 12 per cent from 5 per cent previously.
Some long-standing tax differences will remain between the two provinces after the HST changeover. B.C. residents will continue to pay no sales tax on auto or home insurance, for example, while Ontario residents will continue to pay 8-per-cent provincial tax on home insurance, but no sales tax on auto insurance.

Abstract: Store location is crucial. Both retailers depend heavily on their stores to do their marketing, shying away from traditional advertising. Now, with eight U.S. Aritzia outlets - along with 39 in Canada - Mr. [Brian Hill] is betting he can double his $200-million-plus of total annual sales in the next five years by adding about 50 more U.S. outlets. He believes U.S. landlords will bring him on board in coveted spots as word spreads about Aritzia's performance.

Full text: RETAILING REPORTER
Brian Hill could not have picked a worse time to launch an ambitious U.S. retail expansion: Soon after he opened his first stores, Americans began closing their wallets.
It was late 2007, and the founder of Aritzia LP, a chain of hip, high-end women's fashion shops, had already made the same decision many other Canadian retailers have made, and most lived to regret. Almost out of room to grow in his home country, he took Aritzia into the crowded U.S. market.
But no sooner had he thrown open the doors on new stores in San Jose, Calif., and Bellevue, Wash., than the U.S. economy was tottering. Economists believe the recession officially began in December of that year. With unemployment on the rise and the outlook getting bleaker, few consumers were in a mood to snap up items like crystal-studded 7 For All Mankind jeans - at $340 a pair.
It could have been another Canadian retail disaster. Yet against the odds, Mr. Hill is making headway.
He's doing it with edgy offerings for a select 15- to 35-year-old customer who likes the retailer's slim-fitting styles. But he has taken the advice of pal and fellow Vancouverite Chip Wilson, founder of hot yoga-wear chain Lululemon Athletica: It's all about location.
And the silver lining of tough times is that it's easier to find prime U.S. retail space in the upscale shopping centres and street fronts Aritzia favours.
Store location is crucial. Both retailers depend heavily on their stores to do their marketing, shying away from traditional advertising. Now, with eight U.S. Aritzia outlets - along with 39 in Canada - Mr. Hill is betting he can double his $200-million-plus of total annual sales in the next five years by adding about 50 more U.S. outlets. He believes U.S. landlords will bring him on board in coveted spots as word spreads about Aritzia's performance.
"It was very difficult initially for us to find retail locations in the U.S. that were the same quality as our real estate in Canada," Mr. Hill, Aritzia's chief executive officer, said. "Now we're finding the availability. Because of the recession, there's not a lot of competition - there are not a lot of new retailers starting out. And landlords are excited about our performance in some of our centres."
Already, privately held Aritzia is outperforming its fashion peers in U.S. malls, Mr. Hill said. Its productivity runs at more than twice the March average of $285 (U.S.) in sales per square foot at U.S. women's wear mall chains, Mr. Hill said.
Still, it hasn't caught up to the stellar productivity of its Canadian outlets, where sales per square foot are almost twice its U.S. level - and more than three times the Canadian mall average in March of $385 (Canadian) per square foot for its segment.
"He's achieving a level of performance that others in the U.S. would envy," said Tony Grossi of retail real estate adviser Grossi North-Bound in New York. "Aritzia's performance is in line with some of the top retailers in the U.S."
Even so, Mr. Hill will be stretched to duplicate his Canadian performance in the U.S. because of brutal competition, Mr. Grossi said. The average productivity at U.S. women's fashion chains is roughly 25 per cent lower than at their counterparts in Canada, according to March data from the International Council of Shopping Centres.
Lululemon, with an impressive $1,400-plus of sales per square foot over all, also lags in its U.S. stores, analysts say. Nevertheless, it has become a sought-after U.S. retail tenant, one that Mr. Hill can emulate.
"Real estate people talk between each other," Lululemon's Mr. Wilson said. "They tell each other who's doing the best sales per square foot. When Brian goes to approach another landlord about another location, the due diligence has been done on him."
Mr. Hill also is learning from Lululemon's real estate mistakes. Mr. Wilson's company rushed to open 35 U.S. stores after going public in 2007, only to be forced to retreat. By 2009, it had taken a $4.4-million writedown to cover the cost of breaking and renegotiating leases. Now, with 74 U.S. outlets out of a total of 128, Lululemon is more picky.
Eventually, Mr. Hill may borrow another page from the Lululemon playbook and take Aritzia public. "It's something we might be considering in the mid-term."
For now, he has his own challenges. His two Chicago stores are underperforming the others, a fact he blames on the recession, which has pinched the U.S. Midwest hard. Mr. Grossi said residents in that region tend to prefer more conservative fashions and don't spend as much as consumers on the East and West coasts.
To build his U.S. business, Mr. Hill is bolstering his private label offerings, which he said are resonating with U.S. customers. In-house labels such as Wilfred make up 70 per cent of the retailer's overall sales; now he's raising them to as much as 80 per cent of U.S. offerings.
Private labels can generate gross margins 10 per cent higher than branded lines such as 7 and J Brand. The national brands, meanwhile, are a tougher sell because they're carried by a wide range of rivals.
More important for Mr. Hill, store labels give him more control over styles and deliveries. Adapting to local operating rules, however, has been a hurdle. In California, for example, Mr. Hill must grapple with an array of regulations that add to costs, including having to provide both a men's and women's washroom for the handicapped. "Over all, there's a lot more to know in the U.S. It's a big market to get your arms around."

CROSS-BORDER SHOPPING
Lululemon Athletica
The Vancouver-based yoga-wear chain expanded rapidly in the United States after it went public in 2007, now operating 74 of its 128 stores south of the border. The retailer generates $1,428 of sales per square foot, although analysts say they're not quite as high in the more crowded U.S. market.
Aldo Shoes
The Montreal-based shoe retailer is another of the few U.S.-expansion success stories in Canadian retail. Since opening its first U.S. store in 1993, Aldo has increased its American base to 383 stores and parlayed that achievement into international growth, with more than 1,400 stores in more than 50 countries today.
Le Château
Montreal-based Le Château has struggled since entering the U.S. market in 1985. After opening about 20 U.S. outlets, it retreated. This spring, it closed one of the four remaining U.S. stores it had left. Now it has decided to shut the last three when their leases expire over the next few years.
Danier Leather
In 2005, the Toronto-based leather chain closed three struggling U.S. stores after four years in the market.
Canadian Tire
In 1982, the company scooped up the ailing home and auto supply chain White Stores Inc., based in Wichita Falls, Tex., but failed to turn the brand around. By the time Canadian Tire sold off the assets in 1986, the company's U.S. experiment had racked up about $250-million in losses.
In 1991, Canadian Tire ventured south again, this time launching an auto parts and service chain called Auto Source Inc. in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky. But the company was again unable to compete in the cutthroat U.S. market, and Canadian Tire eventually mothballed the chain in 1994 after losing more than $60-million.
Mark's Work Wearhouse
The Calgary-based work and casual wear chain entered the U.S. market in 1981 and peaked at nine stores. But the U.S. operation ran into difficulties and filed for bankruptcy six years later.
Shoppers Drug Mart
Canada's largest pharmacy chain already had nearly 40 franchise stores in Florida when, in 1984, then-parent company Imasco Ltd. purchased the Virginia-based chain Peoples Drug Stores Inc., with nearly 800 company-owned stores spanning 14 states. But over the next two years, Shoppers got caught in a heated discount-drug war against its larger American competitors. The chain downsized and slashed costs but, by 1989, Imasco gave up on its U.S. venture and sold off the remaining outlets.
La Senza
In 2005, the lingerie retailer shut its five U.S. stores after about two years in the market, the victim of tight competition and disappointing results. Almost two years later, it was taken over by the U.S. parent of rival Victoria's Secret.

Bruce Davis's many hats create dilemma

Abstract: At issue are details in the proposed "harmonized zoning bylaw" that may limit the TDSB's ability to sell surplus land and redevelop undercapacity schools as "community hubs." These hubs would lease space to social service agencies, arts groups, dental or mental health clinics and other local organizations. Such deals could bring millions in new revenues into the board and create new uses for empty classrooms.

Full text: Smitherman campaign manager's role has come into sharper focus as council prepares to deal with a contentious zoning policy matter
When George Smitherman hired Bruce Davis in April to manage his bid to become mayor, many observers felt the former Liberal cabinet minister had bagged a game changer, someone who'd know how to light a spark under a lacklustre campaign.
A former lobbyist and publisher, Mr. Davis boasts excellent contacts at Queen's Park, a strong political track record (as one of the architects of Mel Lastman's 1997 victory), and proven entrepreneurial skills (he and his wife operate a popular bed and breakfast near Kingston).
But in the past month, his role has come into sharper focus as council prepares to deal with a contentious zoning policy matter that bears directly on the finances and operations of the Toronto District School Board, where Mr. Davis, a trustee, serves as a chair.
In that capacity, he appears to be urging council to approve new land use rules that benefit the board, even while running a mayoral campaign. "All of a sudden, [Mr. Davis] seems to be tugged in two different directions," observed Ryerson University political scientist Myer Siemiatycki, who characterized the situation as "a grey zone," but stressed there's no suggestion of personal impropriety.
Mr. Davis, however, said the TDSB had been grappling with the zoning policy conflict long before he became involved in Mr. Smitherman's campaign. "I have not called anyone [on council]. I have not been working this issue from a political angle."
At issue are details in the proposed "harmonized zoning bylaw" that may limit the TDSB's ability to sell surplus land and redevelop undercapacity schools as "community hubs." These hubs would lease space to social service agencies, arts groups, dental or mental health clinics and other local organizations. Such deals could bring millions in new revenues into the board and create new uses for empty classrooms. TDSB officials say they are planning to set up 16 community hub pilot projects next year.
The bylaw addresses a broad range of planning issues, including some that have raised concerns among industrial landowners. Council's planning and growth management committee was supposed to debate the whole package last week but the item was held back for procedural reasons.
Pressure to deal with the community hubs proposal has been mounting. Last month, People for Education released a report advocating the importance of such hubs, the latest in a series of expert studies calling for far greater integration between local schools and their communities.
The devil, as always, is in the details.
The city's proposed rules will compel schools to go through rezonings when establishing such hubs - a requirement board officials describe as cumbersome and expensive. "There is a strong belief that these are public assets already and the school board shouldn't be treated as another developer," said Shirley Hoy, CEO of the Toronto Lands Corporation, an agency established by the board to sell off 97 surplus parcels of TDSB property.
City officials, for their part, defend the proposed bylaw, insisting that boards must adhere to planning processes designed to allow residents to express their views about changes in the way local schools function. Nor has the TDSB defined what it means by "community hub."
"They talked about it as a conceptual idea," said Joe D'Abramo, director of zoning bylaws. "They never went beyond that."
Mr. Davis said negotiations between bureaucrats for the two institutions have failed to produce a compromise. The conflict has become increasingly political as council presses to approve the harmonized bylaw before the end of its term.
As TDSB chair, Mr. Davis and former mayor David Crombie have been spearheading efforts to sell unused TDSB real estate and establish these hubs for two years. But with council poised to vote on the changes before August, Mr. Davis has hired lobbyist and planner Alan Slobodsky, a onetime aide to Mr. Lastman, to twist arms and warn councillors that the TDSB is prepared to challenge the new rules at the Ontario Municipal Board.
Wearing his campaign manager's hat, Mr. Davis is also part of a campaign effort to entice councillors - the same crowd who will be voting on the harmonized bylaw - to support Mr. Smitherman's bid to become mayor. Several turned up at his splashy fundraiser/transit policy launch last month and were introduced by name.
The dual role has raised a few eyebrows in political circles.
"There's some unease," a non-aligned councillor said. "This is intergovernmental affairs with someone who's running a campaign."
But other council veterans note that shifting alliances and the tangled interests of local government come with the territory, especially at election time.
"That doesn't bother me," said Norm Kelly (Scarborough-Agincourt), who chairs the planning and growth management committee, which is vetting the bylaw. "[Mr. Davis is] the type of guy who's pretty darn good at multitasking."
Some councillors seem unwilling to give the board exemptions. "Just because you're the school board and presumably would do good things with the proceeds doesn't mean you get special planning rules," said John Filion (Willowdale). People For Education spokeswoman Annie Kidder agreed, noting that community engagement is key to creating community hubs. "Nobody has special dispensation to do what they want."
Noting Queen's Park's support for community use of schools, Mr. Davis hopes council will focus on developing a precise zoning definition of community hubs so the board can move forward with its plans. But he said that might require deferring the decisions until the next council takes office. "You don't have to do it right now. If you're worried that you'll make a mistake, then park it."
As it happens, Mr. Smitherman earlier this week released a suite of campaign promises that pledge funding for community programming in schools and other public buildings as well as integration of community-based health, recreation, and social services, both pledges that suggest the community hub concept is circulating inside the campaign team.
The fight between council and school board represents a new front in a lengthy war. Mr. Miller came to office promising to repair the links between the city and the TDSB, but those efforts foundered as the two battled over money issues such as school pool closures and the board's attempts to earn revenue from its parking lots during off-school hours.
Adam Vaughan (Trinity-Spadina) hopes the murky politics of the harmonized zoning bylaw creates an opening to revisit the question of how the city and the board might think more strategically about their considerable land holdings. "If Bruce Davis wants to have that debate, I'm glad he's running a mayoralty campaign."

Abstract: As an ambitious outsider who, if successful in Toronto, will be sought after elsewhere, Dr. [Rafi Hofstein] has the luxury of not needing to curry favour with local eminence grises. Mr. [Paul Chipperton], who's dealt with Dr. Hofstein twice, finds him direct and honest. "His mentality is global.

Full text: Toronto is North America's third-largest medical cluster, but as Joanna Pachner writes, it struggles to monetize its brain power. Enter the no-nonsense Rafi Hofstein
A colleague catches Rafi Hofstein on the way into his office and outlines a project snag. Dr. Hofstein, the chief executive officer of MaRS Innovation, a new entity charged with turning Toronto scientists' ideas into profits, is annoyed - both by the interruption and the colleague's insistence the problem will cause delays. "We have to sign today," Dr. Hofstein says tersely, already halfway into his office, "so make sure we sign on something that's agreeable to us." The door shuts.
Dr. Hofstein has no time for internal diplomacy. He's here to get things done the entrepreneurial way: shrewdly, creatively and as quickly as possible. He's been given five years to turn the vast scientific talent clustered around University Avenue into the seeds of a vibrant biotechnology industry. And he's doing it while answering to 14 research institutions and three levels of government. The job, says a close observer, requires an "arch-politician" - but one who invests in ego-stroking only when it's necessary.
His challenge is huge, but so is the opportunity. Ontario, and especially Toronto, is home to North America's third-largest medical cluster, exceeded only by San Diego and Boston. Starting with the discovery of insulin in 1922 and on through breakthroughs in genomics, stem cells and breast cancer, the city has emerged as a global leader in regenerative medicine, oncology and medical device technology.
The 2.5 square kilometres centred around the University of Toronto and the downtown hospitals, dubbed the Discovery District, may be the most concentrated area of medical research in the world, says Matt Buist, biotech manager for Toronto Economic Development, who branded the area in the mid-1990s as part of an effort to attract investment.
Luring that money has proven tough, however. Despite a billion dollars in annual funding, Toronto scientists have a poor track record of cashing in on their research. Meanwhile, the MaRS Centre - the sprawling, glass-sheathed building on College Street that houses and incubates startups - has acquired the image of being "little more than a high-end real-estate play," according to its own officials. "We needed a bigger and stronger organization to partner with these scientists," says David Shindler, executive director of BioDiscovery Toronto.
So, in October of 2008, MaRS Innovation was formed. Its goal, in essence, is to help nascent companies cross the so-called "valley of death": the yawning funding gap between the time scientists come up with a new therapy or technology and when they've amassed enough proof of its viability to attract private-sector money. And to run it, MI's board imported Dr. Hofstein, who had spent the previous decade at Hadassah Medical Organization in Jerusalem, where he devised a novel way to get the market to fund untested biotech ideas.
An elegant 60-year-old scientist-turned-financier an intense gaze and a penchant for arching his thick eyebrows for emphasis, he doesn't bother with false modesty. Seated in his institutional-grey office, he calls what he did in Israel "pioneering," "unprecedented" and "a total paradigm shift."
On this day in early June, exactly one year since he arrived in Toronto, Dr. Hofstein explains that there's no harder industry for startups than life sciences. It takes about 15 years and $3-billion to $4-billion to guide a new, potentially life-saving molecule through the dense layers of testing and regulatory red tape and on to consumers, he says. Just getting to the point where investors or industry partners might take the risk on the idea requires $5-million and three to four years, from lab models through animal trials to tests on humans. Only one in 10 survive that first phase.
"The valley of death in Canada is a very big one," says Paul Chipperton, CEO of Profound Medical Inc., a startup developing a treatment for prostate cancer based on research by two Sunnybrook scientists. "Life sciences has the biggest risk and the biggest reward if you're successful, but not many investors have the appetite for it." The financial meltdown only worsened a bad situation. "The last three years have been the most difficult in the 15 years I've been in the industry," says Mr. Chipperton.
Armed with $30-million in funding, MI is meant to bridge the valley. And for Dr. Hofstein, it's a chance to prove that his new paradigm can work on a larger scale.
CROSSING THE VALLEY OF DEATH
The Israeli doctor brings impressive credentials to the job. A PhD who did post-doctoral work at the Harvard Medical School, Dr. Hofstein has spent 30 years in the commercialization of medical innovation.
While in Israel, he tapped the country's aggressive incubation program. But to qualify for government money, research institutions needed to form companies. So Hadassah, Israel's leading research hospital, created some 40 tiny startups. It then selected the eight most promising prospects and put them under the umbrella of a holding corporation. In 2005, Dr. Hofstein took it public and raised $50-million, which went to fund the startups' clinical trials. A second company raised $100-million. "It was unprecedented," he says, his left eyebrow shooting up. "It was real out-of-the-box thinking in raising funds for the sector."
Dr. Hofstein was intrigued by the Toronto opportunity because the city has the elements needed to replicate his approach. MI has money, in the form of $15-million from Ottawa's Centres of Excellence for Commercialization of Research, and it also is uncommonly rich in "disclosures," findings researchers share with their institutions' commercialization offices. Toronto scientists produce more than 200. "At Hadassah, we had 20 to 30," says Dr. Hofstein. "Stanford [University] has between 40 and 60. Two hundred and above is huge."
The problem in Canada, traditionally, he says, is that the research part of R & D takes precedence. MI is all about the development. Every new disclosure gets reviewed by its staff. If it's deemed to have commercial potential, the agency patents the innovation and assigns a deal team to shepherd it along. Since Dr. Hofstein's arrival, the agency has homed in on 20 to 25 promising ideas.
MI is about to form its first company, in medical diagnostics, and three more are in development. Regenerative medicine, where Ontario is a world leader, particularly in stem cell research, is a natural focus, so the agency is grouping about a dozen research teams under one umbrella in hopes of raising a large pot of cash around them. This type of "bundling" is increasingly popular because it lowers the risks for investors: If one idea doesn't pan out, the company has others.
The goal, says Dr. Hofstein, isn't to sell or license the discoveries but build local companies: He wants to see three to six within five years, which will draw other researchers and investors into the area, forming a significant cluster.
As an ambitious outsider who, if successful in Toronto, will be sought after elsewhere, Dr. Hofstein has the luxury of not needing to curry favour with local eminence grises. Mr. Chipperton, who's dealt with Dr. Hofstein twice, finds him direct and honest. "His mentality is global. The industry doesn't have time to sit around patting each other on the back, saying 'This is the greatest thing in Ontario,' or 'This is the greatest thing in Canada.' He asks, 'Is this something that will fly or die on a world stage?'"
More significant, those who make it across the valley of death are hardly home free. There are two others to cross. Canada's venture capital community has had several terrible years: funding activity is down nearly by half since 2007 and at its lowest levels since the mid-1990s. And nowhere is the problem deeper than in MI's backyard: life sciences. "Most people now describe two chasms," acknowledges Dr. Hofstein. "We need to know there's someone in the financial sector willing to invest in the companies we nurture." Otherwise, MaRS Innovation is building a bridge to nowhere.
MI is an experiment with a five-year time frame; if the hypothesis isn't born out by results, the federal funding may cease.
Like any entrepreneur, Dr. Hofstein has unshakeable conviction in his venture. What MI is doing isn't just the right approach, he says. "It's the ideal approach. If we were to be successful, everyone else will duplicate it. Without a doubt."

Home-grown innovations
Toronto's Discovery District is an incubator for game-changing medical advances:
Dr. Andras Nagy,
Lead researcher;
Samuel Lunenfeld Research
Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital
Breakthrough
Converting adult skin cells into pluripotent embryonic stem cells
Applications
The regenerative capacity of embryonic stem cells, the basic building block of every type of cell in the body, is a crucial component of research into incurable diseases like Parkinson's. But the furor surrounding harvesting stem cells from aborted fetuses has limited their use. Dr. Nagy's discovery allows scientists to sidestep that controversy by harmlessly manufacturing stem cells using adult skin.
Dr. Tony Pawson,
Lead researcher;
Samuel Lunenfeld Research
Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital
Breakthrough
Monitoring human cellular communication
Applications
Cells grow by receiving signals communicated from outside to inside the cell. Diseases can occur when those communications go awry - for example, cancer is caused by a misinterpreted signal leading to uncontrolled growth. Dr. Pawson's work can be used to create cancer drugs that block those signals.
Dr. Aled Edwards,
Lead researcher;
The University of Toronto
Breakthrough
Discovering the shape of human protein structures
Applications
Different diseases are made of differently shaped proteins. Drugs for arthritis, for example, work by blocking disease-related proteins of a certain shape. But they also block healthy proteins that look almost identical. By determining the precise shape of different proteins, Dr. Edwards hopes to make drug treatments more effective.
Dr. John Dick,
Lead researcher;
University Health Network,
The University of Toronto
Breakthrough
Turning normal blood cells into leukemia stem cells
Applications
Cancer is difficult to study in the human body, because it is usually only witnessed in mid to late stages. By converting human blood cells to beginning-stage leukemia cells in a lab then injecting them into specially designed mice, researchers can watch how the disease develops from beginning to end, potentially leading to a cure.
Dr. Steve Scherer,
Lead researcher;
The Hospital for Sick Children
Breakthrough
Discovered the genetic risk factors for autism
Applications
Leading a team of 120 researchers in 11 different countries, Dr. Scherer discovered that people with autism have long stretches of missing or duplicated DNA, and that those stretches are different for each person. The discovery makes it possible to diagnose 10 per cent of those afflicted at birth, leading to earlier treatments.

Co-op agent: Nutan Brown, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
After an intense search of nearly two dozen homes in Bloor West Village, Swansea, Old Mill and Baby Point, agent Nutan Brown found her clients a renovated two-storey house that possessed everything on their checklist.
But even better was the fact it had a price tag that wouldn't require them to blow their budget in a bidding war. "The reason they settled on this was that they liked the street itself and the things done to the home," says Ms. Brown.
"This particular property was put out without any holdbacks on offers, so we were able to approach the vendors with a reasonable offer and negotiate a price they were happy with and my buyers were happy with."
Situated on a short street, this detached brick house - circa 1930 - is in good condition indoors and out.
The private backyard was especially memorable with a deck off the sunroom, winding patio and hot tub, as well as a gate to a detached garage and lane. "It's been beautifully landscaped at the front and back, which really warmed up the property," says Ms. Brown.
Inside, there are three bedrooms, three bathrooms and a fireside living room overlooking the dining room. "It's a very traditional home of that vintage," says Ms. Brown. "But having the additional sunroom at the rear was certainly a bonus we did not see in many properties."
Finishes include pot lights in select areas; leaded-glass windows in the principal rooms; and bamboo floors in the kitchen rather than the hardwood floors installed throughout.
The lower-level family room also features broadloom carpeting and a side entrance.
In terms of local amenities, attractions range from shops and subway on Bloor Street to parks and trails along the Humber River.

Listing agents: Marlene and Sarah McLean, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
In the Newport Beach condominium community by the waterfront, there are few opportunities to purchase a three-storey townhouse, much less one as special as this end unit, agent Marlene McLean says.
"It was upgraded to the nines," she says, referring to features such as marble finishes, hardwood floors and built-in units as well as sound, central vacuum and water filter systems.
"It was also an end unit, so on one side of the townhouse, there were extra windows from top to bottom, and the majority of them faced the water."
In addition, this townhouse combines the perks of a condominium suite and a low-rise home. "It's very much like living in a single-detached house, but all the maintenance is looked after for you," Ms. McLean says.
There is direct access to a private garage from the lower level, where there is a powder room, a family room with a gas fireplace and an exit to open green space. "If you have a pet ... it's very convenient," she says.
The primary entrance is located off the living room on the main floor, which houses a formal dining room and kitchen with an island and double doors to a balcony.
On the second floor, there is a bathroom, one bedroom with a built-in desk, and a second bedroom with a walk-in closet.
The floor above was set up as a master retreat with a walk-in closet, a five-piece bathroom and a balcony. "The master suite is sumptuous," the agent says. "It's private, it's large and it has a walkout that overlooks the green space and the lake."
For additional room to exercise or socialize, residents can use a common gym or party room, which are maintained with funds from the monthly fee of $841.
Alternatively, local attractions and amenities include shops and bistros, as well an increasing number of medical offices, businesses and bus routes.
"Living at the waterfront has been made a lot more convenient," Ms. McLean says.

Full text: 7053 Pond St., Mississauga,
What: The Cheyne House, which was built circa 1860 in the village of Meadowvale for the first postmaster. In 1920, the dwelling became a tea room and small hotel known as the Apple Tree Inn. In recent years, the property has been restored as a family home, with five bedrooms and three bathrooms in 3,200 square feet on a 174-by-113-foot lot.
Asking price: $1.395-million
Taxes: $5,118.50
Agent: ReMax Realty Specialists Inc. (Patricia Hodge-Rendall)
In Luther Cheyne's day, Meadowvale was a tranquil village set beside the banks of the Credit River and surrounded by beautiful countryside.
Today, the Cheyne house still stands in tranquillity in an enclave of heritage houses that have been sheltered from the city growing up around them.
Real-estate agent Patricia Hodge-Rendall of ReMax Realty Specialists Inc. often receives calls from house hunters who come across one of her listings online and are perplexed by the images of a bucolic setting so close to the centre of Mississauga.
"They call me and say, 'Where is that?' " says Ms. Hodge-Rendall. "A lot of people don't even know this area exists."
Today the 90 or so houses are preserved in a heritage conservation district, designated for its architectural and historical significance.
"The whole village is set on the river banks," the agent says.
Residents who live in the hamlet today have access to nature at the Meadowvale Conservation Area nearby. The Credit River Conservation Authority protects the river.
The village was founded by John Beatty and a group of Irish immigrants from New York in 1819, according to author Kathleen Hicks, who chronicled the history of the area in Meadowvale: Mills to Millennium.
As the village and surrounding farms prospered, she says, millers harnessed the power of the Credit to saw lumber, grind wheat into flour and spin wool into yarn.
One of the entrepreneurs was Mr. Cheyne, who operated a grist mill and set up the first post office in the village store. He became involved in local politics and took on the role of deputy reeve in 1863.
"He was extremely community-minded, being the first postmaster," Ms. Hicks says.
At the corner of Pond Street and Barberry Lane, Mr. Cheyne commissioned a one-and-a-half-storey residence with classical and gothic-revival stylistic elements.
In 1891, John and Mary Ann Lambe Farnell purchased the house from Mr. Cheyne's estate for $500, Ms. Hicks's research shows. Over the years, they expanded the property by buying adjoining lots.
In 1920, a few years after the death of Mr. Farnell, the house changed hands again. It was purchased for $2,500 by Helen Beardmore and Mary Yates, who opened a tea room and named it the Apple Tree Inn after the aged tree near the house.
The inn became a haven for art students from Toronto, who spent their summers painting scenes from the picturesque village and surrounding landscape. One visitor was Group of Seven artist A. J. Casson, whose grandmother lived in the village.
"There are so many paintings of that apple tree," says Ms. Hicks of the inn's namesake. "It was quite a popular place."
Her research also uncovered details about Ms. Yates and Ms. Beardmore, who were avid gardeners devoted to cultivating irises and roses. They had brick-lined terrace gardens built into the hill behind the inn and covered the slope with roses.
In 1944, the house was sold to Aemiluis Jarvis for $3,000 and it became a family residence again.
Later in the 20th century the house became neglected. When the current homeowners bought the property, the house had fallen into disrepair and the floors had heaved.
The appraisers brought in to assess the property refused to climb the stairs to the second floor because they were so dilapidated.
But the owners saw the potential of the old house and brought in architect Christopher Wallace to rebuild.
The renovation retained many of the original elements while making the house more accommodating to a family.
Today the main floor provides a large living room and a formal dining room. The large eat-in kitchen offers views of the gardens all around.
On the second floor, the master suite has a large bedroom, walk-in closet and bathroom with a walk-in shower and double sinks.
The other bedrooms overlook the side yard, and a sunroom at the rear, surrounded by the treetops, currently serves as a playroom for the children in the household.
In the main bathroom, a reclaimed antique dresser has been turned into a vanity with a sink and marble top.
Ms. Hodge-Rendall points out that the property, at about half an acre, offers seclusion and pretty paths for walking.
Meanwhile, the property and those surrounding it near Old Derry Road are sheltered from development. Ms. Hodge-Rendall says the construction of a new Derry Road north of the original street has helped to preserve the hamlet.
The location between Highway 401 to the south and 407 to the north means residents have quick access to all sorts of modern conveniences and transportation.
The village of Streetsville is not far away for dining and shopping.
"It has some funky little restaurants and boutiques," says Ms. Hodge-Rendall.
Ms. Hicks says the people who choose to live in the old village of Meadowvale tend to be conservation-minded. She met many homeowners while researching her book, and found they shared a love of antique houses.
"Nothing can happen to those houses," says Ms. Hicks. "It warms my heart that they're still around to enjoy. It's a very precious area."

Full text: Toronto's Altius Architecture Inc. designs a Muskoka cottage with high visual impact but a soft touch
Building any house or cottage comes with its share of hurdles. But when Trevor McIvor was hired to design a sustainable, cliff-top family retreat with 360-degree views of the surrounding lake and forest from every room, he knew he was in for a challenge.
"It's obviously impossible," says the partner of Toronto-based Altius Architecture, "unless you build a tower where every floor is one room."
The combined task of designing a 3,000-square-foot, four-season cottage to be totally off the electricity grid, while possible, is seldom done. Incorporating solar technology into non-winterized cottages is one thing. But for year-round residences that endure long, cold Canadian winters, the financial investment is typically too large and the return too small.
The owner of the aptly named Cliff House would not disclose his building budget, saying only that the return on investment for going green "was too high for me to count in years based on economics."
However, he says the cost to run electricity to the secluded Muskoka property would also have been very high - as much as six figures.
In the end, his family's decision to go green wasn't financially motivated. "It's cultural. It's a value statement," he says.
Several years ago, they built a few smaller solar-powered cabins by the lake some 20 metres below the granite peak. And though the Cliff House is luxurious to be sure, it does not have a landline telephone, television, dishwasher, microwave or other modern conveniences.
"For us, luxury is a comfortable chair, good reading light, a great book, solitude ... being able to look out the window and be surprised that an eagle flies below you."
The size of the retreat and its year-round use means it must leverage not one - but many - green strategies and technologies.
Architecturally, the building, which was completed last fall, is designed to take advantage of the sun's movement and seasonal air flow - incorporating elements like cantilevered flying roofs that overhang to block the sun, green roofs that mediate temperatures inside, and venting skylights and super-insulated operable glass windows that release hot air above while drawing-in fresh air below.
Mechanically, the Cliff House is equipped with a solar system designed to keep the cottage operating at a "healthy temperature" during the winter and prevent the pipes from freezing.
The evacuated tube solar collectors on the roof are connected to 10 hot-water tanks in the basement that heat the cement floors and water supply. When fully charged, they can store enough heat for four overcast days in the winter.
Electricity is generated through photovoltaic arrays (solar cells) on the property and a bank of batteries hidden in a storage shed, which make up 50 per cent of the solar system cost, according to architect Tony Round, another partner at the firm.
But it's the masonry heaters in the Cliff House's two fireplaces that are designed to "bump up the temperature to something comfortable" when the owners are there, explains Mr. McIvor. There is also a propane-fired boiler as a backup energy source.
"We burned more propane than we ever intended," says the owner of the family's first winter. He's committed to improving the solar efficiency before next winter hits, however he concedes managing that process can be difficult when there's less sun than expected. Altius and the owners are tweaking the systems so that they can reduce their reliance on the back-up propane generators in winter.
Mr. McIvor says that the project is an experimental work-in-progress and an opportunity most architects don't get. "When I was young and energetic, going to university 15 years ago, this was the stuff that got me all excited, but no one was ever interested in doing it. We're finally getting to implement it full on," he says gratefully.
The chance to build on the cliff was "a once in a lifetime thing," Mr. Round adds. "It's an amazing site. There are a lot of cues that you can take from it."
As a result, the design of the interior was kept simple and natural. Materials like authentic Muskoka granite, slate, polished concrete, Douglas fir, birch and walnut complement the exterior. And, custom floor-to-ceiling, frameless glass windows with glazed corners, made by a local manufacturer, bring the outside in.
The rooms don't have 360-degree views but both the owners and architects agree they come close. Except for the basement and utility room, each has three walls of windows, granting spectacular panoramic vistas of the grounds and wildlife.
"We didn't let the architecture get away from us and overpower what the natural beauty of the site is," says Mr. McIvor. "The real showpiece is always the view. It's always what's drawing you in."

A tower to make Yonge young again

Author: John Bentley Mays

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/tower-make-yonge-young-again/docview/519394284/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The important thing about Mr. [David Pontarini]'s tower is not, however, its novelty in profile - a cautiously decorated box is still a box - but rather its relationship to the Yonge corridor. Instead of eliminating the site's five existing street-side storefronts and building out to the edge of Yonge Street, Mr. Pontarini has pulled his tower smartly back from the avenue, behind the old buildings.

Full text: Five will bring a cool condo to a rough patch of downtown Toronto - and revive old storefronts too
jmays@globeandmail.com
Yonge Street between Bloor and Wellesley is one part of Toronto that's in absolutely no peril of being officially designated a heritage district.
Its Victorian storefronts, for the most part, are architecturally forgettable. Neither the self-conscious gentility of Rosedale nor the chic of Yorkville, its near neighbours to the north, have made a civilizing mark on this downmarket strip, with its endless pizza joints, nail and tattoo parlours, sex shops and the like.
That said, this stretch of Yonge Street does possess one thing that makes it a good candidate for improvement: the attractively hard, lowrise street wall created by those otherwise nondescript facades. What's needed here is a scheme of urban healing that will draw many high-earning, hard-working residents into this balefully neglected downtown area - main-street intensification, in planning jargon - while conserving what's already right about the commercial streetscape.
The ingenious new complex called Five Condos, proposed for the southwest corner of Yonge and St. Joseph streets, could be just what the doctor ordered.
Designed for MOD Developments Inc. and Graywood Developments Ltd. by David Pontarini, founding partner in Hariri Pontarini Architects, Five is a mixture of three interconnected elements.
The most conspicuous of them is a 45-storey residential tower containing 412 condominium suites and offering five levels of underground parking. (The interiors are by Anna Simone, principal in the much-awarded firm of Cecconi Simone.) This tall building will feature a sculptural gesture that is emerging as Mr. Pontarini's signature in skyscraper design: a pushing in and pulling out of balcony fronts at various levels to generate the effect of a great, gently billowing top-to-bottom curtain of glass.
The inspiration behind this treatment, Mr. Pontarini told me, is a much more adventurous Chicago building called Aqua, by Jeanne Gang and her firm Studio Gang. Ms. Gang's tall structure is basically a modernist block, though it shows the world a remarkably vivid face, with high drama - much rippling and ruffling, like the surface of a lake battered by wind - fashioned by manipulating the protruding edges of the floor plates.
The important thing about Mr. Pontarini's tower is not, however, its novelty in profile - a cautiously decorated box is still a box - but rather its relationship to the Yonge corridor. Instead of eliminating the site's five existing street-side storefronts and building out to the edge of Yonge Street, Mr. Pontarini has pulled his tower smartly back from the avenue, behind the old buildings.
This small troop of architectural survivors, the second item in my list of the plan's three, is to be cleaned up and otherwise given a new lease on life by heritage specialists ERA Architects, Mr. Pontarini said. The one or two upper storeys will become office space; the ground-floor units will continue as retail shops. The offices will be accessed through a rear entrance, off St. Joseph Street. (A Gothic Revival warehouse on St. Joseph, or at least its ruggedly handsome façade, is also slated for salvation. It will serve as the entry pavilion of the tower.)
The third aspect of Mr. Pontarini's design is a roof garden by the celebrated landscape architect Janet Rosenberg, boosted a storey or so off the ground. This green space, a pleasant open-air interval in the dense commercial and residential fabric that surrounds it, will be slotted between the tower and the Yonge Street buildings.
Though we have nothing to go on at this stage other than renderings, Five promises to be an excellent and thoughtful instance of urban design, and it could even be a model for the future invigoration of Toronto's most important streets.
What we all like about Yonge - the long rhythm of small shops and low facades, punctuated now and again by little streets - is kept intact by this project. A sensible, urbane philosophy of architectural preservation (encouraged by city planners) is at work here, not the antiquarian devotion to every old brick and stick that's too much the reigning dogma in the local heritage community. If Five lives up to its artistic pledge and succeeds in the marketplace, it could entice other developers to adopt a similarly sophisticated attitude to our historic thoroughfares.
And what we don't like about this extent of Yonge Street - its forlorn shabbiness, its sense of being unloved, uncared for - will be under pressure to change, as several hundred affluent residents, those "eyes on the street" architects and urban planners like to talk about, move in and begin to demand something better from the stores in their neighbourhood. Not that Yonge Street will be suddenly transformed by one project. But Five sets a valuable precedent for how the transformation of Toronto's main streets can be brought about.

Full text:   BP's disaster in the Gulf of Mexico highlights why large institutional investors want more disclosure on how businesses deal with the environment. Which companies give it? Janet McFarland reveals our ranking on corporate responsibility, conducted with Corporate Knights
47% reported energy usage levels
58% reported carbon dioxide emissions
25% provided data on water use
25% reported data on waste production
Major pension funds are demanding more environmental data about the businesses they've invested in, but most companies are still not giving them key information about things such as energy and water consumption, according to a new review of corporate social responsibility in Canada.
Loblaw Cos. Ltd., Canada's largest grocery chain operator, tops the ranking of corporate responsibility in the country, compiled by research group Corporate Knights Inc. The review assessed environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices of companies in Canada's S & P/TSX 60 index.
The review found only 10 of 60 corporations in the index (17 per cent) disclosed detailed data on four environmental factors assessed in the ranking. Only 25 per cent of those companies provided data on their water use and waste production.
Fewer than half (47 per cent) reported their energy use, while 58 per cent disclosed their carbon-dioxide emissions.
"These four things - energy, carbon, water and waste - are the four things that are the most core and universally applicable indicators," said Toby Heaps, editor-in-chief of Corporate Knights.
Among companies reporting all four criteria, Bombardier Inc. had the best environmental performance, the review concluded.
The factors used in the assessment - a total of 12 criteria, including governance and social factors - were selected based on their broad acceptance as key ESG ratios, and because they are relevant among all companies regardless of what industry they're in, Mr. Heaps said.
Unlike many other corporate responsibility rankings, the marking system is fully transparent; details of all factors considered are available at www.globeandmail.com/business.
Some of Canada's largest pension funds have been urging companies to improve their weak reporting in the environmental realm to make it easier for investors to analyze risks - and some are even using BP PLC's Gulf of Mexico disaster to buttress their argument.
The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board has a five-person team that manages the fund's ESG issues, including its participating in various global reporting initiatives such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, said executive vice-president Mark Wiseman.
Mr. Wiseman said ESG issues are potential investing risks, and CPPIB urges more disclosure from companies to help weigh factors like carbon emissions or social risks.
"We believe these issues are important and go to long-term value," he said. "But the only way we as an investor can assess that impact is if companies provide us with appropriate disclosure around exposures they have."
Doug Pearce, chief executive officer of the British Columbia Investment Management Corp., said as a long-term holder of shares, BCIMC cannot easily sell holdings because of environmental concerns. Instead, it has decided it is better to urge companies to adopt better ESG practices.
"It is a substantive risk component for long-term holdings like ours," he said. "You just need to look at BP - that company is in deep trouble."
Canadian companies are not specifically required to disclose any environmental data about their operations, but regulators do require companies to report on issues "material" to their operations. A new report commissioned by the Ontario Securities Commission concluded that the "materiality" requirement is good enough.
Mr. Heaps, however, said there are some factors that are widely reviewed by investors, including carbon emissions, energy use and lost-time injury rates, so regulators should start by requiring basic disclosure on those fronts where there is little controversy about their relevance.
A number of leading companies in the ESG realm say their voluntary disclosure is still evolving as they set internal standards and targets.
Iamgold Corp., which finished third in the ranking, is developing a new process to report water usage data, said Ross Gallinger, senior vice-president of health, safety and sustainability at the gold mining company.
As a young company with only four years of history in sustainability reporting, Iamgold can tackle only so many initiatives each year, he said. The company has put particular emphasis on disclosing details of its environmental stewardship, community engagement and community development.
The mining and energy sectors are among the most advanced industry groups for reporting on environmental data, but Iamgold interim chief executive officer Peter Jones said the impetus has come more from community groups than from investors. Many investors are only interested in sustainability issues if a company has a significant problem, he said.
The bigger impetus for mining firms comes from their work in remote or underdeveloped areas where they need a "social licence" to operate from local residents who are most affected by social issues and environmental risks. Iamgold helps finance schools, hospitals, infrastructure and economic development programs such as agricultural assistance in regions where it operates in Africa and South America.
"We want to be welcome there, rather than being a thorn in their side," Mr. Jones said.
Financial services companies are also often ESG leaders, in part because of specific rules requiring banks and insurers to report annually on sustainability factors.
Sun Life Financial Inc., which finished fifth in the Corporate Knights ranking, emphasizes its philanthropic giving programs in its sustainability report. But the company also places significant emphasis on issues relating to employees and its own environmental footprint, said Michel Leduc, who manages the insurer's ESG issues.
Financial companies in particular face sustainability questions about their investment portfolios, he said. Sun Life has large holdings of real-estate assets, such as office buildings, and has implemented programs to monitor and reduce energy use among its holdings.
Mr. Leduc said the insurer also plans to bolster its scant public reporting of environmental data, but wants to be sure it can confidently measure each criteria before disclosing numbers.
"Having observed the evolution of expectations over the last 10 years, you naturally see that's where it will go - people will expect not only more transparency, but I could see where you would ultimately have to be audited," he said.
While environmental reporting is spotty among TSX 60 companies, Mr. Heaps said it is impressive that a majority of large companies are disclosing their CO2 emissions, a high-profile concern for many investors. And he said scores are impressive on some of the social and governance factors included in the ranking.
For example, 43 per cent of companies in the index now tie a portion of compensation of a top executive to sustainability, and 58 per cent have designated a committee of the board of directors to oversee environmental issues. As well, 62 per cent of companies offer a traditional defined-benefit pension plan to workers - a level far higher than in many other countries.

Abstract: It's not that anyone seems to be shy about using it; there is also South Dildo, Dildo Pond and Dildo Island. The name may have had its origins in the Spanish port of Bilbao, or it may come from the Portuguese, or the native Indians. But no one really knows and no one really cares. I'm sure the locals have heard it all. A while back, a proposal to change the town's name was strongly voted down.

Full text:   In a province known for wacky monikers like Tickle Cove, Witless Bay and Come by Chance, one place still manages to stand out. Dildo. I had purposely avoided Dildo, not wanting to be another curious tourist stopping by simply because of the name. But as the sun sank lower in the sky, my husband Rick and I began to run out of options.
It's our last full day in Newfoundland after a 10-day tour. We are heading back to St. John's from Bonavista, a 300-kilometre drive. The highways are empty, so we cruise at a leisurely pace, hoping to spend the night outside of the city. But travelling on the fly has its downside. We discover that much of the better accommodation is seasonal, and this is late October - the season is about to end.
Each successive town brings another disappointment, as Rick asks around for suggestions and I dial furiously on my cellphone. "Don't drive at night," we are warned. "You'll hit a moose."
Moose be damned, I am holding out for four-star lodgings. Unfortunately, the only promising stop on the map is Dildo. Our guide book shows several highly rated establishments that are open year-round, including a four-and-a-half star bed and breakfast overlooking Trinity Bay. My call nets only an answering machine, but we venture in anyway.
Dildo is a small community of about 1,200 people, some 15 kilometres off the Trans-Canada Highway. Fishing and whaling initially attracted settlers, though today the main industry is tourism and heritage preservation. The Dildo Interpretation Centre is well-known for its fine collection of Beothuk Indian and Dorset Inuit artifacts excavated from an island in the mouth of the harbour. Boat tours to see the archeological digs are also available. We catch an exhilarating whiff of fresh sea air as we enter town, and pull into our bed and breakfast at the same time as the owner.
The Inn By The Bay, built in 1888, is one of two establishments run by the same proprietor. It is right across the road from the ocean, while further up the hill sits George House Heritage B & B, with an art gallery and boutique. Close by is Dildo's Kountry Kravins 'n' Krafts, a coffee shop that also offers local souvenirs.
The inn is welcoming, decorated in a palette of muted earth tones and furnished with tasteful antiques. There is also the odd curiosity thrown in, like a stuffed baby seal. Our room is stylishly elegant, with nary a doily in sight. An overstuffed club chair from the 1940s provides a comfortable spot to relax and the queen bed is dressed in a plush, down-filled duvet. Now assured of a fabulous place to sleep, we go to watch the sun set.
The harbour is sheltered and picturesque. Gentle waves lap against a pebbly beach. Clusters of frame houses perch on the dusky hillside. Half a dozen pricey fishing boats are moored at the docks and beside them, a couple of fishermen sit on a wooden bench, smoking. One of them reminds me of the Skipper from Gilligan's Island . We stop and chat about real estate, the fishing industry, the weather... just about everything but the town's name.
It's not that anyone seems to be shy about using it; there is also South Dildo, Dildo Pond and Dildo Island. The name may have had its origins in the Spanish port of Bilbao, or it may come from the Portuguese, or the native Indians. But no one really knows and no one really cares. I'm sure the locals have heard it all. A while back, a proposal to change the town's name was strongly voted down.
We meander along the shore, admiring the final pink and orange efforts of the setting sun. Later on, we'll savour a home-cooked meal at a nearby diner. I'll enjoy a delicious macaroni and cheese casserole while Rick tucks into a hot turkey sandwich. But right now, as the sun sets over Trinity Bay, the moon is rising over Dildo. And the next time we hear the word, we'll think of this pretty fishing village instead of, well, the other thing.

Full text:   California, like many other states, is nearly bankrupt and desperately needs a bailout. The not-so-Golden State's budget crisis is a harbinger of a grim dilemma that all Americans will soon confront. And dramatic cuts by state governments are threatening to derail the U.S. recovery, which bodes ill for Canada
bmckenna@globeandmail.com
Arnella Sims has seen a lot in her 34 years as a Los Angeles County court reporter, but nothing like this.
Case files piling up by the thousands, phones ringing off the hook, forced midweek courthouse closings and occasional brawls as frustrated citizens queue for hours to pay parking fines.
"People think we're becoming a Third World country," said Ms. Sims, 55. "They don't understand."
It's a story that's being repeated all across California - and throughout the United States - as cash-strapped state and local governments grapple with collapsed tax revenues and swelling budget gaps. Mass layoffs, slashed health and welfare services, closed parks, crumbling superhighways and ever-larger public school class sizes are all part of the new normal.
California's fiscal hole is now so large that the state would have to liberate 168,000 prison inmates and permanently shutter 240 university and community college campuses to balance its budget in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
Think of California as Greece on the Pacific: bankrupt and desperately needing a bailout.
"We are on the verge of system failure," warned Jean Ross, executive director of the California Budget Project, an independent think tank based in Sacramento.
Costly government machine
None of this would matter much to anyone outside the not-so-Golden State except that California's budget crisis is a harbinger of a grim dilemma that all Americans will soon confront. The country has built an elaborate and costly government machine, tied to a regressive tax system that can't generate enough revenue to pay for it all.
Canadians too have a stake in all this. Dramatic cuts by state governments are threatening to derail the U.S. recovery, dampening expectations for global growth. The tension - between continuing to keep the fiscal tap open and coming to grips with unsustainable deficits - is emerging as a key theme of the upcoming G20 summit in Toronto.
"This is a classic American dilemma," explained Peter Dreier, a professor of politics and director of urban and environmental policy at Occidental College in Los Angeles. "Americans expect a lot of their government. But politicians have convinced them they're not getting what they want."
Americans have been "brainwashed" into believing they pay a lot of taxes, Prof. Dreier added. In fact, they are among the least-taxed people in the Western world, particularly if they're wealthy, he said.
After unveiling a grim budget last month that scraps a popular welfare program for a million children and slashes countless other programs for the poor and elderly, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger complained that the state's broken budget process has left him facing a "Sophie's Choice." That's a reference to the story of the Polish Jew forced by the Nazis to choose between saving her son or her daughter from the Auschwitz gas chambers.
Experts say the U.S. government will inevitably have to come to the rescue, using its borrowing clout to save the state from near-bankruptcy or devastating service cuts. Do nothing, and the entire U.S. economy could be put at risk. California, like the country's banks, may be too big to fail.
Dire financial straits
California is looking at a gap of $19-billion (U.S.) this year and $37-billion next year on a roughly $125-billion-a-year budget. Local governments, including the City of Los Angeles, are in similarly dire financial straits and are now scrambling to shed workers and services.
"We have to get some federal money," argued Ms. Ross of the California Budget Project. "The impact [of the Schwarzenegger budget] would be enough to slow down the U.S. economy. It would be bad for the U.S. and, arguably, bad for the world to do the shock therapy approach."
And California isn't alone in angling for a bailout. U.S. states are facing shortfalls totalling nearly $300-billion in 2010 and 2011; they also must wrestle with hundreds of billions more in unfunded pension obligations to their workers. "There are a few Greek crises brewing among the United States of America," said economist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research.
The task is made all the more difficult because California and virtually all other states are barred by legislation from running operating deficits, forcing them to balance their budgets annually by slashing spending, raising taxes or both. Typically, states can only borrow short-term funds, or capital projects.
Billionaire Warren Buffett, who advised U.S. President Barack Obama during his White House run, suggested recently that a Washington bailout of California and other troubled states is inevitable. How, he wondered, can Washington deny California after saying yes to GM, AIG and dozens of banks. "I don't know how you would tell a state you're going to stiff-arm them, with all the bailouts of corporations."
The alternative for many state and local governments may be default. Mr. Buffett said many state and municipal bonds are only triple-A rated because investors assume there's a federal backstop. "If the federal government won't step in to help them, who knows what [the bonds] are," he said. California's credit rating is already the lowest of all 50 states.
How California, the largest and once most-prosperous state, got in this mess is a story decades in the making. It began with middle-class angst and a property tax revolt in the sprawling suburbs of Los Angeles. The movement would eventually sweep the country in the inflation-ravaged economy of the late 1970s, leaving government unable to pay for many of the services and entitlements people now take for granted.
John Serrano Jr., a social worker, was frustrated that he had to move his family out of East L.A. to find decent public schools for his children. He would eventually lend his name to a class-action lawsuit that would go all the way to the California Supreme Court. In a series of decisions, the court found the state's school finance system to be unconstitutional for relying too heavily on local property taxes, which vary widely in poor and wealthy neighbourhoods
The landmark case would forever change the fiscal landscape of California, and many other states, shifting the financial burden of kindergarten to Grade 12 education from local to state governments, but not the tax base. K-12 education is the State of California's single largest expense, soaking up roughly a third of its budget.
A tax revolt would further tilt the tax burden to the state and deprive local governments of their most stable funding source - property taxes.
Proposition 13
In the mid-1970s, California property taxes were soaring, along with real estate values, and incomes couldn't keep pace. The result was a campaign, financed by L.A.-area apartment landlords, that culminated in the now-infamous Proposition 13 ballot initiative in 1978. Prop. 13 rolled back and capped both residential and commercial property tax rates at 1975 levels. And it virtually guaranteed that only a revolution would reverse it: Prop. 13 imposed a two-thirds majority requirement for all tax bills and required local voters to approve all municipal tax increases.
"California put itself in a straitjacket that it hasn't been able to get out of," Occidental College's Prof. Dreier explained. In the years since Prop. 13, California has come to the rescue of local governments, taking on ever-greater responsibility for schools, low-income health care and welfare. And it has paid for all that with volatile sales and income tax revenue, making it tough to balance its budget when the economy stalls.
"A lot of people predicted doom and gloom in 1978. It just took a long time," said John Tanner, executive director of Local 721 of the Service Employees International Union, which represents 85,000 government workers in Los Angeles and throughout Southern California.
Perhaps no group of workers feels more targeted in the crisis than teachers. U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan has warned that without money from Congress as many as 300,000 teachers nationwide could lose their jobs to state budget cuts, including several thousand in California.
"It's not easy being me these days," said A.J. Duffy, president of the United Teachers of Los Angeles. "I have 45,000 members looking to me to save their jobs." His union represents teachers and other employees at 700-plus L.A. schools, where up to 1,200 jobs are threatened.
California public schools were once a beacon for the country. Now, the state ranks dead-last in student-teacher ratios, 45th in per-student spending and 36th in high school graduation.
The tax structure may be badly flawed. But even union activists acknowledge that repealing Prop. 13 is probably a non-starter. Recent polls show support for keeping a lid on property taxes remains strong, in spite of the budget crisis.
Experts say tax reform is the only option for California, short of a massive and unprecedented shrinking of government. And that requires an "open conversation" between voters and their elected leaders, and almost certainly higher taxes, according to Ms. Ross, the economist. "If you want good schools, you have to pay for them. Cutting taxes doesn't raise revenue."
That kind of talk angers Kris Vosburgh, executive director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, named after the L.A. homeowner who led the Prop. 13 campaign and dedicated to ensuring it's never overturned. He said California is a high-tax state with generously paid government workers, and recession-weary taxpayers have no money to pay more.
"The bank is empty," Mr. Vosburgh complained. "We have tried to be all things to all people and we can't afford to do that any more."
But in California, and elsewhere, the price will be steep - in lost jobs and vanishing services. Carliose Lane, 37, an animal licensing official for the City of Los Angeles, knows the city, and the state, are in a budget bind. But he can't understand why he and the city's entire team of animal fee collectors must pay the price with their jobs. Who, he wondered, will collect the money that pays for the city's shelters and pet control operations after he's laid off on July 1.
"Laying me off isn't going to solve the city's budget problems," said Mr. Lane, whose $32,300-a-year salary helps support a wife and three children. "It will make them worse."
****************
Red ink, from sea to shining sea
Forty-eight of 50 states face budget shortfalls this year. Many shortfalls amount to more than 20 per cent of planned spending. The plunge in state tax revenue is the worst on record.

Full text:   As the price of mortgages rise and the real estate market cools, more people are selling their properties for temporary homes
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Bidding wars have moved from the bungalow to the two-bedroom rental apartment.
Many homeowners who cashed out at the peak of the market are putting their money in the bank rather than investing in a new house. And as a slew of new renters look for temporary homes, they are driving up prices and engaging in bidding wars to ensure they snap up properties that are comparable to the properties they left behind.
With the real estate market cooling and the cost of mortgages expected to climb, they are sitting on their cash and hoping prices will drop before they wade back into the world of home ownership.
"There is angst among buyers who would rather rent and wait a while before jumping back in," said Cary Chapnick, president of Hive Realty Corp. in Toronto. "And then they get out there, and find that the good properties are receiving multiple offers. It's quite a shift."
In one recent deal, a downtown Toronto two-bedroom condominium rented for $2,250 a month - 122 per cent higher than the $1,850 its owner had expected. A three-bedroom house went for $2,700, 110 per cent higher than the $2,300 listing price.
While the sudden surge in price increases are easy to quantify in Toronto, where the city's real estate board keeps track of rentals on a daily basis through its Multiple Listing Service, agents in other cities have to rely on anecdotes to track prices because the information isn't compiled.
Diana Mander of Royal LePage Northshore has worked in Vancouver's rental market since 1989, and said this summer has been among her busiest. Things are usually slowing down this time of year, but a flood of local inquiries has caught her off guard.
She's more accustomed to dealing with families who are moving to Vancouver from other cities, not Vancouverites who are looking for high-end rental homes because they sold their own properties.
"The strength of the local market is really quite a surprise," she said. "People are literally selling $3-million homes and opting to rent. It's definitely putting pressure on supply."
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said this week that the national vacancy rate increased to 2.9 per cent in the last year, up from 2.7 per cent. But rents advanced 1.8 per cent, as landlords took advantage of tight supply in the country's largest markets.
Toronto and Vancouver have been at the epicentre of the country's real estate boom, with resale prices now at all-time highs. Their vacancy rates are also among the lowest in the country, at 2.2 and 2.7 per cent, respectively.
"As an agent I can tell you that it is incredibly frustrating to deal with prices that seem flexible at best," said Mr. Chapnick. "You think you have a deal, you show up and they tell you someone will pay more. And there aren't any regulations, really, so you're stuck playing the game."
That said, he understands the case for renting is compelling.
Someone who spends $800,000 on a house today could rent a comparable property for about $3,000 a month. If prices fall 10 per cent in the next year - a possibility cited by both TD Bank and CIBC World Market economists - that home would be worth $80,000 less by 2012.
Or, they could spend $36,000 on rent and gamble on lower prices down the road while also saving on maintenance fees and taxes.
This is the approach Susan Isenstein and her husband Norman chose after selling their Toronto home 24 hours after it was put on the market last month. They had intended to move into something without so many stairs, but couldn't find anything acceptable in their price range.
"So you can't find what you like, and then there's the concern about whether or not prices are going to go down," she said. "All in all, we decided to rent and wait a little while to see what will happen."
Once they decided to rent, they made an offer on a condo only to find the landlord was demanding $200 more than the listed price. He was willing to negotiate, but they still spent $40 a month more than they had expected.
"I know a while back it was a renter's market," she said. "I don't think you can say that any more."

The third wave

Abstract: "They're injecting fuel into it, causing [luxury prices] to rise a little faster than they usually would," says West Side realtor Ryan Dyer. "There are definitely some fast-paced sales going on. A lot of the really highly sought after properties have been snapped up pretty fast."

Full text:   Buyers from the Chinese mainland are pouring their wealth into Vancouver real estate, boosting the market and making Mandarin a must-have in the realtor's toolbox
The economic impact of wealthy buyers from Mainland China has gone all but unnoticed by the average Vancouverite - but it's no secret to the city's real estate industry.
And unlike the buyers from Hong Kong in the 80s and Taiwan in the 90s, who had a huge impact on property values, this third wave from Mainland China is projected to be far bigger. This wave of buyer is newly rich and seeking luxury properties on the city's West Side, in downtown condo properties, and to a lesser extent, in Richmond and Burnaby. Buyers from Mainland China are even buying up recreational properties in places like Kelowna.
"They're injecting fuel into it, causing [luxury prices] to rise a little faster than they usually would," says West Side realtor Ryan Dyer. "There are definitely some fast-paced sales going on. A lot of the really highly sought after properties have been snapped up pretty fast."
Magnum Projects' George Wong has benefited first-hand from the buying spree of the Mainland Chinese. "We've sold about $150 million in the last two months," says real estate marketer Mr. Wong.
"In terms of purchasing power, they go for the big residential single detached homes - that's all we're hearing, especially in regard to high end product," says Mr. Wong, who has had to learn Mandarin as a result.
"It's very much a reflection of the new wealth. China is no longer a sleeping giant - it's a giant.
"And it's not just a Vancouver phenomenon, it's all along the west coast."
Vancouver developer Robert Macdonald, owner of Macdonald Development, is making regular trips to China to entice buyers.
"Realtors on the West Side will tell you about 30 per cent of sales are from the Chinese market," he says.
Marketer Bob Rennie says the majority of high-end shoppers these days are from China. Based on a survey done by his office, Mr. Rennie says more than 60 per cent of West Side sales over $1.7 million are by new Mainland Chinese purchasers. The pressure on the high end of the market could have an overall affect on affordability, says Mr. Rennie.
"We have to acknowledge that local incomes cannot compete with any foreign money," says Mr. Rennie. "Housing supply is the one thing that cities and planners will have to watch closely to maintain any level of affordability."
Vancouver is no stranger to international interest. Over the last two decades, there have been smaller real estate buying sprees by Americans, English, German, Iranian and Korean buyers. But the overseas Asian buyer has had the biggest impact on the Vancouver property market.
Of all the markets across Canada, realtors say the Chinese are most attracted to B.C. Visas Consulting Group is one of the largest immigration consulting firms in China, with offices in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong and Shandong provinces. Visas' Vincent Chen says more than 3,000 Chinese families migrate to Canada under the business category every year.
"At least 60 per cent of these families choose Vancouver to settle down - and a major part of them will buy property there, sooner or later," says Mr. Chen, from his Shanghai office.
Macdonald Realty VP Dan Scarrow, who is half Chinese and knows Mandarin, has experienced the benefits of the new market. Last year, he sold 10 condos priced at more than $5 million apiece to people from China.
Today, he runs a program aimed at partnering with immigration consultants who are hired by foreign clients to help them settle in, which includes the purchase of real estate.
"After a few years, the Hong Kong and Taiwan waves sort of fizzled out, whereas my immigration consultant friends tell me that there is a minimum of 10 more years of this wave.
"And it's still the first wave, so these individuals are what you'd call the hyper-rich. As these waves continue to come on shore, they get progressively less wealthy. We saw that happen with the Hong Kong and Taiwan buyers."
The savvy realtor in the new milieu has either learned Mandarin, has Mandarin-speaking staff or is hiring translators to do deals.
Mr. Dyer has partnered with a Mandarin-speaking translator to help with selling transactions in the last six months. He specializes in West Side properties at the high end of the market.
"They are a huge part of the market, especially [for property] above $2 million," says Mr. Dyer. "Definitely for the last six months, it's been a large percentage of offshore buyers. It was noticeably higher than average.
"They want the landmark properties - Shaughnessy, Drummond Drive in Point Grey. That would be what they're after. They are astute, and they know if they are over-paying. They bring agents with them. They are not naïve about the market."
Their interest is putting buying pressure on the high-end properties, which traditionally have fewer buyers than the lower end of the market.
It might be unbelievable to Vancouverites who've long been priced out of the market, but to the newly wealthy Chinese, Vancouver is relatively cheap.
"Many wealthy Chinese believe property is the safest way for investment, and the properties in Vancouver are not particularly expensive compared to the price in major cities in China, such as Shanghai or Beijing," says Mr. Chen.
As well, the buyers from China have already been well versed in the buying and selling of real estate.
"One of the first purchases that an immigrant family makes is a roof over the head," Mr. Wong explains. "Then there is a car and a good school for the kids. So it is a new immigrant's lifestyle. Real estate is a very crucial part.
"Also, many Asians like to invest in real estate. There is an affinity for real estate. If you're born in Monaco, chances of you being a good swimmer are higher than if you're somebody from Winnipeg. You're just immersed in that environment."
There are other reasons for the heightened interest in Canada, such as wanting to get away from China's pollution from increased car use, the perception that Canada's education system is of a high standard, and the opportunity to have bigger families.
"There is a one-child policy in China. I have several clients, they might already have a teenager, and they move here and have a baby right away - that's a strong motivation for some," says Mr. Scarrow. "Also, I think political instability is a big fear for them. They want a safe place to go to protect their assets and their life."
The Chinese buyer is popping up in the secondary recreational property market too. Vineyards are especially of interest, says Kelowna realtor Alexandra Rebagliati.
"I am seeing more and more Chinese buyers. I have a Chinese translator who works with me when my Chinese clients are in town," says Ms. Rebagliati. "Half come for recreational property - I would say it's up 20 or 25 per cent over last two to three years.
"I think you'd be very ignorant to ignore this market right now."

Full text:   PEARS ON THE AVENUE
LOCATION: The Annex
BUILDER/DEVELOPER: Menkes
SIZE: 525 to 1,974 square feet
PRICE: $425,990 to $1,678,990
SALES CENTRE: 164 Avenue Rd., north of Davenport Road. Open Monday to Thursday from noon to 6 p.m.; weekends and holidays from noon to 5 p.m.
CONTACT: Phone 416-323-0100 or visit www.menkes.com
Menkes is pleased that its latest project downtown - situated on a premium infill site ripe for redevelopment - is starting to bear fruit this season.
Last month, the builder commenced sales for Pears on the Avenue, which will contain about 130 suites within an 18-storey condominium at the southwest corner of Avenue Road and Pears Avenue, just north of Davenport Road.
"It's where the Annex meets Yorkville, so essentially, the site straddles two fantastic neighbourhoods," says vice-president of sales and marketing, Mimi Ng. "You've got the best of both worlds there."
Yorkville is packed with an assortment of designer boutiques, fine dining establishments, art galleries and museums, making it a popular destination to seek out the best in high fashion, food and culture.
"We're getting a lot of interesting from people who like the idea of being close to Yorkville, but not being right in the middle of it," adds Ms. Ng.
Meanwhile, the Annex offers a more relaxed atmosphere, established with pubs, quaint cafes and one-of-a-kind shops.
Despite the recent influx of developments in Yorkville, including the Four Seasons Hotel and Private Residences Toronto being built by Menkes, there are still fewer infill sites in that community - as well as the Annex - than other parts of the city.
"There is a lot of pent-up local demand from people who want to make a transition [from larger single-family houses] into condominium living, but don't want to leave their neighbourhood," Ms. Ng explains. "They don't want to find a new convenience store, a new grocery store or new neighbours."
To make a visual statement befitting of the boutique building's prominent setting at Avenue and Davenport roads, which is virtually a gateway between downtown and mid-town, the three-storey podium will be fashioned from glass and stone, while the upper floors will be encased with glass and white steel frames on three sides.
"It enhances the verticality of the building, so it makes it seem taller," says Ms. Ng. "It's a way of ...giving it a bit of a different look, so it's not another glass block."
This classic, yet contemporary aesthetic will continue into the interiors, which are designed by Munge Leung.
Fitness facilities will consist of a gym, an outdoor yoga studio and an indoor pool lined with cabanas.
A guest suite, boardroom and theatre will also be available, along with a party room with a kitchen, a wet bar and access to a landscaped terrace with seating areas and a fire pit. "We tried to make the outdoor spaces just as enjoyable and usable as the indoor spaces," says Ms. Ng.
The same concept applied to the design of individual suites, which will consist of one- and two-bedroom plans, with or without dens.
For the most part, there will be open-concept kitchens that flow into principal rooms with walls of full height windows and walkouts to private outdoor space.
"The balconies and terraces are meant to be extension of the living and dining room spaces," Ms. Ng adds.
Standard appointments will include nine-foot ceilings, granite kitchen counters and Miele kitchen and laundry appliances, as well as a choice of 60-ounce carpeting, engineered wood and ceramic-tile flooring.
Monthly fees will be about 60 cents per square foot.
With the exception of one-bedroom models, each unit will come with a parking spot. Lockers will cost $5,000.

Full text:   RIVERSIDE
LOCATION: Ajax, Ont.
BUILDER/DEVELOPER: Marshall Homes SIZE: towns 1,500 to 2,500 square feet; singles 2,990 and 3,660 square feet PRICE: towns $361,125 to $565,515; singles $699,325 and $788,675 SALES CENTRE: 732 Riverside Dr., at Birchmount Road in Ajax. Open Monday to Thursday from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m.; weekends from 11 to 5.

On a site bound by a lush ravine and the manicured greens of an executive nine-hole golf course in Ajax, Marshall Homes is in the midst of constructing an upscale community to be completed before the end of the year.
But some purchasers are so eager to move into the low-rise development, called Riverside, their frequent visits to the site have turned into weekly after-work socials between future neighbours.
"They're all getting along," president Craig Marshall says. "They've already turned a subdivision into a neighbourhood."
Only nine homes are left for sale out of 53 townhouses and detached residences within the project situated across from the Riverside Golf Club.
"It's a very high-end site for town homes, especially in Durham [Region]," says Mr. Marshall, who notes that the majority of buyers are empty-nesters downsizing from larger homes nearby. "There are a lot of people that live in Durham ... and want to stay in Durham."
Locals prize Ajax for its collection of waterfront parks and trails, shopping outlets, restaurants and entertainment centres. Plus activities and attractions in neighbouring towns are easily accessible using Highway 401 or GO Transit.
Though Riverside is just minutes from urban conveniences, it will feel secluded surrounded by protected woodlands, a small creek on one side and a larger trout stream on the other side, as well as an extensive trail system.
"The site is incredible," Mr. Marshall says. "When you walk out your door or look out your window, you're looking at pretty incredible views."
The homes were generally designed around main-floor living, so there are often master suites on the ground floor and additional bedrooms for guests or adult children on loft levels.
From the Golf Series, there are four townhouses left between 1,500 and 1,700 square feet and priced from $361,125 to $409,495. These two-storey models will have single garages and two or three-bedroom plans.
In the Ravine Series, priced from $506,150 to $565,515, there are three bungalow loft townhouses left backing onto green space. These will have double garages and roughly 2,500-square-foot plans, including three bedrooms, an office and a second-floor games room. Outdoor kitchens and screened-in porches will be optional.
For buyers concerned about their environmental footprint, two of the three Ravine Series homes will incorporate green materials and technology to earn LEED certification. As a result, homeowners will drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase energy savings and improve indoor air quality compared with conventional homes.
Two detached models remain on irregular-shaped lots about 40 feet wide and at least 120 feet deep.
To maintain the common roads and pool, homes will have a monthly fee of $150.

Joanna Kakkavas has a nifty idea. Whether it will fly or not remains to be seen.
She wants to introduce a concept called Condo Box. In essence she intends to make things easier - although not necessarily cheaper - for anyone who wants to buy a condo completely move-in ready.
Every stick of furniture will be in place. There will be paintings on the walls and throw pillows on the couch. And perhaps best of all, the cost of this solution to condo living will be covered by the mortgage on the suite.
It seems a great idea for people who have difficulty judging space from floor plans and have little idea how to go about hunting down furniture that suits a condo's limited space.
Yes, the concept has been tried without much success before. There have been projects that offered a turnkey solution as an option. They failed as a surefire marketing tool.
In fairness, however, those projects generally did deals with companies like Ikea. The furnishings were more college dorm room than elegant downtown condo. They were directed towards those with limited budgets.
Ms. Kakkavas is an interior designer and furniture designer by trade. Her Condo Box aims at mid-market buyers. About $20,000 gets you in the door.
But what you get is five hours of consultation with a professional designer, then rooms full of quality furnishings and all those grace notes that brighten living spaces: Pieces that were designed to suit the restricted spaces condos offer and made in Canadian factories whenever possible.
The artwork is all from local artists. No prints here. Ms. Kakkavas even uses the walls of her store at King and Sherbourne to display local art on a consignment basis.
So far, no developers have agreed to make Condo Box an option at their presentation centres. She does, however, have two private clients, both eager to sell existing condos and with the belief that the sale will go quicker and more smoothly if they sell their units fully furnished by a talented interior designer.
For private clients, she charges half the cost of furnishings up front and half when the sale closes. She also offers buyers of those suites the ability to switch pieces in place for other pieces as long as they are in the same price bracket.
The idea of a turnkey solution has been a few years in the making, Ms. Kakkavas says. She has been an interior designer for seven years and has run her store Roomy Interiors for about half that time.
"Shortly after I got into business, I decided to focus on condos," she says. "There was an obvious need. Condos are very different from single-family homes. Spaces are much more restricted and you need scaled-down furnishings to suit those smaller spaces."
The evolution of condos into truly small spaces such as those 500-square-foot, one-bedroom units, has raised the need for design changes to an even higher level, she says.
"One of the tricks is to be able to source not just smaller pieces but pieces that do double or even triple duty," she says.
And while there are low-end stores around today, what's lacking is outlets that offer mid-range quality furnishings - not assemble-yourself dining tables and bookshelves but stuff that will look good and last for 20 years.
So what tips does she offer for those about to acquire small spaces? Well, start with a couch that is larger than a love seat but smaller than a full sized sofa. It could even hide a fold-out double bed. Something in the 72- to 80-inch range. The price: about $2,000.
Then, instead of a dining table, think about a coffee table that can do double duty. Maybe even consider one with storage underneath. Storage space is often woefully lacking in today's condos. The price: About $1,500.
The sofa can seat two diners and to add two more look at a large ottoman for the other side of the table. Get one that seats two people and again has storage space underneath. About $700 will get you one that looks great and will last half a lifetime.
Bedrooms can be a challenge. Most are too small for a king-size bed; a queen is generally the largest you can squeeze in and if you do there will likely be little room for a chest of drawers. Ms. Kakkavas suggests getting around these restrictions by choosing a bed with might tables attached and with storage space under those night tables.
Some bedframes even offer drawers in their base. The cost will be about $2,500 including a mattress.
Gut the closet that comes with the bedrooms and install specially designed closet organizers. That eliminates the need for a chest of drawers.
Spend on good furniture but go downmarket on rugs and accessories, she says. A great-looking four- by eight-foot rug can be had for $400 and an original piece of art can be had for as little as $500.
Better yet, she says, let her do the work.

ROCK OF AGES

Abstract: "There's a resurgence in dry stone wall making because it's green, it's ecological, it's handcraft," says John Shaw-Rimmington, founder of the Dry Stone Wall Association of Canada, whose membership has grown from zero to 200 people since launching in Port Hope, Ont., in 2003.

Full text:   Rather than the cliché white picket fence, some home owners are reaching back to the ancient art of dry stone wall building to enclose their properties
dkelly@globeandmail.com
It's an ancient craft and it's making a modern comeback.
Dry stone walls, so-called because they are constructed without mortar, are being built on weekends by harried businessmen for whom the act of fitting rock to rock together for all manner of architectural structures is a form of three-dimensional therapy.
"It's just you and nature," says Daniel Lynch, a busy Toronto real estate agent who last summer helped his then 20-year old son, Nick, build an 80-foot stone wall around the family's rural property in the Mulmur Hills, 90 minutes north of Toronto.
"It's hard work, but it gives you a sense of peace and accomplishment. I work with paper all day. What's there to show for it? But with a stone wall I've made something that lasts. I can see it on Google Earth. A little piece of me. There. For eternity."
"There's a resurgence in dry stone wall making because it's green, it's ecological, it's handcraft," says John Shaw-Rimmington, founder of the Dry Stone Wall Association of Canada, whose membership has grown from zero to 200 people since launching in Port Hope, Ont., in 2003.
"It's no longer acceptable to have a big, heavy stone pushed into the landscape with a tractor. That's so overdone. People today want to see something that's labour-intensive and made by hand, not by a machine."
The handcrafted quality of dry stone walls is what makes them beautiful and worthy, in some instances, of being called art. This new-found status owes much to British artist Andy Goldsworthy, who creates dry stone walls as "land art" around the world to international acclaim.
They include the 2,278-foot wall he made over a two year period, from 1997 to 1998, at the Storm King Art Center, a sculpture park on the Hudson River in Mountainville, N.Y.
The wall's renown earned Mr. Goldsworthy a review in Art Forum, one of the international art world's more prestigious journals. "The wall is expertly made, its ingenious jigsaw-puzzle structure cohering without mortar or cement. Goldsworthy has invited an enduring craft tradition to play, making function manifest humor, grace, and an artmaker's intelligence," the review said in 2000.
Mr. Goldsworthy's work is the subject of a hardcover art book entitled Wall that Isabel Beveridge, the mother of Nick Lynch and wife to Daniel, used as inspiration for a book of her own created in February for her son's 21st birthday.
The Wall , as her self-published book is called, consists of photographs documenting her family's six-week project of last summer. Included are images of the surrounding fields where father and son harvested the 120 tons of granite used to create their six-foot-high structure.
A local stone supplier had quoted them $50,000 for the same amount of stone. "I thought, 'Forget that. We'll get the stone for free,' " Mr. Lynch says.
Using the family Land Rover, a neighbour's tractor and their bare hands, the Lynches pulled the stones out of the earth much like early settlers in the region must have done when clearing the land to plow.
The pioneers had left the stones in piles under trees. Father and son had to uncover them from under nearly a hundred years of dirt before choosing the right stones for stacking.
The younger Mr. Lynch concedes that the work was back-breaking, and often intimidating. "I felt overwhelmed at first," he says. "I wasn't sure I could do it."
But the work progressed in stages and this helped him gain the confidence he needed to get the task done.
He says the stones were like puzzle pieces that he had to play with before finding the right pattern to prevent them from toppling back to the earth.
"I studied them every day, memorizing their shapes and sizes, basically forming a relationship with them," he says. "They have a certain energy when fitted together properly. And as I progressed with the project, I found myself responding to that energy, and getting a high from it.
"I felt away from modern society and back in ancient times when making walls like this was an art. I felt like Thoreau. Except my Walden Pond was a wall."
The experience was so, well, uplifting that Nick is back in Mulmur building a 15-foot extension to last year's wall. He has put a sign out front advertising his new-found skill set. The hope is that more people will fall in love with stone walls the way he has.
"I think this wall is something I'll be able to carry with me for my whole life," he says. "It's taught me to believe in myself."
The Dry Stone Wall Association of Canada offers free workshops and other events such as the three-day dry stone wall festival taking place at Landon Bay, near Gananoque, Ont., during the Thanksgiving weekend in October. For additional information, visit www.dswa.ca.
****
How to build a stone wall
* Prep the base by digging out eight to 10 inches of topsoil.
* Deposit clear gravel in the base to allow for drainage.
* Assemble more stone than is actually needed and cherry-pick the best stones for the job.
* Lay out the selected stones on the ground before building to determine what fits with what.
* Set up string lines off a wood frame to serve as guides for the wall building.
* The golden rule for laying stones is: one stone on two and two stones on one, covering every joint. Large stones are used in the base of the wall, to carry the weight; smaller stones, known as hearting, are used to fill gaps and pin the outer stones in place until the wall becomes solid with no movement.
* Each course consists of two walls filled with small stones.
* Each course is slightly narrower than the one beneath it to give the wall gently tapered sides.
From Eric Landman, a dry stone waller with Orangeville's Whispering Pines Landscaping.

Full text:   Proposal adds more residential development to pay for park
In 1943, it was the centre of Toronto's Second World War aviation effort.
In 1994, the federal government announced its future as a massive national park.
Next week, the Downsview plan goes before North York community council when councillors vote on the latest iteration of the city's proposals for the area, which make provision not only for 100 hectares of parkland, but for thousands of units of mixed-use residential development intended to pay for it.
If the vote passes and sends the proposed Downsview Secondary Plan to city council, it will set in motion plans 16 years in the making.
But Michael Baigel would really rather it didn't.
"It's a dreadful plan," he said. "It was meant to be a national park ... a real gem in the city."
But plans for the Parc Downsview Park rely on turning much of the site - running from Keele Street in the west to Wilson Heights in the east and as far north as Sheppard Avenue - into intensified residential developments in order to raise money for the park itself, which is meant to be self-funding.
"They want to make it like downtown," Mr. Baigel laments - something he moved to Toronto from Manchester, England, specifically to avoid.
"The reason people live in the suburbs is because they want to live in the suburbs. They don't want to live in condos."
Plans for the site have ruffled more than a few residential feathers in the various neighbourhoods bordering the park. But one of the most offensive is the proposal to remove ramps on and off Allen Road from Wilson Heights Boulevard.
The plan to foster "transit-supported mixed-use communities" includes 400,000 square metres of mixed-use development and a transportation plan that emphasizes transit use and provides for an internal pedestrian and bicycle network.
But residents argue this would add to already clogged traffic and force commuting motorists into residential areas.
Local councillor Mike Feldman is putting forward an amendment at the June 22 meeting asking city staff to shelve plans to remove the ramps, at least until residential development transforms the area enough for different traffic systems to make sense.
Apart from that detail, he said, the secondary plan is "a nice first step" for a project that, like a growing number of public initiatives across the city, will attempt to pay for itself by leveraging the real estate value of the land on which it sits.
But Mr. Baigel would rather see the plan scrapped altogether. He fears Torontonians "will never get that greenery back again."
"They'll make one area residential and then a few years later another bit will get developed. Eventually it'll all disappear. Over 50 years, we're going to lose that park in the centre of Toronto. ... It's going to be chipped away at."

Full text:   It had been years since I had been in theatre. Yet here I was in a church basement rehearsing for Mamma Mia!
On a cold January night, we gathered in the dark basement of a North Toronto church. We'd come for a variety of reasons: some to reconnect with our past, some to escape from it, some on a whim or a dare and some because they had no good reason to say no.
We were lawyers, oncologists, acupuncturists, real-estate agents, moms and dads. We'd all come to perform, as this was a community theatre staging of Mamma Mia!
Our show was born out of the bubbled-over jealousy of one former drama queen as she watched her seven-year-old perform in yet another musical. She had a strong conviction that we, as parents, should be able to be on stage, too. The calls went out and a ragtag group with pockets full of different reasons arrived.
I'd always thought I would return to the stage after performing in theatre throughout my youth, but 20 years on Bay Street, four kids, mortgages and life had got in the way. So when the desperate call for more male actors came in the midst of the market crises, I was in desperate need of a diversion and thought, "If not now, when?"
As we gathered for our first rehearsal, most of us perfect strangers, we were completely unaware of the magic that would unfold.
On that cold winter night, we began with a few improvisational exercises and checked each other out with furtive glances. I looked around trying to assess the room. Thin, pretty Caroline had the soft voice and look of terror that surely indicated she wouldn't be back next week. Tall, bald Dr. Paul had the stilted delivery that evidenced his regret over not being able to say no. I estimated we would lose five or six of our 25 as the awkwardness intensified during our solos and some of the first voices warbled with timid fragility.
But as the auditions wore on, my optimism soared as others sang with voices clearly trained and pure. This was a group with promise, and I felt that moment of innocent joy I remembered from my youth: the Andy Hardy, "Let's put on a show!" moment.
As we assembled every Wednesday evening, doubt started to be overtaken by laughter and camaraderie. To my surprise, everyone returned as curiosity trumped trepidation. Our amazing director cast us perfectly. I didn't realize it but I was Harry Bright.
We learned exits and entrances, stage left and right, spacing, acting and reacting. We struggled to memorize dance steps only to find that when singing was added, we were once again hopelessly lost. We were often plagued by self-doubt but as the weeks passed an extraordinary chemistry started to happen - in short, we became a cast. We didn't know a lot about each other outside those walls but what we shared within them was special.
As opening night approached, we at times felt excited and ready and at others amateurish and ill-prepared. A fear set in that we would live up to the expectations of our teenage children, who were only coming to say "I told you so" after watching us fall flat on our faces. We had no choice but to make it work, though. Our director, who if she ever had a single moment of doubt refused to show us, pulled us through by her sheer will, talent and optimism.
The feeling on opening night for any actor is indescribable. The roar of the greasepaint reaches a crescendo. Our hard work and sweat was now about to be on display. Other than at a wedding, it would be hard to imagine a more partisan crowd: spouses, children, parents and friends all curious to see the result of all the hours we spent away from them.
We held hands in a circle at centre stage an hour before curtain. I'm not sure there is a way other than theatre to feel that close to a group of people whom you have only known for three months. We were ready.
And when the lights went on, we rose to the occasion as we secretly knew we would. There were dropped cues, flubbed lines and flat notes but, most of all, joy and brilliance. The real thrill of live theatre comes in the surprises - watching Caroline hit a note during Super Trouper in a voice that had been hidden from us (and herself) during the past 14 weeks; or the scene-stealing comedic genius of Dr. Paul, who had somehow, over the past few months, become an actor.
All of our efforts were rewarded by a standing ovation from a proud audience. Those smiling faces are truly why we did it: to not only test ourselves but to set an example for our children and pay a debt of gratitude to our parents. Theatre has a unique way of stripping away all that you have built up in your life and putting you out there with nothing to protect you but the strength of your own character.
As the Dancing Queen lyrics faded, the curtain went down and the last bows of the encore finished, we drifted back to the wings with a feeling of exhilaration, but also sadness. We live out most of our lives there - in the wings. Our moments in the spotlight are precious few and fleeting. Whether we care to admit it or not, we all need recognition for what we do. Ironically, it comes more freely from an audience than those closest to us. While the cast will inevitably see one another at soccer pitches, in supermarket lineups or the local coffee shop, we know it will never feel quite the same as opening night.
The real reason I performed may have been best summed up in the cheesy lyrics of ABBA themselves: "What would life be, Without a song or a dance what are we?"
So to all of you, thank you for the music - for giving it to me.
Kevin Sullivan lives in Toronto.

Full text:   Outspoken councillor's focus on taxes and city debt strikes chord with voters, poll shows
A new poll has revealed a tight two-horse race for Toronto's mayoral office: Outspoken councillor Rob Ford has emerged as a key challenger to long-time front-runner George Smitherman, thanks to Mr. Ford's focus on such hot-button issues as taxes and the city's ballooning debt, which are top-of-mind for Toronto voters.
A new Globe and Mail/CTV/CP24/Nanos poll puts Mr. Ford in first place, edging out Mr. Smitherman, who left his provincial post as deputy premier and energy infrastructure minister to run. The lead, however, is quite slim - 17.8 per cent of the 1,000 Torontonians polled said they would vote for Mr. Ford if the election were held immediately, compared with 15.9 per cent for Mr. Smitherman - and well within the margin of error of 3.1 per cent, 19 times out of 20.
The poll also revealed an electorate dissatisfied with the status quo and overwhelmingly concerned about taxes, transit and the city's ability to manage its debt - issues that align with Mr. Ford's single-minded campaign. He has pledged to cut council in half, from 44 councillors to 22, and to trim municipal fat such as the jobs of plant waterers at City Hall - an example he repeatedly brings up as indicative of the city's profligacy.
"The only poll that matters to me is on Monday, Oct. 25," Mr. Ford said Sunday afternoon. "[But] our message is resonating with people. People are sick and tired of spending down at City Hall, and when I'm mayor, I'm going to get control of the spending. And that's the first and foremost priority. ... Someone has to lead by example."
When voters were asked what issue they think is the most pressing, money came first: 20.5 per cent named the city's budget and debt; another 16.7 per cent named high taxes.
Stefan Baranski, George Smitherman's spokesman, said the poll results are a "wakeup call."
"It's clear we need to do a better job of sharing [Mr. Smitherman's] vision with voters, and that is exactly what we will be doing. This is shaping up to be a two-horse race, and with Mr. Ford now as the front-runner, we expect he will face the scrutiny his views and record deserve."
The poll results expose deep fissures between different areas of Toronto: While Mr. Ford garnered a commanding lead (27.6 per cent) in Etobicoke and came out ahead in North York and Scarborough, in pre-amalgamation Toronto he polled well behind both Joe Pantalone and Mr. Smitherman: 12.9 per cent named him as their first choice, compared with 22.1 for Mr. Smitherman and 14.9 per cent for Mr. Pantalone.
He also trailed in support from women and younger voters - segments of the population Ryerson University politics professor Myer Siemiatycki said are more likely to be leery of the bombastic and often controversial councillor. Mr. Ford has come under fire for his comments about homosexuality and HIV/AIDS; last month city council formally reprimanded him for revealing confidential real-estate information on talk radio and at council.
But in a campaign without an incumbent, Mr. Ford appears to have tapped into the concerns of a financially anxious electorate on the heels of the deepest recession in decades.
"There's a perception that things aren't working," said Prof. Siemiatycki. "The candidate who is the loudest and most forceful with an alternate expression of how they will make it better for residents of Toronto is going to resonate. ... It's kind of an echo of the Tea Party phenomenon in the U.S.: Voters are grumpy; they want a politician who is going to be an anti-politician."
Mr. Ford appears to have also tapped into an insular anxiety, and the divide between Toronto's core and its outer reaches: A dozen years after amalgamation, many voters outside the city core have the sense their local views aren't being heard. Mr. Ford has pledged to make the concerns of individual neighbourhoods and their residents paramount, putting them ahead of broader, citywide desires emanating from City Hall.
But, Nik Nanos points out, while Mr. Ford seems to have hit voters' fiscal responsibility concerns right on the money, he has yet to come through on the other dominant campaign issue: transit. He has yet to unveil a comprehensive transit platform, an issue that 16.4 per cent of voters said is in dire need of attention.
"The polling suggests no one can avoid that issue," Mr. Nanos said. "Although [Mr. Ford] might look strong on fiscal issues, having a weak transit plan would seriously affect his campaign in a negative way. ... It's relatively easy for any politician to stand up and say they're going to control costs. But when there's another public policy priority that actually requires money, that's a completely different story."
Although Mr. Ford is now neck-and-neck with Mr. Smitherman, 38.9 per cent of voters polled are still undecided. That level of indecision isn't unusual this early in a municipal race, Mr. Nanos said, but it means the campaign is still anyone's to lose.
The test now is who can win the biggest share of the undecided voters. "The fact that we have such a high percentage of undecided would mean that any of the candidates can grow at this point," Mr. Nanos said. "On election day, the percentage of undecided will be zero."
***
Who's ahead
If the election for mayor of Toronto were held today, tell me your first and second choice from the following list of six candidates
Rob Ford: 17.8%
George Smitherman: 15.9%
Joe Pantalone: 10.1%
Rocco Rossi: 9%
Sarah Thomson: 5.8%
Giorgio Mammoliti: 2.5%
Unsure: 38.9%
The margin of accuracy for the decided subsample of 611 likely municipal voters would be 4.0 percentage points, plus or minus, 19 times out of 20.

Gauging the economic ripple effect of the Gulf oil spill

Full text:   A Florida economist predicts that the impact of the environmental disaster on his state's economy could be as devastating as the fallout from the financial crisis
Florida economist Sean Snaith has crunched some numbers on what BP's oil spill could mean to his state's economy, and they're awful.
The fourth-largest economy in the U.S. was already staggering under a 12-per-cent unemployment rate and a recession that started earlier and ended later than in the rest of the country. A hit of even 10 per cent to Florida's tourism and leisure coastal industry would mean 39,000 lost jobs and $2.2-billion (U.S.) losses in spending.
Professor Snaith, director of the Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida, can't even think about the impact should currents take the spill further around the peninsula to the Atlantic coast, as some oceanographers are now warning.
"That's the true nightmare scenario. I'm too scared to even think about that," Prof. Snaith said from Orlando. If it does hit both coasts, "it could be in the same arena as the housing boom and bust."
It's too early to discern the full economic impact the worst oil spill in U.S. history will have on local and regional economies. No one knows how long the spill will last, or the full extent of the damage. The coming hurricane season adds another variable. But that's not stopping economists from crunching numbers.
One thing is certain: Gulf towns have already been hit. Real-estate owners are worried about property prices. Hotels are fielding cancellations. Fishermen are collecting food stamps.
The ripple effects go well beyond the coastal communities. Nathaniel Karp, chief U.S. economist for BBVA Compass, a Birmingham, Ala.-based bank, now pegs the direct economic cost of the spill at $11.5-billion, which includes hits to commercial and recreational fishing, oil and tourism in parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.
That price tag is a steep increase from a month ago, when he calculated the impact at $4.3-billion.
"Considering that some regions in these states are recovering from the real-estate meltdown, the direct and indirect economic consequences could be dire," he said in a report.
Some economists are comparing the BP oil spill with the 1979 accident at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island, which helped stall growth in nuclear power generation and led to dozens of plant closings.
"Further out, there could be more material consequences," said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, in a recent report entitled, "Spillonomics."
Deepwater production accounted for almost half of the increase in oil output over the past decade. Beyond the current moratorium, outright bans, or higher costs from tighter regulations could have a direct impact on this type of oil production just as output is stagnating or falling.
Suddenly, he added, Canada's controversial oil sands are looking "a shade greener, both environmentally, and by extension, economically."

Full text:   Sweating through their suits behind a podium set a few hundred feet above the staggering coastline that is this city's best asset, a group of business and political leaders attempted to sell Jacmel over the weekend.
Their pitch: the opportunity to help shape this underdog Haitian city into a true tourist paradise. The offer drew such an unprecedented mass of potential investors - abut 80 foreigners travelled from Port-au-Prince to hear it - that many were forced to sleep three to a room in sold-out hotels, an inconvenience softened by a late-night dance show and a steady supply of Prestige, Haiti's national beer.
The event, attended by the city's top politicians, was part of Jacmel's ongoing mission to force the decentralization of post-earthquake investment by wooing business people away from Haiti's overrun capital and onto the shores of what was once the country's top tourist destination. It was also a small power play on the part of local politicians frustrated by the fact that the reconstruction of Jacmel, a city many would argue is Haiti's most precious cultural gem, is not a national priority.
"We hope bringing investors here will make the central government aware that Haiti and the diaspora care about Jacmel," Mayor Edo Zenny said in a speech.
He did not articulate the deep fears among leaders here that without private investment, the city will never be rebuilt. In Port-au-Prince, there is still much wrangling over which of the decimated government departments are to oversee urban planning, zoning and mapping the future of collapsed cities.
However, Patrick Delatour, the national Minister of Tourism, was frank about the grim outlook. It will take the government 10 to 20 years to return Haiti's tourism sector to its pre-earthquake state, he said. One quarter of the nation's international-standard hotel rooms - 500 in total - were destroyed on Jan. 12. Investors should see that dearth as an opportunity, he said.
"It's about time people start investing in hotels in this country," he said, adding: "We need a partnership between the public and private sector to plan the reconstruction."
To ease the minds of daunted investors - and to inspire some to take more than baby steps in Jacmel - Lesly Kernisant, a Haitian-born doctor who chairs the Societé Immobilière d'Agriculture, de Commerce et de Tourisme, a group of 51 New York-based shareholders with a range of investments in Haiti, presented an ambitious real-estate project his group is pushing forward.
"I was able to convince my colleagues, let's remove our money from Wall Street and put it on Main Street Haiti," Dr. Kernisant said.
Already the owners of the Cap Lamandou, an oceanfront hotel in Jacmel that is the most luxurious in southern Haiti, SIMACT is planning the construction of a new $25-million gated residential and hotel complex on a 24-acre seaside plot just outside of Jacmel. Called Belle Rive, the country club-esque complex is to feature a 120-room luxury hotel and 94 condominiums, a private marina, health spa and movie theatre. Its target buyers, Dr. Kernisant said, are not only tourists in search of an exotic locale, but "Haitian baby-boomers" who have spent their professional lives in Canada and the United States and can afford what is sure to be a steep price tag.
"They're the ones whose retirement portfolios are very full," he said. "If you were to offer them a condo on the shores of Boca Raton [Florida] or Jacmel, the choice is simple."
Shovels at Belle Rive will hit the ground as soon as SIMACT raises sufficient financing for construction, which may not take long now that Haiti has the attention of investors, Dr. Kernisant said.
"The earthquake had the paradoxical effect of making Haiti a place people are now looking to invest," he said.

Full text:   Graeme Smith visits the front lines as India's biggest city struggles to house its burgeoning population without destroying the coastal mangroves so vital to its future health and safety
The boss wears dark glasses and won't give his name, as his bodyguards throw themselves in front of any camera pointed his way. As he sits in the shade, with his dress shirt unbuttoned to reveal his gold chains and oiled skin, his work crews destroy a patch of wilderness at the edge of India's biggest city.
Dump trucks rumble into the mangroves and bury the leafy thickets under loads of dirt, slowly transforming the green belt along Mumbai's coast into real estate.
India's laws are supposed to protect these forests, restricting development to maintain a buffer against the sea. But just as coastal cities around the world are bracing against rising water levels, Mumbai is losing its natural defences. Environmentalists file legal challenges, but they're losing: In recent years, construction projects have devoured an estimated two-thirds of the city's mangroves.
The failure to save the mangroves serves as a stark example of what happens when the needs of a growing population - that of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region is currently estimated to be about 20 million - overwhelm plans for sustainability. The case also may prove to be a harbinger of future struggles over land use, as India's crowded cities grow by half a billion people in the coming generation.
"It's like committing suicide," says Debi Goenka, executive trustee for the Conservation Action Trust. "There's no place for the city to expand any more. We've reached the choking point."
POLLUTION SPONGE
Developers have a proud history of dumping fill into the Arabian Sea to expand the city. In the 18th and 19th centuries, British engineers transformed an archipelago of seven islands into a peninsula to create the thriving port of Bombay. Speculators bought real estate before it existed, staking claims to patches of water where Mumbai's skyscrapers now stand.
But the modern controversy over coastal development has little in common with that feat of engineering, Mr. Goenka says, because Mumbai now depends on the dense vegetation that grows in the salty mud flats along the coast.
Mangroves absorb the city's pollution, offsetting carbon emissions and improving air quality. They are spawning grounds for fish, and the interlocking root systems serve as a barrier against erosion.
That green belt has suffered as Mumbai swells into a megacity and developers seek alternatives to building in the distant suburbs.
Hemmed in on the north by the huge Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the city has few options for expansion.
Developers could mitigate the environmental concerns by replanting mangroves and shoring up the coastline against the rising ocean. But urban-planning experts complain that such precautions are usually overlooked - despite disasters such as the Asian tsunami of 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which illustrated the need for natural barriers along the coast. Just last month, 70,000 people were moved as a major cyclone reached India's southern shores.
A major reason for the haphazard pattern of development in Mumbai is corruption, says Shirish Patel, a consultant and urban-planning specialist.
"The Bombay mafia was heavily into smuggling, but they moved into filmmaking and real estate," he alleges.
In a recent research paper, Liza Weinstein, a sociologist now at Northeastern University in Boston, concluded that, although Mumbai's crime syndicates have moved into slum and squatter settlements, most major developers do not have criminal connections.
She suggests that the "rather flippant use of the term 'land mafia' by media and housing-rights advocates" has created a false impression.
It may seem strange, but slums can offer staggering rewards no matter who builds them. Rent here is steep, even for a tin-roofed shack. In the Dahisar neighbourhood on the western edge of the city, a residents association lobbying to protect 175 hectares of mangroves estimates the swampy tract could be worth hundreds of millions if turned into a shantytown.
The property owner has permission to repair a facility for extracting salt from sea water that was abandoned in the early 1990s, along with a court order to "take necessary care not to disturb mangroves and vegetation."
But environmentalists claim the real goal is to clear land for residential development, and lawyers acting for the owner of the land, as well as a developer allegedly linked to the project, refused repeated requests for comment.
'NO MANGROVES ARE CUT'
Even at the job site, answers are hard to come by.
Well-muscled young men who guard the property and supervise the work crews were labelled "goons" last month after they threatened and allegedly assaulted government officials, forestry specialists and environmentalists trying to inspect the property.
Greeting a team from The Globe and Mail, the guards introduce themselves and politely block entrance to the area. As their boss and several other supervisors hide their faces, they offer up a spokesman who identifies himself as John Rodrigues of the Kanderpada Salt Producers and Fishermen Union.
Local residents say they have never heard of the union, but Mr. Rodrigues insists that his group has been hired to provide security - although he claims not to know who owns the land, or even the full name of the man who pays him, in cash.
Still, he seems familiar with the environmentalists' concerns. Trucks rolling onto the property are simply part of the effort to repair roads and the existing salt facilities, he says.
"No mangroves are cut. Not a single one is cut inside. Not a single one. We have got a road here, but the road was broken by the high tides. So we have to construct the road only."
Again he insists: "Hundred per cent, none of the mangroves were cut."
When informed that his visitors have, in fact, already examined the site, arriving before the guards and photographing swaths of mangroves that appeared to have been cut recently, Mr. Rodrigues suddenly changes his story, suggesting that trespassers from slums have harvested the brush for firewood.
Environmentalists dismiss this explanation.
The nearest slum is on the far side of the mangroves and, "as you can see from these chopped branches here," says doctor and activist Mathew Peedikayil, standing in a vast clearing littered with dead vegetation, "they have all been cut with machines."
Slum dwellers, he points out, are highly unlikely to possess chainsaws.
Dr. Peedikayil, who works at a clinic nearby, is a volunteer with the New Link Road Residents Forum, a community group trying to save the mangroves. Even if the construction crews do no more than finish the road, he says, the fragile ecosystem will have its water supply choked off, killing the vegetation.
The two sides are locked in a legal battle, and last month, the Supreme Court of India referred the case back to a lower court.
There are an estimated 70 such disputes in and around Mumbai - and the legal wrangling can go on for years.
Sometimes the environmentalists' concerns result in action, as when plans for an airport near the city were modified this year to include replanting 350 hectares of mangrove.
But the gesture seemed to miss the point of coastal protection, because the plantation will be 200 kilometres north of the new airport.
In their arguments, activists often rely on the Coastal Regulation Zone rules of 1991, part of India's Environment Protection Act, which limits development along the shoreline.
The government released a draft of new CRZ rules in April after a five-year review process, but environmentalists say they are skeptical about whether the updated regulations represent a step forward.
"It's a mixed bag," says Ashish Fernandes, an oceans campaigner for Greenpeace India. "The laws already exist, in many cases, but the big problem is enforcement."
PRESSURE TO GET WORSE
Upholding the rules that limit development will only get harder in India's cities, urban planners say, because of the overwhelming demands created by millions of new arrivals.
India now has 300 million people living in cities, a number projected to almost triple to 800 million by 2051. That growth, says Edgar Ribeiro, the country's former chief planner, will be concentrated in the biggest centres, such as Mumbai.
"It's a rush from rural India and small-town India to the megacities," says Mr. Ribeiro, who now freelances as a consultant.
"I can understand the environmentalists saying the mangroves have to be protected, but I can at the same time understand that the very poor, through a slum landlord, searching" for a place to live.
"The haves and the have-nots," he concludes, "are fighting for space."

Full text:   Tom Bradley is president of Steadyhand Investment Funds tbradley@steadyhand.com
We're starting to see stories about a softening real estate market in Canada. Listings are up, sales are down, and even the always bullish industry executives are predicting lower prices in the coming year.
It reminded me of a quote I saw recently: "Real estate is the drunk driver on the economic highway." This statement, attributed to Tom Barrack, CEO of real estate investor Colony Capital, speaks to the fact that residential real estate can be volatile. Yet that same volatility highlights why it can be fertile ground for a disciplined, patient investor. There are a number of reasons for this.
First off, it's cyclical in the best way - the cycles are generally long while memories are always short. For an investor willing to take a longer view, this is a good thing.
Second, real estate is a topic that produces lots of "armchair" experts. Despite a lack of rigorous analysis, views are strongly held and overconfidence is rampant. Again, this is good for someone who is less entrenched and has a broader perspective.
The third reason is that buying decisions are often steeped in emotion ("It's perfect. I have to have it!"), and based on non-economic factors ("The baby will be here soon."). Music to an investor's ears.
And finally, houses are easy to borrow against. Thus, the potential for overindulgence.
Nonetheless, there are reasons why I don't invest in real estate beyond my personal needs. For one, I have a day job, and this type of investing is time intensive. It also doesn't help that transaction costs are extremely high, and there are significant carrying costs. Both have to be factored into the investment return.
But if I did have time and could find the equivalent of a discount broker, many of the rules I use for investing in stocks would apply.
Oh so sensitive
Because leverage is involved, real estate prices are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Purchases are often financed up to 90 per cent with debt, so mortgage payments are a key factor in determining prices.
For almost 30 years, we've been in a bull market for interest rates and with every tick down, property values have gone up. Given that we are somewhere near the end of the rate declines, investors have to recognize that a huge tail wind is swinging around.
After such a long up trend, it's easy to forget that residential real estate is cyclical. And as with all cycles, there is only one thing that's easy to predict - the farther prices stray from their fundamental value, the bigger the downturn will be. If you think back to periods when prices were rising at a mind-blowing rate, there was always an equally astonishing decline to follow.
House owners deploy a strategy that is at the core of hedge fund investing - buy long-term assets with short-term financing. The strategy dials up the investment's return potential, both on the upside and downside. In the case of a house, if rates stay low and prices rise, it's a beautiful thing. If financing costs rise and cause prices to fall, however, it's not so good.
When people tell you that their house has been their best investment, they are undoubtedly telling you the truth. But it's not because prices have gone up more than the stock market over long periods of time, it's because a house investment is highly levered. And the math is powerful. When a $400,000 house bought with $100,000 of equity goes up 25 per cent, the value of the equity doubles. As Americans found out in recent years, however, high gearing works both ways.
Fundamentals matter
(eventually)
Ultimately it comes back to valuation. Prices have to make sense in the context of the local economy. Do income levels support the price levels? Do people want to live there, and are more coming? Are the demographics going to help or hurt in the future? And what are apartment rents and vacancies doing?
If the continuing income from a real estate investment is barely covering expenses, and the long-term supply and demand outlook doesn't justify current prices, then I am flat out speculating. When I'm ready to sell, I'm betting a greater fool will pay me an even more uneconomic price.
When I apply my investing skills and experience to the Canadian real estate market, I see a super cycle coming to an end. By plugging low interest rates into mortgage calculators, prices have been driven higher. But rents are coming down. After-tax incomes are likely to be under pressure in the post-stimulation era. And it doesn't feel like the right time to be adding leverage to a portfolio.
Regardless of what happens, when it comes to real estate, I always want to be the designated driver. That means being be opportunistic, patient, well-financed and stone cold sober.

Full text:   Stone house dating from 1893 the centrepiece of a rural estate on 100 acres
45829 HOWICK-TURNBERRY RD., CLIFFORD, ONT.
WHAT: A restored circa 1893 stone farmhouse on 100 rolling acres in Wellington County. The house has four bedrooms and two bathrooms in 2,500 square feet of living space.
ASKING PRICE: $699,900
TAXES: Not available
AGENTS: Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd. (Brad Douglas)
and Royal LePage RCR Realty (Matthew Bennett-Monty)
When Stefanie and Mitchell Clark set out across their fields towards the hardwood bush and criss-crossing streams, they enjoy imagining the lives of the earliest farmers to settle on the land near Clifford, Ont.
Two of the early occupants were Christian and Mary Gadke. Born in Germany, they were among the many immigrants to move into south-western Ontario from that country. After arriving in Canada in 1859, the couple settled on this farm in Howick in 1863.
The Gadkes, who had 10 children, likely farmed a mix of crops and kept cows, sheep and draught horses, says Mr. Clark.
Even today, the road does not attract much traffic. With the large Amish community in the area, the Clarks are as likely to see a horse-and-buggy pass by as a car or truck.
"It must have been a very, very sleepy road," says Ms. Clark.
Eventually the Zimmermans took over the land from the Gadkes. Descendants of both families still live in the area.
For the Clarks, arriving at 45829 Howick-Turnberry Rd. marked the end of a lengthy search.
"We had looked for 4 years, every day on the internet," says Ms. Clark of their decision to leave Guelph, Ont. and seek out a more bucolic setting. "We just fell in love with the house and property."
The Gadkes erected a barn in 1890 and built the house in 1893. Only the foundation of the original bank barn remains but the house, with walls built of cut granite, has been restored and renovated.
Even today, the Clarks still come across large chunks of granite on the land.
Inside, the former summer kitchen has been transformed into a large kitchen that blends new appliances with cherry cabinets and open shelves. Two antique wall cabinets have the old-fashioned barrel-shaped drawers which were once used for storing flour.
"We really wanted to work around them," says Ms. Clark. "And I love buying antiques so we put in antique lighting."
A bit of the home's heritage remains in the Findlay Oval cook stove made in the area by Elmira Stoveworks. The Clarks have made the stove part of the decor and use the compartments for storing spices, but they do their cooking on a stainless-steel range.
At the rear of the house, the original wood shed with a vaulted ceiling has been made into a great room. The house was unusual for its time, Mr. Clark says, in that the walls of the summer kitchen and wood shed were also built from stone. In most cases, those structures were less substantial than the rest of the house and eventually tumbled down.
As in many homes in the area, the stone work was done by masons who had emigrated from Scotland.
The great room is cozy in winter with a wood stove, new windows and heated floors.
The original main floor of the house has been reconfigured to include a dining room, sitting room and bathroom. Upstairs, the original three bedrooms with their wide-plank floors remain. A new master bedroom above the kitchen overlooks the great room.
The geothermal heating and cooling system uses water on the property. It's highly-efficient and allows the Clarks to extract every little bit of heat they can for such functions as warming the floors.
"It helps cut down on cost and makes the system more environmentally-friendly," says Mr. Clark. "A lot of thought and effort went into designing the system."
The telecommunications system in the area is run by Clifford-based Wightman Telecom, which was started by local farmer Robert Wightman in 1908. According to the company's web site, Mr. Wightman was frustrated that Bell wouldn't provide service to his farm, so he strung up lines between his property and his neighbours' farms.
The family-run business still operates today and provides high-speed services to the most rural of properties.
"We all get high-speed internet out here," says Mr. Clark, who uses the service to work at home for an employer in Toronto.
Outside, the house has a covered verandah at the front and patios on the sides facing east and west.
"We really enjoy the views," says Ms. Clark, gesturing towards the tall maples and undulating meadows.
Perennial gardens explode with flowers in the spring and summer, says Mr. Clark.
The property has approximately 56 acres of farmer's fields and 44 acres of bush. A neighbouring farmer rents the fields for growing crops such as soybeans, oats and hay.
"He always wins ribbons for his soybeans so we're proud of that," says Ms. Clark.
A large wooden shed built into the hill now serves as the barn and a place to store farm equipment. Above ground, a previous owner transformed the building into an art studio and workshop.
At one time, all sorts of farm tasks would have been done in the shed, which still has an original wheel and hardware.
"There's been a lot of activity going on," Mr. Clark says of the room and its many uses in previous decades.
Mr. Clark notes the struggle that many small farms across Canada face in the current business climate but many farm families in the area adhere to tradition.
People in the area get to know which farms sell eggs, honey, quilts or vegetables. Some farmers also earn money from a craft such as making rope or reclaiming barn board. Just down the road from the Clark's farm, an Amish market sells fresh produce.
"This is the heartland of Ontario. This is real agricultural land," says Mr. Clark. There's a lot of will and grit around here."

Abstract: In 1939, [Helena Kojder]'s life was shattered by war. Her husband was brought home wounded and shortly afterward the family was deported to Siberia, to Stalin's slave labour camps. Helena was 20. Her year-old baby died of typhus a few weeks later. She suffered night blindness from starvation. The work in the forests was backbreaking.

Full text:   Wife, mother, refugee, nurse, immigrant. Born Sept. 27, 1919, in Rozdzalow, Poland. Died Nov. 15, 2009, in North Battleford, Sask., of Alzheimer's disease, aged 90.
Helena Kojder was a survivor. War only changed her dream of being a midwife to that of becoming a nurse.
The eldest of three children of Maria and Jan Beznowski, Helena was 6 when her father left for Canada. That's when she learned she had to fight the bullies in school herself. It helped that she was a tomboy.
Helena learned ear candling, cupping and other skills from local healers. At 16, she married Franciszek Kojder. The couple attempted to come to Canada but were unsuccessful because of the Depression. At 19, Helena had a baby girl.
In 1939, Helena's life was shattered by war. Her husband was brought home wounded and shortly afterward the family was deported to Siberia, to Stalin's slave labour camps. Helena was 20. Her year-old baby died of typhus a few weeks later. She suffered night blindness from starvation. The work in the forests was backbreaking.
When the Poles received amnesty, Helena's family made its way south through Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Twenty-four relatives didn't survive. Once the men were in the Polish army under British command in the Middle East, Helena became the leader in the group of women left behind. She lived by her wits, travelling without tickets on the train while being hidden by Jews.
In 1943, Helena began her career as a nurse, first with the Red Cross in Tehran and then in Ahwaz, Persia. She started teaching herself English. After working in a refugee camp in Karachi, she moved to a camp for orphans near Jamnagar, India, and finally a hospital in Bombay.
After the war, Helena was reunited with her husband in England. In 1948, two weeks after her arrival in Canada, her second daughter was born. In North Battleford, Sask., Helena worked at the Notre Dame Hospital until retiring in 1984.
Helena's strength kept her going when she became a widow at 49 with the death of her husband in a work-related accident and, five years later, the death of her beloved mother, who had lived with the family. A pulmonary embolism kept Helena off work for only a year.
She learned yoga and reflexology and, upon retirement, swimming. She walked and cycled everywhere. She even had time to manage a small real-estate business. Her natural curiosity led her to read the English literature that her daughter studied at university and to expand her large vegetable garden to include, among others, Chinese greens, kale and basil for her pesto.
Helena was cared for at home by her daughter for the last nine years of her life. The last memories she spoke of were the saddest, Stalin's gulags, and the happiest, her life in India.
Apolonja (Pola) Kojder is Helena's daughter.

Full text:   The Stratford home of Festival director Des McAnuff puts the spotlight on relaxed living
For Des McAnuff, home is a refuge from the demanding directorial duties that keep him hopping at least six days a week, often between continents.
The artistic director of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival and the multiple-award-winning director of the hit musical Jersey Boys , which has grossed over $800-million and been seen by more than seven million people worldwide, doesn't get much down time, but when he does he loves to be at home.
These days, that's a spectacular, remodelled 4,000-square-foot house in Stratford, Ont., overlooking the Avon River across from the Festival Theatre. He and his partner, Bryna McCann, spend half the year in their Stratford home; the rest of the year they split between their Lower Manhattan loft and travelling.
"The house and the apartment in New York are sanctuaries for us," says McAnuff. "I do work very hard and so does Bryna, so they're the oases in our lives. We put a lot of thought, work and resources into our home environment because we can control that. The rest of our lives seem very chaotic and anarchic at times. It's a great pleasure to be able to control a small piece."
McAnuff became artistic director of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in 2008. Born in Illinois, he grew up in Guelph and Scarborough and went to Ryerson University to study theatre before launching into a career as a composer and lyricist, eventually moving on to playwriting and directing. The flamboyant and prolific award-winning writer and director has a list of credits as long as your arm.
At first, the couple rented in Stratford. But one day while out jogging, McAnuff spotted a house he liked on one of the city's most beautiful streets. It hit a chord. He thought it might be the time to buy. Excited, he called McCann in New York. The trouble was when she arrived in Stratford, he couldn't find the house again. He called local real estate agent Annette Vyge and explained they were hoping to buy a house along the river. She took them to see one that was available, and as it happened it was the same house McAnuff had been drawn to, although no for-sale sign had been posted.
"It was meant to be," says McAnuff. "Bryna claims I had some kind of vision for this house - and I did."
They bought the house in 2008 for $1.1-million and began remodelling immediately. Most of the work was done while they were away, which meant they weren't around for the mess but also not around to oversee the process. They moved into the house in March, 2009, and everything had turned out beautifully. They were thrilled with the work done by Stratford's Belliveau Construction and local tradespeople. And there was lots of it.
McAnuff and McCann changed almost everything - from the doorknobs and floors to the doors and cabinets. With help from Stratford-based architect Terry Marklevitz, they also reconfigured the house and put on an addition. The interior, which had been painted five different colours, was repainted a creamy white throughout. The main arched entrance over the front door was also completely redesigned and the hall ceiling raised. "It looked like someone had punched the house in the nose," says McAnuff, who had the arch replaced with a peaked roof, inside of which is a brilliant red, stained-glass maple leaf he commissioned.
Everything is spread out on one floor and there's no basement. The house is spacious, modern, elegant and teeming with natural light no matter which room you're in. It's also very open-concept. Because of that, say McCann, "it's a great house for entertaining." The couple estimate they spent about $300,000 remodelling and landscaping the three-bedroom, three-bathroom building, which sits on a half-acre of prime real estate. One of those bedrooms is used whenever McAnuff's 85-year-old mother or his 19-year-old daughter come to visit.
The great room in the house consists of an enormous ultra-modern, state-of-the-art kitchen, dining area and a large living room, where McAnuff keeps his grand piano and five of his guitars. An accomplished musician, he often spends some of his down time making music. It's one of the talents explored in a recently released documentary about his life called Des McAnuff: A Life in Stages .
McAnuff and McCann's taste for art and Art Deco adds to the overall elegance of the house. In the hall is a Deco chair by the late Donald Deskey, one of America's leading interior and industrial designers and the man who designed the interior of Radio City Music Hall in New York. The enormous, glistening dining room table is also distinctly Deco, as are various dressing room pieces, tables and chairs elsewhere in the house. The artwork is bold, colourful and mostly contemporary. Much of it is a reflection of McAnuff's theatre life, his family life and the past. There's a stunningly realistic painting in the living room, by local artist John Gould, of a jar of Robertson's marmalade (it was McAnuff's father's favourite preserve). There's a poster from The Who's Tommy and Billy Crystal's 700 Sundays, both of which he directed, and a poster from Troll , which he wrote very early in his career.
His favourite painting (an image of giants red lips) hangs over the piano. Entitled Lagos - In the Beginning was the Word , it was painted in 1946 by artist, designer and illustrator Eric Aldwinkle, who was also the festival's first promotional art director. McAnuff's mother bought the painting from Aldwinkle but gave it to McAnuff because he loved it so much. He claims he designed their entire living room around it.
Sitting at the dining room table before heading off to Toronto for a screening of the new documentary, McAnuff points out a rusty-orange rug in the living room, which they bought from their favourite rug dealer in New York. "This is the one thing that makes us look like design geniuses," he says. "We put in these three maples out front - two sugars and a northern maple - and in October that little sugar turned exactly the same colour as this rug - exactly. It took my breath away. For about three weeks it really looked like we knew what we're doing, but it was total luck."
The couple also filled in the swimming pool, replaced it with a hot tub and re-landscaped, which included adding a pond and cascading waterfall. "Bryna has a green thumb so she had a big hand in designing the outdoor space," says McAnuff, who enjoys feeding the birds and squirrels. "Bryna accuses me of being Dr. Doolittle."
McCann, who met McAnuff in New York and is originally from Long Island, is a former massage therapist and fit model, meaning she posed for fashion designers so they could check the fit of their clothes. She was so much in demand it left little time to be with McAnuff so she gave it up. She's now studying the Alexander Technique, a method of changing movement habits to discover a new balance in the body and release unnecessary tension.
It's a big change living half the year in Stratford, a small city of roughly 30,000 people surrounded by farmland. While McAnuff is undoubtedly more used to places like New York, and London, Stratford is a natural fit. "For a theatre professional, this is Mecca," he says. "Stratford is certainly the most important of the resident theatres in North America and really became the role model for many other theatres.
"It's also in my blood, because I was a student of John Hirsch [former artistic director] and Michael Langham, who hired me to teach at Juilliard when I was just 28. [Langham was also an artistic director and former director of New York's Juilliard performing arts school.] So I feel like I'm part of this great continuum and I want to keep their work alive and moving forward - and those of course are the main reasons for being here."

Full text:   Montreal's Corus has already reached an agreement with Cogeco Cable
MEDIA REPORTER
A new set of bidders - with a very old name in Montreal media - has made an offer for the Quebec radio stations owned by Corus Entertainment Inc.
At the end of April, Corus announced it had an agreement to sell 11 of its 12 stations in that province to cable company Cogeco Cable Inc., to allow it to expand its radio offerings and compete with the largest radio broadcaster in Canada, Astral Media Inc. Cogeco's purchase is awaiting regulatory approval.
Tuesday, a new offer for the stable of radio stations was put forward by former Montreal city councillor and real estate agent Nicolas Tetrault, and Paul Tietolman, the son of a pioneer in the radio business in Montreal.
But in a statement Tuesday, Corus said the stations are no longer up for grabs: "Corus has entered into a binding agreement with Cogeco which is subject only to the usual regulatory approvals. Therefore we are not in a position to consider any other offers at this time."
Even still, the partners are proposing to buy all 12 of Corus' Quebec stations for $81-million; an increase of $1-million over Cogeco's offer. The stations would be operated under a new private company, Tietolman Tetrault Media.
Mr. Tietolman's father Jack operated two local radio stations for about 50 years before selling them to Metromedia CMR Inc. in the early 1990s. Those stations were later sold to Corus.
"Paul was born in the radio industry," Mr. Tetrault said. "I have the kind of contacts we need. He has a tremendous background in media ... Our plan is really clear, we know what we want to do with all the stations."
The new offer would include the purchase of an FM station in Saguenay, which was left out of the Cogeco deal and remains for sale. The pair have also offered to buy all of the equipment at two AM stations that Corus closed earlier this year, as long as the federal broadcast regulator approves Tietolman-Tetrault taking over the licenses to operate those stations as well.
When the deal with Cogeco was announced, Corus president and CEO John Cassaday said the company wanted to focus on its specialty television business, which includes channels such as W Network, Treehouse and HBO Canada, as well as its 38 radio stations in Ontario and Western Canada.
"We have a binding agreement ... both parties are pretty pleased with that agreement," said Cogeco spokesperson Marie Carrier. "After [the CRTC's] approval, we will be operating those stations. That's all."

Thank God for Frank. What would we do without him?

Abstract: So we turn to [Frank Stronach] as our best hope. And boy, has he delivered. It's The People v. Frank Stronach. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, money manager to working Canadians who don't live in Quebec, objects to Mr. Stronach's latest scheme, calling it "offensive", not to mention "excessive" and "inappropriate" and - have we forgotten anything? - oh, yes, "horrible." Maybe not as horrible as living in [Fidel Castro]'s Cuba, but you get the idea.

Full text: ddecloet@globeandmail.com
Every night at the dinner table, every business journalist in this country ought to give a toast to the continued good health of Frank Stronach, for what would corporate Canada look like without him?
A dull parade of insurance executives, bankers, oilmen and geologists, that's what, most of them highly competent, utterly uncontroversial and largely devoid of charisma. The men and women who manage Canada's biggest companies tend to conduct their lives in such a buttoned-up manner as to avoid becoming household names, no matter how embedded in the country's fabric their businesses are.
Quick, can you name the guy who runs Tim Hortons, one of the 60 largest businesses in Canada and easily one of its most-recognized brands? (It's Don Schroeder, a lawyer who apparently enjoys golf and who previously held the title of "chief compliance officer," among others.) No paparazzi are gainfully employed to follow around Canadian Tire's Stephen Wetmore or CIBC's Gerry McCaughey. The tabloids simply aren't interested - for good reason.
But there's always Frank, the chairman of Magna International, the auto parts colossus on which his fame and personal wealth are built.
He'll tweak his shareholders' noses, then poke them in the eye. He'll rant and he'll stomp and when his critics give it to him, he'll give it right back. Some years ago, after hearing someone complain that he'd been paid $58-million for a year's work, he responded: "I should get more."
He once got a hedge fund manager so upset that the manager compared Mr. Stronach's control of real estate firm MI Developments to Fidel Castro's iron rule over Cuba. (That's totally unfair. Frank Stronach is much more powerful than Fidel Castro!) A Stronach-controlled racetrack company, Magna Entertainment, built a glitzy, multimillion-dollar racetrack and gambling complex in Austria (at investors' expense), though the local market seemed small for such a grand facility. The place lost buckets of money. But it was conveniently located for a certain lover of horses who lives in the region.
That's why we love the man. Oh, the stories he generates! Journalists crave conflict, and there just isn't enough of it in Canadian business at the moment. Not a single chartered bank had the decency to blow up and collapse during the crisis. Our Finance Minister and central bank governor are now swanning around the globe, touting the merits of the Canadian way and throwing around terms like "macroprudential regulation." Worthwhile Canadian Initiative. God help us. Now we'll never be able to shed our reputation as the most boring nation in the G20.
So we turn to Frank as our best hope. And boy, has he delivered. It's The People v. Frank Stronach. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, money manager to working Canadians who don't live in Quebec, objects to Mr. Stronach's latest scheme, calling it "offensive", not to mention "excessive" and "inappropriate" and - have we forgotten anything? - oh, yes, "horrible." Maybe not as horrible as living in Castro's Cuba, but you get the idea.
In sum, and in case you haven't been following the story, Mr. Stronach has decided to listen to the shareholders who for so many years have objected to his ability to control Magna International (and extract large sums from it for himself) while owning less than 1 per cent of it. He will end this arrangement, in return for a mere $860-million or so in cash and shares, plus several more years of payments, plus control of a joint venture in electric cars that Magna would co-own.
Excessive? Yes. Offensive? Sure. Surprising? Not in the slightest, because this isn't the first time Mr. Stronach has proposed a highly complicated scheme for his own self-enrichment. Three years ago, Magna sold a stake to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. The deal was purportedly an entree into Russia's growing car market, but came with so many wrinkles and side deals (extra dividends and payments for Mr. Stronach and certain members of management) that it, too, caused a flap. But in the end, the shareholders approved it. And they might well do the same with this latest deal.
How do we know? It's just a gut feeling, because - and this might be the most fascinating thing about Frank Stronach - he almost always gets his way. Mr. Stronach is famous for stocking the Magna board with friendly directors, which helps. In this latest case, they've declined to recommend the deal to other shareholders (as they would normally do). But they won't come out and oppose it, either. Bay Street, too, has been an enabler of Mr. Stronach's antics. Privately, money managers and analysts will gripe about him - but almost always off the record. When the chips are down, very few of them speak out publicly.
Mr. Stronach has little to fear here: no matter how "egregious" the $860-million payment, a good many shareholders just want to see him gone. Unlike, say, business writers, who will mourn the end of the Stronach era.

What: A four-bedroom, eight-bathroom Southern Georgian-style residence custom built by architect Gren Weis in "Olde" Oakville. Winner in 2000 of an Oakville urban-design award by both architect Gren Weis and landscapers Mark Mulder and Rick Jesson of Bosk Environments, the house has 6,400 square feet of above-ground living space on a 100- by 225-foot lot.
Asking price: $4,499,000
Taxes: $28,015 (2009)
Agent: Great Canadian Realty, Inc. (Denis F. Bastien)
Beth Rose is the perfectly named owner of a lady-like home where flowers serve inside and out as a dominant style statement.
Tiles embossed with floral patterns line the bathrooms while a hand-painted backsplash featuring a garden scene decorates the main floor's custom-made Neff kitchen.
On the floors are custom-made runners by Dominion Rugs festooned with Georgia O'Keeffe-sized blooms and on the ceilings are ornate plaster crown mouldings with a flower motif.
Most of the furniture is covered with a floral print chintz and the walls painted in the pastel shades of spring.
"It's a lady's home," says Ms. Rose, a retired human-resources executive who built the house for herself 12 years ago.
"I am woven into the fabric, into every dish and every flower. This home is intimately connected to me. It's a reflection of who I am."
(Which is why she's now selling: There's a new man in her life and she wants now to build a dream house that better reflects the two of them as a couple.)
A self-described "cottage girl," Ms. Rose says that she wanted a home that brought the outdoors in.
Working closely with architect Gren Weis, a local architect known for the grand, classically designed houses that he has built throughout Olde Oakville, a heritage area, she requested a Georgian-style house largely because it would afford her a series of large, symmetrically placed, floor-to-ceiling windows that would allow even more flowers into the interior.
These flowers are rhododendrons and lilacs, hydrangea and, yes, roses which bloom in profusion in the gardens created out back by Bosk Environments.
An outdoor oasis of spectacular beauty and serenity, the gardens feature a stream surrounding an island with a waterfall, fish pond and in-ground granite pool.
Birds make their home here, sheltered by a lush canopy of mature trees, the majority of them planted 12 years ago after Ms. Rose clear-cut the original property to make way for what she calls her urban cottage of a home.
"I used to have a property in Muskoka but I sold it because this is where I want to spend all my time, surrounded by nature and water and that feeling of getting away from it all."
That sense of escape is enhanced by the presence of a games room and home theatre in the finished basement, as well as a sauna, exercise room and pretty in-law suite with a second kitchen and separate entrance located over a double garage: A home within a home.
It all pales in comparison to the screened-in porch with heated flagstone floors located at the rear of the house and overlooking the gardens.
Her favourite room, this is where Ms. Rose comes to really smell the roses.
"It's a grand home with a cottagey feel and it has charm," she says, inhaling deeply.
"It will be wrenching to leave."

A harvest of history at East York's Topham Park

Abstract: Even long before the poster project, Mr. [Jeremy Hopkin]'s archivist eye had spotted this unusual and nostalgic enclave.

Full text: With the help of students at a local school, a city project uncovers the history of a post-war neighbourhood
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
Can you see them? He in a pressed uniform, she in a simple, homemade wedding dress; smiles that anticipate family-focused days ahead and relief from horrors left behind. And, at the centre of it all, a tiny, tidy, saltbox of a home with a yard big enough to plant ... dreams.
Jeremy Hopkin of Think Tank Toronto can, and he's put them on a poster.
Actually, it's more than just a poster: It's a collaboration, celebration, grassroots initiative and a visual chronology of East York's Topham Park neighbourhood, a tiny part of the city that might otherwise be overlooked.
With a sweep of the eye across Mr. Hopkin's handiwork, one travels from the big picture of the Second World War and the postwar housing shortage all the way to the federal government's development of three veterans-only neighbourhoods, ending fittingly with a microcosm of family memories involving inflatable pools and baseball games in Topham Park.
Drive along St. Clair Avenue east of O'Connor Drive, and it's obvious that the street layouts and housing forms stray from the norm around Merritt Road. Here, roads break from the logic of the grid. Like parade batons, they're set at angles, with looping ends containing treeless islands of green so that children can play while mothers supervise them from front windows.
Even long before the poster project, Mr. Hopkin's archivist eye had spotted this unusual and nostalgic enclave. "You almost feel as if you're driving into an old military base," he says. "It's got a bit of an older feel to it, like you're going back in time because a lot of the houses haven't been changed too much."
Not only are many of the original 197 homes of unchanged wood-frame construction, they populate streets with names such as Warvet Crescent, Valor Boulevard and Vicross Road. When Think Tank Toronto - headed by University of Toronto professor Rafael Gomez - partnered up with Heritage Toronto on neighbourhood enhancement projects in late 2009, they jumped at the chance when offered the Topham Park project by Gary Miedema, Heritage Toronto's director of plaques and markers.
The idea to celebrate Topham Park first hit Mr. Miedema's desk via Beaches-East York Councillor Janet Davis. Ms. Davis was eager to do a local history project, and had heard from Topham Park residents about the need for commemoration of some kind. By early 2010, the councillor, Mr. Miedema and Margaret McRae of the East York Historical Society were meeting regularly with Mr. Hopkin and Prof. Gomez at the Gordon A. Brown Middle School, where teacher Sherri Walker had also become involved.
After engaging Ms. Walker's Grade 7 and 8 students with a presentation on the known history of the neighbourhood - stories about Victoria Cross winners Frederick Topham and Cecil Merritt for example - the group enlisted them to gather stories from parents and grandparents.
After that, it was time for a "history harvest" to collect even more stories, family photographs and ephemera. To promote it, Mr. Hopkin crafted a pamphlet with a cover photograph of a contemporary Topham Park home surrounded by a few ' ghosts'- a happy couple in front of a curvy 1940s automobile, a milkman on his rounds, a child on a tricycle and a Lancaster bomber flanked by a formation of Spitfires in the sky - which was stuffed into every mailbox.
On April 17, the research "crop" was harvested, including "quite a bit from the Fairbanks family who still live here," says Mr. Hopkin, a long-time volunteer at the Scarborough Historical Society.
Topham Park, it turns out, was first known as "Sunshine Valley" because of the lack of trees and a dip in the land when it was created by Wartime Housing Ltd. in 1945-46.
Two other neighbourhoods were built at the same time, one at Royal York Road and The Queensway, the other at Jane Street and Trethewey Drive known as "The Wishbone."
From the beginning, sports and recreation were the focus in Topham Park, since, as a June 1947 Globe and Mail article stated, the "more than 400 youngsters tearing about the landscape" needed structure (there was a suggested minimum of two children per household). By the 1960s, the East York Argos were "tearing" into that same landscape, albeit in a different way.
And it is exactly these not-worthy-of-official-heritage-plaque nuggets that Jeremy Hopkin enjoys featuring most. The overwhelmingly positive response when the poster was unveiled at the Brown school a few weeks ago suggests Think Tank Toronto is onto something with this deceptively simple format.
"You don't need a whole bunch of descriptive text like regular plaques do," Mr. Hopkin explains. "It does have text, but it's all within actual documents, so you feel like you're going through your grandpa's old book about the neighbourhood."
Prof. Gomez hopes this concept can be used to celebrate other neglected parts of the city: In other words, a celebration of individual moments would be a way to "see" neighbourhoods as more than just the sum of their parts.
A fond look back at the beginnings of the Topham Park Community can be viewed in the foyer of the Gordon A. Brown Middle School at 2800 St. Clair Ave. E., Toronto.

Full text: They've got millions in revenues, dozens of employees, and clients beating down their door. But the new breed of start-ups is avoiding real estate-and changing the future of work
Mob4Hire is a Calgary start-up with a global work force.
The company has assembled an army of 43,000 people worldwide who test mobile-phone software. If you've written a mobile app you think will be the next bestseller, you give it to Stephen King-Mob4Hire's CEO-and he sends it out to his testers, who are sprinkled across 150 countries and possess thousands of different handsets. They'll tell you in days whether it works well on their handsets, or whether it's riddled with bugs.
Testing phone apps is important, but it's curiously hard to do, because it's difficult to tell if an app will work the same on different versions of the same handset. "Software that runs fine on a BlackBerry 9000 might not run well on a BlackBerry 9700 or a Curve or a Pearl," King says. Things get even more difficult if you want to release a mobile app globally, because wireless carriers often have quirks in their networks that change how phone software performs. As a result, app developers are now rushing to Mob4Hire to vet their wares. After only two years in business, the start-up is testing 50 apps a month, at rates ranging from a few hundred dollars to nearly $20,000. "Growth has just been explosive," King says.
But there's one thing Mob4Hire doesn't have: a big headquarters to run the show. King's dozen full-time employees all work primarily from their homes, in Calgary and Victoria, but also further afield, in London, England. His team stays constantly in touch, using instant-messaging applications and talking on Skype, often leaving channels open for hours at a time as they work, virtually, side by side. "I liken Skype to water-cooler conversations," King says. "You can get quite distracted by it, but it's good." They also use Dimdim, a Web-based collaboration tool that lets workers share online whiteboards for sketching ideas and brainstorming.
King detests wasting his time in traffic, so he primarily runs the firm from his basement in a suburb of Calgary. Next to the big desk that holds a printer and computer is a rackful of electric guitars and a drum kit. He's recorded several albums in his spare time. ("As soon as we finish talking, I'm going to play a bit," he told me when I called him up.)
Working from home is nothing new, of course. The self-employed have been doing it for years. But with Mob4Hire, King is engaging in something different. He's running an entire global firm-a "micromultinational" as he calls it-without any serious real estate. And he is not alone: Today's start-ups increasingly delay getting an office for months or even years; they'll have double-digit employees and millions in revenues yet still be surfing from a table at Starbucks.
Going "officeless" -or nearly so-is a sea change in business attitudes. It's driven by technological and cultural shifts as the Web-literate Generations X and Y become the driving force behind entrepreneurship. The trend is so advanced that architectural experts think it will even alter the way future corporate spaces are designed, as office-free companies vault into the ranks of the Fortune 500. Are we facing the end of the office?
Decades ago, if entrepreneurs started a company with several employees who needed to collaborate daily, they pretty much had to get an office. There was no other way to achieve the level of constant communication that a firm needs, other than sitting in meetings and poking your head in your co-workers' cubicles and rooms. Collaborating with employees outside the city-or in another country-was even harder, since long-distance calling was a serious expense.
Beginning around the mid-2000s, that reality suddenly inverted. A new generation of tools began to emerge that gave start-ups free (or dirt-cheap) ways to achieve "co-presence" : a constant sense of what co-workers are doing and thinking, even when they're halfway around the world. "Status updates" -like those on Facebook, Twitter or its corporate cousin Yammer-let team members share insights and describe what they're doing, for everyone else in the firm to see. Chat tools let team members instantly ping each other with questions, and voice-over-IP software has reduced the cost of long-distance conferencing, even with video, to zero. (The birth of Skype in 2003 might be considered the single biggest driver of the officeless movement.) Other aspects of running firms that used to require major real estate-like hosting your own servers, or having an accounts-receivable and payable department-can be outsourced online with a credit card. At the same time, the financial environment pushed start-ups to be parsimonious: In the wake of the 2001 dot-com bust, venture capitalists began handing out smaller chunks of money, and the giddy, cash-out-quick IPO market was gone.
That's why software companies and online services comprised the first big wave of officeless start-ups in Canada. These industries were ripe for virtualization. One example is Aydin Mirzaee, a 25-year-old who, in 2006, founded Boknow, one of Canada's first "callback" services that let mobile-phone users get ultra-cheap long-distance rates. (Since phone plans at the time often came with unlimited free incoming calls, a user dialling China could text the number to Boknow's service, hang up and, a few minutes later, Boknow would call back, patching in a connection to the Chinese number. Presto: an international call for only pennies, with Boknow routing the number over the Internet.) At the time, Mirzaee was working full-time for Nortel, but in his spare time during the day and at night, he collaborated with two friends, who were still students at McGill, to design and program the service. "We'd spend a lot of time in Gchat" -Gmail's free chat application-hashing out problems and responding to customers and suppliers, he recalls. They closed down Boknow after two years, but a few months after he left Nortel, he started full-time-still working remotely with his Montreal colleagues-on their next firm, Fluidsurveys, a service that lets companies quickly design and deploy surveys. Today, it has 10 employees and clients in all layers of government. Mirzaee won't reveal revenue figures, but by operating so lean for so long, his firm was able to offer survey services for hundreds of dollars "that you'd normally pay $15,000 for," he estimates.
Mirzaee argues that operating officeless is a natural extension of the entrepreneur's urge, which is to move quickly and with as few costs as possible. For him, an office would have been an enormous cost that he couldn't afford; the company began without any capital financing at all, so work had to be done from dorm rooms. And it isn't just rent, he points out: Tending an office is like tending a plant, with an endless set of things that suck up time and money.
"When you get an office, you have to get an office printer, they charge you more for your Internet, the phone lines are more expensive because you're in commercial space," Mirzaee tells me. "And your employees are going to want parking spaces, and then you have to pay for the parking spaces. There's a whole bunch of things you don't expect."
Scott Annan is another proselytizer. Last fall, in a blog post for Ottawa start-ups, Annan-an Ottawa entrepreneur-urged his audience to avoid getting an office for as long as possible. "It's just additional costs that aren't necessary to innovate," he says. For five years, Annan has run Mercury Grove, a software development firm he founded while living in Kentucky and now runs from his home in the Glebe area. Today, he employs 12 people full-time and 40 part-time worldwide-including partners in Cincinnati, Ohio and Lexington, Kentucky, as well as a few in South Carolina. He even has a testing team in Pakistan and a development team in India. "We ship over their laptop, we pay their Internet connection fee every month," Annan says. "For six years, we've had a great relationship with them." He estimates that forgoing an office saved him hundreds of thousands of dollars, which he could plow into hiring more and better talent.
Running a completely unphysical firm isn't necessarily easier, of course. By his own admission, Annan spends hours each day on the phone in order to keep in contact with his employees and clients. He's clocked months of travel time visiting his teams in the United States. "All business comes down to relationships," he adds, "and nothing beats spending time face-to-face and talking. So there's a lot of work spent making those relationships, and making clear expectations. There's definitely additional work."
But other officeless workers argue that working virtually avoids one of the big pitfalls of a physical office: time-wasting idle chat and pointless confabs that people hold just to make it feel like they're doing work. "In a regular office, you have those meetings and meetings and meetings," laughs Ivan Paramonau, a 30-year-old entrepreneur in Ottawa. Two years ago, he and a partner co-founded Itteco Software Corp., a company that provides instant development teams for firms that need software built quickly. Itteco now employs almost 80 programmers worldwide, and Paramonau thinks they work far more efficiently because they're not physically together. He finds Skype meetings more direct, possibly because the situation is inherently more awkward and less conducive to small talk. "You drift less, you discount things that aren't essential," he says. For his part, Mirzaee thinks face-to-face time is overrated; most of the time when one of his employees needs to do something that is really hard, they prefer to do it at home so they won't be interrupted. "I don't think more than two or three hours of sync time a day is necessary, if the company is structured well."
Some of the shift away from the office is generational. Many virtual entrepreneurs are from Generation Y, the twentysomething children of the baby boomers. As workplace experts are discovering, Gen Y holds radically different ideas than their parents about what an office ought to look like-and how work ought to be done.
Mike O'Neill has studied this generation of workers closely. O'Neill is senior director of workplace research for Knoll, an office-furniture firm based in Pennsylvania. In recent years, he has polled more than 15,000 current employees across different generations-boomers, Gen Xers (who are currently in their 30s and 40s), Gen Yers, and even the workers who are a generation older than the boomers. When O'Neill asked each to rank the importance of a formal office as the place to get work done, boomers ranked it highest. They were also the strongest proponents of keeping one's office and home life separate. This, O'Neill says, is because in the formative early years of the boomers' careers, an office was the only place they could work: Computers and phones were huge and immobile, so boomers hunkered down the instant they got to the office and cranked away.
"Your office reflected your status, and you had to do everything there," O'Neill says. "So there's a lot of heavy lifting that the office had to do for boomers. The unit of work for the baby boomer is the formal meeting-'Bring on the coffee, and we're going to sit here for three hours and have a meeting!' " The quintessential boomer space is a large conference room with a huge table, where a dozen people can gather and do deals.
In contrast, Gen Y ranked the importance of a formal office much lower than did the other demographics-and they ranked big, traditional conference rooms as their least favourite choice. "They see meetings as being vaguely confrontational in nature," O'Neill notes. "Why? Because Gen Y prefer to have meetings in short bursts, in small gatherings in informal spaces. The boomers are like, 'Come on, we're going to have a meeting!' But Gen Y is like, 'We already had a pre-meeting. I talked to my guy while we were at the coffee machine.' "
What's more, Gen Y was the most likely to prefer working outside the office. In O'Neill's surveys, 26% of Gen Y employees telecommute, and 17% of them work at "unassigned spaces" in offices, picking a different spot to plop down with their laptop when they drop by. Gen Y also preferred casual work environments like cafes. It is a neat paradox of their generational upbringing: Having grown up in the era of the MP3 player, they're accustomed to wearing headphones to screen out the outside world, so Gen Y workers often head for a public space when they want privacy. Gen Y also expressed its dislike of commuting, an activity that boomers had taken for granted, because, back then, there was no way around it.
Some of the entrepreneurs I interviewed argued that the desire to work officeless reflects the changing relationship between firms and their employees. Gen X and Y entered a work force in the late 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, when the social contract between a firm and its employees-the guarantee of lifetime employment, so long as you didn't screw up-died, and was permanently buried. Nobody expects full employment any more, as Scott Annan told me; indeed, he and his peers began their careers assuming that all jobs were provisional, and the goal was to manage the shape of your career. "The whole relationship with your employer has changed, so that it's more of a relationship with contractors, even when you're an employee," he argues. "So that changes the culture. People think, 'How do the objectives of the company fit my objective?' It's like, 'I'm independent anyway, so I want to work where I want to work.' "
And perhaps the most interesting shift is in what makes a company feel like, well, a company. Offices used to have totemic import: Entrepreneurs didn't feel "real" until they'd moved out of their kitchens and into a formal office. Even 15 years ago during the dot-com boom, the young entrepreneurs of the time-who were of Generation X-famously blew millions of their venture-capital money constructing expensive, elaborately detailed workspaces. In contrast, the new generation of entrepreneurs regard their firms as "real" from the moment they start building a product or service and selling it. (Indeed, many of today's start-up founders marvel and chuckle at the sums that dot-com firms spent on their offices. "I could do an entire start-up for the amount those guys spent on Aeron chairs," as one told me recently.) They have decoupled the importance of an office not only as a tactical necessity but as a psychological one.
Other experts argue that officeless firms are following the lead of other just-in-time sectors, like Hollywood. "One of the industries that always worked that way was Hollywood," says Fabio Rosati, the CEO of Elance, a Web service that helps companies hire and manage professionals online. "Today's small businesses, the mini-multinationals, are mini-versions of Hollywood. They're assembling the talent, they're managing the projects, and they're disbanding the talent when it's no longer needed. It's much more efficient."
Granted, there are some obvious limits to officeless work. Industries with big capital-intensive stakes-like pharmaceutical labs or aerospace engineering firms-probably aren't going to be able to shed space or allow virtualization the way that small high-tech start-ups can. And some of those in the high-tech world argue that even they have faced problems-creative limits that come when people aren't face-to-face enough.
"Any high-level product questions are best done when you're in the room together," says Ali Davar, the founder of Zite.com, a search-engine-technology firm based in Vancouver. Davar managed the firm virtually for a year, because he had to; his full-time job moved him from Vancouver to Barbados, so while developing Zite.com in his spare time, he managed a team of programmers and designers around the world, using Skype and Chat. But he found it incredibly difficult to make deep, profound decisions about the shape of their software when they weren't all in the same place. When-after two years working remotely-he finally got a chance to set up an office with his core team in Vancouver, he jumped.
"You can't beat a whiteboard," he says. "The nature of software is that it's iterative in nature. The product seldom ends up where it starts. So no matter how clear you are at the start, you're going to revisit and revisit it-probably when you're all under one roof."
Another big worry with officeless work is managing discipline. If you can't see your employees, can you even know when they're slacking off? Most CEOs of virtual firms say they have to be careful when they hire, to make sure the corporate "fit" is good, and that the employee or contractor has good self-management skills. At Mercury Grove, Annan usually starts new employees on "smaller jobs" to see what their work patterns are like, before entrusting them with "high-level work." But several other entrepreneurs argued that being officeless usefully pares an employee-employer relationship down to the most crucial element: Is the work getting done? If that's all you care about-because you're not worried, say, about whether they're arriving at the office on time or not-it becomes easy to measure whether the employee is working out. Annan argues that remote employees enjoy a flexibility that makes them more productive.
"I've never had an employee, contractor or partner tell me that they didn't complete a project because their wife was sick (or they were sick), that they had to go to a doctor's appointment, or that they would be late for work one day," Annan tells me. "You have a relationship based on performance." Though, as he points out, the flexibility cuts both ways: "I regularly receive e-mails from them at 3 a.m. and on weekends." Mirzaee told me that his firm's online collaboration software auto-reports what everyone is doing, so it's essentially impossible for an employee to slack off without him instantly knowing. "When I worked at Nortel, we'd spend hours filling out these activity reports," he adds. "Now I just look at the software and I can see what people are doing."
It's also true that "official" office space hasn't entirely vanished, even among the ranks of the new start-ups. Some of them have found that after years in business, they need to get some sort of space to hold meetings with clients or for group staff meetings; in other cases, they can't fit all their corporate stuff in their bedrooms or basements, and need an overflow spot. At Mob4Hire, King began renting a small Calgary office mostly to hold meetings. Since he and his local staff hate commuting, they still work from home the rest of the time. And even when they're forced to finally get an official home, many of them avoid the hassle of managing it by turning to the new market in "co-working spaces" -places like the Code Factory in Ottawa, or Station C in Montreal, where entrepreneurs or the self-employed can rent a cubicle or two, often on a limited-time basis, sharing printers and faxes with other people; they can focus on growing their business while letting the managers of the space take care of the scut work like taking out the trash, managing the Internet and paying utility bills. Itteco's Paramonau rents space on an on-demand basis at the Code Factory, from which he and his partner manage their worldwide network of employees.
And even those who wind up renting space find they don't use it the way a previous generation would have. In Mirzaee's case, it took him four years to get to the point where he needed more space than he had at home. Then, he rented a small office in Ottawa South for four of his local employees. But he still finds that employees work from home when they "really need to get work done."
Indeed, there's a generational clash emerging between the new regime and their older counterparts-who expect companies to be housed in gleaming office towers. When Mercury Grove's Annan applied for a federal grant that helps hire technical workers, he discovered not having a physical office hurt his credibility. It incensed him: He'd already done $1 million in business, he'd been asked to present Mercury Grove's software at the prestigious DEMO conference in California, and he was creating jobs. But to the government, he wasn't real because he didn't have an office. "These grants are based on land, not on how many jobs you create," he fumed. (Mirzaee has a more humorous version of a similar story: When Boknow applied for a government grant, the federal agent insisted on visiting their office. They spent a frantic weekend trying to make his home look official, cramming all the furniture into the bedroom and printing a corporate banner to string along one wall.)
Yet there's other evidence that the officeless trend will grow, because it's percolating up from the grassroots. In recent years, some large, established Fortune 500 firms-particularly management consulting and accounting firms-have begun to dematerialize, shedding real estate as they realize that their cubicles are often empty. Employees are either working from home, travelling or holding meetings outside the office. Why pay for all that expensive real estate if you don't need it? Using that logic, the management-consulting giant Accenture has significantly reduced the square footage of its global office footprint, says Sharon Klun, the firm's manager of retaining talent.
Some prominent architects believe the trend will remake the way we construct new office buildings. Frank Duffy, a British architect who founded DEGW and became famous for his pioneering office design in the eighties and nineties, predicts offices of the future will have fewer traditional conference rooms and private offices. Instead, they'll have plentiful-and smaller and more casual-meeting areas, and unstructured space where employees can drop by to work for a day, on the increasingly rare occasions when they're not working from home or in the field. More and more meetings will be conducted outside the firm-in airport lounges, bars and cafes. O'Neill, too, predicts offices will become more "residential" in appearance, filled with sofas and chair arrangements that replicate a Starbuckian feel.
"It's the interstitial spaces between buildings that are more important now," Duffy tells me. "It's no accident that Starbucks has flourished in the last decade. It's providing this interstitial space in between companies, places to meet." The office may never go away-but in 10 years, will we recognize what it's turned into?

The Top 5 Tools of the Officeless
Internet phone calls Skype is the biggie here. Using a computer headset, employees can make free calls to Skype users worldwide, with video and sound quality better than many mobile phones. About $20 a month gets you unlimited calling to almost any landline or mobile phone worldwide, as well as voice mail, conferencing and a regular 10-digit dial-in number.
Status updates Free services such as Twitter and Yammer let you post status updates (privately or publicly) so colleagues can see, in real time, what everyone else in the virtual firm is doing and thinking. Presto: instant "ambient awareness" -that sense of other people's moods and doings that you normally get from glancing around the office.
Project management To keep everyone working in sync, entrepreneurs use collaboration tools like Basecamphq.com or Microsoft's Groove: Team members can tick off items on to-do lists, share files, track progress toward milestones, comment on tasks and conduct team discussions.
Chat To fire quick, time-sensitive questions back and forth among far-flung employees, start-ups avoid e-mail-the inbox gets too unruly-in favour of chat applications like Gchat, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) or Microsoft Messenger.
Virtual whiteboards Need to brainstorm visually during an online meeting? Tools like WebEx and Dimdim let members do sketches, type out ideas or show slides to each other in real time.

Full text: This former wasteland is exploding with new restaurants, boutiques, bars and bicycle lanes
Pepsi-Cola stopped making its sugary drinks in Long Island City a decade ago, but the area is known for creating a different kind of fizz. Once an industrial wasteland, the Queens neighbourhood is New York's newest centre of cool.
Factories, among them the former Pepsi property, have given way to art galleries and other hubs of creative activity such as Silver Cup Studios, one of the largest studios outside California where much of Sex and the City was filmed.
Former landfills are now sculpture gardens. Warehouse loft conversions are drawing Manhattanites across the East River to take up residence. And rumour has it a new Marriott is moving into the neighbourhood, joining a handful of other hotels - both budget and boutique - that have recently been built in Long Island City in response to the growing tourist trade. Upgraded with sidewalks, lighting and bicycle lanes, streets are teeming with new restaurants, trendy boutiques and bars. Graffiti, which is maligned in Manhattan, is beloved in this neighbourhood where an entire city block is devoted to the art of urban scrawl on the walls of the five-storey, 200,000-square-foot 5Pointz, a former industrial building.
"Long Island City is experiencing a period of explosive growth," says Jeffrey Travia of the Long Island City Business Improvement District. CUNY School of Law is moving in, JetBlue Airways is relocating to Queens Plaza North and New York's Department of Health will be moving into the 21-storey Gotham Center office building when it opens early next year.
This is where, in recessionary America, real estate is booming and new businesses are arriving. Twenty years after New York magazine first declared the area up-and-coming (after noticing New York artists flocking to the Queens neighbourhood in search of cheaper rent), Long Island City has definitely arrived.
Areas of Long Island City may still be covered with warehouses, but these days they're producing pop art, not pop bottles. Galleries include MoMa PS 1, a contemporary outpost of the Museum of Modern Art (22-25 Jackson Ave., 718-784-2084; www.ps1.org) and the Socrates Sculpture Garden, an outdoor exhibition space with a view of Roosevelt Island (31-34 Vernon Blvd., 718-626-1533; www.socratessculpturepark.org). The Noguchi Museum, this year celebrating its 25th year in Long Island City, showcases the work of the late sculptor Isamu Noguchi. 9-01 33rd Rd., 718-721-2308; www.noguchi.org
A BEACH WITH A VIEW
While just a stop from Midtown, the neighbourhood also has its own sandy beach with spectacular views of the Empire State and Chrysler buildings.

The Brooklyn Grange is a one-acre working rooftop farm that recently took root high at the top of the six-storey Standard Motor Products building, an old warehouse property. Consisting of a million pounds of soil and using a greenhouse infrastructure to grow vegetables, it is said to be the largest commercial rooftop farm in New York City. The urban farmers involved in the pioneering project plan to sell

Full text: For those Canadians new to the harmonized sales tax, the first reaction is likely to be outrage. After all, many goods and services that will be subject to the HST starting July 1 will have previously been taxed at a much lower rate. How in the world could the HST be beneficial for you and me? Tim Cestnick explains
WHAT IS IT?
By now, it's likely you've heard about this thing called the Harmonized Sales Tax.
The HST already exists in the Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, and will be introduced in Ontario and British Columbia on July 1, 2010. The rate will be 13 per cent in Ontario and 12 per cent in B.C.
In effect, the HST is a combination of the federal Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the provincial sales taxes in the provinces where it applies.
It is a single sales tax that replaces the provincial sales taxes in the provinces mentioned.
The HST is collected by the Canada Revenue Agency, which then remits to the appropriate province a share of the taxes collected.
WHY IMPLEMENT IT?
Provincial sales tax (PST) is charged on many purchases made by businesses engaged in manufacturing goods and providing services.
These businesses can't recover that PST, and it applies at every step in the production, distribution and retail process - making it a tax on a tax on a tax.
The end consumer is the one who bears the ultimate cost of the PST.
Want an example? Suppose you buy a suit jacket. The company that creates the fabric will pay PST on the raw materials. That company can't recover this PST, so it passes it along to the manufacturer of the suit jacket in the form of higher prices. In turn, that manufacturer passes that cost along to you, the consumer.
In the end, you pay GST on the jacket, PST on the jacket, plus the cost of the PST embedded along the way.
HOW WILL IT AFFECT ME?
With the HST, manufacturers will be entitled to recover the PST that they could not recover before. The end result is supposed to be lower costs to the manufacturer, and ultimately lower prices to you.
While you're going to see the new HST on many point-of-sale receipts and invoices, the fact is that 83 per cent of goods and services in Ontario won't face a change in the amount of tax levied (in B.C., it is about 80 per cent).
There will, however, be 17 per cent of goods and services that will face higher sales taxes under the new HST in Ontario (and about 20 per cent in B.C.).
What specifically are these goods and services? The list is different for Ontario and B.C.

'When I first saw him in the hallways of Father Bressani [high school] in Woodbridge, I knew he was going to be something really big."
She turns to him.
"Wow," he says, shaking his head. "I never knew." He flashes his megawatt smile.
"I just didn't know we had to do it ourselves," she says, laughing from behind a curtain of long, sleek black hair.
This is the David and Nina Rocco show, at home, the husband and wife in a hardwood-floored room with their twin two-year-old daughters, Giorgia and Emma. They're at a key juncture in their long-anticipated route to fame and fortune. This week, their self-produced show, David Rocco's Dolce Vita , which is in its fifth season on Canada's Food Network and in 100 countries around the world, makes its debut on The Cooking Channel, a sister company of The Food Network in the U.S.
It's the final, big meatball of success. Mr. Rocco has just returned from doing a media tour, including interviews with CNN and Fox.
"We go into 65 million homes on May 31st," he beams, adding that he is now being represented by the prestigious talent agency, William Morris.
The domestic scene is as casual as an al fresco lunch at a long table in a vineyard. Toys are strewn across the floor. Light falls through the south-facing windows. There is laughter. The 40-year-old couple, both 40, are perfectly coiffed (at mid-morning, no less) - packaged, seemingly, to portray the right celebrity-esque image - but they're also breezy; free with their banter; relaxed with their children, who clamber up onto their knees for requests; and unfazed by questions about how they turned a cliched version of Italian life into their successful brand.
Ah, La Dolce Interview .
In their TV show, Mr. Rocco immerses himself in Italian life, eating al fresco, sampling this and that, kissing his bunched-together fingertips, squeezing plump tomatoes in an outdoor marketplace, leaping on a scooter, chatting with authentic-looking locals, waving from open windows to friends in the street below, making the sign of the cross as he passes an ancient church and throwing together an impromptu meal for anyone who enters his kitchen to smell his pasta sauce.
"But all TV is contrived!" retorts Mr. Rocco playfully when asked if his version of la dolce vita is too predictable. "Who really does a recipe in three minutes?"
"We infuse a modern look into what Italian life is," puts in Ms. Rocco, who also features in the TV series, clad usually in a teensy bikini. The couple, who were both born in Canada, live in Toronto but move to Italy for four or five months every year to shoot a season of the show.
"Yeah, the typical cliché is the old mama and the checkered table cloth," Mr. Rocco explains. "We don't do that. If we're really talking cliché, we might have accordion music."
"We use French [music]," his wife explains sweetly.
"And let's not forget," says Mr. Rocco with a smile, "some cliches are cliché because they're true." The show's popularity comes from the sense of community it evokes, he suggests. "It's the humanity of it. Meeting the cheese maker in the village."
"It's a romanticism, a feel," Ms. Rocco explains, adding that they brought the same sensibility to the cookbook, David Rocco's Dolce Vita . "If people can watch the show and then want to go and break bread with their friends and family, make a meal, that's good."
Their road to success began in high school, when they began dating at the age of 16. Born in Toronto's Scarborough neighbourhood, the son of Italian immigrants who both worked as hairdressers, Mr. Rocco moved to Woodbridge when he was a young teenager. Ms. Rocco's parents, who also immigrated to Canada, were already living in the predominantly Italian community just north of the Greater Toronto Area.
By 16, Mr. Rocco was modelling for big agencies, including Elite and Armstrong Men. He and Ms. Rocco took acting classes together. And when both went off to York University, they ran a restaurant, La Madonnina, in Woodbridge, after Ms. Rocco's father, who worked in real-estate development and construction, bought the building. "There's a sexiness about the restaurant business and we've always loved food, but there's nothing glamorous about it," she says. They gave it up after a year to pursue their acting.
In 1997, without success in the feature-film world, they figured a food show would be better. In Italy on holiday, they shot a video on their last day in Florence and later showed it to a Toronto production company. "We shot it on instinct," Mr. Rocco explains. The demo led to a 26-episode TV series called Avventura , which was "a hybrid of travel and cooking."
The following year, they moved to Rome. "Why not? We were young," Mr. Rocco exclaims. They wanted to do a show about the food culture. "Rome confirmed that yes, there's a show here in the Italian lifestyle of connecting to each other through food," he says.
Upon their return to Toronto, they pitched the idea to The Food Network, insisting on producing it themselves. "We knew what the brand was even then." But television executives wanted control and the deal fell through, prompting the couple to withdraw money they had saved to buy a house and go back to Italy to shoot a 30-minute pilot with a crew of ten. "It was a huge leap of faith," Ms. Rocco says.
The Food Network loved it.
"The fact that we were married was the best thing," says Mr. Rocco of their 15-year marriage. "When one of us would get down, the other would be encouraging. I would sometimes be, like, 'I should just go get an ordinary job,' and she'd be, 'No, no, no. Keep the dream.'"
"I always had a belief it was going to happen," she says.
Their Dolce Vita brand is a "lifestyle that's aspirational," they explain. And so is theirs as a couple. They are renting a townhouse while they wait for their house in Toronto's upscale Rosedale neighbourhood to be built - a project that hasn't been without controversy. They bought the property three years ago and have run into objections not just from the city but from snooty neighbours. One actually wondered why the young couple didn't aspire to live in Woodbridge, rather than central WASPdom.
"So we forgot about putting in big lions at the portico," deadpans Ms. Rocco, joking about villa-like architectural style.
"And no arched gateways," adds her husband, beaming his smile.
"Oh no," she says, eyes twinkling at him as she laughs lightly, flips her mane of hair behind her shoulders and leans down to scoop up a child.
Ah, the sweetness of life. If the Roccos can exploit stereotypical Italian life and style for their brand, they're also unafraid to make fun of it. They're successful hybrids themselves, after all - as Canadian or Italian as the setting dictates.

Full text: jaryan@globeandmail.com
Beautiful people do not always lead charmed lives.
Contrary to what you may have seen on Entertainment Tonight , it takes work and determination to look stunning on the red staircase at Cannes. Factor in the cost of haute couture , dental veneers and various cosmetic surgeries, and looking perfect can be a very expensive proposition.
And the price of vanity spikes even higher tonight. True Beauty (ABC, CITY-TV, 10 p.m.) involves payback, of a sort, against those beautiful people. Returning for a second season from extended hiatus, the reality series exists to expose the painfully attractive for the shallow monsters they really must be.
It's worth pointing out that the executive producers of True Beauty are Tyra Banks - a former runway model turned daytime talk host - and actor Ashton Kutcher, formerly of That '70s Show , though more commonly known these days as Demi Moore's husband. Both could rightfully be described as beautiful people.
The first run of eight episodes began in January 2009, after which the show quietly disappeared, seemingly forever. Now it's back, though, and the second season is faster, slicker and unquestionably meaner.
Here's how it works: Five stereotypically attractive women (think Heidi Montag, but less pneumatic) and an equal number of rakish chaps with chiselled abs are accommodated in well-appointed digs at the Planet Hollywood Hotel in Las Vegas. The 10 witless souls have been told they will compete in a reality-TV competition to determine the next "Face of Vegas." While some maintain blank expressions, most in the self-absorbed group take to the idea like the Jersey Shore cast take to spray-on tans.
The comely contestants assume they will be judged entirely on their physical attributes when, in reality, each episode is really a test of their inner beauty - you know, kindness, compassion, generosity and other attributes that can't be enhanced by Botox.
Borrowing the format of Kutcher's MTV series Punk'd , the show uses hidden cameras to film the contestants as they face a series of set-ups to gauge each one's moral turpitude. Unlike Punk'd , it's not terribly amusing.
But to this group, naturally, it sure looks like a real reality show. The participants are told that one of them will be kicked off each week. The group meets the show's host, played by former ET host Vanessa Minillo, and the requisite celebrity judges: ex- Queer Eye for the Straight Guy fusspot Carson Kressley and Beth Ostrosky Stern, an ex-model famous for marrying radio personality Howard Stern. The bait is set.
In the first season of True Beauty , the self-absorbed participants were removed for such unforgivable indiscretions as not holding the door for someone carrying coffee, or failing to help a fallen bicycle courier. The candid-camera tests in the second season have turned a tad nastier.
Tonight's opener, for example, is titled "The Stealing Challenge." Each contestant is assigned a professional stylist, handed a budget of $200 and told they have 30 minutes to create a signature Vegas look. Once they are polished to perfection, they are put into lighted glass cases along the Las Vegas strip. The voting procedure falls to passersby, who drop a chip into the case of the person they deem "hottest."
For the average person, smiling and posing in a glass booth for strangers might be enough humiliation to last a lifetime; on True Beauty , it gets better, or worse, depending on your vantage point. In this instance, each player is slyly approached and offered a chance to steal and conceal an item from their budget - could be a codpiece, could be a push-up bra - that will presumably give them an advantage later in the competition. Human nature being what it is, more than one of the beautiful people cave to the temptation.
So it begins. The furtive behaviour is the hook of every episode of True Beauty , which is slated for another eight-week run. The contestants do not learn of the fakery until they are kicked off, by which time the damage is already done.
The last one standing will receive $100,000 and a feature in People magazine, which, come to think of it, probably pushes the meanness quotient even higher. Isn't a People profile is the dream of every truly superficial person?
But the tone of True Beauty suggests that this bunch deserves public scorn. As per every reality show, the contestants are hand-picked, and, with all due respect, none seem likely to catch onto the ruse. The occupations of the five women: bartender, cocktail waitress, model, dancer and pageant queen (if in fact that is an occupation).
And the men? Here we have a DJ/astrologer, real-estate agent, actor/model, athlete and, heaven help us, a Canuck named Craig, who works as a retail manager in Winnipeg. Craig might not want to show his face at Portage and Main after this show.
The curious thing about True Beauty is that some people will unavoidably feel empathy for these beautiful people. In reality-TV terms, they are like animals lured into leg-hold traps.
However vapid the contestants' personalities, they still went into the reality process with honest intent, not expecting to become objects of public ridicule for viewer entertainment. Don't hate them because they're beautiful. Hate them because they're gullible.

Abstract: Patricia Heaton a full vote of confidence with a second-season renewal - and don't be surprised if the show sticks around for years to come. Tonight's episode is the much discussed Valentine's Day outing, in which Heaton's character of working mom Frankie and husband [Mike Holmes] (Neil Flynn) are surprised - and decidedly uncomfortable - when their kids leave them home alone on the most romantic night of the year. Contrary to popular belief, love does not make the world go 'round....

REALITY
For Rent
HGTV, 7:30 p.m.
Not everybody is looking to commit to a mortgage. Many people still prefer the comparatively non-committal renting world and this series follows the efforts of real-estate pro Jodi Gilmour as she tries to put the right renters in the right rental. And once they're moved in, Jodi even helps set up a nifty makeover on a shoestring budget. Tonight, she huddles with university students and best friends Colby and Heather, who are desperate to get out of their cramped one bedroom and into a larger space.
DRAMA
Friday Night Lights
NBC, Global, 8 p.m.
Is this earnest series about life in a football-mad Texas town the best drama currently on television? Try to name a better one. In tonight's show, coach Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler) attends the homecoming at the newly-reopened East Dillon High, which prompts him to dig deeper into the school's checkered history. Elsewhere, the coach's wife Tami (Connie Britton) feels the wrath of the local football booster club and the star player Tim (Taylor Kitsch) and Matt (Zach Gilford) unexpectedly bond during a hunting trip.
MOVIE
The Mighty Quinn
CH, 9 p.m.
Having nothing in common with the 1967 chart-topper by Manfred Mann, this 1989 film stars Denzel Washington in a taut thriller set in a tropical paradise. Filmed in Jamaica, passing for your basic generic Caribbean island, the story casts the future Oscar-winner as the wise police chief Xavier Quinn, who gets more than he bargains for while investigating the murder of a wealthy resort owner. Everyone in town assumes the killer is the ganja-dealing local thief named Maubee (Robert Townsend). The Mighty Quinn, however, looks beyond the obvious answer to suspect the motives of a crooked local politician.

Life in Music
Bravo!, 7 p.m.
Coinciding with the release of Paul Quarrington's upcoming memoir and his first solo CD, this documentary will leave most viewers with a lump in the throat. The film documents the Toronto novelist/musician's dogged acceptance of the terminal illness that took his life earlier this year. The abrupt diagnosis led Quarrington to embrace his life and art, and the film shows him pouring his heart into his memoir at the same time he's writing and recording songs with his band, Porkbelly Futures. The documentary also includes interviews with such Quarrington contemporaries as musician Dave Bidini and writer Roddy Doyle.
MOVIE
The Special Relationship
HBO Canada, 9 p.m.
Debuting tonight, this new movie takes sweeping creative liberties in documenting the relationship between two former world leaders. The original HBO movie stars Dennis Quaid as former U.S. president Bill Clinton and stage and film star Michael Sheen as British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Set in the idealistic nineties, the story recounts how Clinton helped Blair achieve peace in Northern Ireland, and Blair thereafter returned the favour by supporting Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The two leaders reached an impasse, however, with the growing crisis in Kosovo. The roles of Hillary Clinton and Cherie Blair are played by Hope Davis and Helen McRory, respectively.
ANIMATION
Red Dead Redemption
Fox, midnight
Searching for an alternative to reruns of Saturday Night Live ? This animated special is based on the bestselling video game and will definitely include warnings of viewer discretion. Like the game, the half-hour story is set in Mexico, circa 1910, in the dying days of the Old West. The central character is reformed outlaw John Marston, who is on his way to round up his former partner-in-crime, Bill Williamson. En route to the Williamson Gang's hideout, Marston teams up with a psychotic sheriff and a mentally unstable grave robber.
DRAMA
Law & Order: SVU
CTV, 10 p.m.
When a crime-scene photo of a murdered teenage girl becomes an online phenomenon, detectives Stabler and Benson take their investigation to the victim's father, who in turn directs them to his daughter's shrink. Despite an airtight alibi, the doctor has several other unstable teens for patients - one of whom recently broke into the police morgue. British actor James Frain, who played Thomas Cromwell on The Tudors , guest-stars as the therapist.
SUNDAY
MAY 30
Drama
Star Trek: The Cage
Space, 5:30 p.m.
Before William Shatner's Captain James T. Kirk took control of the USS Enterprise, there was Jeffrey Hunter. This is the original 1965 Star Trek pilot episode, which cast the film star Hunter into the role of Captain Christopher Pike (Shatner took over the role when Star Trek went to regular-series status the following year). Working from a script by series creator Gene Roddenberry, the story takes place on-board the Enterprise and has Captain Pike interacting with a species of bulbous-headed aliens. The highlight is watching Leonard Nimoy as an excitable early version of Mister Spock.
SCIENCE
Into the Universe
with Stephen Hawking
Discovery, 8 p.m.
First broadcast on the U.S. Discovery Channel, this two-part special made headlines with the statement from famed theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking that life very likely does exist on other planets. The likelihood of alien life is addressed in the first program, in which Hawking states, "In our vast, ancient universe, with its countless galaxies, almost any life form that is physically possible is likely to exist somewhere." In the second half, Hawking explores one of the most enduring of all scientific queries: Is time travel possible?
ANIMATION
Ugly Americans
Comedy Network, 9:30 p.m.
Seemingly aimed at depressed viewers and goth kids, this animated Comedy Central series focuses on the fictional character of Mark Lilly, a social worker at the Department of Integration, which is located in a dark and disturbing version of New York populated by netherworldly creatures. The cast of edgy characters also includes Mark's zombie roommate Randall and his evil boss Callie Maggotbone. Also thrown into the mix are the daft wizard Leonard and a demonic bureaucrat named Twayne. Not for younger viewers, obviously.
MONDAY
MAY 31
Drama
Murder, She Wrote
Vision, 7 p.m.
Looking back at this series, isn't it strange how people were always dying around author-sleuth Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury)? It's a miracle the woman ever had a friend. In tonight's episode, Jessica is visiting scenic Cabot Cove when her old acquaintance Stephen Earl dies during a boat trip with his four daughters. The problem: Each daughter tells a different version of their father's demise.
DRAMA
Lie to Me
Fox, Global, 8 p.m.
Renewed for next season, this series starring Tim Roth returns for a summer run. Tonight's story places Roth's character of human lie-detector Dr. Cal Lightman at a political protest in Washington. A seriously disgruntled farmer has parked a tractor loaded with explosive devices somewhere near the Treasury Department building, which forces Lightman and his team to make some life-and-death decisions.
REALITY
Hoarders
A & E, 9 p.m.
While many people have trouble eliminating clutter, the people profiled in this popular series are extreme cases. Tonight focuses on two typical subjects. Michelle owns more than 60 birds and her house is awash in feathers and birdseed, which has forced her husband to seek lodging elsewhere. Kim is a pharmaceutical sales rep who can't find any of her work papers in her hopelessly messy home. With help from psychologists, both women seek the path to removing the clutter from their lives.
REALITY
UFO Hunters
OLN, 10 p.m.
Seemingly made for viewers who believe The X-Files was real, this series follows the efforts of paranormal investigators trying to prove or debunk reports of Unidentified Flying Objects. The team is headed by the serious William J. Birnes, who enlists the help of investigative biologist Jeff Tomlinson and MIT researcher Ted Acworth in each case study. Tonight's show is the first in the series and reopens the case of a little-known UFO encounter that supposedly occurred near Maury Island, Wash. in 1947. Why is the incident unknown? Because it happened two weeks before the alleged crash landing of an alien spaceship in Roswell, N.M.
TUESDAY
JUNE 1
REALITY
Wipeout
ABC, 8 p.m.
If you thought the regular version of this series was bizarre, wait until you see the "blind-date" edition. As before, the concept involves a group of people taking on a huge obstacle course that looks like it was designed by Willy Wonka. The difference: Tonight brings together 12 single guys and an equal number of unattached ladies, whose first dates will find them falling off enormous spinning wheels and dumped into wave pools. Besides true love, the contestants will be competing for a $100,000 grand prize.
DRAMA
Glee
Fox, Global, 9 p.m.
Tonight, the episode of Glee that some people believed would never happen: Good-guy glee club leader Mr. Schuester (Matthew Morrison) finally gets revenge on the mean-spirited gym coach Sue (Jane Lynch)! In other news, Quinn (Dianna Agron) connects with her "funky" side, with a little help from Mercedes (Amber Riley). The episode features guest turns from Broadway veterans Idina Menzel and Jonathan Groff.
SCIENCE
100 Greatest Discoveries
TVO, 10 p.m.
Remember Bill Nye? Twenty years ago, the gawky educator was a TV fixture as Bill Nye the Science Guy, which was the first introduction to the universe for many young viewers. Now older but certainly wiser, Nye takes the same tack in this series that looks at the most important discoveries of this century. Tonight, Nye narrows down the top 10 discoveries to benefit mankind. They are, in no particular order, Newton's law of motion, penicillin, germ theory, laws of inheritance, microorganisms, the Earth's movement, the periodic table of elements, e=mc2, general relativity and natural selection. Nye is still the smartest science guy on TV.
DESIGN
Holmes on Homes
HGTV, 11 p.m.
The damnable thing about home ownership, says savvy handyman Mike Holmes, is that most people blindly put their trust into lousy contractors. Tonight's show introduces Olivia, who bought a nice home and decided to turn the basement into a living space for her daughter and grandchildren. Her plan to redesign the space and install larger windows was stalled by an unskilled contractor who more than once was found sleeping on the job. Now she's exhausted her reno budget and the basement's window wells are filling up with water. Once again, Big Mike comes to the rescue.
WEDNESDAY
JUNE 2
DRAMA
Tom Stone
Showcase, 7 p.m.
Oh, for the days of the simple Canadian drama series. First shown on the CBC in 2002 and 2003, this show was set in Calgary and starred Chris Martin as Tom Stone, a cheeky rogue who was both a former police detective and an ex-con. Somehow Tom's background made him the perfect employee for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who would bring him in to assist on unorthodox cases. In tonight's show, a suspicious accident at an Alberta oil rig puts a young worker in the hospital. Tom's RCMP handler Marina (Janet Kidder) puts our boy undercover at the rig to find out what really happened.
COMEDY
The Middle
ABC, 8:30 p.m.
ABC gave this sitcom starring former Everybody Loves Raymond regular Patricia Heaton a full vote of confidence with a second-season renewal - and don't be surprised if the show sticks around for years to come. Tonight's episode is the much discussed Valentine's Day outing, in which Heaton's character of working mom Frankie and husband Mike (Neil Flynn) are surprised - and decidedly uncomfortable - when their kids leave them home alone on the most romantic night of the year. Contrary to popular belief, love does not make the world go 'round.
COMEDY
Accidentally on Purpose
CBS, 8:30 p.m.
More than a few TV-industry watchers were surprised by CBS's recent decision to cancel the show. While it wasn't a hit on the level of, say, Modern Family, the show had decent ratings and seemed to fit into the CBS mold of low-concept sitcoms. If you missed the show entirely, tonight is the pilot episode in which the free-spirited Billie, played by Jenna Elfman of Dharma & Greg renown, breaks up with her boyfriend, has a fling with a younger guy and ends up pregnant. Billie decides to keep the baby-and the baby's father, sort of-and thereafter becomes a feisty single mother. Not a bad concept, until you realize Murphy Brown did this nearly 20 years ago.
MYSTERY
Happy Town
ABC, 10 p.m.
It's back. ABC pulled this murder-mystery series following three abysmally low-rated airings last month. The final four chapters begin tonight and the story picks up right where it left off: The disappearance of Rachel Conroy (Amy Acker) creates uneasiness in the town of Haplin, with all clues pointing to the return of the elusive "Magic Man." In other developments, Tommy (Geoff Stults) finds an ally while searching for his wife and Handsome Dan (Peter Outerbridge) announces he's leaving town. If some of the license plates look familiar to viewers here, it's because the show was filmed on location in Port Hope, Ont.
THURSDAY
JUNE 3
REALITY
The First 48
A & E, 9 p.m.
If there's a criticism of this long-running series, it's that the format focuses primarily on the investigation of a heinous crime and never provides closure. The shortfall is remedied in tonight's new show, which takes viewers inside the dramatic events unfolding after the arrest of a suspect, right up to and including the subsequent trial and arrest. The first of several update specials follows up on a high-profile disappearance and the case of a killer caught in the act.
COMEDY
30 Rock
NBC, CITY-TV, 9:30 p.m.
For viewers accustomed to a Thursday night 30 Rock fix, it's unbelievable he show won't return with new episodes for five months. Tonight's show from last season, however, is one of the best in the series. The network has announced open auditions for a new news anchor and everyone is jockeying for the position. Spunky Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) attempts to rig the audition process, while Girly Show regulars Tracy (Tracy Morgan) and Jenna (Jane Krakowski) conduct their own off-site auditions. NBC anchor Brian Williams turns up, playing himself.
DOCUMENTARY
Fugitive Chronicles
A & E, 11 p.m.
To long-time A & E viewers, this new show resembles the type of programming that used to fill the network's schedule. Harkening back to the days of American Justice and Investigative Reports , the series relives stories of fugitives who successfully evaded capture. Tonight's episode retells the story of bank robber Craig Pritchert, who, along with his girlfriend Nova Guthrie, became a modern-day version of Bonnie and Clyde. This program tracks the six years the pair spent eluding the FBI, which was followed by their eventual capture in Cape Town, South Africa.
FOOD
Food Jammers
Food Network 11:30 p.m.
Funny and informative, this series chronicles the food journeys of Micah Donovan, Chris Martin and Nobu Adilman, better known as the Food Jammers, who are forever adding their own inventive spin to the culinary process. Tonight, they combine their love of cycling with their search for the perfect croissant. After touring the city and country, the trio discover that the secret to the perfect croissant is to use fresh-churned butter. In short order, they're using pedal power to roll out their pastry dough. Clever lads.

Full text:   Plans to restore legendary hotel and convert some floors to condos may be a blueprint for future preservation projects
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
It's funny: Most architectural criticism lobbed back-and-forth about Toronto is that it lacks history, or that what we do have, we demolish. Chicago this, Montreal that - I'm sick of it, frankly.
While it's true our road to preservation is peppered with potholes, we have many places to make a preservationist's heart sing: Fort York, Cabbagetown for the gingerbread set, the financial district for deco-heads and midcentury modernists and everything in between. We also have the great architectural gifts left behind by families such as the Masseys and the Gooderhams. The problem, if there is one, is that we are a financially focused, pragmatic city. We like heritage, we usually understand its importance, but it needs to be useful and profitable. If we only had a model to follow!
The King Edward Hotel might just be it.
In March, Dundee Realty, Skyline International Development, Serruya Realty Group and Alex Shnaider purchased the storied King Eddy for the bargain price of $48-million from New York's Lehman Bros. Over the next few years, this group will probably spend a great deal more renovating and restoring George Gooderham's gift, but, more importantly, the third, fourth and fifth floors, vacant since 1991, will become the King Edward Private Residences.
What does this mean? Well, with prices starting in the low $400,000s for a studio, it means these suites aren't just for the wealthy (as a result of too many film noir marathons, I used to believe that only the very, very rich or grifters and private eyes live in hotels). It means, with 35 to 38 residences of varying sizes on each of the 30,000 sq. ft. floor plates, this irreplaceable piece of local history will now be co-owned by Torontonians of all stripes.
"Even if you're not a history buff, how can you not get excited about something like this, and what's going on here?" asked Jason Lester, Dundee's chief operating officer, as he showed me the cavernous and stripped-to-the-concrete fifth floor. Gazing down from the hotel's distinctive rounded corner at King and Victoria (the current vinyl windows will be replaced with operable, double-hung units) to see a streetcar slip between Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's TD Centre and Edward Durell Stone's First Canadian Place, it was hard to think of anything but history.
Toronto's first luxury "palace hotel" was designed by Chicago architect Henry Ives Cobb in 1900, but local hero E.J. Lennox (who designed the 1899 City Hall) took the reins in 1901 to alter, improve and finish the design. An "intense, hands-on architect," writes heritage consultant Sally Gibson, Mr. Lennox was someone "who paid as close attention to the ventilation and heating systems, as the colonnades and detailing of the public spaces."
The hotel - ventilation, colonnades and all - opened in May 1903 and was advertised as "absolutely fire-proof" (built of steel and concrete) to calm guests fearful of staying on upper floors. It had everything: Women-only areas for solo female travellers, lavish murals, a men's barber shop, the Palm Room, the Oak Room bar and, of course, the exquisite Rotunda. In 1921, the 18-storey "skyscraper" addition, designed by a Buffalo, N.Y. and a London, Ontario firm, was tacked onto the east side of the hotel; until being eclipsed by the Royal York in 1929, the King Eddy was the largest hotel in the country. The Crystal Ballroom on the 18th floor set a new standard, and celebrities from Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks to Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor partied there.
But will twenty-first century celebs get that chance?
"We do not know what we're going to do with the ballroom," said Mr. Lester, ruefully. Boarded up since 1978, the decaying beauty will be studied over the next few months and may open on a temporary basis "to see what type of response we have... and see if it works well as an event space," he said. Should Dundee decide to do a full-on restoration, I'm sure it will be top-notch, since they've proved their heritage mettle at another of Mr. Gooderham's gifts, the Distillery District. The fact that heritage heavyweight Michael McClelland and his firm, ERA Architects, are onboard as architects-in-charge doesn't hurt, either.
And that's just it: In addition to a chunk being offered up as condominiums next month (suites go on sale June 12), the hotel can now boast local ownership and local brainpower behind the redesign.
"The thing is, you've got to live and breathe it - for us, our offices are a block away," said Mr. Lester. "I think that's been part of the problem with some of these previous owners; you can't push the buttons from White Plains, New York, and figure out what the best thing to do is."
And the "best thing" for this city is to prove that heritage and good business are not mutually exclusive. A tightrope act, for sure, and there may be stumbles. Will adding balconies to the King St. façade (where there originally were some) animate the building or just anger preservationists? Will the refreshed Rotunda look timeless or dated in 30 years? Will a worthy successor to Luigi Romanelli and his King Edward Hotel Orchestra take up residence in a restored ballroom? Will a five-star restaurant on the ground floor woo foodies from the four corners of the city?
I hope so, because if the King Eddy is crowned king again, this model can be applied to other significant properties when their time comes; in the 2060s, will the Residences of the TD Centre be on offer?
The King Edward Hotel (including the Crystal Ball Room) will be open tomorrow and Sunday during the city's 11th-annual Doors Open Festival. For more information, go to www.toronto.ca/doorsopen or www.kingedward.ca.

Ottawa stadium project unveiled

Author: Naylor, David

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/ottawa-stadium-project-unveiled/docview/346585567/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "We talk about the fan experience, but I think the players will have a sense of pride from having a world-class dressing room and strength and conditioning room," [Jeff Hunt] said Thursday. "I think players will love to be here and be part of the Ottawa experience, where in the past the Ottawa experience was something you had to overcome. The Ottawa experience will be an asset instead of a liability."

Full text:   Development group hopes to break ground in 2011, rejoin CFL for 2013 season
When Ottawa last had a CFL team, it played in beautiful area south of downtown, in a stadium that was falling apart.
Yesterday, the city got a first look at designs for the facility the reborn Ottawa franchise will be playing in at Lansdowne Park - if all goes according to plan between now and the start of the 2013 CFL season.
"I think it will be the jewel of the CFL," said Jeff Hunt, the head of a group that was granted a CFL expansion team two years ago. "In my opinion, one of the most unique outdoor stadiums in North America."
The proposed stadium boasts part of the stands built below ground, with a construction largely made from wood to reflect the city's history as a lumber town.
The north-side stands, which were condemned and partially destroyed a few years ago, include a curved shape. And unlike the old facility in the final seasons of CFL football (which ended prior to the 2006 campaign), the new stadium will have first-rate amenities for fans and players.
"We talk about the fan experience, but I think the players will have a sense of pride from having a world-class dressing room and strength and conditioning room," Hunt said Thursday. "I think players will love to be here and be part of the Ottawa experience, where in the past the Ottawa experience was something you had to overcome. The Ottawa experience will be an asset instead of a liability."
The city's final vote on the stadium project and the overall redevelopment of the Lansdowne Park area, including retail, residential and service areas, is scheduled for June 28. If successful, barring any unforeseen delays, shovels could be in the ground by early 2011.
Hunt said his group, which includes local businessmen with real estate backgrounds, hope to rejoin the CFL in time for the 2013 season. They are also planning to house a professional soccer team in the new stadium.
"The stadium has such a distinct look," Hunt said. "It has the potential to be an icon for Ottawa, so people will think of Parliament Hill, the canal and Lansdowne Park. So much of today's sports is about the experience and Lansdowne will deliver that whole experience."
The proposed Ottawa stadium is part of a trend across the CFL, with new or refurbished stadiums planned for Hamilton, Winnipeg, Vancouver and Regina.
The Hamilton facility, however, remains in limbo as the city and the Tiger-Cats team try to find common ground on a site for the stadium which will be used for the 2015 Pan American Games track and field events.
Ian Troop, 2015 Pan Am chief executive officer, said again Thursday that Hamilton is not guaranteed to be home to the stadium. Troop said the city has until July 8 to reach a compromise, before the Pan Am committee must consider alternative sites.

Full text:   The Calgary house where Bret (The Hitman) Hart and his siblings were raised is being sold for $5-million - 'dungeon' included
Ever dreamed of owning a big piece of wrestling history, complete with more than two acres of land and a view of the Calgary skyline?
It can all be yours for a little under $5-million in the form of the Hart House, the legendary abode of Alberta's first family of wrestling.
The mansion where Stu Hart and his wife, Helen, raised 12 children, seven of whom would become professional wrestlers, is back on the market. The place includes a basement room nicknamed "the dungeon," where Mr. Hart schooled generations of men in tights in the finer points of submission holds and body blows.
In its heyday, everyone from Muhammad Ali to Hulk Hogan visited, and the house even played host to a WWF-sanctioned match.
"If you walked into it, it didn't look like much or seem like much," said Bret (The Hitman) Hart, Stu's son, in an interview with IGN Sports. He described holes in the ceiling and even cracks in the walls from wrestlers slamming each other into them.
"I can tell you, what made the room was the presence and knowledge of ... what men had suffered on that mat," he said.
The late Chris Benoit, who was among the wrestlers to be thrown around by the senior Mr. Hart, reportedly said of the experience that "going to the Hart family for training was kind of like, if you're a very religious person, going to the Vatican."
The stately brick house was built in 1905 in what was then open countryside west of the city by Edward Crandell, who owned a nearby brick factory.
In the 1920s, it was used as a Red Cross hospital for convalescing First World War soldiers, and also housed children orphaned by the war.
Stu Hart, who founded the Stampede Wrestling organization, bought it in 1951. After Mr. Hart's death in 2003 at age 88, the home was sold to a local businessman who restored its woodwork and renovated the kitchen. The dungeon, however, was left partly intact, with bars on the wall and a punching bag hanging from the ceiling.
To the disappointment of wrestling fans hoping to get a peek inside Calgary's ultimate school of hard knocks, there won't be an open house. The only people who can get in are those interested in buying, said real estate agent Gary Cronin.
The 5,500-square-foot, six-bedroom home sits atop a hill on 2.5 acres of land, which the new owner will have the option to develop.
And the dungeon isn't the only piece of Hart family history left here, Mr. Cronin said: many of the bricks in the house bear messages carved by family members over the years.
"They've got things like 'Happy Birthday, 1958' or 'Third Child Born.' You can spend an hour going around the whole house and just finding these," he said.

Full text:   Spanish banks mergers, national austerity programs sink euro
Fears of another credit crunch are building in Europe, as Spain's move to consolidate four banks shows debt problems are weighing heavily on the financial sector.
The Bank of Spain organized the merger of four regional savings banks known as cajas in a bid to strengthen their overall financial position. Spain's smaller banks suffer from heavy exposure to the slumping real estate sector and construction industry, in addition to rising loan losses amid one of Europe's harshest economic declines. The merger will create Spain's fifth-largest lender, with EUR135-billion ($178-billion) of assets, and comes just days after the central bank seized control of CajaSur, a failing bank in Cordoba controlled by the Roman Catholic Church.
Nervous investors Tuesday pushed the euro down to its lowest level since 2001, hammered bank shares and trimmed 2 to 4 per cent off most of the benchmark European stock indexes.
In Italy, meanwhile, a EUR24-billion austerity package approved late Tuesday is the latest in a string of broad government-spending cutbacks spreading throughout the continent and threatening to derail the modest rebound in economic activity.
Subject to parliamentary approval, Italy plans to freeze government-worker pay for three years and cut compensation for highly paid public servants. Other measures are aimed at reducing bureaucracy and cracking down on those falsely receiving disability benefits. In total, Italy's planned cuts would reduce the country's budget deficit to below 3 per cent of GDP by 2012 - in line with euro zone rules - from 5.3 per cent in 2009. The cutbacks would also help address the country's debt load of 115 per cent of GDP, the highest of the 16 countries that use the euro.
While the Spanish government's message was that it is moving quickly to shore up the country's 45 savings banks through forced mergers and support from a EUR99-billion restructuring fund, investors took the four-way deal as evidence that the entire European banking sector is coming under stress once again.
"I was thinking today that maybe the immediate knee-jerk reaction is - yikes! - is this the start of another banking crisis?" Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist for British investment manager Brewin Dolphin, said in an interview. "Does this increase counterparty risk for the banks and hence push up the spreads even further for Libor [London interbank offered rate]?"
Indeed Libor - the rate at which banks lend short-term money to one another - climbed Tuesday for the 11th day running. A rising Libor means banks are becoming increasingly concerned about the quality of bank assets used as collateral. The three-month rate was last at about 0.536 per cent, its highest level since last July and more than double the March figure.
The Libor rate could go as high as 1.5 per cent in the next few months, Citigroup analyst Neela Gollapudi said in a report last week. The rate for European banks, judged to be riskier than their U.S. counterparts as the debt crisis rolls across the continent, has been rising the fastest.
Investors were spooked not just by the state of Spain's banks, but the state of the overall economy. Spain's unemployment rate is 20 per cent and rising, the result of the bursting of Europe's biggest property bubble.
On Monday the International Monetary Fund, the sponsor with the European Union of a EUR750-billion bailout fund for EU countries that cannot roll over their debt, said Spain faces "a dysfunctional labour market, the deflating property bubble, a large fiscal deficit, heavy private-sector and external indebtedness, anemic productivity growth, weak competitiveness and a banking sector with pockets of weakness."
Along with cuts to some public servants' salaries, Italy's austerity package includes a hefty reduction in transfer payments to regional and local governments. Government spending cuts are spreading across Europe. On Monday Britain's new coalition government unveiled £6.25-billion ($9.6-billion) of spending cuts - a prelude to far deeper reductions expected later this year, when chancellor George Osborne is to unveil an emergency budget. Germany is reportedly on the verge of eliminating EUR10-billion a year of spending through 2016.
In spite of the spending cuts, which are designed to bring outsized deficits down to the EU's 3-per-cent limit, and bank reform in Spain, debt and equity investors are using any bit of bad news, real or perceived, to flee.
"The encouraging part of the news flow is that under extreme pressure, it seems that European governments have started to address their problems," UniCredit debt strategist Philip Gisdakis said in a note to clients. "The bad news is that due to the reforms, markets will turn more negative before they will improve. Harsh austerity measures and a reform of the [Spanish] banking system in the midst of a deflating property bubble is definitely not supporting growth."
In a recent interview Jose Manuel Amore Alameda, an economist and partner at Madrid's AFI, an economic and financial services consultancy, said the Spanish government is deluding itself into thinking it can grow its way out of the debt crisis. "The government is banking on a return to growth," he said. "That's nonsense. It won't happen unless the labour market and the banking sectors are reformed."
*************
Italy swings the axe
Government sets budget cutbacks of EUR24-billion ($32-billion) for 2011-12.
Cuts would reduce deficit to 2.7 per cent of GDP in 2012 from 5.3 per cent in 2009.
Salaries for civil servants are frozen for three years; high-ranking government officials face wage cuts.
Measures introduced to attack tax evasion and fraudulent use of government benefits.
Cuts must be approved by parliament and could face political backlash.

Full text:   The European Union's biggest countries are launching the first instalments of the deep spending cuts needed to crunch extravagant budget deficits, even if they come at the risk of dampening economic growth.
Britain's new coalition government started the process Monday by unveiling £6.25-billion ($9.5-billion) of immediate cuts in the current fiscal year, ranging from grants to local governments to taxis for senior officials.
Germany and Italy are poised to announce double-digit spending reductions to restore the battered euro's credibility, bring down bond yields and keep the euro zone intact as the debt crisis shows little sign of abating. And Spain, which has already unveiled measures to fight its deficit, is now blocking regional officials from long-term credit for certain projects, reports said.
While some economists think the spending reductions across the EU will hurt growth, the good news is that the deficit-busting efforts should help keep interest rates lower for some time. In a note published Monday, Deutsche Bank's economists' team said that the British government's austerity programs "have led to a sharp decline in interest rate expectations going forward," adding that "in the euro area, we have already put back our view of monetary tightening to the first quarter of 2011."
The announced, and expected, austerity efforts failed to prop up the euro.
Instead, concerns about slower European growth and the potential cost of rescuing Spain's ailing savings banks gave currency traders another reason to unload the currency. The euro, used in 16 EU countries, fell as much 1.8 per cent against the dollar, erasing all of last week's gains.
Over the weekend, the Bank of Spain seized CajaSur, a savings bank controlled by the Catholic Church in Cordoba, and ousted its management and board, which included six priests.
CajaSur was clogged with sour real estate loans, the result of the collapse of the EU's hottest property market.
Declared unviable by the Bank of Spain, CajaSur had lost EUR596-million last year on revenues of a mere EUR426-million.
Spain is setting aside EUR99-billion to prop up the savings banks, an amount that will put more pressure on its deteriorating finances.
The country's projected budget deficit in 2010 - equivalent to 9.3 per cent of gross domestic product - is among the EU's highest.
The Spanish government has given the savings banks, which are mutually owned and do not have listed shares, until June 30 to apply for rescue funds.
At least 16 of the 45 banks are in merger negotiations. To varying degrees, each was a victim of the burst property bubble, which has left many newly built estates abandoned.
The Bank of Spain said that the banks granted EUR243-billion of the EUR454-billion loans made to the real estate and construction industries. The cajas , as they're known, account for roughly half of Spain's banking industry.
In Britain, the Labour opposition party and the trade unions attacked the new spending cuts announced by Chancellor George Osborne and David Laws, chief secretary to the Treasury.
Alistair Darling, Mr. Osborne's predecessor, said "it is already clear that these cuts will seriously affect support for business, mean less jobs for young people and hit students."
Brendan Barber, general secretary of the Trade Unions Congress, said that "Taking the amount out of the economy at the moment is dangerous, and there is a real risk of a double-dip recession."
The Chancellor left few spending programs (health, defence and international development) intact in his effort to trim Britain's record £156-billion deficit - equivalent to 12.1 per cent of GDP last year. Only Greece's, at 13.6 per cent, was worse.
Among the biggest casualties were child trust funds, education and transport. He also imposed a freeze on civil service recruitment.
The government made it clear that far deeper cuts were to come.
"These are only the first steps we will need to take to put our public finances in order," Mr. Laws said. "The years of public-sector plenty are over."
Economists believe spending reductions of as much as £50-billion will be announced in 2011 and beyond if Britain is to knock its deficit down to the EU's 3-per-cent limit.
Germany and Italy are set to follow Britain's lead.
The Financial Times reported that Germany's austerity program is expected to remove EUR10-billion a year from spending until 2016.
Italy, meanwhile, has called a Tuesday night Cabinet meeting to discuss budget cuts that will bring down the deficit by some EUR25-billion by 2012.
At an expected 5.1 per cent of GDP this year, Italy's deficit is one of the EU's lowest. But its overall public debt, at 115 per cent of GDP, is among the highest in the industrialized world.
Driven by Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti, who resisted pressure from Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to launch expensive stimulus spending programs during the recession, the Italian austerity program is expected to include pay cuts for the civil servants with the highest salaries, pay freezes elsewhere and may include a shortened school year.

Full text:   News of a burning cross on an interracial couple's lawn outside Halifax shocked Canadians: Could this really have happened here, and now? But for Nova Scotia's deep-rooted black community, the past, with its burdens of slavery and segregation, never seems far enough away. Progress is always meeting setbacks, and a Maritime mainstream that often prefers denial because it has too many social and economic problems of its own. This history makes for racial dilemmas unlike any other province's. Les Perreaux reports
For years, most black people in New Glasgow lived along Vale Road and its side streets, Ghana and Brother Street Extension. It was the kind of place where children would address their elders as uncle or auntie, skate on a pond in the winter and pick blueberries in the summer among the bushes that separated them from the big department store nearby.
To many of their white neighbours, though, Vale Road was just "Nigger Hill."
Today, in this town of 9,000 a couple of hours from Halifax, a mere allusion to the name triggers a visceral reaction among the few hundred black residents: "To us, even just 'The Hill' is exactly like saying the N-word," says Henderson Paris, bristling as he drives among the neighbourhood's well-kept wooden houses.
Mr. Paris also recalls being on the production line of the local Michelin Tires plant in January, 1990, when his son, Jeremy, was badly beaten at a college in nearby Stellarton. About 100 of the boy's white peers watched while another student beat him, yelling slurs.
Jeremy recovered and eventually moved to Bermuda. Hennie Paris, as the father is known around town, was motivated to start an annual anti-racism run and eventually become a town councillor.
As he drives, continually waving to white constituents, Mr. Paris doesn't like to talk about the past. Things are much better now in New Glasgow, he says, turning down Washington Street. He points at a grey two-storey apartment building where he was refused housing in the 1980s, when the landlord told him neighbours wouldn't appreciate living with a black family.
That wouldn't happen now, Mr. Paris says. And even then, the landlord succumbed to pressure. "We didn't give up. Others intervened, he eventually gave us the place," he says. "You can't say progress hasn't been made."
Mr. Paris's sister, Cherry Paris, who spent the 1970s and 1980s working for the provincial Human Rights Commission, agrees. The schools are much less fraught with tension lately, she says. And: "At least we don't get yelled at by whites when we walk down the sidewalk any more."
A TROUBLED HISTORY, DISTINCT IN CANADA
It may sound like a modest gain, but measures of progress can be like that for blacks in Nova Scotia.
Across Canada, tensions exist over race and ethnicity, immigration and aboriginal rights. But no other region on this side of the 49th parallel has Nova Scotia's long history of a black-and-white divide.
Until the immigration reforms of the 1960s, 37 per cent of Canadian blacks lived in Nova Scotia. Today, its black population of 19,200 is smaller than the numbers in each of the largest cities. But no other place in Canada has so many black communities still living in de facto segregation. Nowhere else in Canada does the legacy of slavery remain so tangible, as much as mainstream white society tries to block it out.
"We are Canada's largest indigenous black population, and our history sets us apart and makes us unique. Nova Scotia blacks, in fact, have been treated a lot worse," says Donald Oliver, a Nova Scotia Conservative senator and lawyer. "People are very afraid to talk about it, they want it buried under the carpet."
The remnants of that history can be as subtle as a suspicious glance in a corner store or the cavalier placement of a dog park or garbage dump on top of a poor community. At other times, racism flares up more dramatically, evoking places far south of Canada's Ocean Playground.
Earlier this spring in Windsor Junction, Ku Klux Klan graffiti was plastered outside the riding office of Percy Paris, a provincial cabinet minister who happens to be black.
And the entire country gasped last month when an interracial couple an hour away from Halifax announced they were moving to an undisclosed location to protect their five children in the aftermath of a cross-burning.
The only black man in pastoral Poplar Grove in Hants County, Shayne Howe woke to the glare of that burning cross on his front lawn one night in February, while the perpetrators shouted threats and taunts. Then, last month, when one of the two brothers charged was due in court, the family car was torched, destroying the entire interior, including a new child-safety seat.
Sporting diamonds in his earlobes and a baseball cap perched on his head, Mr. Howe is a descendant of the original black settlers, Loyalists and ex-slaves who came to Nova Scotia in the 1780s. He mixes paint one sunny afternoon in their grey bungalow to prepare for the sale of his family's house, which backs onto a vast, green hay field.
He'll miss simple pleasures there, he says - riding his lawn mower, beer in hand, or skinny-dipping under cover of darkness in the backyard pool.
"I was comfortable before. People seemed okay with me," says Mr. Howe, a 31-year-old truck driver, recalling his relief when a local shop owner stopped keeping watch on him whenever he dropped in for a carton of milk.
Because the alleged cross-burners are distant cousins of his wife, Michelle Lyon, many people around town dismiss the incident as a family feud. But Ms. Lyon says she had never met the brothers before.
A venomous Facebook page with more than 100 supporters has popped up to back one of the alleged firebugs, where residents of nearby Windsor and Halifax throw around the N-word while condemning the couple as publicity hounds.
Mr. Howe gazes out at the unfinished backyard chicken coop. "You bury this stuff, dig as deep as you can, and put on a polite face," he says. "But you can't bury everything under the rug, I guess."
Indeed, that fraught heritage can seem close to the surface when you know where to look. Rev. Russell Daye, a minister at St. Andrew's United Church in Halifax, earned his doctorate in comparative ethics studying racial reconciliation in places such as South Africa and Fiji. "I was away 21 years," he says, "and when I came back, I was really stunned by how much this city is defined by race. It really looks more like U.S. cities than other Canadian cities like Montreal or Toronto."
However, he says he also sees "clear efforts to overcome the racial divide." Recently, for example, the Halifax Regional Municipality made an apology and pledged reparations for the 1960s-era bulldozing of the Africville settlement.
But some gestures go down better than others. The province recently offered a "pardon" to Viola Desmond, often called Canada's Rosa Parks, who was arrested in 1946 for sitting in the "white" section of a New Glasgow movie theatre. Black leaders pointed out that a pardon may not be the most apt recognition for a woman who did nothing wrong. Viola Desmond Day's declaration was put on hold.
"There are a lot of white people in this city who carry the stories of having witnessed African Nova Scotians getting the screws put to them," says Mr. Daye, who is white. "There is all kinds of goodwill.
"But there is so much history to overcome."
FOLLOW THE TRAIL OF BROKEN PLEDGES
Contrary to the image many Canadians hold dear, slavery was practised here from the 1600s into the early 1800s. Africans were dragged along in chains with the earliest British and French arrivals, who also enslaved natives.
Still, most of Nova Scotia's black community was founded by Loyalists who had fought for Britain (in return for their freedom) in the American Revolutionary War in the late 1700s, or who became refugees after the War of 1812.
Later, as every Canadian school child learns, Nova Scotia was one of the destinations of the Underground Railroad, the heroic effort to rescue U.S. slaves. Fewer people know how pre-Confederation British governors and their Canadian successors reneged on promises of decent land to the Loyalist blacks. They faced segregation and economic persecution. Canada's first race riot took place in 1784 when impoverished whites drove blacks from Shelburne and tore down their houses.
Many returned to the United States after Emancipation. A few hundred even went to Africa. Most were simply pushed into the hills by the white establishment. Right into the 1960s, they endured Jim Crow laws and segregation, much like blacks in the deep South.
Like Southern blacks, Afro Nova Scotians emerged from the 1800s with unusually high rates of land ownership for a disenfranchised people. And while U.S. blacks lost their farms during Reconstruction, many black Nova Scotians held on to their scrubby plots.
But when they settled in Guysborough County in 1783, the ancestors of the residents of Lincolnville and nearby Upper Big Tracadie were promised 3,000 choice acres near the water, where they could grow crops and fish.
Today they still live on a small fraction of the acreage, with plenty of rocks, clay and bush, miles from the nearest ocean or open field. In fact, instead of viable land to farm or run cattle, the black community got a garbage dump.
GETTING DUMPED ON, IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
About 250 kilometres northeast of Halifax, the massive landfill near Lincolnville will probably endure long after the last family has left the dying village. The windows of James Desmond's small bungalow rattle as garbage trucks rumble past from Cape Breton and more than a dozen northern Nova Scotia counties.
Mr. Desmond has been fighting the dump since the beginning, 40 years ago. Fearing contaminants, he fought the last major expansion in 2006, and is still fighting his lost cause. He now seeks compensation for the 50 residents of his fading town, and tries to make sure a potential tire-recycling plant goes elsewhere.
"We've put up with it for 30 years. Now, it's someone else's turn," Mr. Desmond says. "I'm all in favour of doing something about these first-generation dumps, these environ- mental disasters. But it shouldn't be in our backyard."
Lincolnville is far from the only black Nova Scotian community haunted by refuse. A study in the 1990s found that 30 per cent of Afro-Canadians in the province live within five kilometres of a dump. Several of the biggest black communities have fought off landfill relocations in the past decade.
Lloyd Hines, the white warden of Guysborough County, says race had nothing to do the dump's placement. "It was located based on the greatest scientific evidence of the day, the type of soil in place. It had nothing to do with the fact the Lincolnville community was nearby. It's as simple as that."
But racial dynamics are subtler than that, even in a country where they're often given little thought. "People just don't understand the concept of white privilege," says Rhonda Britton. She sees all around her the way members of the majority are blind to their own inherent, unfair advantage.
A Florida native, she came to Nova Scotia from New York, settling first in New Glasgow and then Halifax, where she became a pastor at Cornwallis Street Baptist Church. When she arrived in New Glasgow in 2003, a new high school was opening that combined black and white New Glasgow students with white children from three smaller towns. Three years of name-calling and schoolyard brawls ensued.
Then there was the time she was congratulated for her mastery of the English language at an otherwise all-white meeting of ministers. Ms. Britton holds two PhDs and spent 20 years as a systems analyst before turning to the ministry.
"I would have expected things to be better here," she says. "I was told, 'In Canada, we're all Canadians.' I was quite surprised to find racial tensions instead."
Mr. Daye, who is encouraging his white, upper-class suburban congregation to reach out to Ms. Britton's black, inner-city church, remains hopeful. But overall, he adds, "there's a reluctance to speak openly in Nova Scotia. It's a Maritime trait in general and is on display with these issues."
Halifax radio host Andrew Krystal says that when he opens the lines on his talk station, he hears nasty hints of his mostly white listeners' beliefs in blacks' inferiority and so-called griping. In general, though, they "tend to be quite cagey about their views," he says, as they know he is sympathetic to the black plight.
Yet Mr. Krystal, who hails from Toronto, also points out that the white majority in Nova Scotia harbours its own legitimate set of grievances.
Many Maritimers feel they have received a raw deal, from Confederation down to the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway, which allowed the industrialization of the baby-boom era to pass them by. The region has chronically fewer jobs and lower incomes than most of Canada.
"Nova Scotians got punked by central Canadian power politics. And because of their own economic marginalization, they don't particularly want to hear about anybody else's shit," Mr. Krystal says.
He adds that "monochrome Nova Scotia's problem with race isn't that different from what you'd find in the white person from Barrie or the 905 [area code in Ontario] or the Frenchman from Laval."
STILL MOURNING A PLACE THEY CALLED HOME
Mr. Krystal used his radio platform to push for an apology and reparations for the notorious Africville demolition. "Maritimers have a much more romantic sense of place than most Canadians. Blacks are no different when it comes to Africville," he says.
Initially started as a rural settlement by black Loyalists around 1815, Africville remained a black community as Halifax grew up around it and a railway was run through it.
Over its 155-year history, it never got proper water, sewage, roads, electricity or health services. By the 1960s, the installation of a garbage dump helped mark the end. When it was appropriated by the city for industrial uses and its close-knit community of 400 dispersed and relocated to private and public housing, all the promises of generous compensation and social support once again came to very little - the city choosing to wipe the slate clean and forget the place it considered a slum.
This February, along with an apology, officials promised to rebuild Africville's central Seaview African Baptist Church as a memorial site, funded by millions of dollars.
"The black community was treated less than respectfully," says Halifax Mayor Peter Kelly, carefully measuring every word. "We certainly would not conduct business that way now. But we must own up to the errors of the past."
Meanwhile, the site remains a monument to disrespect. A dog park sits where Africville once did, and the massive A. Murray MacKay Bridge as well as an onramp, a railway line and massive electricity-transmission towers cut the Seaview Memorial Park in three.
Dressed in a Che Guevara T-shirt, 60-year-old Eddie Carvery is a well-known face who has been camped out down here for the past 16 years, protecting what he considers a sacred trust, even as broken wine bottles collect under an iron sign that marks the spot where the church once stood.
He is one of a handful of dissidents who oppose the Africville settlement, demanding personal compensation for his grandmother's lost land.
"It was always going to be collective reparations," says Irvine Carvery, Eddie's brother and his opponent. The Halifax municipal-housing director, who negotiated the deal as head of the Africville Genealogical Society, is a rising leader in the black community, though his critics accuse him of opportunism. Outside of this issue, he says, he and his brother get along fine.
"This settlement doesn't stop others from hiring a lawyer and suing the city. But a lot of these people are waiting for others to do it."
A RISING PROFESSIONAL CLASS - UP TO A POINT
Mr. Carvery isn't one to wait. Born in Africville and then raised in a housing project, he became a senior city bureaucrat and recently won election as the city's first black school-board president. All around Halifax are signs that black people such as him are slowly taking a greater role in politics and the economy.
Reports from the early 1980s pegged unemployment among Nova Scotia blacks around 50 per cent. That has dropped steadily, according to census results, to 20 per cent in 1996 and 11.8 per cent in 2006 - still three percentage points higher than Nova Scotia over all, but a far cry from 20 years ago, when it was double or triple; it's within one percentage point of the black employment rate in the rest of Canada.
A local business magazine brags of black entrepreneurs starting hair salons, restaurants and construction businesses. But progress often seems tempered by setbacks.
It's not uncommon to see a black firefighter dousing a blaze and Halifax has one of Canada's more diverse police forces, with 40 blacks among 523 officers. But both institutions were hit in the past year with human-rights complaints from black employees, claiming they face frequent racist taunts and are systematically passed over for promotions.
"These things are constant reminders that we have to become better and get beyond some of the old ways," Mr. Kelly says. "We're trying. We have to try harder."
Though the province boasts scores of black teachers, for example, in higher-paying professions the glass ceiling still glares. Twenty-one years after a special black and aboriginal law program was created, the Nova Scotia bar has only four black partners among 476 senior lawyers in legal firms. One black judge was appointed in the 1980s, one in the 1990s, and none since.
In 2008, the chief justice of Nova Scotia, Joseph Kennedy, told the Halifax Chronicle-Herald that the top judges in the province are still "a bunch of old, white guys."
Senator Donald Oliver, who spent 35 years in a Halifax law firm before Brian Mulroney appointed him to the Senate 20 years ago, offers the blunt assessment that as women and members of other visible minorities advance, blacks are being left behind: "The glass ceiling is getting thicker, closer, more difficult to break."
Mr. Oliver's family has had a history of breakthroughs, ever since his grandfather, William White, in the 19th-century became the second black man ever to get a degree from Acadia University. He can rattle off the psychological hurdles facing Nova Scotia blacks - poverty, the absence of role models, an inferiority complex, a historical "latent sense of slavery" - yet has a harder time explaining how his own clan, the only black family in Wolfville when he was growing up, jumped over them.
"There were problems, but Wolfville was an educated community, and it seemed if you had an education, you really were an equal in a sense," he says. "It's all very complex."
THE DOUBLE EDGE OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT
A half-hour drive away from the downtown Halifax church that was led by the preachers of the Oliver family, and is now led by Ms. Britton, sits an impoverished city neighbourhood that looks more like a Saskatchewan Indian reserve. Tidy bungalows sit alongside crumbling shacks fronted with smashed, rusting appliances.
North and East Preston are the heart of Canada's largest, longest-standing black settlement. After 230 years, North Preston's 4,100 residents are still 98 per cent black. Despite bad soil and isolation, the area has a proud history of survival.
Today, its mix of poor and working class families, a few professionals and unusually high levels of home ownership are creating an entirely new dynamic for what is essentially a countryside urban ghetto - rising property values. While people in Preston wrestle with persistent violence, increasing gunplay and other social plagues, a debate is emerging over the merits and the risks of gentrification.
Schoolteacher and activist Doug Sparks describes how his family's 28-acre parcel has been divided since his ancestor, a runaway slave named General Taylor, obtained it in 1816 as a reward for helping the British in the War of 1812. Now, with lots selling for up to $10,000 an acre, residents are feeling the pressure to cash in, he says. Families are being split in disputes over land.
From his kitchen, he points across the street to explain that one side of the road had its name changed from East Preston to Lake Echo. Rev. Richard Preston was a celebrated early leader in the black community, but as nearby white areas expand, the real-estate industry has concluded that his name does nothing for the neighbourhood's cachet.
Mr. Sparks, 44, describes the switch as a "subtle sort of racism." He fears his community will eventually get swallowed up by developers selling the joys of rural living a half-hour from downtown. "The African Nova Scotian community as a whole is going to disappear. That's what I'm seeing."
Back downtown, gentrification is putting a more traditional kind of pressure on another Halifax neighbourhood.
Uniake Square, the project where Irvine Carvery and many other former Africville residents grew up, is a tight-knit place (despite its derisive nickname "Maniac Square" among some Haligonians).
Today, the area is dotted with new co-op housing developments (starting at $128,000 for a one-bedroom) and flanked by tidy residential avenues.
Mr. Carvery figures the house he bought there for $15,000 in 1975 is worth at least 20 times that now. The transition he made from Uniake to owning his own home, he believes, would be nearly impossible now.
GOING FORWARD, CLASHING SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT
On a recent Sunday, in an old high-school gym, Mr. Carvery is officiating a men's adult basketball game. This basketball court is one place in Halifax where blacks rub elbows with white opponents.
"I can't say I haven't seen progress. I have," Mr. Carvery says during a break. "You just have to look around here. It may be a product of gentrification, but this is one of the more integrated neighbourhoods you'll see."
No. 26 on the court, a teacher named Wade Smith, is the vice-principal of Halifax West high school. It's "the most diverse school east of Montreal," he says. Everyone there gets along, he says, but he refuses to make sweeping judgments about progress.
Mr. Smith gained local notoriety in 2006 for suggesting a black school might help students stay in touch with their culture, just as a Jewish or Catholic school does.
He was roundly dismissed and, in a few cases, condemned as a segregationist, even though the same idea has gained traction in many places, including Toronto.
"It's 2010," he says. "There aren't race wars every five minutes, but it would be wishful thinking to believe race issues are gone. Hardly any time has passed at all. There's been not a real attempt to get at true equity since the civil-rights movement. We've only spent 40 years trying to rebuild something that took 500 years to destroy."

Private doesn't pay for CPPIB

Abstract: Mr. [David Denison] said most of the fund's private equity holdings were held outside of Canada, and lost value in 2010 when converted into Canadian dollars for the fund's financial statements. He said private equity and infrastructure had positive returns last year when measured in local countries' currencies.

Full text: Pension fund reports 14.9 per cent gains, asset base climbs back up to $127.6-billion
The Canada Pension Plan fund has poured its energies into private equity investments over the past five years, becoming one of the world's biggest buyers of private companies, real estate and infrastructure assets.
But private equity didn't return the love last year.
The country's largest public pension fund reported Thursday it earned 14.9-per-cent investment gains in fiscal 2010, ended March 31, pushing its asset base up to $127.6-billion - the same level it reached at its peak in June 30, 2008, just before it was hit by the global market crash that sent its assets tumbling to $105.6-billion.
The recovery was no thanks to private holdings, however, which far underperformed the fund's larger portfolio of public company shares, bonds and other debt.
While shares of Canadian public companies posted gains of 43.7 per cent last year, for example, private equity holdings in Canada climbed by 13 per cent. Foreign public equities in developed countries were up 24.7 per cent, while foreign private equities fell by 9.4 per cent.
Emerging market equities posted an even greater disparity in returns, with public equities climbing 46 per cent while private equity dropped by 4.3 per cent.
Even public real estate holdings climbed last year by 19.3 per cent, while private real estate lost 11.8 per cent in value. Infrastructure holdings fell by 6.5 per cent.
Despite the drag on returns last year, however, the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board remains convinced its shift toward private holdings will be a superior investment choice over the longer term, chief executive officer David Denison said Thursday.
"We do believe private assets and infrastructure will outperform the public markets," he said.
Mr. Denison said most of the fund's private equity holdings were held outside of Canada, and lost value in 2010 when converted into Canadian dollars for the fund's financial statements. He said private equity and infrastructure had positive returns last year when measured in local countries' currencies.
Private equity holdings are also less volatile, and could not match gains of over 40 per cent in public stock markets last year, said Mark Wiseman, CPPIB's executive vice-president of private investments.
"It just takes longer for those values to be realized in those types of assets. You're not marking them to market on a daily basis," he said. "You will see those assets catch up over the long term."
The CPPIB was launched in 2000 with a mandate to invest the assets of the Canada Pension Plan to earn returns needed to pay benefits over the next 75 years. In its early years, the fund invested passively in indexed securities, but launched a far more active investment strategy in 2005 as its asset levels soared.
Since then, the fund's returns have lagged a reference portfolio based on passive investments in market indices. But Mr. Denison said it will take at least 10 years to decide on the success of the active investment strategy.
The CPPIB completed 37 private asset deals last year worth a total of $7-billion, and was a lead investor in three of the five largest private equity deals in the world last year. It does not anticipate duplicating that pace of investing in private deals this year, Mr. Wiseman said, because many competitors have returned to the markets this year.

The roots of comedy run deep in Canada.
Despite our fabled politeness and insecurities about living next door to America, we remain a nation that likes to laugh and, perhaps more tellingly, to make other people laugh. As with real estate, location is everything.
"Canada itself is in such a ideal place for comedy," says Samantha Bee, the Toronto-born correspondent on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart . "We're at this great intersection of having a little bit of British-ness and a little bit of American-ness. And Canada has these cold, dark winters, so what else is there to do? Play the fiddle by firelight?"
Arguably the funniest Canadian woman currently on American television, Bee and her husband, fellow Daily Show correspondent Jason Jones - who proudly hails from Hamilton - host The Canadian Comedy Awards 10th Anniversary Special (Saturday, Comedy Network at 10 p.m.).
Taped last fall at Toronto's Masonic Temple, the special showcases several Beaver Award-winning stand-up comedians from the past decade (yes, it's really called the Beaver Award). But disregard the program's title: no actual trophies are handed out.
"When we agreed to host, we sure thought it was an awards show," says the 40-year-old Bee, laughing over the line from her Manhattan home. "To tell you the truth, we didn't really understand what it was, but we had a game-plan going in."
Bee and Jones make a perfectly charming team on the non-awards show, which includes turns from comedians such as Nathan MacIntosh, Graham Clark, Kate Davis, Tim Steeves and the sketch troupe The Imponderables. The tender median age of the talent was not lost on Bee.
"They're all so young and so funny," she says. "Sometimes I feel I can't relate to them at all. They're like creatures from another planet, these young whippersnappers."
Look who's talking. Bee's own comedy leanings began in grade school, courtesy of reruns of the seminal Canadian comedy series SCTV . "I was so into SCTV as a kid," she says. "It aired every day at 6:30 p.m. and I watched it every day. Catherine O'Hara was my idol."
Oddly enough, Bee never explored the performing arts until her later years of university, and her first instinct was toward serious drama. "I told myself: 'I'm going to be the most amazing Lady Macbeth. I know I'm small, but I'm powerful.' And then nobody took me seriously, which was a reflection of how bad an actor I was. I feel like the world told me to go into comedy," she says.
When Bee did make that move, it was to join a Toronto-based all-female improvisational group called The Atomic Fireballs (the members are briefly reunited onstage in the awards special). "For years we were constantly working on shows or putting on shows," she says. "And we certainly weren't making any money. That sort of comedy is tremendous fun and makes you a better person, but it's hard work. You have to love it."
Bee was still honing her improv skills with the Fireballs in Toronto cabarets when she was invited to join The Daily Show in 2003. Unlike most of her all-male co-workers (she was the only female correspondent on the show until Kristen Schaal signed in 2008), Bee was not a comedian, but simply a funny lady. She had never even tried standup.
"I have great admiration for standups," she says, "but it was not something I ever aspired to because, frankly, the lifestyle did not appeal to me. There's so much travel in the beginning, and for no money. You're up late every night. It's exhausting. I'm much too lazy."
Similarly, her husband was a sketch-comedy player before The Daily Show . One of the funniest segments on the Canadian Comedy Awards special has Jones attempting a standup routine, which includes his lame observations on iPods ("How stupid is that? They don't go in your eyes. They go in your ears!"). All the while, his wife glowers at him from the wings. "It's so painful," Bee groans.
In between her Daily Show duties, Bee has blocked out the next month to promote her new book, I Know I Am But What Are You? , which arrives in stores on June 1.
"Mostly it's embarrassing stories about me coming up in the world," she says. "It's a departure from what I do on the show. This is personal and I hope people find my life funny."
The bigger news: Bee and Jones, already the proud parents of a four-year-old daughter, Piper, and a two-year-old son, Fletcher, have baby number three scheduled for arrival this August. "We're just procreating like we're farmers and need someone to work the onion fields," says Bee cheerfully.
Even then, the fake news must go on - Bee plans to file reports for The Daily Show until the last possible minute.
"When I had Fletcher, I went into labour at work," says Bee. "The medical system is different here and you only get eight weeks or so for maternity leave. If you take your mat leave when the baby is not actually emerging, you're wasting your time off."

Established around the late 1940s, Parkview Hills is a small low-rise community nearly surrounded by ravine and parkland. Its secluded and scenic locale is one of the many reasons residents tend to stay in their homes for decades, including the sellers of this three-bedroom bungalow.
"It's a very quiet, very low-traffic neighbourhood," says agent Lina Risi, who received three offers from local buyers. "There's conformity throughout all the street, good schools and good access to the ravine."
For 37 years, the previous occupied this brick residence, which is in fairly original condition with vinyl floors in the eat-in kitchen and carpeting in the bedrooms, formal dining room and a living room with a wood burning fireplace.
There is an updated four-piece bathroom on the main level and a three-piece version on the lower level, which has a separate side entrance, one bedroom, a paneled den and an eat-in kitchen stocked with appliances.
"The basement needed some work, otherwise, the rest of the home was in good shape," adds Ms. Risi. "It was well kept and well loved."
Outdoor assets include a wide backyard with a shed and a long private driveway.

Listing agents: Honey Moore and Andrea Stark, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
About 16 years ago, this North Toronto home was custom-built with an unconventional design to maximize the amount of living space and natural light inside, agent Honey Moore explains.
The 2,348-square-foot house has a side centre-hall plan with the main entrance off the driveway and more windows facing south rather than east towards the street. "As a result, it gets a lot of light," says Ms. Moore. "The bay window in the living room faces the front."
The interior also feels more spacious with nine-foot ceilings in most areas and a sky-lit cathedral ceiling in the master bedroom. "The high ceilings everybody really liked," says Ms. Moore.
Other highlights include a foyer flanked by entrances to the front living room and a rear family room with a gas fireplace, built-in media unit and French doors to the galley kitchen.
The cooking space, which can also be entered via the dining room, features upscale appliances, including a gas cooktop and two wall ovens, and ceramic floors.
By the breakfast area, windows frame the door to the private patio and detached double garage, "which is very rare for the area," Ms. Moore adds.
Amid the three bedrooms on the second floor, there are two out of four bathrooms, including a six-piece master ensuite.
Unlike the hardwood floors throughout the main floor, carpeting covers the upper and lower level, which contains a nanny suite, an L-shaped recreation room and a wine cellar. "It's an added extra," says Ms. Moore. "There's a huge amount of storage space in that house."
Central vacuum and in-ground sprinkler systems allow for easy maintenance.
Local amenities include shops, restaurants and grocers on Bayview Avenue, as well as parks, schools and public transit.

The case for Winnipeg

Author: White, Patrick

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/case-winnipeg/docview/276148986/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "I'll admit I'm a little perplexed about the economics behind this," said University of Manitoba sports economist Ian Hudson, of the True North bid for the Phoenix Coyotes.

Full text:   Putting the Coyotes or another NHL in the city makes business sense to Chipman, Thomson
For a fleeting moment, the whole modest city broke into swagger.
A 15-year mourning period had lifted, as once forlorn Winnipeg Jets fans were talking openly about who the team should pick up in the off-season and how much they would pay for season tickets.
The tired barroom quarrels over who was to blame for the team's exit turned into unbridled adoration for the white knights trying to land the team here again: local business and hockey mogul Mark Chipman and David Thomson, Canada's richest man.
But even as the city council vote in Glendale, Ariz., on Tuesday quashed any hope of the Phoenix Coyotes returning to Winnipeg - at least for this year - questions remain about why two sharp businessmen and their True North Sports & Entertainment company would bother trying to put NHL hockey in a city whose size and prosperity hasn't changed much since scant crowds and heavy debt forced the Jets out of town a decade and a half ago.
"I'll admit I'm a little perplexed about the economics behind this," said University of Manitoba sports economist Ian Hudson, of the True North bid for the Phoenix Coyotes. "Often sports teams and good economics do not lie comfortably together. Sports ownership is littered with the ranks of people who lose money and don't mind."
But the True North titans are a little different than ego-driven owners such as George Steinbrenner or Mark Cuban. Neither Chipman (a guy doesn't even have a Wikipedia entry) nor Thomson (referred to so often as "the reclusive billionaire" that it's become cliché) exude such bravado.
"These are two very savvy businessmen," said Darren Ford, operator of jetsowner.com, a site hosting a well-cited business case for returning the Jets to Winnipeg. "They have learned from [failed Coyotes suitor] Jim Balsillie that you want to do this low-key and by the book."
Their business acumen makes the plan all the more puzzling. True North's current revenue pillars - the 15,000-seat MTS Centre and the AHL's Manitoba Moose - earn the company a tidy profit. The MTS Centre continually ranks as the country's third-busiest entertainment complex in Canada (behind only Bell Centre in Montreal and Air Canada Centre in Toronto) - even though the region's market size ranks eighth in the country.
Chipman has snuffed out any investor reluctance to modifying that money-making formula. He recently bought out the last of several prominent Winnipeg businessmen who invested in the arena's construction 10 years ago.
Only one of Chipman's original partners remains: Osmington Inc., Thomson's real-estate company, which also owns buildings surrounding the MTS Centre.
And that could help explain Thomson's interest. The arrival of an NHL franchise could only boost the value of his holdings in a city in which his family once owned one of the country's most profitable daily papers, the Winnipeg Free Press, and where he was spotted enjoying a Leonard Cohen concert last year.
Aside from Thomson's affection for the city, a Jets homecoming is starting to make strong financial sense as well. When the team left in 1996, a sagging loonie made paying a U.S.-dollar payroll onerous. Dollar parity changes everything.
What's more, the new ownership model - whereby True North holds both team and building - jettisons financial deadweight such as lease payments and a lack of gate and concession revenue that led to million-dollar losses for that team almost every season of its 17-year NHL existence.
"Owning the building makes a huge difference," said Stacey Brook, a sports economist at the University of Iowa. "In the end, you put a team on the ice so that you can sell hot dogs and drinks and big foam fingers. That's where the money is."
Brook pointed out that the Minnesota North Stars moved to Dallas because, in part, of an abysmal lease agreement. Under a far more favourable deal, the state's new team, the Wild, are thriving.
Since the Jets skipped town, the NHL has also introduced a revenue-sharing agreement that buoys the fortunes of smaller-market teams.
Still, Brook, who was once such a big Jets fan that he asked his wife if he could name all their children Teemu after former Jets star Teemu Selanne, isn't hopeful that True North group will establish a long-lasting NHL franchise in Winnipeg.
He's aware of several reports suggesting Thomson will hold the team in Winnipeg only until a more lucrative spot opens up in Southern Ontario.
A source close to Chipman called that idea "absolutely false" and local fans continually dismiss it.

Abstract: Thinking about the future of journalism these days makes my mouth go dry and my left eye twitch - but not Dinnick. Here's a guy who, as Middle East correspondent for CNN, would find himself on the road for a month at a stretch covering stories in China, Africa, Iraq and Afghanistan. It was a stressful job, but did he spend his evenings at the bar swilling scotch like a character out of a Graham Greene novel? Nope.

It's a whole new media world out there and Wilf Dinnick is planning to take it over - one local story at a time.
The Toronto-bred newsman, who you might remember from his days on CBC television and later at Global, ABC and CNN, is about to launch a new Toronto-based website that, he says, "inverts the traditional model of reporting" and reinvents journalism as we know it.
Now, I'm not sure whether to react to this news with gratitude or narrow-eyed skepticism, so instead I'll do what any good reporter does: simply try to understand.
Thinking about the future of journalism these days makes my mouth go dry and my left eye twitch - but not Dinnick. Here's a guy who, as Middle East correspondent for CNN, would find himself on the road for a month at a stretch covering stories in China, Africa, Iraq and Afghanistan. It was a stressful job, but did he spend his evenings at the bar swilling scotch like a character out of a Graham Greene novel? Nope. Instead, the war correspondent and teetotaller holed himself up in his hotel room and tried to think of a way to secure the future of journalism in a digital world, which is a fancy way of saying he was hoping to save his job. "When I started at ABC, there were 15 people in the bureau and now there are only three and how often do they even get on air?" he said in a phone interview this week. "I just saw the writing on the wall - they weren't putting the money there. They were putting all the money on the Web."
Dinnick's response to this development - OpenFile, which goes live on Monday - is a news source that lets journalists look to users for story ideas and commentary rather than the other way around. While the typical online news model allows users to simply log on to a given site, check out the stories of the day and perhaps leave a comment, visitors to OpenFile are invited to open a file to "start" a local story of their own. Other community users can then share and add to the file and, if the site editors decide it's a worthy endeavour, OpenFile will dispatch a real live professional to follow up with a properly researched and reported story. The official report will then be published on the site as a kind of document of record.
Dinnick was so taken with the notion that he decided to get out of traditional journalism altogether. Just over a year ago, he quit his job in TV and moved with his family back to Toronto from Dubai. (His wife, Sonia Verma, now works as a reporter for this paper.) After doing some research, he sketched out a model that reflected his "ultimate journalistic wish list," which included "total transparency, a story that never dies and crowd sourcing."
In essence, he says, "the idea was to match social media with professional journalism."
With this concept in hand, Dinnick enlisted the help of two other journalists (former Toronto Star editor Kathy Vey and technology and media writer Craig Silverman), hired a chief financial officer and went out hat in hand. After pitching the idea around Bay Street, he received several million dollars of angel investment from an anonymous Canadian corporate backer. Unafraid to boast, Dinnick describes the site as "one of the biggest media ventures in Canada since the launch of the National Post."
But don't mistake OpenFile for an online newspaper. In fact, the project has more in common with Wikipedia or craigslist than it does with The New York Times. It is also part of a larger online trend that includes sites like Spot.Us, where users raise money for investigative reports into issues they care about. Over all, the OpenFile model is more community bulletin board than national broadsheet, which is why it lends itself so well to local stories - and, by extension, targeted niche advertising.
To cite a favourite catchphrase of the current new-media universe, Dinnick's idea depends on the prominence of "user-generated content," but there's a big difference between selling your bike on Craigslist and breaking a serious news story in a balanced, responsible way. Dinnick insists that his site is not about citizen journalism so much as the marriage of user participation with professional editorial standards. And that, of course, brings us to the nagging question of credibility.
How, for instance, will an operation like OpenFile navigate the torrent of paranoia, misinformation, abuse and blather that often exists online in order to find the real stories? The answer is not entirely clear. Dinnick says he plans to "set the tone" early by completing user identity checks and blocking racists, sexists and general haters from using the site for good. But one wonders how, with a total staff of seven, he can possibly tame the beast if it grows exponentially, as he hopes it will. Ultimately, the credibility and viability of a venture like OpenFile will be up to users themselves - and by that I mean the public.
Of course, it's easy to imagine such a site degenerating into a stultifying maze of message boards dominated by local cranks once the floodgates are opened. At the same time, though, it is undeniably compelling in its optimism. Why not let local people decide what matters most in their communities? Who says only journalists should decide the stories of the day? In essence, Dinnick is suggesting a new kind of social contract between the third and fourth estate, one in which both sides communicate with honesty, integrity and respect.
"Journalists are not longer the voices of God and traditional media are no longer the gatekeepers of news," he says, making my mouth dry and my left eye twitch. But what else is new?

Everybody ready for Mother's Day? If you're fortunate enough to still have your mom in your life, do something nice for her tomorrow. Should your plans involve going out for Sunday brunch, do not take her to a restaurant with plastic forks and a kids' play area. And if you're dropping over for a visit and possibly some TV-watching, at least allow her to select the program. Curiously, there's little specific Mother's Day programming this weekend, save for a marathon of Party Mamas (Sunday, Slice at 8 a.m.). If you really care about your mother, direct her toward this weekend's top viewing picks, which include a touching documentary on Haiti, a beloved octogenarian hosting Saturday Night Live , and the final leg of TV's pre-eminent scavenger hunt.
Rescued
Saturday, 8 p.m., CNN
Hosted by CNN anchor Soledad O'Brien - who seems to pull all the tough assignments - this hour-long documentary explores the plight of orphaned Haitian children. Perhaps the most startling fact: CNN began filming the report months before the horrific earthquake last Jan. 12, when there were already scores of orphans roaming the streets of Port-au-Prince and other cities; the footage filmed since then is positively heart-wrenching. At times accompanied by Haitian-born author Edwidge Danticat, who left the island as a teenager, O'Brien visits those areas where the need for financial aid appears most urgent. She relates the postquake carnage from the perspective of two orphans, Cendy and Marc, the latter rescued from a child-slavery ring. Both children were recently taken into an orphanage run by two American missionaries and have a shot at some kind of half-decent future. Hundreds of thousands of other Haitian orphans are not nearly as lucky.
Saturday Night Live
Saturday, 11:30 p.m., Global, NBC
Have a nap or put on the coffee, but try to stay up late to watch Betty White's host turn on tonight's edition of the long-running comedy-musical series. As the entire world knows, Ms. White, who turned 88 in January, was unwittingly thrust into the SNL host role by a massive Facebook campaign. Now that she has it, what should viewers expect? A sketch with White reprising her randy Sue Ann Nivens persona from The Mary Tyler Moore Show is practically a given. And don't be surprised if the writers revisit her eighties heyday as one of The Golden Girls . And dare we hope White crosses paths with Kristen Wiig's Gilly? The show's musical guest is Jay-Z and there's a Mother's Day theme that will bring back ex- SNL ers Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph and Ana Gasteyer. Keep in mind this is a live broadcast, though if anyone slips up and drops an expletive, it will likely be Betty herself. You go, girl.
The Amazing Race 16
Sunday, 8 p.m., CTV, CBC
Need further proof that Donald Trump is a buffoon? Only last week, the real-estate mogul and Celebrity Apprentice host was griping about The Amazing Race winning the Emmy for best reality series for seven straight years - every year since the category was created, in fact. The Donald doth protest too much, methinks. The Amazing Race is coming off one of its liveliest and best-rated seasons to date. The contestants have travelled nearly 40,000 miles. This Sunday's finale covers the last leg in San Francisco and trains closely on the three remaining two-person teams. Will it be the combative Rhode Island brothers Dan and Jordan? The dating models Brent and Caite from South Carolina? Or the cowpoke Oklahoma brothers Jet and Cord? Details of the finale are top secret, but there is apparently some extreme ugliness when one team cuts in front of another before the finish line. The winning duo collects a cool $1-million (U.S.), and unlike on Celebrity Apprentice , nothing is scripted, refilmed or faked. Et tu, Trump?
Check local listings.
John Doyle returns on May 13.

If you wanted the job done, 'Chester was the guy'

Full text:   From forestry to energy to airports to resorts, he was the go-to guy who got results. And he wasn't afraid to ruffle a few feathers along the way to make things happen, if that's what it would take
Chester Johnson may not have been the most loved among his generation of British Columbia rainmakers, but when it came to getting results, he was definitely one of the most revered.
When he died on March 29 at the age of 84, he had had a hand in many of the things that define the province today.
He helped establish the forestry sector; virtually saved Whistler from bankruptcy; turned BC Hydro from a money guzzler into a money maker; developed Vancouver International Airport into one of the finest in North America and was chairman of the Haida Power Authority. He even started a winery.
It wasn't always pretty, especially for those who were left in the wake of his restructurings. But he was effective.
"He didn't like waste and he didn't like abuse of shareholder money or government money and he would clean the closet fast," says Nairne Gray, a protegé of Johnson's who is now managing director of IFP Canada Corp. "If you wanted a job to get done, Chester was the guy to do it."
Chester Allison Johnson was born on Nov. 1, 1925, in Vancouver. His father, Alfred, was a senior manager in what was then the Merchant Bank of Canada. His mother, Mildred, was a nurse before marrying.
Young Chester grew up as the middle of three boys in a family with a true West Coast pedigree. His maternal grandfather, William, was a successful businessman who owned stores across Canada that carried McClary stoves, then lost nearly everything in 1929.
"I think I got my gambling spirit and my own sense of intuition from him," Johnson said in a memoir completed three days before his death.
His paternal grandfather, Peter, was a Swedish sea captain who landed in Vancouver in the 1880s. He commanded steamships that carried passengers to the Klondike gold rush. His grandmother Ada, who came to Vancouver from England, was a "real fireball," Johnson recalled, "very strong-willed and controlling, with a fiery temper. In fact, I think I take after her."
From his more conservative banker father, he learned lessons in prudence that would temper his feistier side.
When he was but 6, his father took him to downtown Vancouver for a first-hand look at the 1932 Hunger March, where 15,000 men headed to City Hall to demand relief from the deprivations of the Great Depression. He watched as mounted officers rode into the crowd, smashing heads with their swinging clubs.
Horrified, young Chester asked why he had been brought to witness such a scene. His father replied that he wanted him to see what happens when politicians and financiers make mistakes.
"I want you to understand that anything you do in life, if you fail, if you make the wrong decision, somebody is going to get hurt," his father said. "You've got to do it right."
While the Johnson family weathered the Depression in relative comfort, its middle child never forgot the sight of those ragged, hungry men.
Johnson graduated from high school in 1943, signed up for the Royal Canadian Air Force and headed to Toronto for pilot's training. Unfortunately, his shoulder was permanently damaged in a fall during an ill-advised training exercise. A dislocated ankle suffered during a basketball game led to a medical discharge.
Instead, he went back to school, graduating with honours in 1946 with a BA in commerce from the University of British Columbia.
He started work as a clerk for W.F. Gibson & Sons, which ran three small logging companies, but walked out six months later after being chastised for reading the company's confidential financial statements.
Clerking was not for him; he wanted to know how the money was made.
Johnson became a chartered accountant in 1952, then went to work at Gunderson, Stokes, Walton & Co. as a consultant, helping companies manage their businesses. A year later he became a partner.
One of his clients was the legendary forestry mogul H.R. MacMillan. Crunching those numbers was an eye-opener about just how much money could be made in lumber.
Another important client was the hardware chain owned by the family of W.A.C. Bennett, who started a 20-year reign as B.C.'s Social Credit premier in 1952.
Bill Bennett, W.A.C.'s son, who himself became premier in 1975, didn't like the young consultant much when they first met: "Here was this pushy guy telling us how to run our business," he says in the memoir, produced by Echo Memoirs of Vancouver. But the two eventually became friends.
In 1953, Johnson married Janis Ingledew, whose father owned Ingledew's Shoes, a Vancouver institution.
"He probably thought I was not worthy of his daughter since he was the well-to-do successful business owner and I was just a CA," Johnson later said.
But he would not be "just a CA" for long. By 1959, he went on his own as a consultant and began investing in businesses.
He and Janis bought a big home on prestigious Sentinel Hill. In 1960 they adopted baby boy Garfield, and then baby girl Susan in 1962.
Johnson started his climb as a business star when he was hired as a consultant by Whonnock Lumber Co. By 1966, he and a partner owned a controlling interest.
Under his command, Whonnock prospered and went public, raising funds to expand. In 1971, it bought Weldco Ltd., a logging equipment manufacturer. It acquired interior lumber companies and changed its name to Whonnock Industries Ltd., with Johnson as CEO.
Through the seventies, he increased annual sales from $6-million to $191-million. He was a hard driver and his management mantra worked: Choose the right people, let them run things and pay them well.
His working world was one of hard hats, roll-up-the-sleeves number crunching, long hours, whisky and cigars. But he also treasured family time at his beloved cottage on Chain Lake, 40 kilometres northeast of Princeton, B.C.
He started Fibreco Export to export wood chips and worked with Sam Ketcham, head of West Fraser Timber, to find buyers in Japan. "He had an awesome reputation as a tough operator," recalled his trusted project manager Henry Wakabayaksi, "but we always got on very well."
Johnson made his first lump-sum million when he sold Whonnock to Sauder Industries in 1977. Later, he said he would have gotten much richer had he kept control of Whonnock by buying out the other shareholders. But at the time, he thought it too risky.
In early 1980, he got a call from Pete Ketcham of West Fraser, which had lost CEO Sam Ketcham in a helicopter crash in 1977. New management was not working out and the first family of lumber needed his help. As the new CEO of West Fraser, Johnson set out to resolve legal problems, help the company weather the recession of the early eighties and to make it grow.
At the same time he was building a reputation as B.C.'s corporate Mr. Fix-It, he was also getting involved in politics, raising funds for Bill Bennett, who had won W.A.C.'s seat in 1973. He eventually became Bennett's go-to guy in the private sector, making him a powerful backroom player.
"Chester was a pretty wealthy guy," notes Gray. "But he was more powerful than wealthy. He loved the power and he used it."
Johnson's political connections soon allowed him to add Saviour of Troubled Public Entities to his resumé.
In 1983, Bennett created Whistler Land Co. Developments as a Crown corporation to take over the insolvent Whistler Village Land Co., and put Johnson in charge. He didn't pay him, but he gave him free rein.
Johnson's first order of business was to sideline local politicians who got in his way. Then he set about seeing what could be made of the situation - a stalled arena, half-finished hotels and condos, and piles of debt.
He decided what Whistler needed was a convention centre. He told Bennett he would need at least $21-million, and he got it, laying the foundation for what Whistler was to become.
In 1984, Bennett put Johnson on the board of BC Hydro.
The giant utility was bleeding cash - it had $8-billion in long-term debt. With the era of large dams coming to an end, it had also lost its focus.
When its chairman Robert Bonner fell into legal trouble over a land deal, Johnson was sent to fire him and was put at the helm with a $50,000-a-year salary. It was much less than could be made in the private sector, but he relished the opportunity.
"I told the premier I would do it," Johnson recalled. "But I was certain it was going to be hard and unpleasant. They were spending money like drunk sailors, it was bloated, hidebound and chock full of employees twiddling their thumbs."
The utility had already shrunk from 10,000 employees to 7,500 through layoffs and early retirements. But when Johnson came in swinging the axe, another 1,000 were gone, mainly engineers.
"I did what I had to do," he recalled, "but I didn't like it."
He got rid of the executive jets and the swanky executive dining room on the 21st floor.
"The executives," he said, "can eat down in the cafeteria with everybody else."
He transformed the bureaucratic dam builder into a lean energy marketer. Things were going well, but when Bennett announced his retirement and Bill Vander Zalm became premier in 1986, Johnson knew he wouldn't stay long at Hydro.
He never liked or trusted Vander Zalm and shared Bennett's prescient musings that his ascendancy would be the beginning of the end of the Socreds, which came to pass.
Johnson was also dealing with family problems and health issues. He had a quadruple bypass in October and announced his resignation at the end of the year.
Before he left, however, there was another high-profile provincial cleanup job to do, one that would test the integrity of all involved.
He was put in charge of a group charged with tearing down Expo 86. With so many government and other organizations involved, it was a tricky exercise. Auctioning off the pavilions and their contents went smoothly.
But 200 acres of Expo lands were a different matter. After receiving offers from developers, the board got its highest bid - $320-million - from Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing. But Vander Zalm wanted to see the land go to a friend, an effort that would lead to a political scandal. The board prevented that, and was fired.
Johnson went on to another forestry giant that needed help. Western Pulp Ltd., part of a logging empire run by his long-time friend Herb Doman, was having trouble keeping up with foreign competition, and Doman asked him to step in. He rationalized operations, decreased production at money-losing operations and introduced new products.
"He really pulled the coals out of the fire for us," said Jack Abercrombie, an executive with the company at that time.
Johnson eventually had a falling out with Doman over succession issues and his friend's tendency to borrow huge sums of money and take big risks. The company ended up in bankruptcy court with Brascan, the huge Ontario asset-management company, getting the spoils.
It was not an end that Johnson liked to see. Though he could be ruthless in wielding the knife, he saw necessary cutbacks as a pruning exercise that would ultimately help organizations grow. Those who lost jobs at his hand, of course, thought him more a villain than a saviour. But those who worked with him said he did not believe in cutting well-functioning companies simply to squeeze out higher profits.
In his memoir, Johnson talks disapprovingly of Brascan and what it did to a once-proud forestry company he felt still had potential. "They're a bunch of financial people, they're not operators ... they've taken every one of those assets down to nothing."
Johnson's last high-profile public job, leading negotiations to transfer responsibility of Vancouver International Airport from Ottawa to the province, started in 1988. "It was like an elephant fighting a mouse," he recalled. "And we were the mouse."
Finally, in April, 1992, the deal was done and he went forward with a multimillion-dollar expansion.
His crowning achievement was commissioning the multimillion-dollar bronze casting, Spirit of Haida Gwaii, the Jade Canoe , by renowned Haida artist Bill Reid, now a centrepiece of the airport.
In retirement, he worked with the Haida on land claims and economic development issues and indulged in one of his favourite passions - fishing. His son Garfield said the last time he went - after many heart operations - he had to be strapped into the boat in his wheelchair.
Johnson called the memoir, co-written with Vancouver writer Will Peacock, Doing It Right - and with the exception of a disastrous real estate investment in Mexico and selling some businesses too soon, he mainly did.
He wasn't afraid, though, to say so when he got it wrong. At the end of his life, he said he realized he hadn't handled family problems right. Though happily remarried, he regretted the bitterness caused by his divorce from Janis, which was finalized in 1991 after much legal wrangling. He also said he regretted mistakes he made during his daughter Susan's teenage-rebellion years. And he felt bad that he hadn't patched things up with Herb Doman.
There was definitely a softer side to the hard-driving Mr. Fix-It, something Garfield said was there but that most people never got to see.
Jack Munro, former president of International Forestry Workers Canada, tells a story from the 1980s when one of his members, who was on strike, had his hydro cut off because he couldn't pay the bill. Johnson, whom he knew well from the forestry industry, was running BC Hydro at the time so Munro gave him a call. The next day, a memo went out from the chairman's office saying that no striking forestry worker was to have power cut off until after the strike was settled.
"I would say that Chester had a better feel for the people who worked for him than some of the CEOs," Munro said. "He did things the way he wanted to do them. He was Chester."
Chester Johnson leaves his son Garfield, his daughter Susan, his wife Doreen, his stepchildren and eight grandchildren.

After a series of renovations were completed more than a decade ago, this roughly 50-year-old house now has a spacious four-bedroom plan with a main-floor family room, says agent Bill Thom.
"It looks kind of odd from the outside,... but for the price in the area, it's a pretty sizable home," says Mr. Thom, who received multiple offers within days. "Most [houses] have three-bedrooms ... and without family rooms either."
The family room here is a sunken space in the rear addition, complete with a wood-burning fireplace and new sliding doors to the recently extended deck. "These are - among many things - the selling features," says Mr. Thom.
A skylight illuminates the eat-in kitchen and the upper landing to the carpeted bedrooms, including an enlarged master suite with a walk-in closet and access to the largest of four bathrooms.

The basement is set up as a one-bedroom suite with one bathroom, a kitchen and a fireside recreation room with a side entrance. "It could be an in-law suite or [generate] income," says Mr. Thom.
As for cosmetic improvements, the sellers installed new strip hardwood floors on the main floor, bathroom fixtures and kitchen cabinetry last year. The roof and garage door were also replaced and the private driveway repaved.
A sample of local amenities and attractions nearby consist of schools, recreation facilities and Yonge Street shops, restaurants and a hub for Toronto Transit, York Region Transit and GO Transit buses. "It's a convenient location to the subway," adds Mr. Thom.

A textured Modern

Abstract: "Essentially there aren't many people in Victoria doing nice modernist houses, so that's a niche we have been able to fill," says Mr. de Hoog. "It's not that it hasn't happened in the past. Around the city there are some incredible Moderne or Art deco style houses."

Full text:   The new Gonzales Beach House by architects Peter de Hoog and Charles Kierulf keeps alive a housing style overshadowed by an abundance of arts and craft. Kerry Gold reports
In Victoria, a city better known for grand old houses that make for perfect bed and breakfasts, there is a growing appreciation for modernist housing.
"It's surprising that people don't understand that there was a very strong modernist movement in Victoria," says heritage consultant Donald Luxton, who has been documenting Victoria's modernist houses since 2006. "There is lots of it."
Because of the city's long-standing efforts at heritage preservation, Victoria has some of the best examples of modernist housing in North America, says Mr. Luxton.
And the style has made enough of a comeback that new examples of modernist houses are emerging in neighbourhoods better known for arts and crafts mansions.
"Modernist stuff is coming back in a big way, it's the hottest thing," says Mr. Luxton. "As with anything, if it hangs on long enough, people will like the style again."
Architects Peter de Hoog and Charles Kierulf most often work on commercial projects, such as the upcoming redevelopment of the Royal B.C. Museum. But the partners have recently been taking advantage of the new demand in Victoria for modernist homes.
"Essentially there aren't many people in Victoria doing nice modernist houses, so that's a niche we have been able to fill," says Mr. de Hoog. "It's not that it hasn't happened in the past. Around the city there are some incredible Moderne or Art deco style houses."
De Hoog & Kierulf's latest homage to the style is what they call the Gonzales Beach House, a major project that took two years to build on the side of a sloping property overlooking the popular beach. With its flat roof, natural materials and generous use of glass and light, the house exemplifies the modernist movement, but with more contemporary textures.
Although the neighbours might not have appreciated the lengthy time it took for construction, at least one neighbour was grateful for the design.
"When the neighbour across the street realized it was going to be a flat roofed house, he said 'thank you, thank you,' because he was able to maintain his view over the house to the water," says Mr. Kierulf. "Had it been a big peaked roof arts and crafts house, he would have lost that view."
Victoria's love of modernist housing goes back 60 years. The movement took hold after World War II, when there was a population boom that resulted in the building of new subdivisions. The new younger residents were more open to the contemporary architecture of the time, and there was an emerging new crop of architects ready to supply it. What has become known as the West Coast Style developed in the 50s and 60s, identified by modular post-and-beam structures with sloped or flat roofs, lots of windows and light, and exposed materials like stone, wood and slate. The look borrowed from the style of American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, and showed up in the work of B.C. architects such as Arthur Erickson, Ron Thom, John Di Castri, John Wade, and Sharp & Thompson, Berwick, Pratt.
Although threatened by new development, many of the stellar examples of modernist houses and commercial buildings have survived and are being appreciated again.
"A lot of those 50s and early 60s houses are being maintained or renovated. Not all renovations are sympathetic to the originals. But they are generally being kept up," says Mr. Kierulf.
The 4,267 sq. ft. Gonzales Beach House is all glass, concrete and cedar, built into a hill on a narrow lot. Because of the lot's narrow width, the garage had to be built facing the street. As a result, the master bedroom is above the garage, and the whole structure is as much of a feature as the rest of the house, with a roof that appears to float because of the band of glass that runs under it.
"Access to the house is off to the side as opposed to the street, so you get a glimpse of the view as you go into the entrance, and then you get a very dramatic exposure to water and mountains. It's a very nice element of unfolding view and surprise," says Mr. de Hoog.
They say that while the style of the house is similar to something by legendary architect Erickson, theirs differs slightly because of its more polished texture.
"There was more rough wood use than the finely finished wood we use today," says Mr. de Hoog. "Conceptually, it's not that much different, but the finish level is different."
The homeowners, who prefer to remain anonymous, chose a modern style that would combine the indoor with the outdoor, and use natural local materials such as marble from a local quarry and wood from Vancouver Island.
The architects weren't at liberty to reveal the budget to build the house, but Mr. de Hoog said it cost "in the millions."
Today's custom built modern houses are big budget because of their uniqueness and the quality of construction and materials.
"There's no money in cookie cutter," says Mr. de Hoog. "You may as well go hang out on a beach. You could never charge what it takes to do those kinds of houses. The house has to get to a certain scale in terms of its value. Otherwise, we can't compete.
"For us, if a house isn't about $1 million in construction costs, it's hard to look at it. It takes a lot of work. If someone wants a $350,000 house, that's a developer house. We can't compete with the guys who are cranking those things out."

Abstract: Business incubators can be found in large urban centres, too, he says, but a recent tour of a Toronto incubator taught him something. "It's big. It's got in excess of 35 businesses," he says. "I came back to our committee and said there were about 25 businesses in there that could be here in Halliburton. And if any of those people were interested in a place to establish a different lifestyle, we're the sort of place they'd be able to look to."

Full text:   Small-town incubators help entrepreneurs get started in hopes they'll stay
Mike Jaycock is passionate about the small business startup program he is hatching in the heart of Ontario's cottage country.
As director of the Halliburton Creative Business Incubator, Mr. Jaycock is attracting would-be entrepreneurs to Halliburton County, about 230 kilometres north of Toronto. The program is due to start in June with four new companies ultimately pumping much needed creative energy - and jobs - into the region.
Business incubators provide full support to entrepreneurial startups, with resources and services adapted to that business's needs. The aid flows for a specified period of time, usually two or three years, and mentors offer help in areas such as accounting or marketing. The incubator programs concentrate on businesses suitable to the region, such as information technology, agriculture or renewable energy.
Only a small number of businesses are selected and mentored at any one time, with new applicants taken on after the others "graduate" with stable, viable operations that no longer need help. Participants pay a nominal fee while they take part, and are housed together at a single location.
The result is best shown in the survival rates. According to Industry Canada, about 50 per cent of all new small businesses fail within five years of starting. Business incubation proponents say the success rate for their graduates is about 90 per cent.
Business incubators can be vital to rural communities, Mr. Jaycock says.
"This program is drawing in new business and new people to our region," he says. "We've tried very hard to get our message into southern Ontario, to people outside of Halliburton County. ... Part of the appeal is to say we're here to give you a unique program and a unique lifestyle.
"I think we're onto something for Halliburton, and I think we're onto something for small communities literally anywhere in Canada."
Board members of the Halliburton project decided to concentrate on creative businesses, says Mr. Jaycock. They have received applications from more than a dozen entrepreneurs who broadly define what it means to be creative. "I've had contact with artists, craftspeople, a lady who wants to run an [English as a Second Language] school, a designer, someone who's in leatherwork. There's also an executive from Toronto who is thinking of starting a second career in semi-retirement in fine furniture refurbishing and refinishing."
Out of the four to be selected, Mr. Jaycock hopes three will come from outside the region. The startups will have a choice in occupying spaces of 190 square feet for $182 a month, 425 square feet for $319 or $263. For this they get the mentoring program plus use of the space, a copier/fax, audio-visual equipment and wireless Internet connection. Training seminars put on by the development corporation are free.
The cost of the first year of operation, Mr. Jaycock says, will be about $50,000, paid by local, provincial and federal funding.
Business incubators can be found in large urban centres, too, he says, but a recent tour of a Toronto incubator taught him something. "It's big. It's got in excess of 35 businesses," he says. "I came back to our committee and said there were about 25 businesses in there that could be here in Halliburton. And if any of those people were interested in a place to establish a different lifestyle, we're the sort of place they'd be able to look to."
Other rural incubators across Canada echo Halliburton's experiences.
In Middleton, N.S., Jeff Wentzell, business manager of the Ingeonuity business incubation program, has been overseeing the second year of its operation, which was brought together through the town's link with Nova Scotia Community College and its centre for geographic sciences.
Three clients have set up in the Ingeonuity incubator: a geomatics software development company that gathers, stores and processes geographic information; a computer company that creates virtualizations in computer servers as a service; and a mapping company that is moving toward applications for geographical information systems.
Doors have been open for a year and a half, and Mr. Wentzell is looking for his next round of clients.
"Our current clients are seeing success. They've been able to grow since being in the incubator, both in creating jobs and increased revenue," he said.
"We see a lot of our college grads go off to jobs across North America and take advantage of their training, but we see the opportunity for potential entrepreneurs to start up their businesses, engage those students as potential hirings here."
In British Columbia, Peter Haubrich, a former research and development director for Sony in Germany, runs the Okanagan Research & Innovation Centre, which oversees three business incubators. One is in the urban setting of Kelowna, with nine businesses. Two are in smaller locations - a new centre in Penticton, with two businesses planned, and another at the National Research Council radio observatory, near Okanagan Falls, which has one company.
He says that for every dollar spent on business incubators, $30 is returned to the local economy in wages, taxes, sales and services.
"We are trying to make the south Okanagan the Mecca for clean technologies, because of our 2,000 hours of sunshine per year, because of our wind and our water," Mr. Haubrich said.
"For smaller communities, business incubators are a very good instrument for economic development and the diversification of the economy. We are still relatively new, with one company graduating, but it is growing very well, I believe."
******
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Question: Who do the people running these programs work for? Are they government employees?
Answer: The Halliburton Creative Business Incubator was set up in 2009 by a committee of local business people under the guidance of the Halliburton County Development Corp. The incubator is a non-profit undertaking of that body. Ingeonuity in Middleton, N.S., is set up differently; it is connected to the local community college.
Q: Who decided to start the programs? How many locales across the country are running them? Does the federal government track them?
A: According to the Canadian Association of Business Incubation (CABI), Canada has at least 92 business incubators, most in larger urban centres. What the programs have in common is support from local businesses and champions, augmented by local government or institutions such as colleges or technological centres.
In the past, Statistics Canada has tracked the programs formally with research studies. Industry Canada is tracking them informally, said Mr. Donahue, by talking to managers and others involved.
Q: Does anyone track the progress of the companies once they leave the programs?
A: In Halliburton, graduating clients will be paired with a real estate adviser for the securing of space in the community. Those who stay in the community will be supported with public relations. Clients will be asked to maintain contact and, on an annual basis, provide some measure of their progress. These will be reported by the manager to the board.

Full text:   CITY HALL BUREAU CHIEF
The TTC is looking at moving its headquarters to a new 400,000-square-foot building in Hoggs Hollow, a proposal that was swiftly panned by the front-runner for mayor and by the local councillor.
At its regular-closed door meeting Thursday, the Toronto Transit Commission is expected to begin exploring a long-term lease with Build Toronto, the city's fledgling development agency, to erect an eight-storey office tower on a commuter parking lot at York Mills station.
The chair of the cash-strapped transit agency said the deal wouldn't proceed unless it saved money.
"For us it's a simple commercial transaction," TTC chair Adam Giambrone said. "Is it cheaper to go there or here?"
The TTC has been shopping for a new home for about 1,000 engineers, designers, lawyers, project managers and other office staff, currently scattered across five leased locations and two TTC-owned buildings, including its headquarters atop Davisville station.
That 54-year-old building needs $30-million in repairs and upgrades in the next five years - add to that the $8.6-million annual cost of leased offices and a new headquarters could financial make sense, Mr. Giambrone said.
The normally dry matter of TTC real-estate transactions morphed into an election issue Wednesday when George Smitherman called a news conference to slam the head-office idea - at the same hour his opponents were in a debate at a Scarborough school.
The former deputy premier fired off a letter to councillors on the TTC's board urging them to reject a new headquarters. He also demanded they make a confidential report on the proposal public, despite the city's long-standing practice of keeping real-estate negotiations private until they're completed.
"If you're a commissioner of the Toronto Transit Commission, how can you be voting in favour of the use of time and energy in these circumstances on a gleaming new headquarters, when the people who ride your system every day are expressing their concerns and their disaffection so strongly?" Mr. Smitherman asked.
Build Toronto, which submitted a planning application for the site at 4050 Yonge St. on Friday, said it intends to partner with the private sector to finance the project.
Derek Ballantyne, Build's chief operating officer, said it was too early to say how such a deal would be structured, but that there is plenty of interest from other commercial players in a site that sits next to TTC and GO Transit stations.
Councillor Karen Stintz, whose ward includes the potential new headquarters, has reservations about the project.
Constructing a mid-rise tower on the site could be delicate because of a nearby ravine, the need for an official plan amendment and local opposition to the loss of the commuter parking lot on which it would be built, Ms. Stintz said. (The lot, however, has already been declared surplus and turned over to Build Toronto, meaning it will disappear no matter what's erected on the site.)
"It's extremely disheartening especially because I have supported Build Toronto and I want to be their advocate and when I'm not kept in the loop it's difficult," Ms. Stintz said. "There's a question about whether or not a TTC headquarters makes sense at that location and even the commission hasn't answered that question yet."

Smitherman challenges Ford over attitude toward gays

Abstract: "You said, on the floor of council, 'If you're not doing needles and you're not gay, you wouldn't get AIDS - that's the bottom line.' And I'd like you, Mr. Ford, to explain to people how your character, and especially these comments, is justifiable now that you present yourself as someone who wishes to be mayor of the city of Toronto," Mr. [George Smitherman] said during a debate in front of the Toronto Real Estate Board.

Full text:   Mayoral candidate George Smitherman lit into his opponent Rob Ford Wednesday, calling him to task for comments he made about gay people when Mr. Ford opposed the city's AIDS funding in 2006.
"You said, on the floor of council, 'If you're not doing needles and you're not gay, you wouldn't get AIDS - that's the bottom line.' And I'd like you, Mr. Ford, to explain to people how your character, and especially these comments, is justifiable now that you present yourself as someone who wishes to be mayor of the city of Toronto," Mr. Smitherman said during a debate in front of the Toronto Real Estate Board.
The comments, Mr. Smitherman argued, call into question the outspoken Etobicoke councillor's ability to be mayor.
Mr. Ford did not address the charges directly.
"You want to get personal? Go ahead. I'm not going to play games like you have, blowing $1-billion on e-Health as [Ontario] health minister."
But the question remains of whether someone who held those views should be mayor, Mr. Smitherman insisted in a scrum following the debate.
"This is a man who has made comments like that, which disparage and divide a city of Toronto, where diversity is one of the great obligations that any of us seeking the position of mayor should be able to manage."
"There's no one who donates more time, more money to helping out youth and seniors than I do," Mr. Ford shot back, before leaving for a debate elsewhere without taking further questions.
Mr. Ford has come under fire previously for questioning the utility of funding for transgendered and transsexual people and dismissing a $20,000 grant for a movie about homosexuality in the city's South Asian community.
All six candidates finished a marathon day of debates with a town hall Wednesday night in the basement of Runnymede United Church, hosted by a local residents' association. Earlier, five of the six - excluding Mr. Smitherman - had debated at a Scarborough school.
The late debate in Bloor West Village was a much more sedate affair than the morning slugfest. The audience was most eager to learn where each candidate stood on electrifying GO Transit's expanded Georgetown South corridor, which will include trains to Pearson airport.

Full text: Montreal may feel it's cornered the market on hockey tradition, but Vancouver's rich history of the sport only needs revisiting
amaki@globeandmail.com
It is the Friday morning before the Vancouver Canucks open the second-round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, and the question of the day on TEAM 1040 radio is, "Where were you in 1994 when Pavel Bure scored the triple-overtime, series-clinching goal against the Calgary Flames?"
Granted, this was the anniversary of Bure's big strike. But a first-round goal from 16 years ago hailed as a touchstone moment? Is that all Vancouver hockey fans have in their treasure trove?
There are two Canadian NHL teams still in the hunt for the 2010 Stanley Cup. One is the much-storied, championship-rich, "We're the greatest and you're not" Montreal Canadiens, an organization that has spawned more stars, more parades and more hockey riots than any other.
The other still-there team is the Canucks. At first blush, their history consists of waving white towels, losing the seventh game of the 1994 Stanley Cup final, Trevor Linden coming, going and coming again, plus Harold Snepsts's Yosemite Sam mustache.
But if you look beyond that - and those eye-wrenching mustard jerseys of the mid-1980s - you'll find a significant hockey heritage, one that predates Roger Neilson and Orland Kurtenbach and skates all the way back to the Patrick brothers, Frank and Lester, and one Frederick Wellington Taylor, better known as Cyclone.
Even before Howie Morenz was ruling the ice for the Canadiens, Taylor, dubbed Cyclone because he could skate like the wind, was tearing things up on the West Coast. He joined the Pacific Coast Hockey Association, established by the Patricks in 1911, and led the Vancouver Millionaires to the 1915 Stanley Cup. (He scored seven times in a three-game route of the Ottawa Senators.)
"I'd say there's a good hockey history here," said Jim Robson, former Canucks play-by-play announcer. "The first artificial ice arenas in Canada were in Vancouver and Victoria [built by the Patrick family]."
Much of Vancouver's hockey history was written in the minor leagues and major junior, where Ernie (Punch) McLean led the New Westminster Bruins to back-to-back Memorial Cup wins. But this much speaks to the locals' puck passion: They had the 16,281-seat Pacific Coliseum built in 1968 in the hopes of attracting an NHL team, and it worked. "It was difficult to build tradition in Vancouver," said Mr. Robson, who called the team's first game in the NHL, a 3-1 loss to the Los Angeles Kings. "In the 1970s, there was no Calgary, Edmonton or Winnipeg. The nearest opposition was L.A. And when there's a change in ownership, as there's been here a few times, you have new managers and coaches. It was tough to build up stability."
The fans hung in, though. They were shrewd enough to appreciate having NHL hockey while occasionally wishing their team could play it. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Canucks began to earn their stripes by battling the best teams in their division and learning how to win.
"That's when we started getting respect as a team and an organization," said Stan Smyl, the Canucks' senior adviser and former captain. "Since then, it keeps getting better and better. Now it's not just the city; it's the whole province. Look at the growth of interest in hockey in B.C., how many WHL teams there are [six], and the BCJHL is producing talent. Kids are watching, with the Internet and all games on TV. They get excited and want to play. It feeds on all levels."
These days, Canuck fans are still hungry even after feasting on the 2010 Winter Olympics and the Canadian men's gold-medal overtime win against the U.S. The goalie for the Canadian side was the Canucks' Roberto Luongo, the same Bobby Lou being counted on to eliminate the Chicago Blackhawks in their Western Conference semi-final showdown.
Should that happen, Harry Neale, the former Canucks' coach, knows the reaction will be madness, mayhem, everything you'd expect from a city where hockey counts, and history could use some revisiting.
"When we went to the Stanley Cup final in 1982, the fans were ridiculous," Mr. Neale said. "If the Canucks do it again, it will be something to watch."
******
THE FANS
Vancouver Canucks and Montreal Canadiens fans share a love of hockey. But, as Mark Schatzker explains, it ends there.
...............................Vancouver Canucks.................................Montreal Canadiens
Growing................Playoff medical marijuana........................A playoff beard
Sense of Stanley Cup destiny (10 being strongest).....................9............12
Sense of entitlement to federal dollars (10 being strongest).......8.5.........14
Sits on.................A knock-off Aeron Chair..........A La-Z-Boy
Swears...............Once (at which point his partner reminds him about stress and brews chamomile tea laced with fish oil)..........Three times per minute (the maximum possible between swigs of La Maudite and mouthfuls of poutine).
Prays to..............An Inukshuk.........................................................A lock of Guy LaFleur's hair
Workplace productivity...............Will diminish 63% due to fatigue, stress and "difficulty handling everything right now, okay? I need some space."..........Will diminish 22% during playoffs due to hangover and personal injury sustained during moments of jubilation.
When not talking hockey, talks about.....Real estate prices.........Arts, music, life, "le cinema."

How to become your own neighbour

Author: Sewell, Diane

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/how-become-your-own-neighbour/docview/220073657/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The biggest challenge in fixing up the other half of the house? "Everything takes longer than you think it's going to, and there's more to do than you realize," says [Deborah]. "Once you get going and really look carefully you think, 'I can't live with this' so then you have to change that too."

Full text: When your house is joined to the one next door, you hope the owners see things your way. Or you could always buy it
When the other side of Deborah and Denis Harrison's 1872 terrace house came up for sale, a sense of longing, and then foreboding, washed over them. What if the new owners painted their half purple? What if they let the place get run down?
When the look and feel of your house so heavily hinges on the sum of two parts, being on the same page as your neighbour can make all the difference in the world. But the Harrisons knew from experience that page can be rewritten. So they got busy and hatched a plan to buy the other half themselves.
"The initial investment was emotional, but as time went on we wondered how we were going to pay for it," Deborah explains. "We wanted it mainly because we loved it, but we were also concerned about protecting our investment on the other side."
With four grown children, ranging from 21 to 31 and all living away from home, half a house was perfect for the empty nesters, but cramped on holidays if everyone came home. That too got them thinking. The Harrisons realized having the other half of the house for visiting family and friends would be a perfect, albeit expensive solution. Then, as often happens in life, a simple comment opened up a new world of opportunity. A friend said to me, 'You could rent the place out when you're not using it,' " recalls Deborah. A light went on and the rest is history as they say.
In September, 2008, the Harrisons took the leap and bought the other half of the terrace house for $240,000. They then spent the next year and $45,000 doing repairs and upgrades, much of it themselves so they could keep costs down. Deborah, who'd honed a natural aptitude for decorating and landscaping while she was a stay-at-home mom, got busy and put her magic - and her muscles - to work.
Denis, who's the crown attorney for Perth County, traded his business suit for handyman clothes every weekend and the two of them painted the entire exterior of the house last summer, saving an estimated $18,000 by doing it themselves. But the main wall was overgrown with English ivy, so before they could start they had to hire a strong, young man with a very tall ladder to rip it down and haul it away. The Harrisons then spent what seemed like endless days scraping away the leftover suckers, which was followed by more endless days of priming and painting.
Some work the Harrisons just couldn't do themselves so they hired professionals. For example, while they did the outside painting, a professional was painting the inside. "We had to have help or it would have gone on forever," says Deborah. "We painted everything that didn't move."
They also spent $13,000 hiring local stonemason Dale Thomas, who built an elite blue granite retaining wall and matching front steps on the new side so it matched the other side. Another $8,000 went to repairing and restoring the front porch to its original symmetry. And $5,500 was spent replacing the royal blue, painted wooden countertops in the kitchen with Carrara marble countertops and a backsplash. The Harrisons added an eye-popping, double turquoise porcelain sink. The upstairs bathroom was completely gutted. Out went the varnished cedar walls and in went a marble floor and tub surround, plus a new toilet and vanity. Price tag $6,000.
"To me, a bathroom is a place that has to be fresh and clean and there was no way to bring this one back," explains Deborah. "We could spend money on these kinds of improvements because we didn't have to touch the plumbing or electrical. The bones of the house were good. If they hadn't been, we would have had to walk away from it."
The small courtyard out back was neglected and overgrown, and the old red patio stones were full of weeds. The Harrisons gave it a good clean-up and replaced the patio stones with pea gravel. The good-sized magnolia, weeping nootka and Japanese red maple now take their rightful place as focal points. Both terrace house gardens are on the July 4 Stratford & District Horticultural Society Garden Tour.
Gathering the furnishings, art, decorative pieces and linens for the new side was a true labour of love for Deborah, whose creative touch and tasteful eye are evident throughout the house. Some pieces came from friends, others from local and area auctions, antique shows and salvage shops. She also combed fabric shops and discount home furnishing stores for bargains - and found them.
Take, for example, the Ralph Lauren ball fringe she got for $2 a metre, regularly priced at $65 a metre. She bought all they had and it now appears on assorted curtains and blinds she made herself and on the edge of shelving in one of the bedrooms. Bargains were also plentiful at auctions and antique shows. Some pieces she used as is, some were recovered and others she painted. "If you can take something and repurpose it, it's just so much fun," she says. "It's also a lot more affordable."
The biggest challenge in fixing up the other half of the house? "Everything takes longer than you think it's going to, and there's more to do than you realize," says Deborah. "Once you get going and really look carefully you think, 'I can't live with this' so then you have to change that too."
The best part about fixing it up? "The shopping," she says with a grin.
The transformation really was a his-and-her effort, she emphasizes. "I was the decorator, but we couldn't have done all this without Denny. I may have painted the bed, but he had to move it. Let's just say I'm the brains. He's the brawn," she jokes.
Now that the work is finished, the Harrisons are on to part two of the plan: the renting. The fully furnished, two-bedroom, two-bathroom terrace house with den and study is now available for $1,500 a week.
They've named the house Verandah, and created a website for it (www.verandah.ca) and they've listed it with Vacation Rentals by Owner. They've already got four bookings for the summer.
"Buying the other side of this house has really improved the quality of our lives," says Deborah. "It makes us feel truly settled and secure in our own side. Before, we always saw what wasn't done over there, which bothered us since we have a great deal of pride of place. It always felt like something wasn't finished.
"Now, it's finished."

A secondary suburb gets its moment of fame

Full text: daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
Only one postwar housing development can be first. Most weren't designed by the city's best architectural minds and most weren't written up in international magazines.
Since there can only be one Don Mills, how does one tell the stories of the places that came fast on its heels? Places that, despite having a rich narrative of their own, felt the warmth of the media spotlight only briefly as they were being constructed and were celebrated afterward only by those who lived there?
It is in these places - places with a hidden history - that Jane's Walk shines brightest.
Victoria Village was first announced as "Victoria Park Village" in November, 1953, in The Globe and Mail. Then in the final stages of planning, this development on a 600-acre parcel of lush Don Valley farmland (just east of E.P. Taylor's Don Mills, which was already becoming a reality) was to be bounded by Lawrence Avenue East to the north, Eglinton Avenue East to the south and Victoria Park Avenue to the east, and would include 1,500 single-family homes, 2,000 rental apartment units, four schools, two strip plazas and a 117-acre industrial area.
To keep prices lower than the architect-designed Don Mills, homes were "to be built to National Housing Act specifications" (which probably meant purchasing ready-made architectural plans) and to cost "between $11,000 and $13,000," according to the article. The project was organized and financed by A.W. Ruby along with Conservative member of Parliament R.H. McGregor, H.P. Price and W. Pugh of Pugh Brothers Construction.
The thing is, after this announcement and a number of advertisements in the mid- to late-1950s by home builder Arthur-Blakely Ltd. designed to sell off the remaining homes (which included Youngstown steel kitchens in "your choice of exciting colours"), Victoria Park Village fell off the map, unlike its next-door neighbour, which continues to receive media attention well into the 21st century.
"To be honest, it's really been difficult to find the records of those stories of the area," confirms Diana Katgara of Victoria Village Action for Neighbourhood Change. This lack of information suggested a different approach to information gathering when her group created the first walk three years ago: "We connected with the different community centres and schools, sent out information with newsletters [and] we put up posters in storefronts," she remembers.
Tomorrow at 10:30 a.m., interested walkers will gather at the Sloane Public School (which opened in 1958 at 110 Sloane Ave.), and learn instead of the neighbourhood's anecdotal history; for instance, a tidbit is shared of how neighbours bonded while lining up at a public telephone booth on Elvaston Drive before residential service was installed. Walkers will then meander through Wigmore Park, which connects to the school property, and then venture deep into the cool and shady ravine, which connects to the Charles Sauriol Conservation Area.
After activities for the children and a few yoga moves are performed in a wide clearing (in fact, a yoga group was created out of this particular Jane's Walk), it's up again onto Pitcairn Crescent to admire the large, tidy ranch bungalows and then on to Ruscica Drive: "Ruscica was named after an Italian resident who helped build a lot of streets in Victoria Village," says Ms. Katgara, who adds that when walkers are told how streets were shaped into curves and crescents in order to slow drivers and create a safe haven for children, it's an "aha moment" for some.
Down again into the ravine, up again onto more residential streets. In fact, so much of this particular Jane's Walk is through the extensive ravine system that it's billed as the "Victoria Village Adventure Walk" (there are alternate routes for mommies with strollers). In years past, it's been made even more adventurous by mud: "This year we were really debating on calling it 'Rain's Walk' because every time we have the walk, it rains that day," she says, laughing.
Walkers end their one-hour journey on Carnforth Road, touring the area's low-rise industrial buildings. Just as had been proven at Macklin Hancock's Don Mills with an industrial belt ringing around the four housing quadrants and at Scarborough's "Golden Mile of Industry" along Eglinton Avenue East, Victoria Village, too, found that placing an industrial area on its fringe not only provided residents with employment opportunities, it was also a good way to beef up tax revenue.
Even more interesting, when many of the original industries moved to greener (and cheaper) pastures in the 1980s and 1990s, other, non-industrial businesses moved in. On Carnforth, tour-goers will visit the Toronto Sridurka Hindu Temple (1994), the Surati Sweet Mart (1981) and the East Toronto Chinese Baptist Church (1998), all in converted factory/warehouse buildings.
Hopefully, they'll leave with a new appreciation of "why things are the way they are," Ms. Katgara says. "I've never really been interested in [local history], and as I did Jane's Walk, for me, it really was interesting to find out, 'Oh, this is how our city was planned, there were farms this way before the city was planned.' "

Abstract: The city's lack of affordability also caught the attention of Illinois-based Wendell Cox, who once sat on the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission and who now compiles studies on land-use policy. He's made a career out of opposing "smart growth," and "New Urbanism," and has a lot to say about Vancouver's house prices. Mr. Cox is employed by private and public companies, and has done consultant work in Canada.

Full text: City's million-dollar teardowns a cause of mirth and concern as online real-estate game quickly takes off
For Vancouverites, the high cost of real estate is no joking matter.
In a city where half the population rents, the option to buy a home and lay down some good old-fashioned roots is simply not available to a lot of people.
That option isn't currently available to high-school teacher Petr Pospisil and girlfriend Ola Rogula. To illustrate the high cost of property in Vancouver, they created a website game called Crack Shack or Mansion? that has, over the last three weeks, become a hugely popular online quiz for Vancouverites and beyond. The quiz is a tongue-in-cheek critique of what $1-million will get you in Vancouver. More often than not, it gets you a house in serious need of repair.
Mr. Pospisil and Ms. Rogula, a lab technician, created the game for their friends, but didn't expect it to grab so much attention, including media overseas.
It seems simple enough. The user clicks through a slide show of houses and has to decide which one is a drug house and which one is a Vancouver home with at least a $1-million price tag, based on mid-April listings. Most users quickly realize that they can't tell the difference.
"I went on MLS [Multiple Listings Service] and I wanted to see what $1-million gets you," says Mr. Pospisil, who is 26. "I couldn't believe it. You couldn't tell the difference between the $1-million places and rundown places in Detroit," he said.
Finding accurate images of drug houses in the United States was the hard part. Finding Vancouver homes for more than $1-million was easy. One drab Vancouver house with crab grass and a concrete pad for a backyard comes with a price tag of $1.78-million.
The quiz started on a blog and was bouncing around Facebook within hours. By the end of the first week, it had received more than 300,000 views.
"After many years of just accepting that prices have gone up and up, it got people talking about it, and reflecting on what's going on," says Mr. Pospisil.
Point taken. Vancouver's so-called $1-million babies are another city's junkyard dogs.
"What it actually teaches you is the reason things are expensive is because of their land value, not the structure," says Tsur Somerville, a University of British Columbia professor who studies real estate.
Our high land value explains why Mr. Pospisil had to go looking in American cities for pictures of low-cost drug houses, says Prof. Somerville.
Even Vancouver's real drug houses are sitting on expensive land.
It isn't easy to be a middle-class landowner in Vancouver. While most cities' house prices in the last year underwent a correction, Vancouver prices rose again. And although the market is expected to soften once interest rates go up this year, the Vancouver market isn't expected to fall off enough to make houses suddenly affordable to the majority. With its scenic backdrop, mild climate and central location, Vancouver is always at risk of becoming a rich person's playground.
The city's lack of affordability also caught the attention of Illinois-based Wendell Cox, who once sat on the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission and who now compiles studies on land-use policy. He's made a career out of opposing "smart growth," and "New Urbanism," and has a lot to say about Vancouver's house prices. Mr. Cox is employed by private and public companies, and has done consultant work in Canada.
"I guess you could consider me being on the right side of the political spectrum, at least with respect to urban planning," he says.
He too saw the Crack Shack or Mansion? quiz online. He blames the high cost of real estate on efforts to contain sprawl and dwell on urban density.
"I think it is a terrible mistake to force [urban density] to happen, and it creates all sorts of problems which you guys are seeing first-hand in the ungodly housing unaffordability you face," says Mr. Cox, who lived in B.C. as a child.
Mr. Cox is the public-policy consultant behind a survey that ran in The South China Morning Post last week, and was quickly picked up by other international media. The article showed a chart that rated Vancouver as the second most unaffordable city out of 272 metropolitan centres in six countries, including the U.S., Britain, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Hong Kong ranked first.
The sixth-annual survey, originally published in January, divided median house prices by gross annual median household income to get an affordability rating, using figures from government agencies.
Vancouver's median home price of $540,900 was divided by median household income of $58,200.
It showed Vancouver as a "severely unaffordable" housing market - nothing new to locals. But Mr. Cox's solution to the problem is contrary to popular thinking, and local academics question his findings.
"You ought to allow the city to expand," says Mr. Cox. "Do you want virtually everybody living in rentals all their lives? Frankly, a lot of kids in Vancouver who are growing up there at the moment won't own their own homes unless they're inherited."
He says he's not opposed to dense urban areas - he just thinks Vancouverites should be given more options to live outside the city.
His view flies directly in the face of Vancouverism, an internationally lauded planning technique that aims to populate the urban core with mixed-use development, leading to increased transit use and less need for freeways leading away from the city. It's a technique largely devised by former planning director Larry Beasley that is being copied by other cities around the world.
"Over the last 20 years, a lot of planning agencies around the world have decided there's this demon called urban sprawl," says Mr. Cox.
"There is an awful lot of land on which development is not permitted. Vancouver's high prices are a function not of mountains and water, but a function of planning restrictions that do not allow development to occur.
"The minute you ration land, you drive up its price. It's a basic law of economics. Shortage drives up prices."
Mr. Beasley takes issue with that argument.
"What is a gross and misleading simplification is that the answer to higher costs is to extend suburban sprawl," says Mr. Beasley, on the phone from Dallas, where he is advising on urban design. "It is not. Full stop.
"I think it is true that our housing is expensive, but the reason for that rests primarily on the fact that any successful city is going to experience high demand in a very footloose world, and therefore more demand and supply and will push prices up.
"The answer does rest in more development, but the answer also rests in the modern world in the quality of the city that you create.
"Don't just look at the cost of housing to the consumer, but the cost to the public.... If you proceed with urban sprawl, you may get supply, but you also start to sustain other public costs, which have to be at some point echoed back to the taxpayer."
Vancouver already has twice the density of Seattle, says Mr. Beasley. But the city could be even more efficient with the current conversion of areas like Southeast False Creek from industrial to mid-to-high density development.
In terms of the actual survey, Prof. Somerville, who has studied it, says it's flawed because it doesn't take into account low interest rates. Affordability has more to do with monthly payments than a house-price-to-income ratio. As well, housing stock in Vancouver differs greatly from that of say, Hong Kong, where people live in much smaller apartments. It's comparing apples to oranges.
Prof. Somerville is also finishing a study that has found the city's surrounding mountains, water and Canada-U.S. border have more to do with high land values than protected land such as the Agricultural Land Reserve, which restricts development.
Besides, he says, Vancouver has always been unaffordable.
"There is a very classic economic theory that argues that a place that has a high amenity location - things that people will want to be near - will tend to have higher land prices and lower wages.
"What city does that sound like?"
It sounds like Vancouver, and renter Mr. Pospisil doesn't plan on giving up on it any time soon.
"I like the city, and renting is not a bad thing," he says. "But I don't think I would ever get that far into debt for a place here."
Besides, the city's high prices have landed Mr. Pospisil a new hobby. He's just released a sequel to the Crack Shack or Mansion? quiz.

If you have been watching coverage of this spring's boom in housing, especially high-rise condominiums, your natural assumption might be that it is being driven by singles and couples young and old rushing for their chance at home ownership while mortgage rates are still low and prices not yet at their peak. You would be only half right.
Yes March was the third best month for high-rise condo sales since we began keeping records. Yes it was also the best month for detached home sales since July, 2007. Yes, older couples have returned to the market ending a winter dominated by young first-time buyers.
And yes, prices continue to rise. In March the average price of a high-rise suite was $420,087, up 2.4% from February and 7.9% from a year earlier. Detached homes stood at $490,395, up just 0.4% from the month before but a whopping 10.7% from 2009.
"I think a good chunk of the increase was builders adjusting to the new harmonized sales tax that comes into force in July," says George Carras, president of RealNet. "But really high demand is also a major factor."
Which brings us back to being half right.
What the experts tell us is that investors are snapping up 50% of those units. The boom is not about ordinary Jacks and Jills securing their future. If we relied on them alone the GTA new homes market would be in the doldrums.
The boom is mainly about men and women with a few extra bucks in their bank account buying small suites they can either flip when move-in day comes or rent at monthly rates high enough to cover mortgage and maintenance costs.
"No question investors are responsible for at least half this spring's overall high-rise sales," says Dan Flomen of TFN Realty Inc. His company is agent for about 2,000 new suites across the GTA. "But they are selective in their choice.
"Some projects have virtually no sales to investors and in others they represent by far the bulk of suites sold."
So which suites appeal to which type of buyer - important to know if you are planning a purchase. Do you really want to be in a tower where 60% of the residents have no ongoing stake in the building? A maxim of the rental business is tenants only value their suite as long as they live in it.
Mr. Flomen says investors look for small suites - anything from 325-square-foot studios to 700-square-foot one-plus-dens. They are the types of rental units in most demand and the cheapest ones to buy. Cheap counts if you need rents to carry your monthly costs.
They are also looking for projects where most renters want to live, which is downtown, on subway lines, near universities or in areas of the city where there is already a stock of aging rental units.
"The idea is that if there are a big number of older existing rental buildings, tenants will naturally want to move into the new ones so they can stay in the area," he says.
That is what makes projects near Highway 427 and the West Mall so popular right now, he adds. The project SellOffCondo.com provides an example, says Mr. Carras. Suites there sell for about $348 a square foot - about $100 a foot less than the the GTA average, he says.
In addition, there is a large stock of aging existing rental buildings in the area, with tenants ready for a move up, says Mr. Flomen, who represents the project. He says investors represent the majority of buyers.
What of the other side of the coin? Projects geared to end users?
Cresford Developments is about to launch one of those with its new MYC, a 25-storey project at Yonge and Merton streets, just south of Davisville.
"We knew from the very start that our market would be end users, not investors," says Maria Athanasoulis, Cresford's vice-president of sales and marketing. "That was what the local demographics told us was needed."
While Yonge and Davisville might seem a natural area for small investor-owned suites because of the high number of existing rental towers, Cresford saw that many of the people who live in those rental suites now wanted to move up to home ownership. The company also saw a mature resident population living in detached and semi-detached homes who wanted to make a change in lifestyle - escape the snow shovelling, lawn mowing and regular maintenance those homes involved - and yet remain in the area.
Athanasoulis says Cresford was not at all surprised by the pre-launch sales. The first of the 205 suites to go were the one-bedrooms, followed by the one and dens, and they did not go cheaply. Prices at MYC start in the $300,000 range for a 519-square-foot one-bedroom and run up to more than $1-million.
"Part of the success of MYC is that there just was not a range of options in the area," says Ms. Athanasoulis. "If you loved living at Yonge and Davisville and wanted to buy a condo then MYC was the natural choice."

Abstract: For architects since the time of Palladio, the rural villa has been a prime site for trying out new artistic strategies and testing design theories in real-world situations. The most memorable results of this ongoing, centuries-old experimentation are often modest in size and bearing: Palladio's country seats, for example, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House in Illinois, and Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye.

Full text: River House applies spatial brilliance to robust materials for a brand new interpretation of the country retreat. John Bentley Mays gives architect Adam Thom's latest creation his highest marks
jmays@globeandmail.com
For architects since the time of Palladio, the rural villa has been a prime site for trying out new artistic strategies and testing design theories in real-world situations. The most memorable results of this ongoing, centuries-old experimentation are often modest in size and bearing: Palladio's country seats, for example, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House in Illinois, and Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye. What makes these projects stand out is not grandeur and opulence, but the quality of intense, robust architectural imagination they embody.
River House, in the Toronto suburb of Brampton, is among the newest contributions to the long, fruitful tradition of modern villa design, and it is surely one of the most excellent new Toronto-area homes I have ever reviewed in this column. Crafted by Adam Thom and Katja Aga Sachse Thom, partners in both life and art, this small, brilliant residence for a couple and one child combines a strong material palette - poured-in-place concrete, untreated cedar cladding on the exterior, handsome jatoba flooring throughout - with refined, gracious livability in a rough, lovely pocket of Ontario countryside.
On the face of it, the tract that River House stands on seemed to offer more problems than opportunities for creative design. A good portion of the property is thickly wooded hillside. A little stream, mindfully protected by local environmental officials, runs slantwise across the site, and a roadway bounds the lot on its southern edge, all of it sharply restricting the area available for construction.
The Thoms' solution to these inconveniences is a poetic wedge of housing that handily fills its irregular, difficult place in the landscape, and that responds with remarkable empathy to its natural and artificial conditions, including the history of its location. Challenged by Brampton city officials to come up with a plan that recalled local building styles, the Thoms scouted out the neighbourhood and found an old flat-roofed woollen factory, water-powered in its day, composed of stone and concrete, chimneys and blocky volumes.
Thus were born certain features of River House - its long, low-slung profile, its tall concrete tower punching skyward and the rugged concrete treatments on the interior. But the raking angles and turning geometry of the volume, which lend great variety and interest to the transitions and rooms within, are the designers' own creations.
This external surface of the house opens and shuts according to the views that are available and desirable. Each of these views is framed by precisely sculpted architectural apertures, terraces, thresholds. The windows in the living room and dining room welcome in the verdant forest floor at the back of the building, while the windows on the street side limit what's allowed to enter.
The structure turns a blind side to the ranch-style home in the next lot, and hides it behind tall grasses.The landscaping plans, which have not yet been executed, call for extensive plantings of native species, knitting the composition into the green surge and tangle of the bottomland.
On the inside, the various parts of the house step up or step down in response to the changing levels of the site, and in order to accent the shifts in use from one section of the house to another. Instead of being enclosed by squared-off rooms, the living areas are lightly bounded by walls that seem to flex and tense along diagonal lines, diverging and colliding in a kind of measured structural play.
The interior is less an open-plan arrangement, with a simple flow-through of space - though the Thoms have clearly learned from the rational schemes of modernist residential planning - than a system of spatial valves that subtly differentiate and define the moods and atmospheres inside the building.
The stairway up to the second level, for instance, passes between two walls of concrete that were poured into horizontal plank and plywood forms. The concrete surface has registered every knot and imperfection in the moulds, lending visual excitement to the ordinary act of walking up steps.
At the top of the staircase, the space opens up on a sort of bridge, with overlooks of the foyer below and the forest beyond - a sociable corridor that links the couple's suite and the child's small room. (None of the dedicated areas in the house is large; the Thoms have chosen, instead, to emphasize the zones of transition, by making each a dramatic passageway.)
The beauty of River House operates at several scales and through several material textures, from the expanse of cedar cladding at the rear down to the jatoba coverings of the air-conditioning vents. Despite the variety and intensity of moves both without and within, however, the house coheres splendidly, and projects a very fresh vision of what the modern house can be.

All aboard the Marrakesh express

Full text: The plan was to circle a remote and mostly high-altitude chunk of the Kingdom of Morocco in a 1,000-kilometre, four-day trek. About a quarter of the kilometres on unpaved stretches, though the off-roading would consume far more hours and much greater energy
jcato@globeandmail.com
It's the grinning kids with their hands out, high-fiving us as we rumble through, kicking up dust and dirt. We saw them again and again, in remote village after medieval-like town, kilometre after kilometre.
And it's the hairpins. Some so tight it felt like I was turning back on myself, wresting the big BMW F800GS enduro bike up and down and through the corners. The river crossings, the mountain passes with gravel and rocks strewn across every bend, laying in wait like marbles to send me skidding over the edge, down 2,300 metres to my doom. No guardrails anywhere, of course. Terrifying.
When I close my eyes, I can see the snake charmer in the largest traditional market - the souk - in Morocco. Yes, in Marrakech. By Moroccan standards, Marrakech is a booming, bustling city. I say Moroccan standards because Morocco is a developing country. It is, then, a mixture of new and old, of a massive outdoor market and modern luxury hotels, of excellent restaurants and narrow, 16th century alleyways.
Some say Marrakech is the most beautiful town in Morocco. It certainly has one of the busiest squares - the Djemaa el Fna - in Africa and in fact the world. As one of our motorcycle guides put it, the square "boils with smells." We spent hours there on our last night, inhaling the atmosphere, watching the cobras dance, laughing at the comic performers and clowns, listening to the music, the drums, flutes and even guitars.
We ate our last night-time meal at a temporary food stall in the Djemaa el Fna. As a local guide put it, we experienced the "medieval lifestyle." But in the 21st century. Really. To pay for our food, we drew money out of a bank machine just off the Djemaa el Fna. Later, we walked the narrow alleyways with shopkeepers on either side hawking their wares - rugs, shoes, hats, clothes of all sorts, wooden boxes and small daggers.
That was the Friday. On the Monday before, we had other matters to focus the mind. I and a troupe of 12 other Inglourious Basterds were facing a 1,000-kilometre, four-day trek through Morocco. The name seemed apt enough, given that the actor Brad Pitt had been scheduled to ride with us, then cancelled at the last moment.
Our bikes would be a line of BMW GS dual-purpose bikes: four 1200s, the rest 800s, with a pair of 650s thrown in - one for our smallest rider, the other a back-up bike that spent the trip strapped to the bed of a four-by-four pickup driven by Axel. Axel was the doctor imported from Munich to apply the stitches and balm - or perform surgery, if required.
The plan was to circle a remote and mostly high-altitude chunk of the Kingdom of Morocco. About a quarter of the kilometres on unpaved stretches, though the off-roading would consume far more hours and much greater energy. That's the nature of the beast; enduro riding is hard work.
BMW makes its GS bikes just for this stage. The big 1200 is a handful when the going gets really rocky or sandy or steep, so I chose the R800GS instead. Bit smaller, but at 80-plus horsepower it has plenty of jam to get you up and over and through goat paths or worse.
This particular trip had been in the works for seven months. It was the brainstorm of Hendrik von Kunheim, the former president of BMW Canada who now runs BMW AG's Motorrad motorcycle division now. He's a business type, certainly, but an even more passionate motorcycle rider. And competitive.
"I wanted to show these guides, to pass them" he laughed, describing his own trip over the handlebars during a tough, rocky, narrow run up the Tizi-n'Tazazert oass (2,200 m) on day three. Our guides, expert instructors at BMW's Motorrad Enduropark in Hechlingen, Germany, near Munich, were Christian One (with the pony tail), Christian Two (bald) and Manfred (the boss) and they were brilliant. At least compared to me, as inexperienced an enduro rider as a group like this has ever seen.
At the top of the Tizi-n'Tazazert pass we found ourselves staring at a small hotel. A room in this remote place sells for nine euros. We took sweet tea and pressed on.
Irony of the day: After slogging up the mountain in narrow trails with shale and rocks and sand, we felt like heroes. I was elated not to have dropped the bike or to have crashed in any way. Not once, though I was protected in my padded enduro gear and carbon fibre helmet. Then I spotted a local who had done exactly the same ride on a 50-cc Docker city bike, baseball cap on his head, tennis shoes on his feet. Humbling.
Morocco, of course, is a wonder of relative tolerance and stability on an African continent littered with crazy, dangerous, corrupt and incompetent regimes. Unlike, say, Nigeria, which is oil rich, yet the populace is poor and civil wars have killed millions over the past few decades, Morocco does not have abundant natural resource wealth - at least not oil wealth - yet literacy is growing and investors are intrigued.
As we drove into town from the airport, I spotted several billboards for new real estate developments. The face on the billboards doing the pitch: actress Eva Longoria Parker, star of the TV show Desperate Housewives and wife of basketball star Tony Parker. He's French and Morocco once was, too. That explains the billboards.
I saw more of Eva on Day 1 as we headed out of Marrakech for a trip through the High Atlas via Tizi-n-Tichka. As Christian One pointed out, this is a spectacular pass road built by the French and it provided the bulk of the paved riding for the day. The last 45 km were all off-road.
We lunched in a Berber tent, visited a women's co-op where they grind Argan nuts to make oil for sale, and ended the day in Quarzazate, a semi-modern town with two movie studios. The movie business is big in Morocco. Lawrence of Arabia was filmed near Quarzazate, as was Mel Gibson's The Last Temptation of Christ and many other films.
At the end of Day One I typed my notes with sore hands and a bruised ego. Yes, I went straight over the handlebars, into a ditch with the dirt and rocks all around. It was the exclamation point on a long, 11-hour ride, about a quarter of which was pure back country riding. Sand, gravel, stony bits, river crossings - you name it. If you are an enduro pro, an experienced rider, this is the sort of thing you live for.
I am a street rider, unaccustomed to spending hours standing on top of the motorbike's pegs, feathering the clutch, working to be smooth on the throttle, relaxed and consistent. This was all new to me.
Fortunately, Manfred the BMW instructor, gave me a quick trail-side lesson. Just the basics. Naturally, after our last coffee break, I made the classic enduro mistake: I looked down, rather than into the distance to where I wanted to go. Bam! I was on the ground.
If you've done any enduro riding, you know this sort of thing happens all the time. No big deal. It's part of the fun, von Kunheim pointed out, slapping my back. Ha, ha.
Fortunately I had Manfred to help me lift the bike. He then spun and powered my ride out of a hole and back up onto the trail. Without climbing aboard. Jaw-dropping stuff. Then it was back to trails built for donkeys and us.
Day One passed in a blur, but it had its memorable happy moments. As I quickly mentioned, mid-morning we stopped for mint tea - a Moroccan staple - at that women's co-operative that earns its living by grinding down Argan nuts into various oils. By hand. Hour after hour using stone tools. They make use of not just the oil, though. The husks provide fuel for burning and the ground nuts are feed for the livestock. Nothing wasted.
Layla, a lovely 28-year-old who spoke excellent English, told us all the women in the co-op are divorced or widowed. They support themselves with this little business - some 35 or so of them. The mint tea was refreshing. All of us bought something in the co-op store.
Lunch was in a Berber tent and it was delicious - a kind of stewed beef accompanied by potatoes, carrots and cauliflower simmered in Argan oil. We sat under the shade of tents without sides, so the fresh breeze could gently keep us cool. Day One was exhausting and exhilarating and tremendous in very way.
And so it went. Day Two took us through the Draa Valley in a long belt of date palms before we left the pavement and turned north over the Tizi-n'Tazazert. Dirt riding: 70 km out of the 200 km total.
Day Three we headed north into the Gorges du Dades. Slowly as we climbed, the red stones began turning grey and the valley narrowed to a gorge. We pressed on across the Atlas, up to the pass where we drank sweet tea and then down and the return to Quarzazate.
The last day of the ride had no formal off-roading, yet we spent only half the day on good pavement. We rode 280 km up and over and down the Central High Atlas Mountains (2,300 metres). We lunched in the Tassaout Valley at a kind of bed and breakfast. Then it was on to Marrakech and rush-hour traffic. It was the ride of 1,000 switchbacks with 2,000-metre drop-offs looming for fools who make one wrong turn.
The ride over the Central High Atlas range was on a single-lane road - well, kind of a road. Some of it was paved, but many stretches were totally washed out. So it was a long, twisty run of tight switchbacks, up and down, left and right. Every corner - and I mean every corner - had rocks and gravel, paved or not. Yikes! But the scenery was spectacular, and we had it all to ourselves. Jagged rocks, steep peaks, snow patches. A novel taste of Africa.
Not so novel was the poverty. Deep, deep poverty. There is much of it in Africa, of course. Von Kunheim, the Motorrad president, has lived and worked in Africa. Here in some stretches, said von Kunheim, he saw poverty worse than anything he'd seen anywhere else in Africa.
Poor, yes, but the kids in village after village lined the streets, holding out their hands to clap ours as we slowly rode by. They smiled and called to us, excited by their Western visitors and a break from the ordinary. A wonderful kaleidoscope of memories.
And it all wrapped up where it began, in Marrakech. At rush hour on a Friday night. Marrakech traffic flows in its own sort of pattern, with crowded, bustling streets shared by cars - a lot of diesel Peugeots and Mercedes taxis - bicyclists and riders on scooters and small motorcycles. No one, and I mean no one, wears a helmet and none of the cycles, scooters and bikes has a mirror. The local riders? Many wear sandals or flip-flops of various sorts.
As for crashes, I think I managed to drop the bike with varying degrees of seriousness at least seven times. Other than a bit of bruising, no serious injuries. But I did tire of picking up that 200-kg bike, even with help. Once I was alone and had to lift and then drive the bike out of a small river bed to get it back on the trail, upright. Manfred arrived just in time to chuckle and ask me if I needed any help. "Not now," I said, climbing on, before riding away.
A kilometre later we passed through another sea of grinning kids. The sting of that last crash was wiped away by little high-fives. What memories.

Abstract: [El Bulli], this year's No. 2 and for the four previous years No. 1, is booked a year in advance, Mr. [David Hawksworth] said. Rouge's Mr. [Paul Rogalski] said the award has made previously listed restaurants "very, very busy," but he's not sure yet whether it will mean a stampede to his place. He hopes that it helps Calgary's tourism business. "Maybe it will make Calgary a spot on the destination map, not just Rouge, but we have a lot of great food in this city," he said.

Full text: International foodies may soon be making the pilgrimage to Canada, where two eateries have made the venerable S. Pellegrino World's 100 Best Restaurants for 2010. It's the first time since 2003 a Canadian establishment has made the list. Dawn Walton sees what's for dinner
ROUGE: 60TH PLACE
Where: 1240 8th Ave. S.E., Calgary (403-531-2767, rougecalgary.com)
Located in Cross House, a designated heritage site built in 1891 and the former home of A.E. Cross, a rancher turned politician who helped found the Calgary Stampede. Rouge sits on the banks of the Bow River in Calgary's trendy Inglewood district, just east of downtown.
Opened: 2003
Owners: Paul Rogalski and Olivier Reynaud
Price: Chef's six-course tasting menu not including drinks $95 per person
Reservations: Expect to wait two weeks to get a table on a Saturday night.
Signature dish: "The thing we do best, I believe, is our chef's tasting menu," said co-owner Paul Rogalski. "I guess you could call it signature dishes."
***
LANGDON HALL COUNTRY HOUSE HOTEL & SPA, 77TH PLACE
Where: 1 Langdon Dr., Cambridge, Ont. (519-740-2100, langdonhall.ca)
Construction of this palatial country estate about an hour west of Toronto was completed in 1902 for Eugene Langdon Wilks, a great-grandson of the wealthy fur trade and real estate Astor family of New York, and his wife, the great-granddaughter of one of the founders of the region. Extensive renovations by the current owners transformed the summer retreat into 52-room hotel, spa and dining hall nestled on 80 hectares of lush greenery and gardens.
Opened: 1989
Owners: William Bennett and Mary Beaton.
Price: Chef's five-course tasting menu not including drinks is $95 per person.
Reservations: Expect to wait two to three weeks to get a table on a Saturday night.
Signature dish: Seasonal, depending on what ingredients are available. Chef Jonathan Gushue is currently serving glazed garden asparagus with poached duck egg, confit duck gizzard, Monforte Toscano, black olive vinaigrette au jus.
***
HOW THEY WERE SELECTED
The annual list is compiled by the World's 50 Best Restaurants Academy based on input from more than 800 chefs, food critics, restaurateurs and what organizers call "well-travelled gourmands" from 27 regions around the world.
A Canadian restaurant hasn't been on the list since 2003, when Eigensinn Farm near Toronto made the cut for the second consecutive year. In 2002, Toronto's Susur also made the list.
The top 10 for 2010: 1. Noma, Copenhagen 2. El Bulli, Roses, Spain 3. The Fat Duck, Bray, U.K. 4. El Celler de Can Roca, Girona, Spain 5. Mugaritz, Errenteria Gipuzkoa, Spain 6. Osteria Francescana, Modena, Italy 7. Alinea, Chicago 8. Daniel, New York 9. Arzak, San Sebastian, Spain 10. Per Se, New York
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE LISTED
Of culinary kudos, awards and designations, this is a list every restaurateur wants to be on.
Top Canadian chef David Hawksworth, whose restaurant Hawksworth at Vancouver's Hotel Georgia is slated to open in December, said the international accolade is akin to getting an Oscar for those in the top 10 and a nomination for the rest.
"It's great for business," he said, adding that it's tough to put a monetary value on being on the list.
El Bulli, this year's No. 2 and for the four previous years No. 1, is booked a year in advance, Mr. Hawksworth said. Rouge's Mr. Rogalski said the award has made previously listed restaurants "very, very busy," but he's not sure yet whether it will mean a stampede to his place. He hopes that it helps Calgary's tourism business. "Maybe it will make Calgary a spot on the destination map, not just Rouge, but we have a lot of great food in this city," he said.
Langdon Hall's Mr. Gushue is flattered and shocked to be included among a list of "culinary icons" in a competition that isn't tainted by "who you know."
"This is truly an unbiased marker of an accomplishment," he said, "...We're in some amazing company."
CULINARY CHOPS
Up-and-comer Michael Dekker took over as executive chef at Rouge last year as co-owner Mr. Rogalski took a break from the kitchen to become "chief culinary officer." Born in Southern Ontario, Mr. Dekker got his first taste of restaurant life as a dishwasher in Calgary as a teen and studied at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. He was a sous chef at the swish Calgary Golf and Country Club and went on to work as a culinary consultant with a Las Vegas-based restaurant development company. In 2008, he finished second at the prestigious international Concours International des Jeunes Commis Rôtisseurs Competition held at le Cordon Bleu in Paris.
Executive chef Jonathan Gushue came to the kitchen at Langdon Hall in 2005 with an impressive resumé. The Newfoundland native studied hotel management at Georgian College and plied his skills in Japan, Britain, Vancouver and Toronto, including stints with the Novelli group of restaurants in London and at the famed Truffles Restaurant at the Four Seasons in Toronto, where he was executive chef.
THINK LOCAL
Both Rouge and Langdon Hall define themselves by locally produced foods - or at least foods that are sourced close by or from the finest purveyors around the country.
Both have their own gardens - a particularly impressive feat in weather finicky Calgary - where fresh produce is harvested daily. Langdon Hall even taps its maple trees to make maple syrup and scours the property for wild garlic, leeks and ginger.
"We let the garden dictate the menu," said Langdon Hall's Mr. Gushue. "... What we're trying to promote here is a sense of place."
It also means the menus are ever-changing as the ingredients define the dishes.
"We're focused on regional and sustainable food options," said Rouge's Mr. Rogalski.

Luxury home sales through the roof as buyers seek stable investment

Full text: Sales breaking records nationwide
As the real-estate market in Canada continues its record-setting recovery, the market for high-end homes is surging.
The country's richest residents - as well as millionaires from countries such as China and the United Kingdom - are turning to property to provide a safe haven for their money because the market is seen as a stable place to park cash as the global economy recovers from a deep recession.
Attributing the upswing in sales to "improved economic performance, increased personal wealth, immigration and foreign investment," ReMax Canada said in a report yesterday that sales for so-called luxury homes broke records in nine of the 13 regions examined in the first quarter of the year.
"It's an astounding recovery compared to last year when people just slammed on the brakes," said Michael Polzler, executive vice-president and regional director of ReMax for Ontario and Atlantic Canada.
The brokerage's definition of a luxury home varies by market, from $400,000 in St. John's to $2-million in Greater Vancouver. The amount is usually determined by looking at the top 1-to-5 per cent of sales in any given market.
While there are no statistics available to confirm the presence of high-end buyers from out of the country, anecdotal evidence from real estate brokerages across the country is abundant. Century 21 recently launched a Chinese version of its website to help Asian buyers find Canadian residential properties and Realtor.ca - the hub for listings on the Canadian Real Estate Association's Multiple Listing Service - now gets almost 1 per cent of its traffic from China.
"There is no doubt a great deal of the demand is coming from mainland China," said Ross McCredie, president of Sotheby's International Realty Canada, who has also been fielding calls from prospective buyers in the European Union and Mexico. "The Chinese are the people shopping at above $5-million."
Canada's market has rebounded strongly from the recession, with average sale prices up almost 20 per cent. But on a global scale, prices here are still relatively low - especially for high-end properties, which realtors said are selling for about the same price as they were in 2007.
And while Canada's rapid recovery - it posted a 5.2 per cent year-over-year gain in 2009 - stoked fears of a housing bubble even as unemployment climbed higher, other markets have been far frothier.
Over the same time period, a survey by Knight Frank LLP found prices in Hong Kong gained 27.6 per cent, followed by China at 25.1 per cent, Israel at 21.3 per cent, and Australia at 13.6 per cent.
Canada was 12th on the list, just behind South Africa and a smidge ahead of Austria.
That has drawn international attention to homes such as the Montreal mansion being sold by real estate agent Cyrille Girard. The house has seven bedrooms, five bathrooms and a heated indoor pool. It also features something its owner didn't have last year - interest from buyers willing to pay the $27-million asking price.
Mr. Girard - an agent with Sotheby's International Realty Quebec - only listed the 41,000-square-foot house yesterday. Two interested buyers have already booked appointments to tour the lakefront property, and he considers them real leads to buy what is currently Canada's priciest listing.
"One is flying in from out of the country, though I don't want to say where because these things can be delicate," he said. "There is a great deal of interest because prices in Canada are seen as reasonable compared to other places in the world."
But while buyers have returned from their self-imposed exile, the boom in luxury housing has taken on a different tone than the broader market because buyers are willing to take time to explore their options, since there are plenty of listings and relatively few would-be owners.
Phil Soper, chief executive officer of Brookfield Real Estate Services, said there's also no rush to buy because the homes are no longer looked at for their investment value.
"Those buying these homes are typically financially sophisticated and there aren't too many who will believe we're in for several years of highly appreciating values," he said. "They see today's prices as reasonable, and don't really think prices will fall very much."

Checking in to a new home front

Abstract: "I truly believe it's an investment, and I'm quite sure my condo's value will appreciate," Ms. [Louise Houle] says. "But by far, one of my favourite things is the fact that my car stays inside and I only have to travel a block to the law firm where I work."

Full text: Done right, condo hotels going up across Canada can add density to downtown cores and vibrancy to the streetscape
For 18 years, famed Canadian photographer Yousuf Karsh, who captured the likes of Audrey Hepburn, Albert Einstein and Ernest Hemingway, lived with his wife Estrellita in Suite 358 of the Château Laurier, Ottawa's most prestigious hotel.
The couple enjoyed cleaning, room and laundry services. And the hotel's four-star restaurant and downtown Ottawa were just steps away from their suite. They moved out in 1992, but today a new generation of tenants is discovering the benefits of hotel living.
New luxury properties called hotel residences are cropping up from Montreal to Vancouver. They mirror traditional condo properties save for the fact that units are attached to a hotel and owners can tap directly into amenities such as the concierge, valet and gym.
By providing these services, developers are able to charge a premium for the units and finance smaller hotels that might not have been built so easily after the beating the industry took last year. Practically no one wants to build a stand-alone hotel these days, and experts say that hotel residences are set to provide solid returns on all sides. Yet they're not only good investments; some say that if done right they promise to lend a hand in rejuvenating downtown cores.
"From the floor-to-ceiling windows in my bedroom I can watch the sun rise," says Louise Houle from her 3,000-square-foot penthouse nestled in the heart of Montreal. "But my favourite view is when it sets behind Mount Royal and the city lights come out."
This March, Ms. Houle moved in on the 23rd floor of Hôtel Le Crystal, which opened in early 2008. Right from the get-go she says she was impressed with how extensive the hotel's services are. It even made moving in easier. "I used the valet quite a lot when I was having all my furniture delivered," she says. "These deliveries usually happen through the day when you're not around. But the valet took care of it."
After the move she also found that, for a fee, there's someone to water the plants while she's away, deliver dinner to her room and take care of the dry cleaning if she gets it to the front desk by nine. "They have it back by the time I'm home at six," she says.
These are just a couple of reasons why the 53 condos built atop Le Crystal's 131 hotel suites have an occupancy rate of 95 per cent, says Louise Latreille, a real estate agent with Sotheby's International Realty Quebec who represents the building.
As baby boomers age, they want more services available to them. "They like the benefit of the hotel's restaurant downstairs, they like the valet service, the pool, and they want to be where the action is downtown," she says.
Owners are willing to pay for what they get. A 3,000-square-foot penthouse with sweeping views of Montreal on the 25th floor costs $2.8-million, and a 4,000-square-foot unit on the 17th floor costs $2.2-million. Condo fees, which are paid every three months, run from 35 to 40 cents a square foot.
"The hotel residence model allows developers to charge a premium for the property because they're offering those extra services," says Curtis Gallagher, vice-president of hotel investment at CB Richard Ellis.
The land value is high where these projects, such as Toronto's Trump International Hotel & Tower and Vancouver's Living Shangri-La, are being built, he says. "In the past, building a smaller hotel there might not have made financial sense. But by adding condos to the mix, developers maximize their return from the property."
The hotel industry will see some gradual improvement in the coming year, Mr. Gallagher says. And the fact that many new hotel-residence projects won't open for a year or two will help drive that recovery.
Yet when they do, unit owners stand to benefit. "The Ritz-Carlton in Montreal is adopting the same concept, and when it opens in 2011 the value of the properties at Le Crystal will go up," Ms. Latreille says. "Its presence creates competition and indicates this isn't just some fad."
But buyers should know they are making an investment in the hotel industry, Mr. Gallagher suggests. "You should understand how and why the industry improves. The brand and management behind the hotel play a large role." Nevertheless, he sees these units generating decent returns in three to five years.
"I truly believe it's an investment, and I'm quite sure my condo's value will appreciate," Ms. Houle says. "But by far, one of my favourite things is the fact that my car stays inside and I only have to travel a block to the law firm where I work."
If hotel-residence projects are done right, they add density to downtown cores and vibrancy to the streetscape, says Ken Greenberg, a consultant and former director of urban design and architecture for the City of Toronto.
"The real challenge for these properties is to be extroverted," he says. "They need to get rid of big hotel drives that remove the building from the street and bring the restaurant, bar and retail closer to the sidewalk."
The Thompson Hotel in Toronto, a condo-hotel property that will open in May, is an excellent example, with large inviting windows that look in on retail space and restaurants, Mr. Greenberg says. This makes the building an asset to its tenants and other local businesses because they generate more public foot traffic.
"I walk everywhere," Ms. Houle says. The Metro is close by, the grocery store is only a couple blocks away, and shopping on bustling Ste. Catherine Street is right around the corner from her home in Le Crystal.
"Compared to my life in a traditional house in Westmount, where there were all sorts of things I was in charge of and had to worry about," she says, "this is a completely modern way of living."

BOOM TIMES IN THE BREAD BASKET

Full text: Saskatchewan is in the midst of an eonomic expansion the likes of which it has never seen. Take Saskatoon, where Porsches and million-dollar mansions are replacing sensible cars and middle-class homes. It's an economic tide that will only rise as the world feasts on the prairies' bounty
Saskatchewan's great bust-to-boom ride can be charted through its iconic vehicles - starting with the 1930s "Bennett Buggies," stripped-down cars drawn by horses and derisively named after a Depression prime minister.
Fast-forward to the hulking combines of the Big Wheat economy, and the pickup trucks that marked the oil-roughneck phase of the past decade.
So what will be the representative vehicles of the coming years? Very likely, they will be the $120,000 Porsches that will soon adorn Vaughn Wyant's Saskatoon showrooms - the new buggies for professionals and executives who typify a thrusting Saskatchewan.
Mr. Wyant's imminent opening of Saskatchewan's first full-service Porsche dealer signals that the province, and the city of Saskatoon, are emerging from their post-Depression funk - a long period of economic lethargy that wheat markets, even in their best years, were never able to banish.
Saskatoon is engulfed in a paroxysm of conspicuous spending, from the million-dollar-plus houses in the Willows, the golf course development near Mr. Wyant's suburban showroom, to the forest of cranes at University of Saskatchewan, which is in the midst of a billion-dollar building program.
It is a resurgence built on the fact that, at this moment in history, Saskatchewan has what the world wants, whether it's potash, oil and gas, uranium, diamonds, coal, and crops such as canola, lentils and wheat. Saskatoon, as its major business city with 240,000 people, has a swagger, lording it over Regina, the capital city.
"This was a temperance colony and people used to guard their wealth very carefully," says Mr. Wyant, who at 57 sports modish Bono-like glasses and already owns local dealerships, for Audi, Mercedes, Volvo, Jaguar and Ford. "It was important that you weren't seen to be overtly wealthy so houses and cars have always been pretty conservative."
That has all changed.
"Now, the younger people are earning lots of money, and they say 'I don't give a damn, I'm driving a Jag or a Volvo or a BMW. I'm driving whatever the hell I want to drive and I really don't care what people think.'"
It is not that Saskatchewan's economy soared during the Great Recession - it just didn't suffer as badly as others. Saskatchewan has a third of the world's potash production, and potash is rebounding from a miserable 2009. The province has 43 per cent of the arable land in Canada, and the world needs food. Saskatchewan will soon pass Alberta in terms of conventional oil production. And the province's population, mired at just under a million people since the 1930s, has edged every so steadily above that mark.
It is a Norway in the making - lots of resources and a sparse scattering of people. "When you think of the natural resource base in Saskatchewan, with its limited population base, you can spread that wealth out over a few people," says Bill Doyle, chief executive officer of fertilizer giant Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan.
And no one has a better front-row seat than Mr. Wyant, whose German-born father came to Saskatoon as a doctor and professor. Young Vaughn didn't care much for school and he loved sales. So he hightailed it to Britain where he got experience selling cars for a London dealer. He returned home to get into the business and in 1983 bought Saskatoon's Jubilee Ford.
Now, his string of dealerships in Saskatchewan and B.C. gross $250-million year. Last year, in one of the worst auto markets in history, Mr. Wyant had a record sales year. Besides the new Porsche store, he has bought a Ford dealership in Prince Albert, the gateway to the North. But the underpinning of his business remains Jubilee, where he still sells plenty of pickups to the farm and oil crowd.
The boom is also reflected in housing prices, not just in the Willows but in the old areas of east Saskatoon, where young professionals live cheek-to-jowl with old families. The most conspicuous landmark is the sprawling turreted brick mansion built by Mr. Doyle and eventually selling at a reported $2-million in 2004. The Potash boss, a Chicagoan, now spends only a week a month in Saskatoon, but the business community accepts that he needs to be out selling potash to the world.
Others have done well in a market that has been up and down, but generally higher than historical levels. Brooke Dobni, acting business dean at U of S, has seen his home triple in value in five years. A native of rural Kindersley, he finds a certain irony in owning real estate in an old-money enclave. "The area wasn't built for guys like me, and now, it's guys like me who are living there."
Mr. Wyant foresees even more uncorking of this pent-up desire to show off success. He figures he will sell 50 to 60 Porsches in the first year. "There are people who have been saying for 10 years that 'when you get the Porsche franchise, I'll buy one.'" It means more chances to indulge his weakness for sports memorabilia, including the green jersey worn by late great Roughrider quarterback Ron Lancaster in the 1966 Grey Cup game. He bought it at a charity auction for $1,000, and in Saskatchewan, Mr. Wyant says, that's like buying the Mona Lisa for $5,000.
Everyone on board
Eric Cline is a mining executive. He has the requisite nice car and a new house on a ravine with a spectacular view of the South Saskatchewan River and downtown Saskatoon. But something is different here, and the tipoff is the photo gallery in his study, showing him with NDP premiers Roy Romanow and Lorne Calvert.
Mr. Cline, vice-president of corporate affairs for Shore Gold Inc., is a former finance minister in the former NDP government of Saskatchewan. His seamless shift from social democratic cabinet minister to mining VP is the kind of transition that perhaps could only happen in Saskatchewan.
"There is a real consensus around Saskatchewan about resource development," he explains. "Oil and mining people get along with the NDP governments. People support the sector and they want to develop it and that crosses party lines."
Indeed, Mr. Cline, and his NDP colleagues, can claim to be the parents of the so-called Saskaboom - a rising economic tide that will only flow higher if projects such as Shore Gold's potential diamond mine are allowed to proceed. As finance minister, Mr. Cline compressed the personal income tax grid into three tiers, not a flat tax but a move revolutionary by provincial standards. He matched the generous energy royalty regime in Alberta - and who knew that Alberta would then hand Saskatchewan a gift by raising royalty rates, thus driving oil and gas activity to the former have-not province?
Alberta has reversed its royalty grab, but the province has had it good for so many years that it is hopelessly divided. It is split to the point of paralysis between urban and rural, Edmonton and Calgary, north and south, and the big issue is who gets the resource money. Not so in Saskatchewan, where everyone has suffered equally and now everyone seems happy to share the spoils.
"Some people in Alberta take development for granted," Mr. Cline says. "In Saskatchewan, no one takes it for granted."
His transition to the mining industry may seem bizarre in provinces that lack deep traditions of NDP governments. But in Saskatchewan people move easily from public to private life, and it tends to nurture more centrist governments. So when the NDP was defeated in 2007 by Brad Wall's Saskatchewan Party, the base for the current economic boom was already laid.
"By the time we left office, people were standing up and saying, 'We're from Saskatchewan and we're not embarrassed by it,'" Mr. Wall said.
A can-do attitude
Saskatoon is all about creative destruction. In the south end of the city, they are tearing down the old Intercontinental pork plant, a Dickensian labyrinth of killing halls and sausage-making rooms that hail back to times when pork king Fred Mendel was the city's arch-tycoon and spearheaded the building of an eponymous art gallery for the city.
Now the changing of the guard is evident in Discovery Plaza, a sleek downtown low-rise with a single tenant, Australia's BHP Billiton, the largest mine proprietor in the world. BHP has signed papers to take over the entire 45,000 square feet , which it hopes to fill with employees to push new potash mine development in the province.
BHP burst into local consciousness last winter when it was the sponsor of the Canadian Junior Hockey Championships in Saskatoon. Its new prominence creates a natural tension with the hometown club, Potash Corp., the biggest potash company in the world. Just adding to the tension is the constant speculation that BHP will acquire Potash at some point.
BHP has 30 people in Saskatoon, and expects to hit 75 next year, but has employed as many as 650 on contract in testing possible mine sites. A final decision on a new mine will be taken by the board in late 2011, the company says.
Meanwhile, Bill Doyle, CEO of Potash, argues that the potash price has not rebounded enough to justify a new green-field mine by BHP or anyone. When it is pointed out that mine developers are flocking to Saskatchewan, Mr. Doyle is dismissive.
"I think there are a lot of speculators in our space and most of them don't have a pot to pee in, to tell the truth ... You just can't make the numbers work. I don't care if you're the biggest mining company in the world or a speculator."
Big vision, big plans
One glance at Karim Nasser's driveway and you know he is not buying cars from Vaughn Wyant. A 1991 Honda Civic beater is parked along the curb, and a 1997 Mercury Cougar sits in the garage of his modest two-story house in a middle-class neighbourhood.
Mr. Nasser, known locally as Kay, was born in Lebanon but embodies the old prairie tradition of playing down your wealth. He is a millionaire developer but lives like a retired engineering professor which, indeed, he is.
Suddenly, at 83, Kay Nasser has emerged as a partner in the project that could transform the city, jumping in to salvage a proposed $200-million hotel-condo-retail complex along the river, after its Calgary developer ran into financial trouble. 'It's like a dynamo, it will create business all around it" says Mr. Nasser, who sees this as his legacy to the city.
The land is also symbolically significant, a scratchy patch tossed around as a potential development site for over 30 years. It serves as a boundary between the two Saskatoons, the East side, which has the university and fine homes - and the West, with its storefront clinics, thrift shops and home of many of the poorest aboriginal people.
In the great Saskatchewan upswing, there is a danger that this group will be left out - from education, housing and jobs. It's a microcosm of the challenge in a province where the aboriginal population is 15 per cent and growing fast. Saskatchewan will need this young labour pool if it is to sustain its economic rise - and reputation for social progress.
Engaging the young native population is "the great social imperative of the 20th century," says University of Saskatchewan president Peter MacKinnon. "If we don't succeed in that, we will be compromised in so many ways."

There is nothing like owning your own home to make you keenly aware of what is going on in the neighbourhood. When you rent, if something pops up on the horizon to threaten the quality of life locally, you can just pull up stakes and move. If, however, you have $50,000 or more invested and a mortgage that seems likely to last longer than your curly head of hair, the natural urge is to protect your own little bit of the GTA.
That is where local residents' or ratepayers' associations can play a major role. They can speak with a single voice to city hall through local councillors. Their clout is increased significantly if they work hand-in-hand with local business improvement associations.
A shining example of what can be achieved with that one-two political punch is the long-standing relationship between the Bloor-Yorkville Business Improvement Association and the Greater Yorkville Residents' Association.
The BIA has 1,650 members, all of whom run businesses in the area bounded roughly by Scollard Street to the north, St. Mary Street to the south, Avenue Road to the west and Church Street to the east. The GYRA covers a large chunk of that. It has about 2,800 members who live in 18 buildings, but membership extends only as far as Yonge Street to the east.
The Bloor-Yorkville BIA is one of 71 business improvement areas established by the province within the GTA. There are 230 in Ontario. The residents' association is probably one of a similar number. Unlike the BIAs, there is no province-wide association of resident and ratepayer groups, and therefore no running tally.
What makes the duo a powerful force in determining what happens in Yorkville?
"The BIA has the money and we have the votes," says Gee Chung, GYRA president.
That is indeed the secret of success when it comes to getting things done at city hall, says Briar de Lange, general manager of the BIA.
"While our members have an enormous stake in what happens in Yorkville, many of them live elsewhere," she says. "Votes go with where you live, not where you work, so our members don't have that political clout often needed to get things done."
The residents' association, however, commands at least 2,800 votes and likely a great many more through networking and influencing neighbours.
"In fact, right now we are doing an outreach program to try and bring in younger people," says Ms. Chung, who is a management consultant to the music industry. "There has been so much new development in the area that the mix of older and younger people has changed," she says. "We think once those young people understand what our goals are they will join us and carry on the work we have done for about 20 years now."
And what business and residents working together have achieved is truly impressive. In a process that took more than three years, they came up with the Bloor-Yorkville Urban Design Guidelines, a hefty document that tells would-be developers, in the finest detail, what residents and businesses want to see in anything new built in their neighbourhood.
Menkes Developments ran afoul of the guidelines with a new condo project it wants to build on the site of the Four Seasons Hotel on Avenue Road a block north of Bloor Street West. Menkes wants a height of about 127 metres. Business and residents say no more than 99 metres. That proposal is now in front of the Ontario Municipal Board.
The two groups have also come up with an inventory of, and plan for, streetscapes in the area. They want to preserve the special character, look and feel of Yorkville in the face of enormous pressure for change. They have also won $1.5-million to green the area with plantings of new trees and shrubs.
"We accept the need for new development. We are not one of those Not In My Back Yard groups," Ms. Chung says. "But at the same time, we want to preserve as much of the history and special character of the area [as we can] into the future."
Importantly, the two groups do not butt heads over issues. Ms. Chung sits on the BIA's planning protection and urban design committee, and another member of the GYRA sits on the traffic committee.
"If there is an issue that is important to the residents and we disagree, we seldom take a stand," says Briar de Lange, general manager of the Bloor-Yorkville BIA. "In most cases, however, residents are interested in issues that don't materially affect our members, such as traffic lights and such."
The benefits to both groups of this productive working relationship have been enormous, both women say.
"If we are going to go to council members to get their support, we simply have to work together," says Ms. de Lange. "Otherwise it is just too easy to ignore us."

Listing agents: Honey Moore and Andrea Stark, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
About 16 years ago, this North Toronto house was custom-built with an unconventional design to maximize the amount of living space and natural light inside, agent Honey Moore says.
The 2,348-square-foot house has a side centre-hall plan with the main entrance off the driveway and more windows facing south rather than east toward the street. "As a result, it gets a lot of light," Ms. Moore says. "The bay window in the living room faces the front."
The interior also feels more spacious, with nine-foot ceilings in most areas and a sky-lit cathedral ceiling in the master bedroom. "The high ceilings everybody really liked," the agent says.
Other highlights include a foyer flanked by entrances to the front living room and a rear family room with a gas fireplace, built-in media unit and French doors to the galley kitchen.
The cooking space, which can also be entered via the dining room, features upscale appliances, including a gas cooktop and two wall ovens, and ceramic floors.
By the breakfast area, windows frame the door to the private patio and detached double garage, "which is very rare for the area," Ms. Moore adds.
Amid the three bedrooms on the second floor, there are two out of four bathrooms, including a six-piece master ensuite.
Unlike the hardwood floors throughout the main floor, carpeting covers the upper level and lower level, which contains a nanny suite, an L-shaped recreation room and a wine cellar. "There's a huge amount of storage space in that house," Ms. Moore says.
Central vacuum and in-ground sprinkler systems allow for easy maintenance.
Local amenities include shops, restaurants and grocers on Bayview Avenue, as well as parks, schools and public transit.

First he conquered the Australian newspaper market. Then he broke the back of Britain's newspaper unions. Now he wants Manhattan.
Rupert Murdoch built his career and his global media conglomerate, News Corp., by attacking opponents vulnerable to takeovers or innovation. His newest target is the biggest of them all: The New York Times, the Grey Lady of the U.S. newspaper industry, which is struggling to overcome big debts, withering revenue and declining circulation. His weapon of attack is the Wall Street Journal, the daily financial bible he paid - many say overpaid - more than $5-billion (U.S.) to acquire in 2007.
The national business paper has been reinventing itself to broaden its readership (it recently hired its first police reporter), and next week the gloves go off when the Journal launches a daily New York edition.
Under what is internally known as the New Amsterdam project, the Journal has been making plans to publish a stand alone New York section that that will feature society gossip, sports, arts, real estate and local business and politics.
Media watchers are salivating at the prospect of a clash between Mr. Murdoch, 79, and Arthur "Pinch" Sulzberger, 58, the latest in a long line of Ochs-Sulzberger family members who have steered the New York Times since 1896.
It is new media money versus old newspaper establishment. It is News Corp., owner of the brassy New York Post tabloid and Republican-hugging Fox News heaving, against the staid, liberal-leaning New York Times, America's paper of record, which boasts the largest collection of Pulitzer Prizes and roots for Democratic President Barack Obama.
"Murdoch made it clear even before he walked into the door as an owner that he was targeting the New York Times," said Paul Steiger, former managing editor of the Journal, who now heads the non-profit investigative journalism group Pro Publica Inc.
If pre-battle skirmishes are any indication, the rivalry is shaping into the kind of old-fashioned newspaper brawl that defined newspaper wars in the 1920s and 1930s.
Taking its cue from what Mr. Murdoch described in recent television interview as his "Australianism" and "love of a fight," the Journal has dropped its pinstripe reserve to hurl unusually sharp jabs at its local competitor.
The Journal's managing editor, Robert Thomson, an Australian imported by Mr. Murdoch, has sneered in recent interviews at the New York Times' corporate strategy and local reporting.
The rivalry got personal last month when the lower half of Mr. Suzlberger's face appeared in a Wall Street Journal photo composite accompanying a story about feminine men.
The stunt prompted a blog from New York media critic and Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff that blared: "Murdoch to Sulzberger: you're a girly man."
Mr. Sulzberger was reportedly infuriated by the stunt, but it appears to have delighted Mr. Murdoch, who said he had no knowledge of the prank until the magazine was published.
"Oh, he should get a life," a chuckling Mr. Murdoch said of Mr. Sulzberger during a television interview earlier this month with veteran media critic Marvin Kalb.
"This is so nasty," said Edward Atorino, a media analyst with The Benchmark Company in New York.
"It's these two titans of the publishing business going at it."
The press war harkens back to another era, but the challenge for Mr. Murdoch and the Journal is very modern. The Wall Street Journal has billed itself for years as America's second paper, a circumspect digest of business news and analysis that professionals and investors should read to supplement local and political news.
The strategy makes less sense at a time when the economy is struggling and readers and advertisers are migrating to the Internet.
To be sure, the Journal has one of the strongest hands in the business. It has more than 2 million subscribers, twice that of the New York Times, and boasts one of the newspaper industry's most lucrative online news services because it charges readers for most web content.
But for all this success, the Journal has a strategic challenge. Its core business audience has limited growth potential at a time when its namesake Wall Street audience is reeling from one of the worst financial crises in decades. By going after the New York market, some observers believe the Journal hopes to broaden its online and advertising audience and further consolidate its media clout on the web.
"The Journal is a niche player. They have hit the limit of people with business accounts so they are going to try and expand the kind of people who pay for the Journal online," said Sree Sreenivasan, a digital media professor with Columbia University Journalism School.
Staking bigger territory online is a priority for Mr. Murdoch.
News Corp.'s London papers, The Times and Sunday Times, recently announced they will start charging online readers in June and Mr. Murdoch has targeted search engines such as Google as the enemy because they circulate newspaper stories for free on the Internet.
He is going after the New York Times at a time when it is financially vulnerable. Heavy debts forced the newspaper company to sell some of its new Manhattan office tower, it put The Boston Globe and other media and sports assets on the selling block and it turned to a Mexican telecom magnate for a $250-million injection last year.
Eyeing the New York Times' rich posted subscription rates (about $65 monthly), the Journal has signalled it is gunning for an intense price war by offering a heavily discounted subscription rate of $10 a month for the financial daily in New York City. Its object is to gain some of the Times' 827,000 New York readers, twice the Journal's local subscription base.
"What Rupert is trying to do, I think, is steal some of the New York Times' general interest audience while maintaining the Journal's business audience," said Mr. Steiger.
The Journal's Mr. Thomson gave New Yorkers a taste of what to expect for the press war when, during an interview last week with the New York Observer, he urged New York Times readers to: "cancel your subscription, read it on the Web for free and buy the Journal."

Full text:   Karen Donston's grocery cart often looks as if she's prepping for a national disaster. She might have 70 cans of Chef Boyardee pasta, or six dozen boxes of cereal (this load takes two carts), or bag upon bag of frozen vegetables. Good thing the Winnipeg mother of two is not bothered by the odd stare. The last laugh is hers: She has mastered a math game that turns those cereal boxes - and the $200 she spent on them - into a $600 flight to Kingston for a family visit, or, if she waits for the next run on frozen fries, perhaps a Caribbean cruise, all paid for with points from her Air Miles card.
Ms. Donston, a 42-year-old ad rep with a fistful of loyalty cards, is what Air Miles calls an "avid" collector, who diligently and strategically tallies the points. She knows that newly renovated grocery stores offer bonus points for a limited time, so she'll drive across the city to snag them, or to get gas at point-friendly service stations. "People only think I am crazy until they want to do it themselves," she says.
Canadians are among the most point-crazy people on the planet. We love handing over those plastic loyalty cards when we fly or pump gas, in order to rack up a points account that we can use to buy a blender or a trip to Vegas.
According to a 2009 study, the average Canadian household uses nine different loyalty programs - 50 per cent more than their American neighbours.
"There is a certain Canadian mania," says Lindsay Meredith, a marketing professor at Simon Fraser University. "I think it's the same genes that drive our British Columbian response to search out a litre of gas for exactly .2 of a cent less than the guy down the street."
The recession has fuelled our fetish: Last fall, one-fifth of Canadians surveyed said they were using their reward points to stretch their budgets, and companies such as Aeroplan saw more people cashing them in for Christmas gifts as opposed to fancy trips. The fastest-growing group of collectors are those between the age of 18 and 25, a demographic hit hard by the slow economy.
This trend certainly makes companies happy - loyalty programs make for loyal customers, who sometimes don't bother redeeming the points that lure them into the store, are less likely to comparison-shop, and whose choices can be easily tracked and charted every time they pull out their card.
But the appetite for points also has some governments and marketers thinking: If Canadians are willing to cross town for a handful of loyalty points, what else might we do for them? All those Air Miles points might have a value beyond vacation cruises and kitchen appliances - they might help build a greener, healthier nation.
Far beyond travel
This is Karen Shiller's list: a trip to New York this month with her 16-year-old daughter, a family flight to London booked for this fall, a Bose CD player, rain barrels and one kayak (hand-delivered to her home). These are the items she has recently "purchased" with her Aeroplan miles, which she collects by using her credit card for everything she buys, even small errands at the convenience store.
She used to stick to the travel rewards, but during the recession, Ms. Shiller, a former lawyer and English teacher at Ottawa's Algonquin College, and her partner, a real-estate developer, began using some of their 500,000-plus miles to get items they would have felt guilty about purchasing with cash.
"It became a way to give ourselves a little treat," she says. "It's like spending money, but it doesn't feel that way."
The country's fondness for loyalty programs may be, as Prof. Meredith suggests, at least partly in our genes; Canadians have traditionally been savers, an immigrant nation of bargain hunters averse to debt and big on nest eggs - although as credit-card spending escalates, those habits are quickly changing. Perhaps it dates to 1961, when Canadian Tire money - dubbed the nation's "second currency" - was introduced; roughly 90 per cent of those bills still find their way back to the store.
The biggest reason is probably simple logistics. Unlike the United States, Canada has more national banks and retailers, which allowed plans such as Air Miles, to arrive on the scene in 1992, allowing customers to collect points from a virtual mall of stores and locations, rather than one card per retailer.
Aeroplan has expanded from just offering flights and travel deals; its recent offerings include marquee items such as a Gibson guitar signed by Blue Rodeo's Jim Cuddy. (Yours for just 117,500 points, which are then donated by Aeroplan to the charity War Child Canada to reduce its travel costs.)
Of course, retailers such as Shoppers Drug Mart aren't just giving away points or cashbacks for nothing. They are counting on the plans creating repeat high-end customers, who might buy products they don't need or won't use just to rack up points or stop shopping for a better price at the competitor next door.
Then there's the information that gets collected, Prof. Meredith points out - where you shop, what you buy, how much you'll pay, and, ultimately, who you are. Stores use it to decide what to stock on their shelves, what promotions to send out, how high to set prices. On the positive side, it means your local grocery chain may be more likely to carry the gourmet mustard that you want. On the negative side, they also learn just how to lure you inside to buy it.
Although loyalty plans can't sell an individual's information, they share aggregate data with their clients and sponsors, or use it themselves: Which means that somewhere, there's a computer file with your name on it. "That information becomes very powerful weaponry," Prof. Meredith says.
"Usually when I ask my students, 'Do you mind if they know what groceries you are buying?' they say no. And then I say, 'Do you mind if they know what drugs you buy and how much alcohol you consume?' Then they get interested."
But revealing her spending habits is a cost that Taylor Ferri is prepared to pay - if it means her points will cover at least some of the gas in her daily commute from Markham to downtown Toronto for school. "You're getting something back for free," the 22-year-old public-relations student says. "I know they take your marketing information, but I'm okay with that."
Since she started collecting Air Miles at the age of 18 - her parents urged her to get a card once she was old enough - she estimates that she has saved up about 10,000 points. She has used them to buy a gas gift card, and a global positioning system device, and right now she's saving up for a trip to New York after graduation.
"I am kind of a point freak," she says. "If my friends don't have Air Miles, I snatch their points when I can."
The greening of loyalty
Air Miles is taking Canada's appetite for loyalty plans one step further - toward influencing consumer behaviour in a positive direction for the environment. It's also a bit of green-washing for a program built on flying people around the world, leaving a heavy carbon footprint, though Air Miles says most rewards are now redeemed for consumer goods and services, not air travel.
Six months ago, Air Miles became the first loyalty company to award consumers with extra points when they bought green-friendly products - locally grown meat or organic dishwashing detergent. Instead of driving across town for gas at the right spot, you can now use your points in several cities to get a bus pass (or an electric scooter, if you'd rather), and Edmonton has become the first city where you can collect points by taking the bus.
This week, the Ontario Power Authority began offering 20 Air Miles to every household that simply pledges to reduce their phantom power - the electricity that's expended by leaving computers and electronics running when no one is using them. Twenty Air Miles won't get a collector very far, but in the first day, the program, which is really about raising awareness, earned 1,000 pledges. (Another 10 Air Miles are donated to the World Wildlife Fund for every pledge.) A pilot project in Toronto offered apartment residents points if they took their hazardous waste to a proper landfill - the program saw a 30-per-cent increase in waste drop-offs.
According to Air Miles, the number of Canadians using the program to buy transit passes increases every month - though it's not clear how many are new bus passengers. In its first month, 250,000 purchases were made as part of the company's green program.
If we do that in the first month, imagine what we can do over time," says Andrew Souvaliotis, the chief impact officer with Air Miles, who manages the company's "My Planet" program. Another venture he's working on would try to encourage healthy eating and physical activity among Canadians, though he won't give details.
In Winnipeg, the very kind of customer that Mr. Souvaliotis thinks he can influence is watching the promotions for the next chance to overstock her shelves - and her points account. Karen Donston doesn't even eat most of those extra groceries. She gives a lot of it away to family or the food bank. Her university-age son sold the extra cereal to his roommates.
She's so good at it that she gives lunch-and-learn sessions to co-workers, and has even accompanied a couple of them to the grocery store for a first-hand lesson. One of her colleagues went to Orlando, Fla., last week, courtesy of her training. (At work, she recently acquired the contract for Air Miles, when she happened to be assigned all the A-letter companies. "I was so excited," she says.)
Her best advice to getting that free trip faster: Be patient, do your math and watch for promotions that can triple your points.
And be prepared to leave the store with 70 cereal boxes piled high in your cart.

Full text:   Local councillors propose asking for a blanket Ontario moratorium on wind-power development
It's an ongoing battle worthy of Cervantes, if he'd been an eco-minded urban planner: A furious group of residents, tilting at a hypothetical windmill.
The proposed turbine project, which would set up windmills in Lake Ontario off the Scarborough Bluffs, would be one of the province's first forays into offshore wind power. Studies into whether such a project is even feasible are still in the nascent stage. It will take at least two years before Toronto Hydro knows whether there's enough wind to make it work, and provincial regulations governing such a proposition are a ways off.
But the Don Quixotes of the Scarborough Bluffs are dead set against the suggestion. And their vocal opposition is putting local politicians on notice.
A motion going before Monday's executive committee, put forward by two local councillors, proposes to ask the province for a blanket moratorium on wind-power development in Ontario. Even if the motion does make its way through council, it will have little impact, but it's symbolic of the sway local opposition can have on such a project.
As Toronto commits to sourcing a quarter of its energy from renewable sources and the Ontario government commits billions of dollars to green-energy projects across the province, local opposition to backyard energy generation is something with which next year's council will have to contend.
Already in the Guildwood community's case, the turbine spat has galvanized candidates challenging incumbent councillor Paul Ainslie, arguing he hasn't been vocal enough in his opposition. Mayoral candidates are being told in no uncertain terms that if they hope to pursue projects like these, they'll have to find a way to work with angry residents.
Mr. Ainslie, the Scarborough East councillor who put forward Monday's motion along with Scarborough Southwest councillor Brian Ashton, says he was motivated to do so out of concern for a precious part of the Toronto waterfront and fear that residents' concerns are being ignored.
"People have a lot of concerns and people want to be listened to," he said. "We're asking for a moratorium because there's health concerns, there's real estate issues with property values and there's a lot of things that are unanswered."
The wind turbine issue is making Mr. Ainslie political enemies in his own ward: It's the reason John LaForet is gunning for Mr. Ainslie's council seat in October. "I'd fight like hell to kill the project," he says.
Ontario Energy Minister Brad Duguid said even if the city's executive committee passes the motion, it won't change anything. If the project is deemed feasible and meets whatever provincial rules are put in place, it will likely go forward.
"There's an 80-fold increase in wind turbines happening across Ontario - it is going to be something that's going to be part of our landscape," he said. "I think it would be a little bit hypocritical for Toronto, given its efforts to try to portray itself as a green city, to support this resolution. But that's something that council will have to deal with. We're determined to move forward with building green energy."
Mayor David Miller, who has championed the city's push towards renewable power, said opposition to the Scarborough Bluffs turbine is the exception, rather than the rule.
"The vast bulk of the green projects we're doing are not only not controversial, they're overwhelmingly embraced by people."
It would be "tragic" if fear of angering residents prevented the city's politicians from pursuing much-needed renewable energy initiatives, said York University environmental studies professor Mark Winfield.
"I think the potential is enormous and the benefits are enormous," he said. "The biggest danger in some ways ... is, frankly, the derailment of some of these efforts."
***
THE CANDIDATES SAY ...
George Smitherman "I used the NIMBY expression to define those residents [opposed to the wind project] once, and ... that language was unhelpful in the discussion."
Rocco Rossi "I'd like to be able to proceed from the facts. So, show me the business case, but let's take a look at those alternatives, which may in fact be more cost-effective ... "
Joe Pantalone "The idea of simply stopping something that may or may not happen simply makes no sense to me."
Rob Ford "If the residents don't want it, I wouldn't do it. ... When I become mayor, it will be stopped."
Sarah Thomson "Renewable energy is a valuable resource that the city needs to use moving forward."
Giorgio Mammoliti "I think that we are asking for trouble when we are trying to commit because of a political agenda and not a common-sense agenda."

Full text:   Developer Peter Freed's grandiose vision for the Toronto harbourfront features a giant boardwalk across the water. It may have flaws, but bravo to a private citizen for floating such an ambitious plan
jmays@globeandmail.com
For the past several years, Toronto real-estate developer Peter Freed has been watching the revitalization of the city's inner harbour inch slowly forward, and he has not liked much that's happening by the water's edge. "It's a typical, boring, Canadian version of what could be," he told me. "There's nothing earth-shattering about it, nothing globally impressive about it."
But unlike most Torontonians who dislike the painstaking handiwork of Waterfront Toronto - the Crown corporation overseeing the renewal of the industrial harbour lands - Mr. Freed has taken the time to contribute something new to the discussion of the inner shoreline's redesign.
His idea, unveiled last week, is grandiose. It's more extravagant than anything proposed so far by the urban planners and architects working for Waterfront Toronto. And it's certainly the most unusual harbourfront scheme anybody's come up with since local people began to think about uniting the city and Lake Ontario 200 years ago.
Mr. Freed suggests throwing a linear green park over the railway corridor that runs across inner-city Toronto (not a bad notion, in my view).
This park, with its biking, jogging and rollerblading paths, would then connect, probably at the foot of Bathurst Street - this is where the proposal gets interesting - with an immense boardwalk jutting out into the harbour just east of the island airport. The boardwalk, perhaps 50 feet wide, would bend around the harbour in a great arc, meeting the linear park again somewhere on the east side of downtown. (Mr. Freed hasn't decided where this eastern connection might take place.)
In this vision, the pedestrian walkway out into the water is supplied with restaurants, cafes and places for picnicking. At the point where the arc swings closest to the Toronto Islands and farthest from the mainland, Mr. Freed foresees "a huge entertainment space ... for symphonies, concerts. ... Statue-of-Liberty-size statues of people from all races and cultures, from Toronto's past or whatever" stand in the water near the concert podium. "This is the only way for Toronto to take full ownership of its waterfront, by putting you right in the bay," Mr. Freed said. "It doesn't have to be overwhelmed with programming. It could be nice places to eat, walk, run, sit down and enjoy the view."
Also in this scenario, the Toronto Islands would no longer be accessible only by the ferry and water taxis that run from the foot of Yonge Street. The boardwalk, Mr. Freed said, could touch the islands at various points, opening foot and cycling traffic from the mainland for the first time in more than a century.
Mr. Freed has not presented his idea to city officials or to anyone at Waterfront Toronto, nor has he sat through any of the intense public planning sessions that have been going on throughout most of the past decade. "This is a fresh concept that has been in my head," he said, "and I thought we could throw it out there for some debate, to see if it can catch wind with the forces that be."
The developer has anticipated some immediate objections to his plan - the way it would seem to block the passage of the island ferry, for example, and interfere with the free manoeuvring of pleasure craft in and out of the harbour and commercial shipping to the Redpath Sugar refinery. His reply: The boardwalk would rise at its western and eastern extremities to allow boats to pass unobstructed, and other accommodations would be made for Great Lakes ships. "There is nothing that could not be worked out here. People flew to the moon in a space ship, so I'm sure we could figure out how to get a ship or two in and out of the sugar plant. If we can't we should all be embarrassed."
My own problems with this controversial scheme include all the ones I just mentioned, plus an aesthetic consideration. The small lagoon framed by the archipelago of islands and the dense fabric of the downtown towers is, as it stands, one of Toronto's most attractive natural features. I can't see how filling it with an enormous boardwalk and with towering statues would enhance the beauty of this expanse of water or the already fine views of the city from the islands.
Logistics and aesthetics aside, however, the notable thing about Mr. Freed's proposal is that a private citizen, on his own initiative, took the trouble to make it. We should hope that other people in the city will follow his lead, and launch similarly ambitious waterfront ideas into the public debate about what's to become of Toronto's Lake Ontario edge.

Abstract: "It's nice to finally, hopefully, get some closure," defenceman Derek Morris said. "Obviously people here want to know what's up with the team, where it's going, what's it going to do - but that's not something we can control. We never thought about it during the year. Obviously, I've got kids here, everybody wants the team to be here to support. Hockey's growing in Arizona. I think bringing Reinsdorf in will help."

Full text:   Chicago businessman's ties to Glendale help lease proposal gain approval
Now that Jerry Reinsdorf won the first battle for control of the Phoenix Coyotes, the players are hopeful stability for the beleaguered NHL franchise is on the way - although no one is sure what will happen next.
One thing that is for sure is that Reinsdorf and his partners know their way around the suburban city of Glendale's corridors of power much better than the losing candidates for the Coyotes, the group of businessmen known as Ice Edge Holdings LLC. Reinsdorf, who also owns the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Bulls, has real-estate interests in Glendale and, more importantly, had already convinced city council to build a lavish spring-training facility for his Major League Baseball team and the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The key figure in Reinsdorf's on-and-off-again campaign to buy the Coyotes is local lawyer and former politician John Kaites. He has a long relationship with Glendale city manager Ed Beasley and handled most of the negotiations with the city for the lease proposal for Jobing.com Arena that was unanimously approved by city council on Tuesday night.
Kaites started out as a TV weatherman in the Phoenix area and then became, in succession, a lawyer, state politician and lobbyist. Reinsdorf supported Kaites's political career and did business with him after he went into private practice as a lawyer and lobbyist.
The Phoenix New Times newspaper reported last August, during Reinsdorf's first flirtation with the Coyotes, that he and Kaites began meeting Beasley as far back as December, 2008, when former Coyotes owner Jerry Moyes was trying to get financial help from the city. Through a freedom of information request, the New Times learned of many meetings between Beasley and Kaites and that Beasley hired a Massachusetts company, Beacon Sports Management, with ties to Reinsdorf's son Michael, to look at the Coyotes' finances.
Michael Reinsdorf's company, IFG, was hired by Glendale in the fall of 2008 to look at operations of Jobing.com Arena. The New Times reported that it was IFG which recommended Beasley hire Beacon to look at the Coyotes.
Neither Beasley or Kaites responded to requests for comment.
Now, while Kaites prepares to hammer out a complete lease agreement with Glendale, one in which a special district around the arena will be expected to raise almost $47-million (all currency U.S.) per year for the team through bonds and other revenue, the Ice Edge group is packing its bags.
"I'd say we're very disappointed," said Daryl Jones, chief operating officer of Ice Edge. "We definitely didn't expect it to end like this. We've basically run a political campaign for the last 72 hours trying to appeal to Glendale city council, including hiring the former Attorney General of Arizona to help us lobby, but it didn't get us anywhere."
NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said he doesn't know how Glendale, a city of 250,000, will be able to sell enough municipal bonds (which are not a hot seller these days) and make enough other revenue to satisfy Reinsdorf's plan to pay as much as $65-million over three years to the league as part of the purchase price plus raise another $25-million a year to cover the anticipated operating losses.
"You'll have to ask the city of Glendale - that's not the right question for us," Daly said. "But obviously they made a significant investment in this team, in the building. They are going to try everything they can to make sure the team stays."
A spokesperson for Glendale did not respond to a request for comment.
The Coyotes, who made their first playoff appearance in eight years last night, are hoping the talk about a move will die down even though Reinsdorf's lease proposal has an escape clause after five years.
"It's nice to finally, hopefully, get some closure," defenceman Derek Morris said. "Obviously people here want to know what's up with the team, where it's going, what's it going to do - but that's not something we can control. We never thought about it during the year. Obviously, I've got kids here, everybody wants the team to be here to support. Hockey's growing in Arizona. I think bringing Reinsdorf in will help."

School board studies sale of land to developers

Full text:   Money would be used to rejuvenate schools on five sites being considered
Faced with a staggering backlog of repairs on its aging infrastructure, the Toronto District School Board is launching redevelopment studies of five areas across the city to decide whether to sell off parcels of its land and use the money to rejuvenate the schools on those sites.
The proposal is touted as win-win: Developers hungry for real-estate in a city with an over-heated housing market get prime (and increasingly rare) land on which to build; a school board sitting on a $2.8-billion repair backlog - up from $474-million a decade ago - gets the cash it so desperately needs; students get better facilities.
But some parents are leery of the prospect of sending their children to school adjacent to major construction, only to find themselves living and studying in the shadow of a condo tower once the dust clears. And some local politicians argue that selling off public land to private developers is rash and unnecessary.
Wendy Crawford's daughter Sarah is in Grade 1 at Davisville Public School, one of several whose potential redevelopment is up for discussion. With a timeline of at least three years - more likely five, or as long as seven - her school would be under construction for most of her elementary career, Ms. Crawford fears.
"We don't want our daughter to have to be living in a construction zone."
Davisville is also prime real estate: It's just blocks away from Yonge-Eglinton Square, whose ambitious RioCan makeover city council approved last month. There's no doubt the school board would find plenty of buyers if it were to sell off even small portions of the sites being discussed.
"I think it's very smart for the school board to be looking into this," said Steve Deveaux, vice-president of land development for Tribute Communities. He said there would "absolutely" be interest from developers and buyers in the properties the TDSB is studying.
"There's less and less opportunities for intensification and ... a lot of these locations are in prime areas of the city," he said. "They're close to transit, close to amenities, close to retail, and these are the places people want to live."
And, said Sheila Penny, the school board's executive superintendent of facility services, the board needs the money.
"We want to ensure that we end up with great schools and great communities, and we generate revenue. These are the three drivers," she said.
"We're not about putting towers up in the middle of existing residential communities. It's very important to respect the urban context of what it is that we're planning."
The city's model in this regard is North Toronto Collegiate Institute. Construction on a revitalized version of the school's historic building will be completed this summer, just as occupants of the two adjacent condominium buildings move in.
The multimillion-dollar project was made possible by the sale of seven-tenths of an acre of land to Tridel development, which netted the school board more than $22-million. Almost all the 528 units, which range in price from about $500,000 to $2.9-million, have been spoken for and sold months before construction's slated for completion.
Work on the new school went on for years, with about $50-million going toward a new building - including painstakingly restored heritage features - a sports track, landscaping and underground parking facilities. The final price tag is unusually high, Ms. Penny says: She expects work on other school sites being studied to be closer to the $30-million to $40-million range. This was due in part to the scope and special considerations for the project, which resulted in special structural requirements and a school building that's higher and denser than a typical high school.
"This won't work everywhere, but clearly in urban centres where we have the density that's prevalent here, it works very well," said Tridel senior vice-president Jim Ritchie of the development deal.
This, insists school board trustee and city council candidate Josh Matlow, is the new normal for making Toronto's school board economically viable.
"The TDSB's greatest asset is its land - along with the city, it's one of the top landowners in Toronto. And in my view, it has consistently mismanaged its property assets for far too many years."
But Chris Sellors, Mr. Matlow's opponent for the St. Paul's council seat and former assistant to departing councillor Michael Walker, a vehement opponent of the plan, says the city can't afford to sell off its public property.
"It's a short-term, shortsighted plan that could just fix their budgets for a couple of years, but in the long term it will sell our students short," he said, adding that he'd rather see a different provincial funding formula to solve the school board's cash woes.
"We don't want to cause any alarm that the school board is suddenly becoming a condo developer," Ms. Penny said. "This is one creative way to solve part of the problem. But it's just one part."

Full text:   It's only a matter of time before an episode of The Big Bang Theory opens with Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Raj playing iPad Scrabble and using their iPhones as virtual tile racks.
Aside from bringing a whole new dimension of geekiness to Hasbro's word game, it may also be the most expensive way to play: The app is only $9.99, but add an iPad and four (optional) iPhones and the price skyrockets to about $3,000.
Still, old-fashioned board games like Scrabble are what excite me most about gaming on Apple's new tablet. Its large touch screen, which is big enough for several people to view comfortably and can handle simultaneous interactions by multiple users, is perfectly suited for a classic tabletop experience - especially if you have a few iPhones on hand to conceal cards.
Sadly, not many of these games are available yet. Hundred of interactive games can be found in the app store, but the vast majority are simply higher-resolution versions of games designed for the iPhone, maybe with an extra mode or level thrown in. Not that that's necessarily a slam.
Real Racing HD ($9.99), big brother to Real Racing for the iPhone, recalls the visual experience of a console racer. As the "HD" suggests, this game has been modified to take advantage of the iPad's 9.7-inch, 1024-by-768 pixel screen to deliver detailed car models and big, beautiful tracks.
But the larger screen also introduces some problems. The iPad weighs a pound and a half, and holding it like a steering wheel - players pilot by tilting the tablet left and right - for an extended period is a chore. My forearms requested respite after only a few races.
The weight, combined with the iPad's curved and slippery backside, becomes an even bigger issue in a game like Command & Conquer: Red Alert ($12.99). This real-time strategy game lets players select units and attack enemies via a series of intuitive taps.
However, holding the iPad in one hand while interacting with the screen with my other had me worrying that the hefty tablet would slip from my grip.
Still, game developers - especially those that make casual games, which are in the iPad app store's $1-to-$15 sweet spot - seem convinced of the iPad's potential as a game platform.
"The iPad opens a universe of design possibilities," said Michael Fergusson, chief executive office of Vancouver-based Ayogo Inc., a company currently working on an unannounced iPad game.
"We felt very constrained by the iPhone's screen real estate," he explained.
"Our new game becomes a comic book at some points, and we couldn't do that [with the iPhone] because we didn't have the space.
"Now we can have high-quality cells, design a menu that contains more than just a few items and have more room to explore and move around. It makes a huge difference."
However, while the iPad offers clear advantages over an iPhone, it doesn't bring much new to interactive entertainment on the whole.
Its graphics are superior to other portable platforms, but inferior to current consoles and most computers.
And while its touch screen is slick and almost ridiculously natural (Google "two-year-old tries an iPad" for proof of its accessibility), most of us are by now well acquainted with similar interfaces, be they on phones, the Nintendo DS or all-in-one computers.
The iPad is a fun new platform on which to play games, and its large, lovely screen has the potential to enrich portable gaming and local multiplayer experiences.
However, if you're looking for the sort of game-changing innovation delivered by a machine like Nintendo's Wii, it's just not here.

A fresh start for a new generation of Haitians

Full text:   Founders envision rebirth of destroyed La Jacmelienne hotel as community youth hub
jleeder@globeandmail.com
On her first trip to this city, the Grande Dame of Jacmel rode in with a chicken between her legs and a gun across her lap.
That was 30 years ago, when there was only one hotel in town and the journey from Port-au-Prince was a mettle-testing six-hour mountain trek.
"And it was marvellous," Marlene Danies recalled wistfully, drawing out the 'r' for emphasis.
On that fateful ride in, Mrs. Danies had no idea who she was about to become, or what, exactly, she would be capable of conjuring from the worn and sleepy seaside city.
But within a year or so of her arrival, she was presiding over the meticulous construction of a 20-room hotel she and her Haitian-born husband, Eric, called La Jacmelienne. Before long, the two had developed the seafront gem into a legendary institution, inside of which racial and class distinctions melted. Together, they helped coax Jacmel into its last cultural renaissance, a bloom of arts, fashion, culture and tourism that suffused the city in the 1980s.
"It was a time when the international community was finally looking at us in a different light," Mrs. Danies recalled. "All these investments were coming. ... We saw the opening of industrial parks. We saw agriculture movements. We saw a need for tourism, and the importance of it."
That sense of renewal, which ramped up during the reign of ex-President Jean-Claude Duvalier, known as Baby Doc, prompted Mr. and Mrs. Danies to abandon their home in Montreal to set roots in Haiti. They wanted to participate in the rebuilding and the best place to make an impact, they decided, was in Jacmel.
"We had the vision when we went down. We knew Jacmel was gorgeous. We knew it was the time," Mrs. Danies said, adding: "And we worked on it: developing all the little artisan trades, refurbishing the beautiful old colonial houses."
When La Jacmelienne opened in December, 1978, flaunting its Haitian-carved mahogany doors and local artwork, it was the city's only real hotel, and its reputation exploded.
"Word just got out. It got to Europe and America. Tourist people came down," Mrs. Danies said. Presidents visited; foreigners smitten with the hotel and the heritage neighbourhood surrounding it bought properties and opened art galleries to feature local work.
"Because of the type of place Jacmel is, we attracted only people that cared about culture and about something exotic," Mrs. Danies said. "Let's face it. Haiti is intoxicating and you can be seduced immediately by the colours and the sounds and the smells."
Soon, La Jacmelienne garnered mentions in The New York Times and Gourmet magazine; the economic prosperity began to unfurl across the city. "It just bloomed," Mrs. Danies said. "It just never stopped."
The massive earthquake of Jan. 12 split open the walls holding up the 31-year-old hotel and drove deep fissures into the white-tiled walkways that lead to its guest quarters. That night, more than a quarter of the city's 700 hotel rooms were destroyed, leaving town officials wondering where, if they are ever able to reignite tourism, the guests will actually stay.
In the case of La Jacmelienne, the truth is that the heyday years had long been slipping away before that fateful night. Although the hotel was still operating when the earthquake happened, locals say it had been in decline since 1997, when Marlene and Eric divorced and she left Jacmel.
Three years ago, Mr. Danies died of a heart attack, spurring an estate dispute that has pitted his second wife, Marguerite, and the two young children they had together in Jacmel, against the Montreal-based team of Marlene and her adult daughter Donalisa.
The damage caused by the earthquake further complicated what was already a difficult situation; the future of La Jacmelienne is more than ever up in the air.
Since January, the long-distance tug-of-war has been in play between Marguerite, who seems to want to keep the heavily damaged hotel, and the Danies family, who seem conflicted over what would be best for the hotel - and the city.
"The hotel is practically nonexistent," Donalisa Danies said in a recent interview, adding that she has been talking with two groups interested in buying the remains of the hotel to repurpose the property as a school, hospital or community youth facility.
"The property is immense and they could construct all kinds of things to try and start a new generation of youth in Jacmel that are able to carry out their dreams," she said. "We think that the hotel and Jacmel could really become a new hub for youth, for culture, education, and a whole bunch of things."
Does that mean the family that created the blueprint for cultural renaissance in Jacmel is passing up the chance to be part of its renewal?
"That's the million-dollar question," Donalisa said. "It would take people like us to go back."

THE NORTH SCRAPES BOTTOM

Author: Vanderklippe, Nathan

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/north-scrapes-bottom/docview/382566295/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "There are lots of resources up there, but a lot of those are not currently on mine plans because of the operating costs. And that's mainly linked to energy cost," says Ricus Grimbeek, the former president of the Ekati diamond mine, now the global vice-president of health, safety, environment and community at BHP Billiton. "Once you've solved that, you've got diamond mines for the next 50 years, easily."

Full text:   The Northwest Territories has feasted on diamonds for two decades, transforming itself from a barren land to one of jobs and riches. But with the great mines nearly tapped out, the good times are over and another painful economic stretch is just beginning. Nathan VanderKlippe reports from the Diavik diamond mine, NWT.
Ninety metres below a gaping hole in the subarctic Barren Lands, a huge square tunnel ends at a wall of dark rock. Overhead, water drips from Lac de Gras, the epicentre of Canada's diamond boom.
The dripping is a reminder that the lake's shores were moved to make way for an open-pit mine. Now that that pit has reached its bottom, miners are down here digging a network of tunnels to extract what remains of the carrot-shaped deposit of kimberlite that they have been pulling from the ground for nearly a decade. In the light of their lamps, the rock looks black as coal.
Hidden inside are the diamonds that have shaped the fate of the Northwest Territories for the past 20 years. Between Diavik and other diamond mines, the wealth at Lac de Gras, about 300 kilometres north of Yellowknife, accounts for nearly a quarter of the territorial economy. Diamonds have pumped billions into local businesses and bank accounts, and have been a catalyst for remarkable social change, including dramatic increases in graduation rates in some aboriginal communities as economic success is passed from generation to generation.
But the fact that miners are working 90 metres underground, and not still scraping away the surface, points to the end of the boom. A place already rocked by the global downturn now faces the reality that its payday resource is running out.
One former government official warns that a looming lack of jobs may create a "lost generation"; another refers to the coming years as Exodus 4, the latest painful chapter for a territory that has witnessed severe busts before.
It is a bitterly dramatic transformation for a place that not long ago held abundant promise. People flocked north for plentiful, high-paying jobs and a pristine landscape that invited outdoor play.
Now people are leaving, businesses are looking for work elsewhere, and both executives and leaders warn that the NWT could find itself severely pinched in the years to come. A push to create a diamond-polishing industry has largely failed, with only a few remaining polishers left in Yellowknife. Efforts to boost tourism have similarly floundered.
Many have lost hope that the Mackenzie Valley natural gas pipeline, which was seen as the territory's ticket to self-sufficiency, will be built any time soon.
As for the dwindling diamonds, both Diavik and BHP Billiton's Ekati, the other big mine, officially will stay open for another decade. But executives privately worry that operations will be scaled back as early as 2016.
"I would draw the analogy to harvesting an animal," says Bob Gannicott, the chairman and chief executive officer of Harry Winston Diamond Corp., the luxury retailer that owns a 40-per-cent stake of Diavik. (The 60 per cent owned by mining giant Rio Tinto PLC.) "We've already had the T-bone steak and we've already had the prime rib roast of this particular animal. We now have to move on to the hamburger and the chuck steak."
The diamonds dry up
The NWT has stared down death before. In the late 1980s, when Yellowknife's founding gold mines were closing, the diamond rush suddenly swept in, more than filling the void.
"The North has been good to a lot of people," says Erik Marsden, who runs the ice roads that serve the diamond mines, and is Diavik's longest-serving employee, with 14 years under his belt. "There's always something that comes over the horizon and takes the place of something else."
Few people have the negative perspective of Mr. Gannicott, who has spent three decades in the North and was a key force in the discovery of Diavik. Despite Harry Winston's New York face, Mr. Gannicott spends significant time in Yellowknife, where he keeps a home.
"We're past high noon here now," he says, as he sits overlooking a ski plane runway that has grown strangely quiet in the past year. Like many here, he knows that several small NWT mines are under development. Avalon Resources Ltd. is pursuing a rare-earth minerals deposit. De Beers, which runs the smaller Snap Lake diamond mine, has also revived its effort to build a second mine, called Gahcho Kue. And exploration could soon begin in the Arctic offshore, where BP PLC and Exxon Mobil Corp. have committed to $2-billion in spending.
Mr. Gannicott, however, doesn't see anything on the horizon that could replace the diamond mines that are, he says, "the linchpins of the economy up here. So what happens after that?
"When they close, all those people that have now got training, are used to being in that wage economy and are doing very well in it - they're frankly going to have to move out of the NWT to be able to carry on doing what they're currently doing for a living."
Some have already begun doing exactly that. Last year, the NWT population declined, and employment fell by 5 per cent.
The economic crisis, of course, played a major role, forcing suspensions of diamond production and causing a huge cutback in spending among junior exploration companies whose sources of capital dried up. Exploration spending in the territory, which once led the country, fell to $29-million last year from $148-million in 2008.
Diavik's transition to underground mining will mean fewer jobs - paralleling the experience at Ekati, where underground mining started in 2002 - and also fewer profits.
At Diavik, it costs about $80 per tonne to process ore from open pits. Underground mining will raise the cost 50 per cent to $120. Most of the underground mining will come from a location that produces on average two carats per tonne - well below the 3.5 and five carats per tonne at the pits. Production volume will substantially decrease.
Worse, the chance of finding more diamonds to sustain further operations has largely faded.
"Both BHP and ourselves have had exploration programs for a number of years and not found anything else that's economical," Mr. Gannicott says.
But for a place that, by the numbers, looks like it's in dire straits, it's tough to see much sign of worry in Yellowknife these days. The NWT has seen a 23-per-cent contraction in its economy in the past two years - a far greater plunge than any other jurisdiction in Canada - but real estate in the northern capital continues a seemingly inexorable rise and the most expensive restaurants still fill up even on weeknights.
Long-time residents are confident it will continue this way. Government, which by some estimates supports 40 per cent of the economy, is not going anywhere, meaning Yellowknife will always have a strong base. Ideas for new infrastructure hold the promise of extending the territory's economic lifelines - including that of the diamond mines.
Pipeline hopes die
The decline in diamond mining has thrown the NWT's other great hope into stark relief. The Mackenzie Valley pipeline, intended to bring natural gas to hungry southern markets from offshore drilling in the Arctic, has long been a divisive symbol of northern development.
The project was first bruited in 1970. When a federal inquiry headed by Justice Thomas Berger recommended a go-slow approach to the pipeline in 1977, it was a milestone victory for the environmental and native rights movements.
But over time, resistance by some of the native bands along the pipeline route changed to an embrace of the project - so long as native people themselves had a say and a stake, which came to pass via the Aboriginal Pipeline Group. The settlement of land claims by most of the aboriginal groups along the pipeline route was part and parcel of the new attitude.
But the revival of the pipeline idea has stalled as the massive cost of the project, as well as the relative contributions of the federal government and participating energy companies, has been weighed against changes in the natural gas market. Moreover, one native group - the Deh Cho, who have not settled their land claim - has opposed proceeding.
The delay is a source of frustration to Joe Handley, the former NWT premier who pushed for the $16.2-billion megaproject, because it would pour billions into the territory and open its frontiers to petroleum exploration like it's never seen.
But Mr. Handley has largely lost hope. The proliferation of shale gas supplies in southern Canada and the U.S. has reduced the need for Arctic gas - and slashed the prices the project would depend on.
"You look at the cost of the Mackenzie Valley pipeline's $4 or $5 gas and it just doesn't add up," he says. "You're not going to make much money on it, if any. You might lose money on the thing."
It could be many years before the pipeline is built, Mr. Handley says. He believes the impact of looming hard times is already visible.
"You don't find people spending the way they used to. If they do have that disposable income, they're being very careful with it," he says. "And I see that happening for a long time, until people become much more optimistic about where things are going."
Pipeline supporters like Fred Carmichael, the chair of the Aboriginal Pipeline Group, have grown angry with the argument about shale gas. He believes that the exploitation of shale gas will be limited by environmental problems, and that the Mackenzie line will be needed to satiate society's growing energy appetite.
"We're going to need all the gas we can get," says Mr. Carmichael, who has spent years advocating for the project. "We see this as a first step toward economic self-sufficiency for our people and to bring us out from depending on the social welfare system."
"We have nothing else," he says.
'Not open for business'
Gary Vivian looks down at a series of aluminum cases the size of large suitcases and shakes his head. "This is about a $275,000 instrument that hasn't really done anything in two years," he says. "We were looking at buying another one two years ago. I'm glad we didn't."
Mr. Vivian is president of Aurora Geosciences, a firm that was once at the heart of the scramble for the NWT's mining resources, but which now finds itself desperate for work. Mr. Vivian, who first started working in Yellowknife in 1976, has lately contemplated moving his company out of town. Last year, Aurora's gross revenue fell 75 per cent.
"Everybody in the NWT wants to keep blaming it on the global recession, but we all know it's not the global recession," he says, pointing to the Yukon and Nunavut, which saw nearly six times more exploration spending last year than the NWT. The reason, he says, is that the NWT has thrown up so many obstacles to investment that people simply aren't interested any more.
"It's permitting, it's land claims, the fact that we're just not open for business," he says. Aurora has begun looking for work elsewhere, and now runs an office in Alaska. Other businesses are doing the same. Discovery Air Inc., the only public company headquartered in Yellowknife, has watched its stock fall to penny territory as it trimmed its helicopter fleet to 55 from 78, laid off staff, and started to drum up business in Ontario, where exploration has taken off, and Peru.
"We're not staying put waiting for the NWT economy to become more robust," says Chuck Parker, Discovery's executive vice-president of northern business services.
In Yellowknife, hope - and, among environmental groups, dread - prevails that the federal government will streamline the territory's thicket of regulations and woo business back.
Others are pinning their hopes on big federal expenditures: The territory is pressing Ottawa to invest in a Mackenzie Valley road; others think Canada could rekindle the northern economy by building a large hydro project, or an Arctic port that would drive mine development. Each carries an enormous price tag.
"So there are some huge 'asks' potentially on the table," says Premier Floyd Roland, who draws an analogy to federal outlays in the Hibernia offshore oil project and the Trans-Canada Highway. "It is the time in Canada's history now to make those similar types of investments in the North."
Take hydro, for example. One of the biggest costs of running the diamond mines is the diesel fuel they must import by ice road. If the mines were able to access cheaper electricity, the impact could be significant.
"There are lots of resources up there, but a lot of those are not currently on mine plans because of the operating costs. And that's mainly linked to energy cost," says Ricus Grimbeek, the former president of the Ekati diamond mine, now the global vice-president of health, safety, environment and community at BHP Billiton. "Once you've solved that, you've got diamond mines for the next 50 years, easily."
Absent a fix to power costs, those who worry about the territory's future say the social gains of the past few years - especially in income and education among first nations communities - could easily be squandered.
"The single-biggest indicator of whether or not a young person gets a job is whether or not his or her father has had a job. If your parents are in the situation where employment is just not possible, then you're in a generational issue after that, I believe," says Doug Matthews, a former high-level bureaucrat who now consults on energy issues for the territory.
"You can lose a generation very easily if you're not careful here."

A SHALE ALTERNATIVE
Decades have been spent chasing the dream of Arctic gas, complete with a Mackenzie Valley pipeline to carry the fuel to markets. But a much more accessible Northwest Territories petroleum prize could lie within striking distance of existing pipelines.
A new study has found that the territory could be home to substantial shale gas supplies on its southwestern border with British Columbia.
On the B.C. side, the Horn River gas play has already attracted huge exploration budgets and attention from companies like Exxon Mobil Corp., EnCana Corp. and Apache Corp.
But virtually no one has explored for Horn River gas in the NWT.
The first systematic study of the NWT's shale potential suggests that the territory could be home to a motherlode of shale natural gas, its author said last month when the report was released.
The NWT portion of the Horn River resource has "got to be in the same kind of ballpark" as the B.C. side, says Brad Hayes, president of Petrel Robertson Consulting, who was hired by the territory to conduct the study. "There's a substantial area there."
But this area is also home to the Deh Cho First Nations, a native group opposed to petroleum development.
Ottawa controls resource development in the territory. Before companies can access land, the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs must make a formal request for bids on exploration rights.
A bid hasn't been staged in 15 years, because the most promising area of shale gas in on land claimed by the Deh Cho.
The impasse has frustrated companies that are eager to extend their expertise into gas-rich land that remains largely untouched.
"There's all sorts of uncertainty there," says Rob Spitzer, Apache Corp.'s vice-president of exploration in Canada. "The regime is not in place."
Mr. Hayes sees developing the NWT shale resources as a good stepping stone for the territory.
"They've always had the big prize up at the far northern end of the pipe," he says, referring to the promise of offshore Arctic gas.
"But maybe [shale gas] gives them an opportunity to do it in stages and to only have to deal with, say, one first nation issue at a time, instead of trying to solve everything at once."

Full text:   Helena Guergis's strength helped her forge an unconventional path to success - one that has taken a severe turn for the worse
Helena Guergis's political career was supposed to take a much different path.
A beauty queen who became minister of state for the status of women, a local girl who ended up sitting right behind Stephen Harper in the House of Commons. Ms. Guergis was supposed to be on the way up, not on the way out - defrocked as cabinet minister, expelled from caucus, the subject of a police investigation and a probe by the ethics commissioner.
Back home, she still has her defenders.
"This is hot on everybody's mind right now, but it'll all pass," Carl Banting, 67, owner of Wolf's Den Sporting Supplies in Utopia, 80 kilometres north of Toronto, said of the storm that gathered around Ms. Guergis in recent months. He's a family friend.
"I've talked to a lot of people around here and they are true blue, and a couple of chicken-shit gaffes aren't going to change that."
We don't know exactly what those gaffes were. We don't know why Mr. Harper saw fit to so thoroughly ostracize her. We don't know what, if anything, his actions had to do with Ms. Guergis's husband, ex-MP Rahim Jaffer, who denies allegations that he told questionable business associates he could get access to government funds.
What we do know is that Helena Guergis is a woman who sees things her own way, who pursued unconventional paths to advance her career, and who confronted anyone who she felt had crossed her.
Mr. Banting attributes this strength to her upbringing in "a God-fearing family" descended from her great-grandfather, a Turkish-born Christian Assyrian who trained as a Presbyterian minister and landed in the Angus area in 1949.
Self-made and hard working, subsequent generations became well versed in the cut and thrust of politics at the local level.
"Nothing was handed to them," Mr. Banting said of the Guergis family (pronounced "Georges").
The Guergis clan became fixtures in business, land development and local politics. Ms. Guergis's grandfather, George, was reeve of surrounding Essa Township. Her uncle was a deputy reeve, two cousins are local mayors and her younger sister, her only sibling, is a township councillor.
To build her profile as a young woman, Ms. Guergis entered the Miss Huronia pageant three times, starting in 1990 - an odd choice for a future status of women minister at a time when feminists routinely decried pageants as sexist and degrading; odder still for the fact she pursued her sash-and-tiara dreams while working as a rape crisis volunteer and marching in Barrie's Take Back the Night rally, activities more typical of those opposed to pageants.
After she won the Miss Huronia title in 1992, Ms. Guergis, then 23, told a local newspaper that the pageant was no beauty contest; it was more like applying for a job and had little to do with looks.
"This was my third time [in the pageant]. The first year, I won the swimsuit competition and I wasn't even in the final eight contestants, so that should tell you something about the pageant," she reasoned.
After taking a real estate course and running a bed-and-bath business in a small Angus plaza her father partly owned, Ms. Guergis went to work as an assistant for Joe Tascona, the local Progressive Conservative MPP. That experience landed her a job for three years with Janet Ecker, a senior minister in the Mike Harris provincial government of the late 1990s.
"She was bright, she was talented and she was willing to work hard and learn," Ms. Ecker said.
Geoff Norquay, a former communications director for Mr. Harper, wrote speeches for Ms. Ecker and remembers meeting Ms. Guergis during that time. "She was responsible for financial institutions and she was bright, competent, capable and quiet," Mr. Norquay said.
Ms. Guergis served three terms on the Progressive Conservative provincial executive, and in 2003, was the Tory candidate in Toronto's Trinity-Spadina riding, which even the most optimistic Conservative recognized was unwinnable.
The next year, carrying the banner of the newly unified right under the Conservative party, she bumped off Liberal Paul Bonwick to take the federal seat in Simcoe-Grey by a slim 100 votes.
One of relatively few women in the federal Conservative caucus, Ms. Guergis stood out from the day she arrived in Ottawa. Despite her at-times girlish voice, she appeared determined not to be taken as a lightweight, and in Opposition, she delivered scathing attacks on the Liberals for supporting projects in China.
When the Tories won the election of 2006, she was appointed parliamentary secretary to the minister of international trade and was then promoted to secretary of state for foreign affairs and international trade and secretary of state for sport.
Although critics said she lacked the experience for these jobs, Mr. Harper nonetheless saw fit to promote Ms. Guergis to her cabinet post after the 2008 vote.
On the personal side, meanwhile, Ms. Guergis broke up with the fiancé who had been her campaign manager in 2004 and began a romance with Mr. Jaffer, who was first elected as a Reform MP at age 25. He proposed in 2007, and on Oct. 15 the following year, one day after Mr. Jaffer lost his seat to an NDP candidate, the couple scrapped initial wedding plans and eloped in Edmonton.
Lately, that low-budget wedding has been looking costlier by the day, at least to Ms. Guergis's political fortunes. And her own problems have exasperated her party colleagues both in Ottawa and in Simcoe-Grey. Conservative riding association officials say annoyed members were calling to demand a vote on Ms. Guergis's nomination even before she was expelled from caucus yesterday.
But Sandi Macdonald, a local councillor who owns a health goods store in Angus, said Ms. Guergis has been doing her job in Simcoe-Grey.
"I'm sorry, but she's delivered on her promises to us," said Ms. Macdonald, who has known Ms. Guergis from childhood and suggested her day-to-day accomplishments have been obscured by negative media portrayals.
"If people have seen the way Helena is with seniors, with women's issues and those less fortunate, they would see the real Helena," Ms. Macdonald said.
For now, it seems, no one is seeing the real Helena.
"She isn't here right now," her mother, Linda Guergis, said on the phone from Angus late this week. The strain of her family's ordeal was evident as her voice rose in a plaintive plea for privacy.
"She hasn't done anything wrong," Mrs. Guergis said. "You want to quote that? Go ahead. Goodbye."
*****
GUERGIS'S TROUBLE ON THE HOME FRONT
Helena Guergis's Rockcliffe Park home might not feel like a haven.
Liberal MP Marlene Jennings has asked the Ethics Commissioner to probe whether conflict of interest guidelines were followed and to ensure no favouritism took place in Ms. Guergis's purchase.
Property records say she bought the four bedroom, two bathroom home for $880,000 on Nov. 23, 2009. She agreed to pay the prime lending rate plus 2 per cent interest a year, calculated daily and payable monthly. Current mortgage regulations require home buyers to make at least a 5 per cent down payment. It's unclear whether Ms. Guergis put any money down. Staff

Full text:   Renovations at the venerable hotel reveal secret glances of bygone eras
Gil Blutrich is on a ladder inside the kitchen of the King Edward, flashlight in hand.
There's a crack in the ceiling that he wants to examine.
He opens it wider and sees not ducts and wiring but painted murals and chiselled wooden pillars. Then, a second ceiling, this one coffered as it was almost 100 years ago when first built for a hotel that in its day was the very definition of elegance.
"I can't believe it is here," he bellows down at hotel staff. "Someone get me a camera."
Ever since buying the King Edward Hotel last month for the recession price of $48-million, he has borne witness to these stunning archeological types of discovery.
His plan is to convert the Toronto landmark - built in 1903 and host to socialites, bootleggers, and Beatles - into a five-star hotel fitted with 140 luxury condos.
But every time he peels back the wallpaper, another stratum of history appears.
This morning, it's the murals. But on recent jaunts he's also discovered the Crystal Ballroom, built in 1923 but boarded up since 1978 when changes to Canada's fire codes proved too costly. Its fading white paint and bedraggled mouldings recall Miss Havisham wasting away inside a memory of long-lost glory. Then behind a utility closet an ornate ebony wood staircase, leading nowhere, stuck in historical limbo.
Mr. Blutrich says that if he hadn't stepped in to buy the hotel from cash-strapped Lehman Brothers, a victim of the recent financial crisis, rumour had it the hotel was to be converted into student housing, causing most of these historic details to be lost.
"Maybe it takes an outsider to appreciate what you really have here," says the 44-year old Israel native who ever since coming to Canada 12 years ago has amassed a portfolio of real estate in the hospitality sector, among them the Pantages and Cosmopolitan hotels in the downtown core.
He calls the King Eddie his crown jewel.
"I am looking deep into the hotel to see how we can turn it back into a vibrant business. But to go forward, I see I'll need to pay homage to the past."

Stellar, but is it special enough?

Author: John Bentley Mays

Abstract: An earlier proposal for the site, done for another developer by another architect, featured four levels of retail above ground (including a large cinema complex), as opposed to Mr. [David Pontarini]'s two (with no theatres). Four sounds right to me; two seems skimpy - though I suppose it could be argued that one- or two-storey shopping is what's ordinary along the nearby Bloor Street corridor. But the intersection of Bloor and Yonge is not ordinary.

Full text:   The Bloor and Yonge location demands a big architectural statement. One Bloor raises the bar, but the details have to be right
jmays@globeandmail.com
The art of skyscraper design came of age and matured in the first half of the 20th century, roughly the period between Louis Sullivan's Gilded Age masterpieces in Chicago, St. Louis and Buffalo, and the completion, in 1958, of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building in New York. Except on the computer screens and in the imaginations of some contemporary architectural dreamers, it has languished ever since.
The reasons for this fall-off in design creativity are not hard to figure out.
Tall buildings have become very expensive propositions. If investors are to receive substantial profit from a tower venture these days, every aspect of the building's realization, from engineering and construction to outfitting and marketing, must be streamlined and rationalized as much as possible. Mass-market popularity, not artistic ingenuity, therefore becomes the most urgent assignment of architects who work for mainline developers. These business folk reason that nobody will pay for top-flight design, so why bother? The results of this dismal realpolitik are familiar to all Torontonians: soulless condominium stacks heaped up on streets across the city in the last 20 years, so many mediocre boxes and cylinders devoid of flair or delight or thoughtful urbanism.
But a city gets the architecture it deserves. Gradually over the past few decades, though with gathering speed since around 2000, Toronto has acquired a sizable population of affluent homebuyers who know the difference between a well-designed tall building and a poor one, and who are prepared to put down money for the privilege of living in a tower with style, sophistication and excellent location. Some suppliers of Toronto housing have responded eagerly to this new, smart market - no surprise there - and a few local architectural offices have shown that they are up to the job of creating attractive dwellings for it.
Among these offices, Hariri Pontarini Architects is a relative newcomer to making tall buildings: The firm has been best known, until now, for its distinguished single-family luxury homes and handsomely crafted institutional projects. With the recent unveiling of its inventive tower scheme for the southeast corner of Bloor and Yonge streets, however, Hariri Pontarini has joined the select league of advanced Toronto designers who are now defining the city's 21st-century skyline.
Called One Bloor by its developer, Great Gulf Group of Companies, this building is slated to soar 65 storeys over the historic intersection in the heart of Toronto. Nearly 700 suites are for sale, ranging in area from 530 square feet to 1,727 square feet, and in price from $390,000 to $1.5-million and up. The interior appointments will be done by the Toronto-based office of Cecconi Simone, and landscaping will be in the hands of Janet Rosenberg + Associates. The designer of the tower is David Pontarini, founding partner and principal in Hariri Pontarini.
Mr. Pontarini's plan calls for a tall shaft rising from a six-storey podium containing two levels of retail outlets at the bottom. While Toronto has seen many tower-podium arrangements, we have never had a tall building with One Bloor's kind of strong architectural romanticism.
The basic form of the building is a steel-framed box - no fancy structural shimmies or wiggles here. The facades, however, sweep toward the sky in broad, flat curves sculpted from undulating balconies and expanses of sheer glass. If renderings are anything to go on, this treatment of One Bloor's tower surfaces should produce a moment of high and urbane visual drama in its otherwise dowdy neighbourhood and raise the artistic bar for the future high-rise development of mid-town.
That said, I do have one hesitation about the project. It's about what happens at the base.
An earlier proposal for the site, done for another developer by another architect, featured four levels of retail above ground (including a large cinema complex), as opposed to Mr. Pontarini's two (with no theatres). Four sounds right to me; two seems skimpy - though I suppose it could be argued that one- or two-storey shopping is what's ordinary along the nearby Bloor Street corridor. But the intersection of Bloor and Yonge is not ordinary. Whatever is built there should be extraordinary in every sense, at grade as well as in elevation - a magnet for tourists and citizens alike, an unusual place full of urban excitement. Mr. Pontarini's podium could be put anywhere in the downtown core. It's just not special enough.
But this flaw isn't large enough to detract from what's genuinely interesting and promising about David Pontarini's One Bloor: its recovery of architecture's admirable early 20th-century ambition to make skyscrapers, not only efficient, but beautiful and inspiring as well. That's good news for Toronto, as our architects and developers continue to reach for the sky.

Niagara-on-the-Lake is a world-class destination famous for its award-winning wineries and theatre productions during the Shaw Festival, as well as its reputation as one of the prettiest towns in Canada.
Adding to this list of accomplishments is a growing low-rise community, called the Village, which was named Project of the Year for 2009 by the Ontario Home Builders' Association (OHBA).
Situated 1 1/2 hours from Toronto - across from Jackson-Triggs Winery and Stratus Vineyards - the master planned development will consist of 400 traditional homes, including condominium suites, townhouses, semi-detached and detached houses and a retirement home.
Brookfield Homes, which is the project's principal builder, Traditional Neighborhood Developments and local builders have completed 77 homes on the 50-acre site, along with parkettes and a plaza that is home to a bank, Shoppers Drug Mart and Deluca's Wine Country Restaurant, which builds its menu around local wines and produce.
To reflect the charm and ambience of the historic town, which served as Upper Canada's first capital in the late 18th century, the entire development embraces New Urbanism design principles.
"There's a much larger focus on community rather than housing form, and way more focus on people rather than cars," says Brookfield president Sid Kerrigan. "We're trying to target buyers that want to live in a community where interacting with neighbours is a way of life."
One way of achieving this is to place homes closer to sidewalks and walkways to encourage communication between passersby and residents on their front porches.
Dead-end streets were avoided in favour of tree-lined streets that narrow slightly and gently wind throughout the site, not only to reduce traffic speed, but also to provide scenic vistas.,
"At the end of every street, there's something attractive to look at, whether it's a park feature, or an upgraded elevation on a house," adds Mr. Kerrigan.
As well, most attached and detached garages are situated off rear laneways and staggered between private courtyards and patios.
Beginning in 1996, Traditional Neighborhood Developments and local builders constructed 60 semi and detached homes, including some custom-built properties.
Since Brookfield came on board in 2007, the Markham, Ont.-based company completed three model homes and 14 townhouses, which are available for immediate occupancy.
"Brookfield has a dedicated strategy to releasing small phases that they can totally complete, including final curb, sidewalk, sodding and exterior paint," says Mr. Kerrigan. "When [a buyer's] road is finished, it's finished."
Otherwise, buyers can select from a large collection of Georgian-inspired plans - though some offer Victorian and Regency details - ranging from bungalow townhouses to two-storey houses on 31 and 60-foot lots.
"Our main product offering is 1,200 to 1,800 square feet with primarily main floor living," says Mr. Kerrigan. "We offer similar floor plans, but over a mix of singles, semis and towns so that each home looks a little bit different."
Standard features will include 10-foot ceilings on the main floor and nine-foot ceilings on the second, in addition to hardwood floors, granite kitchen counters and oak staircases.
The surrounding area is established, with schools, places of worship, waterfront parks and a downtown district packed with quaint cafes, restaurants and boutiques.
"Most housing sites are greenfields out there, but ... we're right in the middle of this historic town, surrounded by wineries," Mr. Kerrigan states. "To be in a new home site so close to so much culture and history is unique."
The QEW also puts Buffalo and Toronto within easy commuting distance. This is appealing to many buyers, half of whom originate in the Greater Toronto Area. "They're in a whole other community, and yet close enough that they don't feel like they've really left the city," says Mr. Kerrigan. "Niagara-on-the-Lake has so much to offer."

Full text:   The Good Woman, the Bad Boy and his Low-Rent Lovers: We care about Sandra Bullock because she's a proxy for our own broken romantic dreams
shampson@globeandmail.com
When Sandra Bullock stepped on stage to accept the Best Actress Oscar for her role in The Blind Side , she was her perfectly calibrated, accessible self: the Miss Congeniality of the Hollywood beauty pageant.
Her long, dark hair sleek as an otter, her lips brightly red, she exuded the simple prettiness that endears her to female fans.
Not quite a girl next door, Ms. Bullock is more Everywoman - someone who has had to work hard for everything she has. She took a hiatus from the film-making business when she was unhappy with a lack of challenge in the roles she was offered. . She finds celebrity "meaningless and empty."
"It holds nothing for me, although it will hold a great table in a restaurant when you're at your peak," she once said.
She had her nose fixed - and it's still not perky. She had a goofy-fringe and bad-highlights period of hair history.
Best of all, "if she puts on weight, forget it. Her prettiness goes," observes Cooper Lawrence, a syndicated radio host in the United States and author of The Cult of Celebrity : What Our Fascination With the Stars Reveals About Us .
Gotta love our BFF Sandy!
It's Sandra Bullock's position as the avatar of average femininity that fuels the continuing tabloid frenzy about her marital woes in the wake of revelations that her motorcycle-enthusiast husband, Jesse James, cheated on her with Michelle "Bombshell" McGee, a Nazi-loving tattooed creature with a name that helps catapult the whole affair into a soap opera of archetypes.
There's the Good Woman, her Bad-Boy Husband and his Low-Rent Lovers (four at latest count, and at least one with saggy stockings and a cheap-looking cone bra).
If there ever was a celebrity romance/breakup story that reveals the purpose of tabloid culture, this is it. (Though maybe it's not quite as enduring as the ongoing Jennifer Aniston-Brad Pitt-Angelina Jolie triangle.)
We're fascinated because they're proxies for our broken romantic dreams. We don't really care about them as individuals. And we wouldn't bother with them if their troubles were over business deals or bad real-estate transactions. We pay attention because they play out our worst nightmares.
The human heart is one complicated universal muscle, and with celebrities we can theorize endlessly.
We can ask each other over the virtual garden fence why the love didn't last, who was to blame, and whether the wronged woman will come out of seclusion soon to put a brave face on her devastating humiliation.
"I don't think there's a woman out there who hasn't had a romantic situation like Sandra Bullock has had," comments Ms. Lawrence. "She does everything right, but things don't work out for her."
Ms. Bullock remained single until 2005, just before she turned 41, when she wed Mr. James. There had been boyfriends in her past, and all of them presented romantic complications - Matthew McConaughey (the eternal bachelor) and Ryan Gosling (a little too young for her). There was even an engagement to Tate Donovan, a little-known actor with whom she'd starred in a forgettable romcom.
"I don't think it was that she was picky," Ms. Lawrence says. "The perception was that men wouldn't fall in love with her. She couldn't find the right guy."
Her marriage to Mr. James, five years her junior, cemented her image as America's Sweetheart. She would reform him. His exes included a porn star, Janine Lindemulder: Ms. Bullock was his salvation. She was playing out a cliché script that never loses its punch.
"She pushes me to be a better person," Mr. James told People magazine in 2006.
"No one knows what someone is like based on appearance," Ms. Bullock was quoted as saying about their unlikely pairing.
"She never had the typical romance," comments Bonnie Fuller, editor-in-chief of hollywoodlife.com. "It was as though she was seeing people for who they truly were. And with Jesse, people didn't like him. Her friends didn't like him. But they thought, 'If Sandra likes him, then he must be okay.' Everything about her was admirable. She was like the characters she played in films."
Ms. Bullock was the ideal stepmom to Mr. James's three children (never an easy task). She was actively involved in the custody battle for the youngest when Ms. Lindemulder was imprisoned for tax evasion. She even adopts handicapped canines from a local shelter.
She fawned over her monkey-suited bad boy at all the awards shows, gushing about her love for him, how hot he was, how much she wanted him, as the cameras panned to his mug, smiling in his goatee. We believed in their love.
So is it simply a schadenfreude thrill we get by witnessing her heartbreak, by refusing to let the story go ? Better her than us? A cautionary tale? Tsk, tsk, Sandy: Bad boys will always be bad?
Sure - at least partly. But as weeks go by, and the scandal remains on the covers of the tabloids, darker theories are emerging.
Ms. Bullock, who has a squeaky-clean, sex-tapeless Hollywood image, is reportedly reluctant to divorce Mr. James. Some have speculated that she is worried about his erratic behaviour. He has publicly (as well as through his attorney) pleaded for her forgiveness; she has remained silent.
"She doesn't want to send him over the edge," one anonymous "friend" was quoted as saying, shoring up the übermaternal rescuer-of-lost-souls image.
More troubling is the notion that perhaps Ms. Bullock is fearful that if she divorces him, he will sell stories that could ruin her image. Could it be that America's Sweetheart - an image she has certainly done her best to uphold - has some marital secrets that could make her Miss Nasty, not Miss Congeniality?
"Look, maybe you don't know that your hubby is having sex with some floozy when he goes to his office, but don't tell me you don't know that he has a Nazi room full of stuff," opines Ms. Lawrence, who worked in Hollywood as an assistant to celebrities before becoming an author.
"She must have known," she says of Mr. James's rumoured interest in neo-Nazism.
Stay tuned. We are all not what we seem.

Where next for the Ticats?

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/where-next-ticats/docview/382569438/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: In any case, the Ticats only use the stadium 11 times a year, including preseason games. Politically, by necessity, it's about more than football, and so barring something that might make the site impossible (sky-high remediation costs, for instance), the city intends to stick to its guns, and resist moving the project to a location that might be more to the Ticats' liking - presumably a visible and easily accessible spot outside of downtown next to one of the area's major highways.

Everyone who loves Canadian football has a soft spot for Ivor Wynne Stadium, even visiting teams made to feel extremely unwelcome there.
Tucked into a working-class east-end Hamilton neighbourhood like an old style English soccer ground, what was originally known as Civic Stadium was constructed for the British Empire Games of 1930. It is a grotty but remarkably intimate place to watch a sport played on a great big field, the concrete walls of the stands constructed nearly against the sidelines in a way that would never pass muster now. There's almost no separation between players and paying customers, to which several generations of hated Toronto Argonauts can attest.
Today, Ivor Wynne is on its last legs.
There's no appetite or funds for maintaining shrines in the CFL.
There are no Fenways or Wrigleys preserved as reminders of times past, and so the millions of dollars pumped into the stadium every year just to keep it standing are viewed as a case of good money thrown after bad.
Fortunately, with the stadium on the clock, deliverance is at hand in the form of the public money made available for the Pan American Games of 2015. The Golden Horseshoe is playing host, Hamilton has been promised the track and field facility, and from that foundation should emerge a new home for the Tiger-Cats.
There is an unprecedented building boom in the CFL right now - renovations and expansion in Montreal, a retrofit in Vancouver, a brand new stadium about to go up in Winnipeg and a dome in the works in Regina. That's extremely good news for the league, because the added revenues generated by new facilities will make it a whole lot easier for teams to turn a profit.
In Hamilton, where no owner of the Ticats has done that in decades, the construction of the Pan Am stadium means owner Bob Young might at least be able to exit the realm of pure philanthropy.
But - you guessed it - it's not quite so simple.
The 15,000-seat park being built with the $105-million or so allocated for the Pan Ams won't, in itself, be suitable for the CFL.
It will have to be expanded to a minimum capacity of 25,000, adapted for football, and provided with amenities such as press and private boxes. The money for that, which could be tens of millions of dollars more, will have to come from the private sector - and probably, in no small part, from Young and the Ticats.
In order to justify that investment, they'd need to be able to make a business case, including benefiting from things like naming rights and spinoff real estate development. Not so quietly, the Ticats have been making it clear they think that would be easier to accomplish in a location other than the one the city has chosen in the West Harbour neighbourhood.
From the city's point of view, this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to revive what is essentially a dead industrial area, and to help connect the very successful waterfront redevelopment with Hamilton's struggling downtown core. The Ticats might be part of the local history and fabric, but this isn't Saskatchewan - the franchise has nearly died of neglect several times in the past.
In any case, the Ticats only use the stadium 11 times a year, including preseason games. Politically, by necessity, it's about more than football, and so barring something that might make the site impossible (sky-high remediation costs, for instance), the city intends to stick to its guns, and resist moving the project to a location that might be more to the Ticats' liking - presumably a visible and easily accessible spot outside of downtown next to one of the area's major highways.
Right now, it's a bit of a standoff, and any threats from the football team have been purely of the implied variety, passing references to all that Young has done for the city (including renovating a downtown building and locating several of his businesses there), and to the money that he has lost since pulling the Ticats out of bankruptcy.
The team's got a point. The city's got a point.
This is going to get tense, it could get ugly, and in the end, that gift horse might well get looked in the mouth.

Real estate rise spurs Tricon IPO

Author: Ladurantaye, Steve; Erman, Boyd

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/real-estate-rise-spurs-tricon-ipo/docview/382561113/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "A number of companies that might have considered an IPO in the last two years were forced to defer those plans as a result of the credit crisis," Neil Manji, head of Canadian IPO services at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said yesterday as the accounting firm released the results of its first-quarter IPO survey.

Full text:   Money manager aims to raise $100-million
Tricon Capital Group Inc. expects a recovery in residential real estate, and is launching an IPO to raise the money it thinks builders will need to borrow to get their projects started.
The Toronto-based money manager creates funds to invest in real estate projects in Canada and the United States. The initial public offering will look to raise at least $100-million, said two people familiar with the deal, giving it enough of a float to appeal to small- and mid-capitalization investors.
The company is hoping to be a sort of "Onex of residential real estate," said a person familiar with its plans. Onex is known as a smart value investor that makes money both from well-timed investments and from fees charged to investors for running funds.
"With more than $1-billion of assets under management, we believe Tricon is one of the leading sources of capital to the North American residential real estate development industry," the company said in its prospectus, adding that it has invested in 137 deals for projects valued at about $8.5-billion.
While other sectors of the economy have shown encouraging signs, housing starts in both Canada and the United States have lagged the broader recovery.
The U.S. Federal Reserve's policy-making committee warned in its minutes from its mid-March meeting, released yesterday, that "housing starts had remained flat at a depressed level, investment in non-residential structures was still declining, and state and local government expenditures were being depressed by lower revenues."
The weakness has driven many of Tricon's U.S. competitors out of business, the company's prospectus said, and "most of these investors are unlikely to return to the market in the foreseeable future." Its key markets of Phoenix, Atlanta and California have been particularly hard hit.
In Canada, starts rose to 196,700 units in February, on a seasonally adjusted annual rate, from 185,400 in January, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said. The number had dropped to as low as 120,000 through the recession.
"Canada's performance in the last few months has been favourable after stumbling out of the gates as the recovery started," said Toronto-Dominion Bank economist Millan Mulraine.
"That appears to be firm for the next few months, and then we shall see. At the least, we can expect more consistent levels as compared to other years."
The IPO market is showing renewed vigour in Canada, a relief to entrepreneurs who have been trying to raise cash but have been hamstrung for much of the past two years by investors wary of new names. Five big TSX IPOs this year, the largest being Athabasca Oil Sands, have raised $1.8-billion, half as much as was raised in all of 2009.
That's likely to draw more companies such as Tricon into the market, analysts said.
"A number of companies that might have considered an IPO in the last two years were forced to defer those plans as a result of the credit crisis," Neil Manji, head of Canadian IPO services at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said yesterday as the accounting firm released the results of its first-quarter IPO survey.

BEING MY OWN BOSS / AND LOVING IT

Author: Belluz, Julia

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/being-my-own-boss-loving/docview/382561811/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: I like that I have the ability to implement my idea at whatever pace I chose. It's all about satisfying your customers' needs and it's very satisfying to have happy customers - in this case happy investors - and to find good ideas and implement them. The pitfalls are that you run the risk that your business doesn't succeed. But I would say that really isn't a pitfall. Ultimately, it's just an experience.

Full text: We've been flocking to the ranks of the self-employed, according to a new Statscan report last week. But is the grass really greener when you're no longer working for the Man? Julia Belluz checks in with three entrepreneurs who've gone solo in the past two years
Brenda Ee Kwun
35, Vancouver
Founder, Travellers Deck Ltd.
Field:
Marketing and publishing
How it started:
I had been working in real estate, selling Vancouver property in Asia. I finally left the industry in December, 2008, to start my own business. I just got tired. The market had collapsed. For me, it was a good time to take a break. While working in Asia, I travelled to more than 30 countries. Uncovering interesting, local places to eat became a hobby of mine, and this was one of the reasons I decided to start Travellers Deck [a "guidebook" in flash cards that showcase 100 of the best places to eat and shop in Vancouver].
How it's going:
We landed major accounts right from the start with Chapters, the Bay, MarketPlace IGA, and London Drugs. So far, we've sold about 5,000 decks, and our goal is to sell 300,000 by end of the year.
What really excites me is that I'm creating something for myself and setting an example for my daughter.
Perks and pitfalls:
It's great to be able to decide when I wake up in the morning. I can work from home, wear my PJs all day, and there's the beauty of seeing my daughter so much. But I thought I'd have weekends off. That hasn't been the case. Also, managing people can be a challenge.
What I've learned:
Even though I was successful in my previous career, being the owner of a business is more stressful because you are always thinking about whether you should spend money on things or not. I am very hands on, but I am learning how to delegate. Regular communication with my staff is very important and giving them responsibilities and letting them make mistakes allows them to grow and become more confident. It's a lot of hard work, but if you believe in yourself and you're willing to make sacrifices, there could be big payoffs.
When I hope to match my old salary:
Probably one year from now.
Stephen Johnston
45, Calgary
Founding partner, Agcapita Partners
Field:
Fund management
How it started:
I worked in London for 14 years, at Societé Generale, managing the private equity allocation of a $500-million fund. My view over time was that there are lots of small investment ideas but people don't typically raise money for smaller funds. So I moved back to Canada where the costs of starting a business are lower, and created this company for investment ideas that are much more concentrated and specialized.
How it's going:
During the financial crisis, none of our funds went down in value. We've grown to over $100-million in assets. There's a real need in the market for investors to get access to these kinds of alternative investment products.
Perks and pitfalls:
I like that I have the ability to implement my idea at whatever pace I chose. It's all about satisfying your customers' needs and it's very satisfying to have happy customers - in this case happy investors - and to find good ideas and implement them. The pitfalls are that you run the risk that your business doesn't succeed. But I would say that really isn't a pitfall. Ultimately, it's just an experience.
What I've learned:
There's no substitute for experience and the best way to become a successful business person is just to start your own business and learn all the lessons the hard way. The worst case is you're not successful but you learn a fantastic amount and go back to what you were doing before.
When I hope to match my old salary:
I matched it in two years.
Adrienne D'Amico
33, Vaughan, Ont.
Co-founder, We Bake in Heels
Field:
Custom cake design
How it started:
I had been working for other people for years and years. I ran an ad agency in Toronto and [my co-founder] Catherine D'Agostino worked as a graphic designer. She has always been an incredible baker and studied at Bonnie Gordon cake design school. We thought our talents would be put to better use if we were working for ourselves so we quit our jobs in 2009, and opened our business. We had a lot of great experience working for other people and we wanted to apply what we had learned to our own business. Plus, cake design has become really popular.
How it's going:
We've been very busy for weeks, booking up really quickly, and we've even had to hire people. What surprises me is the loyalty of the customers. People are so supportive of small businesses and keep telling others about us or coming back.
Perks and pitfalls:
I get to hang out with my best friend all day. We laugh and have a great time. We trust each other, and we set the environment we want. And we get to eat cake all day! But you're always worrying about whether the business will make it. I didn't think it would be this much work. The hours have been crazy [7 a.m. to 9 p.m.] and you have to make the hard decisions you're used to other people making.
What I've learned:
It's best to do something you enjoy and feel passionate about. Work hard, and you will get as much out of your business as you put in.
When I hope to match my old salary:
Within the year, though because we do have plans for expansion, we will be reinvesting back into the company first.

Abstract: "There is a train that goes through central Toronto, and it affects many areas, like Rosedale and Moore Park," the agent says. "This house would have been [sold for] more money had it not had the tracks [behind it], but a lot of people like trains and the sound of them - believe it or not."

Without hesitation, agent Elli Davis says the biggest asset of this traditional 2½-storey home was its location, even though trains pass behind the fully fenced lot.
"There is a train that goes through central Toronto, and it affects many areas, like Rosedale and Moore Park," the agent says. "This house would have been [sold for] more money had it not had the tracks [behind it], but a lot of people like trains and the sound of them - believe it or not."
Buyers also appreciated that two cars could be parked on a front pad if they wanted to reach local shops, schools and a park on foot or head to any of the three subway stations nearby. "It's very close to Avenue Road and transportation, and it's an easy walk to Yorkville," Ms. Davis adds.
Over the past decade, the over 50-year-old house was updated with new roofing, wiring and an air conditioning system. The main-floor living room features a wood-burning fireplace, while the dining room has double doors to a deck and north-facing backyard landscaped with a sandbox and artificial turf, "because it was hard to get sun out there," Ms. Davis says.
Rounding out the second floor are three bedrooms and a bathroom with a tub.
The third floor is occupied by a master suite with a partly enclosed bathroom, complete with a glass shower stall and skylight.
There is a separate entrance to the unfinished basement.

Julie Kinnear, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
The premium location and lot size of this three-storey Edwardian were key elements that sparked an intense bidding war between a dozen buyers, agent and local resident Julie Kinnear says.
"It was a very unusually large lot for the neighbourhood," says Ms. Kinnear, who considers the property seven or eight feet wider than the average in the west-end community.
"These kinds of places don't come up very often."
The previous owners resided in this nearly century-old residence for more than 40 years. It is set on a desirable street within steps of High Park, waterfront trails, Bloor Street West amenities and public transit.
The home is also a short walk to the "uber-cool" stretch of Roncesvalles Village, lined with shops, cafes and restaurants, the agent adds.
There is 2,487 square feet of living space, including five bedrooms, formal principal rooms and a heated, second-floor sunroom. In addition, there is a roughly 900-square-foot basement with a recreation room, bathroom and a separate side entrance.
On the main floor, there is a large foyer with entrances to a living room with a wood-burning fireplace and a dining room decorated with plate rails and beamed ceilings.
The eat-in kitchen in the back corner has an exit to a wide deck with seating and a view of the gated yard, and a garage at the end of a rare private driveway.
Three bedrooms and an enlarged six-piece bathroom fill out the second floor. The top level is occupied by two bedrooms with walk-in closets and access to a shared powder room.
Over the course of several years, the roof, hot water gas boiler, drains and water main have been replaced. However, the home's original characteristics were left intact, such as the wood work, hardwood floors and bay windows, including one in the skylit stairwell.
"It's an opportunity for someone to totally personalize it," Ms. Kinnear says.

Stupich fails to co-operatewith bingo probe Premier Mike Harcourt slammed former NDP MLA Dave Stupich this week for refusing to co-operate with forensic auditor Ron Parks's investigation into the Nanaimo Commonwealth Holding Society.
Mr. Parks, who was appointed by the government to conduct a forensic audit of the society's finances, said he has been forced to subpoena a series of missing documents from Mr. Stupich and two other society directors.
However, Mr. Stupich, the driving force behind the society, has launched a court challenge claiming Mr. Parks can't force him to produce the materials, which include personal banking records.
Mr. Parks said Mr. Stupich's daughter, Marjorie Boggis, and wife, Elizabeth Marlow, both former society directors, have filed similar petitions.
The Premier said Mr. Stupich has "a responsibility to New Democrats and an obligation to British Columbians to co-operate.''
Last year, the Nanaimo Commonwealth Holding Society and three related organizations were convicted of misusing charity funds raised in bingo games.
Mr. Parks was granted full powers to subpoena reluctant witnesses when he was appointed last fall.
Flash forward: In 1999, Mr. Stupich pleaded guilty to fraud and running an illegal lottery that diverted more than $1-million in bingo revenues from charities to NDP coffers.
March 28-April 3, 1985
Agent's murder shocks real estate community The brutal murder of 37-year-old realtor Beverly Seto this week sent shock waves through the local real estate community and prompted female agents to cancel open houses for fear that a sex killer is on the loose.
"They are really scared and I don't blame them," said Bob Johnston, Ms. Seto's former boss, of Wall and Redekop Realty in Abbotsford.
Ms. Seto's body was found Sunday evening in a home in a Matsqui subdivision where she had held an open house earlier in the day, less than two blocks from her home.
Police said the victim was sexually assaulted and stabbed as many as 20 times. The killing bore striking similarities to the death of 27-year-old Lavonne Williams, who was raped and murdered five months ago while house-sitting in Clearbrook.
Don Shannon, president of the Fraser Valley Real Estate Board, said agents are being urged to work in pairs when they host open houses, even though there's no indication they are being deliberately targeted.
Flash forward: In January, 1986, 21-year-old Wesley Gareth Evans, a mentally ill man who lived four blocks from the scene of Ms. Seto's murder, was convicted of killing both Ms. Seto and Ms. Williams. The conviction was overturned in 1991.

Pitching the NHL as must-see TV

Author: Shoalts, David

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/pitching-nhl-as-must-see-tv/docview/382562689/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Through it all, the sources said, the pitch from [Gary Bettman] was that all of the NHL's U.S. television contracts are up in June, 2011. The current deals with Versus and NBC bring in about $75-million (U.S.) per year, combined.

Full text: Commissioner Gary Bettman woos potential team owners by dangling lucrative future television deals, sources say
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman painted a picture of hundreds of millions of dollars in new U.S. television revenue and an expansion fee for a second team in Southern Ontario as part of his pitch to prospective team owners, including Jerry Reinsdorf, according to two sources.
In recent months, the commissioner has had a remarkable streak of success in finding new owners for ailing franchises, from Jeffrey Vinik (Tampa Bay Lightning) to Cliff Viner and Stu Siegel (Florida Panthers) to Reinsdorf, the Chicago White Sox owner who has been enticed to at least take a second look at buying the Phoenix Coyotes.
Bettman and deputy commissioner Bill Daly have also been talking to Canadian billionaire David Thomson about a backup plan to send the Coyotes back to Winnipeg if the sale to either Reinsdorf or the Ice Edge Holdings group of businessmen falls apart.
Through it all, the sources said, the pitch from Bettman was that all of the NHL's U.S. television contracts are up in June, 2011. The current deals with Versus and NBC bring in about $75-million (U.S.) per year, combined. But, the sources said, prospective owners have been told the new contracts, presumably cashing in on the NHL's exposure through the Olympics in part, could bring in more than double that, and when added with the money from the Canadian networks, there could be as much as $500-million for the league and its 30 teams to split up.
Farther down the road, the sources said, is the enticement of an expansion fee of as much as $400-million for a second team in Southern Ontario, probably in north Toronto, which is being dangled to show prospective owners an NHL team is a good investment. But, a third source said, Bettman will have to get the Toronto Maple Leafs' co-operation, which would make this a more long-term prospect.
Neither Bettman nor Daly could be reached for comment.
In the meantime, the waiting game continued on separate arena lease proposals from Reinsdorf and Ice Edge. The proposals were shown to Glendale City Council in an executive session on Tuesday, but Daryl Jones, the chief operating officer of Ice Edge, said he has not heard anything from the city. Jones declined to comment further.
Several sources, including one NHL governor, said Bettman is in a tight spot with the Coyotes. He promised the league's owners they will not have to cover the NHL's involvement with the Coyotes.
The league paid $140-million to buy the team in a U.S. bankruptcy court and had to cover $20-million in losses this season, plus legal costs.
However, neither Reinsdorf nor Ice Edge are interested in the league's asking price of $160-million. And the city is not in a position, financially or legally, to grant huge subsidies (which Reinsdorf demanded in his first attempt to buy the team) to either prospective owner.
If a sale cannot be completed by June 30, when the NHL can legally break the arena lease with Glendale, then the Coyotes can be sold to someone like Thomson and moved.
Reinsdorf was wooed again when Ice Edge ran into trouble securing financing for its purchase. He had an additional reason for taking an interest in the Coyotes - he has real-estate investments in Glendale.
A couple of sources said Ice Edge hoped to get the money to buy the Coyotes from a billion-dollar bond issue that was supposed to pay for a development called Main Street Glendale that is to be built around the spring-training facility the city built for the White Sox, Reinsdorf's baseball team, and the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The $1.2-billion bond offering, orchestrated by a company owned by two local businessmen, Bob Banovac and Danny Hendon, was to be done through the La Paz County Industrial Development Authority. Under Arizona law, small communities can act as conduits for issuing bonds for any development in the state in return for a fee. The idea is to raise private rather than public capital to spur development.
But due to the recession, no one could be found to buy the bonds and the La Paz deal has stalled. Another attempt to put a $900-million bond deal together through a small community called El Mirage, which was also said to include financing for the Coyotes, also fell through.
Further complicating matters is that HB Equities, the company owned by Banovac and Hendon, which is supposed to build the Main Street development, defaulted on a $100-million promissory note in January. Jones declined to comment about the bond issue but he insists financing is not a problem for Ice Edge. Pat Day, a Phoenix lawyer who handled the bond deal for La Paz, said financing for the Coyotes was never included in the preliminary applications, but they "were mentioned from time to time."

Yonge-Eglinton Square is one of the ugliest public spaces in the city. A desolate, windswept expanse of pavement on the northwest corner of that North Toronto intersection, it sucks the life out of what could be a dynamic urban crossroads. Why anyone would want to save it is a mystery.
Yet that is the sworn aim of the YES (for Yonge-Eglinton Square) Coalition, a group of neighbourhood activists and hanger-on politicians who want to block a plan to redevelop the space. At a demonstration on Monday, one advocate described the square as a "jewel" of the neighbourhood. Another, local Councillor Michael Walker, called it "a congregation, a centre of activity for the citizens of Toronto." The coalition even has a fancy website complete with YouTube video showing people coming and going on the square, played at hurried-up speed to make the underused space look like a busy gathering place. It is anything but. Apart from a few plastic chairs, it lacks even a place to sit.
The coalition is hoping to raise such a stink that city council will overrule the recommendation of the city's own planning staff and vote down the redevelopment plan. Let's hope wiser heads prevail.
The proposal by RioCan real estate would vastly improve the corner and add value to the neighbourhood. RioCan plans to spruce up the two dreary sixties-era office towers on the site and add 40,000 square feet more retail space by covering part of the square with a three-storey glass-enclosed mall.
Eager to get the neighbours onside, the company has made all kinds of concessions over the two years of consultations leading up to this week's council meeting. It will put a roof garden on top of the mall. It will spend a quarter of a million dollars on public art. It will build a wind-catching barrier to calm the gusts that whip around the office towers.
It has shrunk the footprint of the mall to allow more outdoor space. It will add a new entrance to the TTC's busy Eglinton station from the mall. With the roof garden figured in, the new space will have only 10 per cent less public area than the old one - and the new one will be much more inviting, this time with places to sit down and hang out.
As a report by city planners puts it, "the proposal provides an improved public realm including active building edges and pedestrian-supportive streetscape while continuing to mark the importance of the Yonge-Eglinton intersection with an improved landscaped open space at grade." In planner speak, that qualifies as a big cheer.
North Toronto Councillor Karen Stintz points out that the existing space was never intended to be a public square. It is an office plaza, owned by the developer and not the city. Contrary to what the square advocates say, there was never any deal between the original developer and city officials to build a square in return for removing a cross street on the site. Ms. Stintz says that RioCan deserves some credit for listening to urban planners and local residents, using their input to come up with what should be a pleasant urban space.
Credit? To a developer? The save-the-square folks are mighty mad at Ms. Stintz for that. They are drawing a parallel with the epic battle over the Minto towers, a condominium project that went up earlier this decade down the street from Yonge-Eglinton square. Local residents associations went on a NIMBY crusade, saying the twin Minto towers would ruin the area by overshadowing residential neighbourhoods and creating unbearable congestion.
They were spectacularly wrong. The towers proved to be a great success, drawing new residents and more street life to what has become a vibrant midtown hub. Life in the leafy single-family-home neighbourhoods goes on much as it did before.
Yonge and Eglinton has become a great part of town, thick with tall buildings and the buzz of urban life. Redeveloping the awful old square will make it even better. Council should vote an enthusiastic yes.

No truth to rumours of Phoenix decamping to Winnipeg

Author: Willis, Andrew

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/no-truth-rumours-phoenix-decamping-winnipeg/docview/382576981/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Lease negotiations with the city have been handled by the NHL in recent weeks and sources told the Glendale Star at this point it looks like [Jerry Reinsdorf] is the more likely candidate to reach a lease agreement. It is thought that Reinsdorf is asking for a special tax district to be created around Jobing.com Arena to raise revenue for the team and he may have demanded an escape clause to allow the team to be moved if revenue and ticket-sales targets are not met.

Full text: Winnipeg entrepreneur Mark Chipman is doing his best to bring NHL hockey back to Manitoba.
For all his hard work, the Manitoba executive may end up being nothing more than a pawn in the National Hockey League's attempt to keep the Phoenix Coyotes afloat in Arizona.
Chipman co-owns the 15,000 seat MTS Centre in Winnipeg with Toronto-based billionaire David Thomson, through a company called True North Sports & Entertainment Ltd. Chipman, whose family owns auto dealerships and co-owned a leasing business, recently sold for $130-million, has long sought to bring NHL hockey back to Winnipeg - the Jets departed for Arizona in 1996. The team now plays in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale, and is owned by the NHL after filing for bankruptcy last year.
There were media reports out of Arizona yesterday that Chipman was close to realizing this dream, with Thomson backstopping a deal to bring the Coyotes to Manitoba if an agreement to keep the team in Glendale fell apart. However, True North executives said the story was false. "There is no understanding between True North and the NHL with regard to the Phoenix Coyotes, or any other franchise," said Scott Brown, spokesman for True North, adding "it's no secret we have regular conversations with NHL officials, including Gary Bettman. And we have made no secret of our interest in a NHL franchise, should the right opportunity arise."
NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly also said the league has no agreement to move the Coyotes to Winnipeg "or to any other city for that matter." Daly also said there have been discussions with Chipman and Thomson about their interest in buying an NHL franchise for Winnipeg but nothing concrete has developed.
"Our focus continues to be on completing a transaction with local ownership that is committed to operating the team in Glendale," Daly said in a statement released last night.
"Based on the communications and information we are receiving on a regular basis, the stakeholders involved continue to express a high level of confidence that that can be successfully achieved. We will not focus on completing arrangements for one or more alternative option[s] until such time as it may become necessary.
"With respect to Winnipeg and Messrs. Chipman and Thomson, we have had ongoing discussions over time regarding their potential interest in owning an NHL franchise [as we have had with a number of other individuals and cities around North America] and potentially bringing an NHL franchise back to Winnipeg. It remains an intriguing possibility and one we would consider given appropriate circumstances, but there is nothing new to report on that front at this time."
Ownership of the Coyotes is still up for grabs, and it may be known by Thursday if Chicago-based real estate developer Jerry Reinsdorf is going to buy the team. That is the unofficial deadline set by Glendale city officials for a lease to be settled between either Reinsdorf, the owner of the Chicago White Sox who has real-estate interests in Glendale, or the Ice Edge Holdings group of Canadian and American businessmen. But the officials are willing to extend the deadline if negotiations are progressing.
Lease negotiations with the city have been handled by the NHL in recent weeks and sources told the Glendale Star at this point it looks like Reinsdorf is the more likely candidate to reach a lease agreement. It is thought that Reinsdorf is asking for a special tax district to be created around Jobing.com Arena to raise revenue for the team and he may have demanded an escape clause to allow the team to be moved if revenue and ticket-sales targets are not met. Speculation is also building that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has been talking to True North about moving the team to Winnipeg if the sale to either Reinsdorf or Ice Edge falls through. But several sources said while there has been communication between Bettman and Chipman and their associates, there is nothing that would suggest the possibility of moving the Coyotes back to their original NHL city is anything more than a way to put pressure on Glendale to agree to a new lease. If Chipman can't bring the Coyotes back to Winnipeg, he's expected to discreetly but insistently push for another team, sources say, despite the hostility that greeted Research In Motion co-CEO Jim Balisillie's attempts to move a franchise to Canada.
"Chipman is attempting to do everything Balsillie didn't do, by working with Bettman and the league. He's only talked to owners of troubled franchises with the Bettman's blessing," said one source in Winnipeg.
The campaign to bring a team to Winnipeg is led by Chipman, not Thomson, said True North's Brown. Chipman is the operating partner in True North, while Thomson is involved through Winnipeg real estate holdings at his private company, Osmington Inc. (The Thomson family holds a controlling interest in The Globe and Mail's parent company, CTVglobemedia.) Sources close to Thomson say while the executive is open to the idea of NHL ownership at True North, his backing is conditional on the terms of a purchase.
Chipman's quiet diplomacy has yet to sway the NHL commissioner. As one source close to the league said, "Bettman is far from convinced that moving teams to mid-market Canadian cities solves the league's economic woes."
Winnipeg's arena is one of the busiest facilities in Canada, playing home to the American Hockey League Manitoba Moose, along with concerts. However, it is smaller than most NHL facilities, which is seen as a potential problem in a league that relies on ticket sales for much of its revenues. One source in Winnipeg said Chipman's response to this concern is, "Would you rather play to a sold-out 15,000 seat venue, or a half full arena that seats 19,000?"
Winnipeg was home to hockey's Jets from 1972 to 1996, first in the now-defunct WHA, then in the NHL. After relocating to Arizona, the team lost an estimated $300-million before filing for bankruptcy last year.

North York residents dig in to save the ravines

Author: Freeze, Colin

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/north-york-residents-dig-save-ravines/docview/382578392/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "It's ravine degradation, that's what we're facing in this city," said George Carere, a North York resident. The retired college professor lives about a kilometre away from the Dawlish Avenue site, but he visited it yesterday and plans to tell officials it represents a chronic problem.

Full text: Real-estate deals cutting closer and closer into green spaces, locals say as they get ready for meeting with local councillor
Claiming that ravines are to North Toronto what canals are to Venice, a group of homeowners will try to hold city officials to account today over what they describe as a "rape of the ravine."
Aggrieved residents of Dawlish Avenue, a quiet street in upscale North York, say a new $4-million home under construction has encroached on a small wooded area they had all shared.
A meeting slated for this afternoon with Don Valley West Councillor Cliff Jenkins and other officials will be a last-ditch attempt to air years of simmering, and allegedly ignored, concerns. The meeting is to take place at the former North York City Hall building.
Homeowners in the neighbourhood complain the Toronto real-estate boom is tempting politicians and developers to bend the rules when new properties are added to established areas, greying green spaces and losing the essential character of cozy cul-de-sacs. They say officials in the amalgamated megacity blithely ignore or play down their concerns.
"It's ravine degradation, that's what we're facing in this city," said George Carere, a North York resident. The retired college professor lives about a kilometre away from the Dawlish Avenue site, but he visited it yesterday and plans to tell officials it represents a chronic problem.
"There's been a tsunami of deals like this ... we're trying to slow it down."
The specific problem? A few years ago, an old lot on the avenue was divided into two, and construction of a massive new home was started - complete with a six-metre concrete retaining wall to separate the property from the sloped wooded area. Trees were cut down and tonnes of earth were poured to shore up the driveway.
"I've seen it go from ravine to parking lot," says Mary Usher-Jones, a long-time Dawlish Avenue resident. She spoke yesterday from her kitchen, surveying the wooded area and the home now nearing completion.
The disputed common area is small, a few hundred square metres at most. City officials uphold that the wooded area is not even technically a ravine.
The owner of the controversial new home on Dawlish Avenue is a 33-year-old commercial real-estate agent.
Payam Khazanbaik, in a telephone conversation last night, said no one told him about today's meeting where officials are to discuss his home's construction.
"I'm still thinking of moving in myself, but the neighbours have made it so difficult I'm reconsidering," he said. He added that the work on the house would have been completed by last year but for all the complaints.
He still expects it will be completed this summer.
Mr. Khazanbaik, who points out he is paying $10,000 for an arborist to replant trees to improve his lot's appearance, added that the small wooded area beside his house is just that.
"I don't' want to say anything that makes them more angry ... [but] this is not a ravine," he said.
"To be honest, it used to be private property; it wasn't a ravine."

It's not a pub - it's a 'gastrotel'

Abstract: Then there's The York and Albany in Camden, which is part of Gordon Ramsay's growing empire and his only pub to take overnight guests. While its 10 rooms range in size from a tiny standard to a 550-square-foot suite that overlooks Regent's Park, each has the same luxurious amenities: 400-thread count Egyptian-cotton bed linens, an iPod docking station, DVD player and complimentary WiFi.

Full text: An absence of real estate around London has inventive hoteliers refurbishing forgotten rooms above bustling taverns
It was a typical Sunday afternoon in London. Inside The Orange Public House and Hotel near Sloane Square, the locals were engaging in a weekend ritual: Sunday roast. Heaping plates of sliced beef with braised cabbage and crispy potatoes were served up with Yorkshire pudding and gravy. Frothy pints of lager were delivered to wash it all down. And between taking orders and clearing tables, a cheery waitress swiftly tucked my suitcase out of the way and asked me to take a seat: "Your room will be ready soon," she said, "Would you like a drink while you wait?"
For a first-timer, checking in to a pub for the night is an unconventional experience. At The Orange - a trendy watering hole with four bedrooms on its upper floor - the features of a classic hotel are absent. There's no dedicated reception desk, no porter, and no concierge. Upon arrival, guests have to navigate their way through an often crowded ground-floor bar, up two narrow flights of stairs (bags in hand) to the second-floor dining room.
There, the check-in process takes place at the same counter where drinks are poured. This is, after all, a pub that happens to have some rooms for rent, not a hotel with a bar. On a busy Sunday it feels slightly awkward to stand there with luggage, in the middle of the rush-hour bustle.
And yet, there's no sense that you've intruded and no pressure to get out of the way. Like any good hotel, the welcome is warm and since there's no lobby, you're encouraged to treat the pub as your own living space.
The Orange is one of the latest in a spate of restored pubs in and around London that offer good food and drink for the local community, and chic accommodation for those who want to stay for more than a meal. "In recent years, the majority of 'restaurants with rooms' have tended to be in rural locations," says Matt Turner, editor of the hotel design magazine Sleeper . "But for hotel developers, the scarcity of available property in prime city-centre sites makes acquiring pubs for conversion to gastro-pubs with rooms - 'gastrotels' even - an appealing proposition."
Turner believes that authenticity and a sense of place are more likely found in an 18th-century inn than a fancy new-build hotel. Since many of the gastrotels started off as taverns offering accommodation, hoteliers have managed to spruce them up and convert them back to their original function. In guest rooms, flat-screen TVs and rain-forest showers are as de rigueur as claw-foot tubs and old wooden writing desks. At the same time, the charm of the original structure may restrict the level of luxury one can expect. Bedrooms tend to be on the small side. Heating and air-conditioning systems may seem antiquated. And noise levels may be high both from outside (most pubs are situated on main roads, so hearing traffic is inevitable) and in (depending on the level of soundproofing, you may be kept up by rowdy pubgoers).
The drawbacks, however, are minor compared to the overall experience. The recent transformation of Ye Olde English Inn has been led by a group of savvy designers and foodies who are as interested in trendy decor as they are in good food and home comforts. Don't expect the drab meals, dusty velvet booths and weathered dart boards of Coronation Street . The Orange, for instance, traded in its staid Victorian-era image for lime-washed Provençal-inspired interiors, exposed floorboards and soaring windows. Ilse Crawford, the founder of British Elle Decoration magazine and designer of Soho House New York, turned The Olde Bell Inn in Hurley and The Crown in Amersham, two timber-framed pubs in the countryside an hour outside London, into contemporary inns with cozy restaurants that serve traditional British fare made from locally sourced food. The guestrooms are simply adorned in natural tones with woven wool blankets, polished oak floors, farmhouse furniture and a stash of organic toiletries.
Then there's The York and Albany in Camden, which is part of Gordon Ramsay's growing empire and his only pub to take overnight guests. While its 10 rooms range in size from a tiny standard to a 550-square-foot suite that overlooks Regent's Park, each has the same luxurious amenities: 400-thread count Egyptian-cotton bed linens, an iPod docking station, DVD player and complimentary WiFi. At the bar, the drinks on tap range from ale and wine to fruity martinis and Veuve Clicquot. Some say the real draw, however, is in the kitchen. Executive chef Angela Hartnett, a Ramsay protegee, best-selling cookbook author and BBC TV personality, presides over the menu and offers up hands-on cooking classes on Saturdays.
But it's not all about the fluffy bathrobes, fancy drinks and celebrity chefs. "Many people are worried that the gastro pub will take over and that nowadays too many pubs are becoming like restaurants," says Fiona Stapley, editor of the Good Pub Guide 2010 , "We have a strict rule [at The Good Pub Guide]: If you're not made as welcome just popping in for a drink as you are coming in for a meal, then that pub is not for us."
There's no risk of being turned away at The Orange. On the Sunday night of my stay, the main-floor bar hummed with activity as friends gathered for chats and pints. The mood was friendly and informal. Upstairs, in the same dining room where I'd checked in earlier that day, I sat for dinner as a hotel guest but felt very much like a local, surrounded by an interesting mix of neighbourhood folk. The food was hearty and the prices, compared to the posh restaurants and hotels in the area, were quite reasonable.
This is the modern Britain public house, where gastro-labels and modern decor don't interfere with no-nonsense hospitality. Matt Turner agrees: "Pewter tankards seem to be the new martini glass."

Realtors argue system is already competitive

Author: Ladurantaye, Steve

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/realtors-argue-system-is-already-competitive/docview/382577738/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Yesterday, [CREA] said the entire case is now flawed because the organization's rules have been changed. "The application brought by the Commissioner against CREA is fundamentally misconceived," the organization said. "It is simply untrue that consumers only have one option if they want to sell their house using an MLS system operated by a local real estate board.

Full text: In filing, CREA says consumers have plenty of choice when it comes to buying and selling real estate
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
The Canadian Real Estate Association will argue that its members already offer Canadian consumers "a wide range of business models" when it appears in court to defend itself against charges of anti-competitive behaviour.
CREA yesterday filed its response to Competition Bureau allegations that the association makes it impossible for competitors to offer innovative services to consumers, such as flat-fee listings or individual services based on minimal levels of service.
The 98,000-member CREA argues in its filing that agents are already allowed to set their own commission rates, and that new rules approved by CREA last Monday will allow consumers to post their homes on its Multiple Listing Service, where the majority of the country's residential sales take place.
"The unfounded allegations in the [Competition Bureau's] application mischaracterize the very competitive environment in which CREA's 98,000 members compete vigorously every day to help Canadians buy and sell their homes," the CREA filing said.
The charges were filed in February by Competition Commissioner Melanie Aitken, a vocal critic of the industry's practices. CREA had until yesterday to file its defence, and on Thursday sent an angry letter to Ms. Aitken's office asking her to stop criticizing the organization publicly.
The letter also said all of her concerns had been addressed, because the recent rules changes allow consumers to take advantage of MLS and not pay a real estate agent a commission for services when a home is sold. Before the changes, consumers had to pay an agent for services they may not have wanted - such as conducting open houses and handling negotiations - to gain access to the MLS system.
While both sides have said they are open to negotiations, the Competition Bureau said it was unswayed by the arguments put forth in the letter and the case is likely to go to court in the fall. Ms. Aitken said earlier in the week that the changes were "a blank cheque" intended to protect a monopoly on real estate services, and didn't change her opinion that CREA wants to keep competitors out of the market by restricting the activities on the MLS.
"Our position remains that only a legally binding consent agreement will ensure a lasting permanent solution," Ms. Aitken said yesterday. "In the absence of that, we look forward to making our case at the Competition Tribunal on behalf of consumers and the many people in the real estate industry seeking to provide more pricing and service options."
Yesterday, CREA said the entire case is now flawed because the organization's rules have been changed. "The application brought by the Commissioner against CREA is fundamentally misconceived," the organization said. "It is simply untrue that consumers only have one option if they want to sell their house using an MLS system operated by a local real estate board. The allegation that consumers who want their property listed on a board's MLS must hire a broker who will force them to purchase a bundle of services they may not want is simply false."
The Competition Tribunal will hear the case if a deal is not reached. It has the power to force changes to CREA's rules, and could levy a fine as high as $10-million. The real estate group wants the case to be dismissed, and is also seeking to have its costs covered by the Competition Bureau if the charges fall through.
"There is simply no legal, economic or factual basis upon which to order the remedy sought by the commissioner," CREA's defence filing concluded.

Full text: REAL ESTATE REPORTER
The bitter feud between Canada's real estate agents and the competition watchdog over how people buy and sell their homes is now a bare-knuckle fight.
Largely on the defensive so far, the Canadian Real Estate Association is accusing Competition Commissioner Melanie Aitken of making "disingenuous" comments about an industry it says has been tarnished in the three-year fight.
In a letter to Ms. Aitken obtained by The Globe and Mail, CREA president Georges Pahud says the association is ready to defend itself in court to put an end to allegations of uncompetitive behaviour.
The letter comes as CREA puts the finishing touches on its legal response to the commissioner's allegations that the organization makes it impossible for competitors to offer innovative services to consumers, such as flat-fee listings or à la carte services based on minimal levels of service.
"The unfounded allegations made by you tarnish the reputation not only of CREA and its member boards, but of all members [who] compete vigorously every day to help Canadians buy and sell their homes," Mr. Pahud says in the letter to Ms. Aitken, who is taking the group before the Competition Tribunal on the allegations of uncompetitive behaviour.
Mr. Pahud says the association has always been willing to meet with the watchdog, and still is, but warns that CREA "is fully prepared to and would welcome the opportunity to deal with the case before the Competition Tribunal."
Due today, CREA's response to the Competition Bureau's accusations will highlight recent actions taken by the association to try to satisfy the commissioner. Until March 22, anyone who wanted to list their home on the Realtor.ca site - the public face of MLS, where about 90 per cent the country's homes are sold - had to use an agent through the entire process and pay a commission when the home sold.
The Multiple Listing Service system meant a consumer had to pay an agent for services they may not have wanted - such as conducting open houses and handling negotiations - in order to gain the valuable MLS listing.
Minutes after the changes were passed Monday, Ms. Aitken issued a press release that said they were a "step backwards" because local boards would be able to set their own rules or flat-out reject the changes, potentially causing even more restrictive rules to be passed in the future.
"What we're seeing is CREA preserving and protecting the ability to pass any anti-competitive rules - indeed potentially even more anti-competitive rules - that we're seeking to dismantle," she said the next day in Calgary.
Mr. Pahud's letter says the organization had "no intention" of passing any new rules that could be seen as anti-completive, adding that each of the country's 101 local real estate boards has been ordered to adopt the changes passed.
"CREA has made it very clear to its member boards that they are not only required to amend their rules as soon as practically possible to reflect the amendments, they also cannot have any rules or pass new rules that violate the principles in the amended interpretations," he said.
Mr. Pahud, who was voted president of the 98,000-member organization on Tuesday, said his priority is to deal with the charges and focus on rebuilding the industry's image.
Both sides agree they were close to a settlement earlier in the year, but talks suddenly fell apart when Ms. Aitken decided CREA was intent on giving itself an escape clause at the board level.
"In CREA's view, it is extraordinary that you would suggest the amendments that directly respond to the stated concerns of the Competition Bureau are a 'step in the wrong direction' and amount to giving CREA and its members an 'absolutely blank cheque opportunity to pass any rules that they wanted including highly anti-competitive rules," Mr. Pahud stated. "This statement is particularly disingenuous given that you and your officials had previously reacted favourably to the thrust of these amendments in our numerous meetings over the last several months."
While CREA's response is due today, it may take until the fall for a hearing before the Tribunal. Until then, real estate agents will be working under the new rules as soon as they are adopted at each local board.
"Perhaps in the past CREA hasn't handled this as well at the political level as it might have," said Phil Soper, president of Royal LePage. "I think that's changed recently."

Abstract: "We've been very inspired by Canada, me in particular," Mrs. [David Clarke] says. "I had never even had Canada on my radar before. It was never one of the places I had ever wanted to visit. But since we've been here, it's been one long journey and love affair. If it weren't for the grandchildren back home, we wouldn't leave."

Full text: A pair of transplanted Brits brighten up the industrial chic of their Toronto house with a collection of Canadian Native art
62 GLENRIDGE AVE.
WHAT:
A modern-style home next door to the York Mills Shopping Centre at York Mills Road and Bayview Avenue in north Toronto. The two-storey detached house offers four bedrooms and five bathrooms in 3,300 square feet of above-grade living space on a
50-by-130-foot lot.
ASKING PRICE:
$1.695-million
TAXES:
$13,910 (2010)
AGENT:
Bosley Real Estate (Jennifer Pierpoint)
Danielle and David Clarke are a pair of decidedly unstuffy Britons who have been in Canada for seven years.
In that time, they've created roots in a sense, having amassed an impressive collection of aboriginal art as well as a showpiece of a modernist home in which to display it.
The buying spree started shortly after they arrived in Toronto from their native London, thinking at first that they'd be in the boring old colonial outpost for only as long as Mr. Clarke's work contract held out.
Direct Energy, a British-owned company, had lured them over, appointing Mr. Clarke CFO of the energy supplier's North American operations.
Only recently married (and each for the second time, with children from previous marriages left behind in Britain), the middle-aged couple arrived with very few possessions - a dining room set and a framed portrait of the 18th-century Shakespearean actress known as Mrs. Siddons (heavily emoting), to be exact.
The idea was to rent for two years and then return to London, a plan Mrs. Clarke - who talks and looks a lot like the British Actress Julie Christie - didn't originally resist after sampling the local beer: "It's terrible," she says, English tongue firmly in cheek.
But after visiting first nations reserves in Ontario and British Columbia, as well as Inuit communities in the Canadian North, they decided to extend their time in Canada, having discovered it to be more intriguing than either had initially imagined.
"We've been very inspired by Canada, me in particular," Mrs. Clarke says. "I had never even had Canada on my radar before. It was never one of the places I had ever wanted to visit. But since we've been here, it's been one long journey and love affair. If it weren't for the grandchildren back home, we wouldn't leave."
But now they are selling the home they purchased two years ago so that they can get back in the bosom of their family in England.
Situated next door to the York Mills Shopping Centre on a residential street, the house is close to where the couple had previously rented. Mrs. Clarke first discovered it while walking the dog.
Less than a decade old, it had never been on the market before, belonging at the time to a young couple related to the architect who had built it as part of his university thesis project.
But Mrs. Clarke had often paused out front, believing that one day she could buy it. She was drawn to its clean architectural lines and the number of windows delineating the exterior. "I always thought that it was my house," she says. "I loved it, even though I had never seen inside."
It was sheer luck that it did eventually come to market, and while the asking price was 50 per cent more than the $1-million budget that Mr. Clarke had set for them, he knew he was going to buy it as soon as he walked in the door.
"It was probably the look on my face," his wife says.
"Well it was that," he confirms, pouring them both a glass of Made in Canada wine.
"But it was more that there was all this space. We'd already started collecting the art and we needed somewhere to display it. It was so big that I knew we needed to buy even more art to fill it. Cheers."
Big? The house is huge - with 3,300 square feet on the main and second floors, and 1,625 square feet in the finished basement where Mrs. Clarke, something of an artist herself, has created a studio.
The feeling of spaciousness is augmented on the main level by a 17 1/2-foot high ceiling and a relative absence of walls. The house feels roomy and light as a result of an abundance of windows and skylights that flood the interior with natural light. The open staircase linking the main floor to the second floor, where there are four bedrooms, two with en-suite bathrooms, has a back wall of glass brick that makes it look lit from both above and behind.
The kitchen is a focal point, fitted with custom maple cabinetry cut so stringently it looks sculpted.
But it is the art, hung on walls and perched on tables, that really brings the inside to life.
The colours are rich and vivid, lots of reds, blues, greens and yellows that fill the retina with bursts of visual energy.
As such, they stand in sharp contrast to the interior's overall surface purity - white walls and neutral-tone, geometrically designed tile work covering most of the floors - that lend the interior an industrial feel.
In Mr. Clarke's opinion, they are what makes their house a home. "It was made to fill with art and we have some beautiful art, which is what makes it so lovely to live in," he says.
It will be up to the next purchaser to follow suit, as the art is travelling to England as soon as the sale goes through.
Which poses a bit of problem for the Clarkes: There's so much of it now, that they aren't sure they'll be able to find a house in Britain big enough to accommodate it.
"I'm thinking something Georgian with high ceilings," Mrs. Clarke says. "Let's hope it will all fit."

Abstract: This industrial concrete structure also suggested that whatever was built underneath it should be "about the everyday," Mr. Smallenberg said. "The park is not trying to be something overly special ... We also recognized that there is strong community interest in having flexible space that unrolls serendipitously.

Full text: Architect Greg Smallenberg has come up with a thoughtful scheme to bring new life to the wasteland under an elevated highway
jmays@globeandmail.com
You may remember a column I wrote a few weeks back about River City. This condominium project by the Montreal office of Saucier + Perrotte is the first development in Waterfront Toronto's West Don Lands to be launched into the local housing market. In that column, I remarked on River City's architectural virtues (which are numerous) and also on the oddest thing about it: the fact that the site is chopped into two parcels by the elevated traffic decks of the Eastern Avenue flyover across the Don River. We were left wondering exactly how Waterfront Toronto, the Crown corporation charged with revitalizing the city's old port industrial properties, planned to bridge this yawning gap between the two parts.
We need wonder no longer. The managers of the West Don Lands have unveiled a strikingly thoughtful and ambitious $5.3-million scheme for turning the wasteland under Eastern Avenue into a playground and passageway for people of all ages.
Designed by architect Greg Smallenberg, partner in the Vancouver firm of Phillips Farevaag Smallenberg, in association with the Toronto-based Planning Partnership, the 2.5-acre Underpass Park will feature recreational spaces and play areas, community gardens and a public art project by Toronto artist and architect Paul Raff. And, if the plan lives up to its promise, it will create a remarkably pleasant link between River City and the new 17-acre Don River Park.
Last week, I caught up (by telephone) with Mr. Smallenberg in Oaxaca, Mexico, where the architect was leading a student workshop.
Building a park under the flyover, he told me, was a distinct challenge from the outset. Successfully solving the problem "was not a certainty right away. There was not an aha moment to say we can do something here. But we knew we had to provide a connection between the north and south portions of the West Don Lands, otherwise it was going to be a really compromised community. How do you make this connection through this crazy mix of highways and stuff?"
Answers to the question began to emerge when Mr. Smallenberg decided to "take advantage of what other people might see as a constraint, primarily the weather protection this place was offering. In so many park developments, among the first things that go are the fantastic built-form ideas that cost too much money. But in this case, the built form was there."
This industrial concrete structure also suggested that whatever was built underneath it should be "about the everyday," Mr. Smallenberg said. "The park is not trying to be something overly special ... We also recognized that there is strong community interest in having flexible space that unrolls serendipitously. In the design, there is quite a bit of flex space that anticipates a future that could include a flea market, a farmers' market, an impromptu, edgy street performance. This is not cathedral-like space. It's not going to attract a large civic event. But I do think it will be very appropriate for a community-level event."
One community asset that especially excites the architect is the allotment garden he has built into the scheme. Detailed shadow studies done by his office have shown that, despite the traffic ramps and such, gardening can be done. "There are areas where people can get dirt under their fingernails, growing some stuff," he said. "It's a pretty wonderful component. In the cases I've seen in Boston and Portland and back in my home town of Vancouver, these become very active places from spring to fall, from morning to late afternoon. ... So this idea gained traction, because it was one way to keep the park activated by people who live around the park and provide interest and beauty for other people who might be living there."
Of the things that people like to do in parks, eating is one that exercises the imagination of landscape architects. Mr. Smallenberg envisions a place set aside for what he calls "very upscale hot dog stands." One example is a self-contained concession that "you drop onto the site, much like you would do with a container. Then the button is pressed, the walls come down, the ceiling goes up, the stools pop out, and the sandwich-maker is standing inside. At the end of the day, they press the button and it rolls up."
Such mindful attention to human needs, extended to the whole project, could result in a successful urban park, and one that sets a precedent. There is nothing quite like Underpass Park in the world this side of Japan and China, Mr. Smallenberg said. It won't be long before Toronto begins to see the outcome: Construction begins in May.

Full text: A down-and-out Washington neighbourhood is in the midst of a revival, with vintage fashion, inventive menus, a stylish speakeasy and a Jamaican dancehall
It was once known as "the Black Broadway." Washington's U Street is a nexus of African-American history and culture. In the early years of the century there was no more glamorous place for nightlife, as its clubs and theatres hosted the likes of Pearl Bailey, Billie Holiday, and native son Duke Ellington.
The neighbourhood has survived riots and economic hard times over the past few decades, but today the lustre is back. Dozens of chic boutiques, eateries and clubs are popping up. "We're not like L.A. [or] Miami. ... U Street is like Williamsburg, Brooklyn," says Ian Hilton, co-owner of Marvin, a local bistro. "Everything here is real and raw and independent." D.C.'s style setters seem to agree. On U, the joints are jumpin' again, and everyone from kids to the old guard seems excited.
WELCOME TO U ALL
Kick off your visit with a stop at the Greater U Street Neighborhood Visitor Center (1211 U Street NW). Browse the historic panels with images, tales and a timeline of the old neighbourhood. If you haven't downloaded the U Street audio tour (at www.CulturalTourismDC.org), a heritage trail brochure is available. There are a dozen historical spots to see, but three not-to-be-missed landmarks are the African-American Civil War Museum (1200 U St. NW; 202-667-2667; www.afroamcivilwar.org); the gloriously restored 1920s Lincoln Theatre (1215 U St. NW; 202-328-6000; www.thelincolntheatre.org); and the vibrant family-owned Ben's Chili Bowl (1213 U St. NW; 202-667-0909; www.benschilibowl.com) just below the Visitor Center, where for a half century the famous and everyone else have been dropping by for Washington's signature snack, the chili half-smoke (sausage and chili on a bun).
ARTS AND MINDS
Transformer, a vest-pocket-sized but influential artists' space, is helping transform an area whose main claim to art used to be graffiti murals on abandoned buildings. Lately it has been filled with the work of Winnipeg wunderkind Mia Feuer. Her colourful, floor-to-ceiling installation evoking an industrial landscape will be at the gallery until April 17. With about a half dozen shows a year, Transformer's storefront art projects are always pushing the envelope. 1404 P Street NW; 202-483-1102; www.transformergallery.org.
SMALL PLATES AND TEQUILA
The hip transitional neighbourhood boasts its first really stylish chef-owned eaterie, Masa 14. Folks aren't exactly flocking in from the suburbs to this area yet, but the new Latin-Asian small plates has a rep for luring in the city's best-looking boys and girls on date night. With simple exposed brick walls and a concrete floor, it has a warehouse feel but still manages to be cozy. Menu highlights include the wok-fried okra with chipotle aioli and Wagyu brisket in a peppery achiote citrus sauce. And do make time for Masa's 20-metre-long bar (reputedly the longest in Washington) where tequila lovers applaud the 150 brands of Mexican spirits on tap. 1825 14th Street NW; 202-328-1414; www.masa14.com
HIDDEN TREASURY
Forget Tim Geithner. Treasury is a vintage store and events venue where the boys and girls (and the boys who want to be girls) play dress-up. From lingerie and lipsticks for the ladies of Mad Men to skinny ties and twenties tuxes for the gents, Treasury is a veritable treasure hunt. Visitors connected to the embassy party crowd will love the lacy black fifties bombshell sheath and the coral silk chiffon pouffy gown. Owner Katerina Herodotou has raided estate sales of diplomats' homes for clothes and baubles from the last century's great (and not so great) fashion moments. But that's not all. A follower of what she calls "social retail," the fashion-backward Herodotou throws DJ-hosted weekly parties. 1843 14th Street NW; 202-506-6908; www.shoptreasury.com
CHEEKY AND CHIC-Y Step into the tiny boutique Lettie Gooch and step out in funky and affordable urban street and club wear guaranteed to turn heads. All the clothes are from independent designers, including Orion London's nouveau peasant frocks in paisley, and Montrealer Christopher Kon's slouchy distressed leather handbags. D.C. menswear designer Andrew Nowell sums up the Lettie Gooch collection this way: "Seventies soul marries sixties hippie." Must-haves include the silk-lined Beth Bowley ruffle trench and the plum crocheted jumpsuit from Atlanta's Mocha Butterfly. While Washington is still a prim kind of town full of paper pushers, Lettie Gooch promises to cater to the ladies ready to take a leap. 1517 U NW; 202-332-4242; www.lettiegooch.com
THE SOUL OF THE 'HOOD
Marvin, a rooftop soul lounge and French-style bistro inspired by the life and career of D.C. native Marvin Gaye, is a Motown music lesson and neighbourhood nightspot in one. A huge mural of Gaye and period photos line the walls. DJ's spin funk, soul, R & B and Afrobeat while neighbourhood regulars and the hipper D.C. politicos (such as White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and cabinet member Ray LaHood) dance and dine on Belgian/Soul fusion eats. (Why Belgian, you ask? Gaye spent about two years in Ostend, Belgium). Don't miss the fried chicken on Belgian waffles, or the big party April 2, celebrating the silky soul singer's birthday. 2007 14 Street NW; 202-797-7171; www.marvindc.com
THINGS THAT GO BOOM
Patty Boom Boom, a nightspot modelled on Jamaican dancehalls, just moved onto the U Street scene and already has a long lineup at its unmarked door.

Abstract: By November, 2009, Mr. [Davide Amato] said he was becoming concerned. He'd raised more than $18-million for E.M.B. and several client loans were coming due. Mr. Amato alleged that when he started asking for payments, Mr. [Robert Mander] stalled. First he pleaded illness, then he claimed Mr. Amato had cut off their relationship and finally he tried to assuage Mr. Amato. "It will all get worked out," he told Mr. Amato in an e-mail filed in court. "You need to be calm."

Full text: Rumours of suicide swirl after body removed from home of Robert Mander, who creditors allege owes them $40-million
By all accounts, Robert Mander looked like a successful businessman.
He owned a portfolio of real estate properties, ran an investment firm and managed an art gallery in Oakville, Ont., that boasted an exclusive collection of "paintings, sculpture and glass in a range of styles by Canadian and International, emerging and recognized artists."
Mr. Mander also lived well. He enjoyed luxury cars, claimed to have a $35-million place in New York and recently built a $100,000 playhouse for his son that included a pirate ship and a castle.
But now he is at the centre of a growing mystery and dozens of creditors have gone to court alleging he owes them at least $40-million. Complaints have also been filed with the Ontario Securities Commission and the RCMP.
For now, no one is sure of Mr. Mander's whereabouts.
Police found a dead man at Mr. Mander's home in Flamborough, Ont., a week ago, but won't confirm the identity. Sergeant Terri-Lynn Collings of Hamilton police would only say that the death was "not suspicious" and officers had ruled out homicide. One investor has claimed Mr. Mander committed suicide and a neighbour is convinced the body taken out of the house was Mr. Mander. Meanwhile, a funeral for him is scheduled tonight at a Buddhist temple in Caledon, Ont.
"He is a mystery guy. He has been a mystery to me since he came here," said Michael Brazeau, who lives on the same cul-de-sac as Mr. Mander. Mr. Brazeau described Mr. Mander as a nice, quiet guy who lived by himself, had a elementary-school-aged son and drove a Range Rover SUV. In the past two years, Mr. Brazeau recalled maybe a dozen conversations about various matters.
The playhouse, he added, "looks like something right out of a theme park. Took three months to build."
Overall, he said Mr. Mander kept to himself. "If the local newspaper was thrown on his driveway, he was the type of guy who would drive over it for a week."
Rumours are flying. According to court filings, Mr. Mander told one investor he'd been disabled by a heart attack last November. Then he changed the timing of the attack to Dec. 11, 2009, the day he was supposed to pay another investor $455,000. Other investors said in court filings that he applied for a passport last month and quietly put several properties up for sale.
"I don't believe [Mr. Mander] currently engages, or ever did engage, in the business of investing," Davide Amato, an investor and former dentist, said in an affidavit filed in court. "I have seen no evidence of the investments that were purchased with the funds provided by [Mr. Amato and others]".
Mr. Amato was unavailable for comment. But he is leading the charge against Mr. Mander in court.
Last week he won a court order putting Mr. Mander's company, E.M.B. Asset Group Inc., into receivership. In court filings, Mr. Amato alleged he feared Mr. Mander was about to liquidate his assets and flee.
In an affidavit, Mr. Amato said he met Mr. Mander in April, 2007, through a friend, Peter Sbaraglia. The two had started an investment company called CO Capital Growth that guaranteed returns of 25 per cent annually, the filing alleged. Mr. Amato was sold - and put $4-million into CO Capital, using a line of credit secured by his home. He also encouraged some friends and family to sink in $1-million.
A few months later, Mr. Amato alleged, the two persuaded him to set up a company to attract other investors. The idea was simple. Investors would lend money to Mr. Amato's company, which he would then lend to CO Capital. Mr. Amato would make money on the difference between the higher interest he received from CO Capital and the lower interest he paid his clients.
Mr. Amato agreed. He sold his dental practice and created SA Capital with help from Mr. Mander, who became a co-owner. He soon attracted roughly 40 investors.
Mr. Amato eventually fell out with Mr. Sbaraglia and moved SA's money out of CO Capital and into Mr. Mander's E.M.B. Mr. Sbaraglia declined comment yesterday and he is not part of the receivership order.
All the loans carried specific terms, but Mr. Amato alleged Mr. Mander encouraged him to keep rolling them over and to draft the loan agreements in a way that made it hard for SA investors to seek redemptions. He also alleged Mr. Mander told him E.M.B. invested its money in publicly traded equities although Mr. Amato said he never saw any paperwork to back that up.
By November, 2009, Mr. Amato said he was becoming concerned. He'd raised more than $18-million for E.M.B. and several client loans were coming due. Mr. Amato alleged that when he started asking for payments, Mr. Mander stalled. First he pleaded illness, then he claimed Mr. Amato had cut off their relationship and finally he tried to assuage Mr. Amato. "It will all get worked out," he told Mr. Amato in an e-mail filed in court. "You need to be calm."
Mr. Amato alleged Mr. Mander had bought up several properties, sometimes paying in cash. They included his $900,000 house in Flamborough, a $2-million property in Caledon, a $1.2-million building in Oakville that housed the art gallery and an adjacent building worth $1.5-million.

Full text:   Competition Commissioner says a vote by real estate agents to ease restrictions on access to the proprietary listing service is a 'step in the wrong direction'
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
The Competition Bureau slammed efforts by Canada's real estate agents to open up their listings service to the public, calling the changes a "step in the wrong direction" that fail to ease the association's grip on the industry.
In a last-ditch effort to avoid a legal showdown with the Competition Tribunal, the Canadian Real Estate Association approved changes at its annual general meeting yesterday that will allow agents to post a house-sale listing on its proprietary and popular Multiple Listing Service for a flat fee charged to sellers. Before the change, sellers using the system had to employ an agent through the entire sale, and then pay a percentage of the final price as a commission.
Competition Commissioner Melanie Aitken immediately dismissed the real estate association's moves, saying she repeatedly warned the trade association that they didn't go far enough to allow new entrants to compete for listings.
"There is nothing in these proposals that we haven't seen before and they do not solve the problem. They are a step in the wrong direction. These amendments amount to a blank cheque allowing CREA and its members to create rules that could have even greater anti-competitive consequences."
Before the changes approved yesterday, someone who wanted a listing on the MLS was required to employ an agent from listing to final sale. Now, a consumer will be able to pay a flat fee to list on the MLS.
The MLS is where about 90 per cent of all home sales are done. Though costs haven't been determined, a flat-fee service might cost a few hundred dollars, compared with commissions that typically amount to thousands of dollars.
Agents must also pass along a home phone number, if the seller chooses, directly to an interested buyer if asked so that the buyer and seller can negotiate directly.
The changes will be made "as soon as possible" at each of the country's 101 real estate boards, which must individually approve the new rules. The fact that the enforcement of the changes remains in the hands of local boards has been a sticking point for the bureau.
After saying the vote was intended to satisfy the bureau and demonstrate how open the system is to both consumers and agents, outgoing CREA president Dale Ripplinger refused to answer questions about how the changes would affect his 100,000 members or the hundreds of thousands of Canadians who buy and sell houses each year.
He said the rules were largely procedural and "too complicated for anyone but a real estate agent to understand" as he walked out on a press conference after the first question was asked.
The association's lawyer said any further comment would have to wait until after tribunal proceedings end.
"There's no point in me trying to explain, when in actual fact they make no difference in the way realtors operate their business and no difference to consumers," Mr. Ripplinger said.
It's not what Ms. Aitken wanted to hear. She said the changes "do not remove the existing roadblocks to real estate agents who list properties on the MLS from offering innovative services and pricing options to consumers."
She believes the current system keeps prices artificially high and makes it difficult for agents to offer new services. She escalated the case to the Competition Tribunal in February, a legal entity that can force changes on the association and levy fines of up to $10-million if it agrees the trade association operates anti-competitively.
Lawrence Dale, a Toronto lawyer who has been fighting the real-estate establishment for years on this issue, said a ruling from the Competition Tribunal is essential, because large innovative operators won't open until they know CREA can't change the rules by a simple members' vote in the future to put them out of business.
"Until the industry is prevented from implementing any new rules that affect what an agent has to do, the cloud remains," he said.
CREA must file its official response to the Competition Tribunal by March 25. No trial date is set.
******

Full text:   Proposed changes an attempt to satisfy concerns raised by Competition Bureau
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Real estate agents are making a last-ditch effort to stave off pressure from the Competition Bureau by voting today on an overhaul of the way Canadians buy and sell homes.
Agents could find their job descriptions dramatically rewritten as the Canadian Real Estate Association votes on changes that would allow individuals to handle a greater portion of home sales on their own, while still taking advantage of the organization's powerful listings database.
More than 300 representatives from the country's real estate boards will gather in Ottawa to determine whether individual sellers should be able to pay a flat fee to an agent to post a listing on the organization's proprietary Multiple Listings Service. Sellers could then negotiate the sale without the help of an agent. The proposed change would differ from the traditional method where agents handle the listing and sale process and take a percentage of the transaction as a commission.
The vote is a way for Canada's real estate sales industry to satisfy concerns raised by the Competition Bureau, which has filed charges with the Competition Tribunal alleging the real estate association makes it impossible for any of its members to offer consumers fee-based services for particular portions of a transaction, such as listing on the MLS or negotiating a sale price.
This leads to higher prices for consumers, the Bureau alleges.
The proposed changes are a key pillar in the real estate organization's defence before the Tribunal. The association must submit its response to the charges by March 25 and the organization hopes a strong vote from its members on the key issues troubling the Competition Bureau would be enough to have the charges set aside.
"CREA has been clear with the Competition Bureau that it was prepared to be pro-active and recommend rule changes that we believe address the board's concerns even in the absence of a settlement," the organization stated an internal memo to its members last month.
The MLS has operated for more than 50 years and only registered agents are allowed to list homes on the service. The MLS trademark is owned by CREA, and each real estate board operates the service in their region.
The main change being proposed by CREA would allow an agent to list a property on the MLS, leave the consumer to fend for herself throughout the rest of the process. Currently, if the MLS is used then the agent must be employed throughout the process.
Another change would allow a seller's name and phone number to be contained in the system so buyers can contact them, though they would still need to ask an agent to pass that information along.
While the changes would address many of the Competition Bureau's concerns, the agency may prefer to press ahead with its case because the language of CREA's proposal contains wiggle room, lawyers say, that would allow local real estate boards to retain the power to enforce their own rules.
The bureau also has something to prove. When Commissioner Melanie Aitken was appointed last summer, she promised to improve the bureau's record of challenging organizations accused of anti-competitive conduct. By taking the case against CREA to a tribunal, the bureau will have to convince a specialized body that the association's practices are limiting competition in the home-selling business.
CREA president Dale Ripplinger - who is a full-time agent in Saskatchewan - refused to comment on the meeting or its implications for his almost 100,000 members. The locally elected presidents of each of the country's real estate boards have also been instructed to not speak with the media.
If the members approve the changes, a CREA spokesperson said the changes would be implemented "as soon as it is reasonable at each local board."
Those who work with the public have been spending a great deal of time trying to figure out what the changes would mean to their businesses and their industry.
Nawel Seth, a broker at Coldwell Banker Trail Blazers Realty in Markham, Ont., said he plans to offer a la carte services - flat-fee listing, one-off advice, negotiating help - as soon as he's given the green light.
"I can tell you that most agents I've spoken to across the country are comfortable with any changes that may be coming," he said.

Full text:   Toronto's hot real estate market is creating apathy among sellers and turning open houses into something of a spectator sport
In today's bloated housing market, where houses can sell in days and sometimes minutes, it appears it's become more about participating in bidding wars than buffing your home to a shine. Many sellers are forgoing fluffing - cleaning, removing clutter and rearranging furniture - opting instead to go au naturel.
It used to be the cardinal rule of home selling that you scoured your place, leaving it gleaming, devoid of any personal touches and so adequately bland that anyone could imagine themselves living there. The current sellers' market seems to have turned that thinking on its head.
"Because they're selling in any state, many people don't care if they're staging their house or not," says Hendrik Glastra, owner of Toronto-based HG Staging and reDesign, which provides consultations to clients on how best to stage their homes. "People are becoming complacent: They think that because they can get eight or nine offers, they can get away with anything."
This sense of smugness can lead to some pretty unusual encounters. At a showing of a $1.2-million home in the Yonge and Eglinton area several weeks ago, potential buyer Meaghan Hardcastle was surprised to be greeted with the smell of recently extinguished cigarettes and an overly affectionate pet ferret. "All the ferret did was follow me room to room through the whole house," she says. "It kept trying to crawl up my pants."
At an open house last month in Sherwood Park, recent home buyer Julie Green toured "what was essentially an enormous bachelor pad, complete with neon strip lighting, stained shag carpeting and a Jacuzzi." When she attempted to open the door to one of the bedrooms, the agent told her, "Don't mind the sleeping teenage boy - just go right in."
Anne Bourne, owner of professional staging firm Staging Works, based in Aurora, says she's always amazed to be greeted at open houses by "absolutely filthy homes - the kind you can smell even before you walk in." She says people need to realize that if potential buyers are privy to rotting garbage and photos of naked family members, "You've kind of missed your opportunity."
She says prepping the home, including cleaning, giving walls a fresh coat of paint, and rearranging or bringing in new furniture, can mean a house sells twice as fast and for anywhere from 8 to 10 per cent more than a home that hasn't been fluffed. It can also result in 13 offers rather than one, says Geoff Hartle, a sales representative with Royal LePage in Toronto.
But the service has become a tough sell for staging firms and agents. Mr. Glastra reports business this past summer and fall was soft. And sales reps confirm they can get pushback when offering tips to sellers on how to spruce up their homes. "I hesitate sometimes," says Cheryl Joseph, sales representative with Harvey Kalles Real Estate, who says most clients are receptive to her suggestions. "I don't want to be the bad guy."
Mr. Hartle believes agents, in the haste to sell homes, are also letting things slide, allowing sellers to remain during open houses (a big no-no), as well as neglecting a myriad of other home-selling tips. "They're just capitalizing on a crazed market," he says.
But the upcoming tightening mortgage rules on home buyers will cool the market, say agents, even by the end of the year. And that could mean a little less reeking kitty litter and a little more Windex.
Says Mr. Hartle: "People need to realize the market does fluctuate - it's not going to continue this way."

HIDDEN HORRORS
Whether it's to check for a formerly flooded basement or tree roots invading the pipes, you need to go on a reconnaissance mission when considering buying a house. Otherwise, prepare to fork over big money
Mike Holmes, a professional contractor and host of TV show Holmes on Homes , suggests interviewing nosy neighbours who've possibly witnessed sewer backups or roofing disasters. He also advo-cates requesting a copy of the Electrical Safety Authority's certificate of inspection (www.esainspection.net) and bringing in a plumber to scope drains for blockages if there's a tree on the property. And if the seller's amenable, you could find out what insurers have covered the property - and what claims have been filed.
****
SHODDY WORKMANSHIP
Find out what permits have been pulled on the home to determine if any changes, such as additions, have been okayed by authorities (www.toronto.ca/building/index.htm). If the house has unauthorized projects, you could risk a dangerous structural problem such as a collapsing foundation or addition, or legal action from the city or an adjacent homeowner.
***
INFESTATIONS
Know which parts of Toronto are home to termites or carpenter ants. Neighbours can be helpful with this info, as well as local exterminators (www.termiteinspections.ca); rodents and other pests can usually be detected by a reputable home inspector (www.oahi.com).
*****
GROW OPS
While police won't release info on grow ops to the public, a quick Internet search of a home's address could yield news reports on a bust. Telltale signs of a home used as a grow op are mould on walls and in the attic, and distortions in the ceiling drywall. Inexplicably high utility bills - info gleaned from an agent or utility - can also point to an illegal operation (www.torontopolice.on.ca/d42/grow house.pdf).
****
AREA IN TRANSITION
If you're looking for a neighbourhood where you can borrow sugar from your neighbour - not watch the trash accumulate on the doorsteps of rental properties across the street - ask your agent to provide you with a Geowarehouse Demographics Report (www.geowarehouse.ca). It provides demographic information, data on income per capita and residents' turnover rate, says Remax agent Tom Robic.

Downtown West is a condo lover's boomtown

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/downtown-west-is-condo-lovers-boomtown/docview/382581927/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "It made enormous sense to create new neighbourhoods west of the downtown core," he adds. "In many ways it was really a return to what spurred development there almost a century ago. When the factories went up housing sprung up around them so people who worked there could just walk to work, walk to shops and walk to entertainment and recreation spots."

Downtown West has proved to be a bit of a marvel. Over less than a decade a section of Toronto once distinguished by its profusion of abandoned factories and tiny run down workers' homes has been transformed into one of the most vibrant areas of the city.
The pace of condo development is so great that people like George Carras, president of RealNet Inc., which tracks the housing market, point out that there is more new condo construction in that one area of Toronto than in entire cities across Canada.
How brisk is the pace? Depends on your definition. RealNet's Downtown West runs from Bloor Street to the Lakeshore and from University Avenue to Dufferin Street, and at the end of January it says there were 55 projects on the go with a total of 15,562 units.
Urbanation's version of Downtown West is smaller. It looks at the area from College Street to Lakeshore but maintains that University to Dufferin east-west boundary. It says at the end of December there were 39 projects on the go with 9,566 suites of which 85 per cent had already been sold. Note that RealNet tracks the market month by month and Urbanation quarter by quarter.
Fine points of definitions and procedure aside, both companies rank Downtown West as the hottest area in the GTA for sales of new condos and both marvel at its success reinventing itself.
I like Urbanation's definition of Downtown West better, so let us stick with that.
What has happened in Downtown West is just prelude. That exhausting pace of new projects in a relatively small chunk of the city seems certain to continue. Ben Myers, executive vice-president of Urbanation, says he can see another 9,286 suites in the prelaunch or planning stages.
"We already had three launches in February alone," he says. They included Thompson Residences at Bathurst and King streets, 775 King West and ART on Dovercourt Road just south of Queen Street West.
"It really is phenomenal - the pace of construction and the enormous demand for suites there," he says.
So what is driving this rush to Downtown West and who is leading the charge?
Mainly young singles and couples although people in their 40s, 50s and 60s are starting to show up regularly at presentation centres, says Peter Freed of Freed Developments. Mr. Freed can justify laying claim to the crown in Downtown West.
Since 2004 he has developed nine projects in the area totalling 1600 suites. His most recent is Thompson Residences, launched last month.
What drew him to the area? Two major factors, he says. The first was a decision by former Toronto mayor Barbara Hall to designate the area for redevelopment into mixed-use neighbourhoods - away with those factories and in with new communities, which encouraged the creation of local retail, commercial and residential uses. They would also include a mix of new construction and renovation of existing properties into brick-and-beam lofts and office space.
The second was simply the cost of land. Those unused or underused industrial sites sold for a heck of a lot less than land in the core. "The math worked out," said Mr.Freed.
"It made enormous sense to create new neighbourhoods west of the downtown core," he adds. "In many ways it was really a return to what spurred development there almost a century ago. When the factories went up housing sprung up around them so people who worked there could just walk to work, walk to shops and walk to entertainment and recreation spots."
And that, of course, is the appeal of Downtown West. It is far enough from the core to offer a terrific neighbourhood, including shops and some of the best bars and restaurants in the city, but close enough so you can walk to work or take public transit. When development started there was also an overriding factor: Condos were cheaper than those in the core.
That, however, seems to be changing. While Mr. Freed says you can still find suites selling for $450 a square foot, RealNet says the average price had risen to $622 by the end of January, which makes Downtown West the fifth most expensive of the 20 GTA areas that the company tracks.
Mr. Freed points out it is still cheaper to buy in Downtown West than Bloor-Yorkville ($967), the Downtown core ($900), Yonge and St. Clair ($666) or the Central Waterfront ($631).
His own view is that there are still great opportunities in the area; he is looking at two more right now.
"Most of the projects are smaller and more intimate," he says. "It is a chance to live close to the heart of the city without having to buy a place in 60-storey high rises separated by a busy street."

Abstract: "They want to keep the home in its present form," apart from a few needed repairs pointed out in the inspection report, Mr. [Bruce Lasuta] says. "Folks that used to purchase a large boat or recreational aircraft are, in many cases, disposing of these high-cost, high-maintenance, depreciating acquisitions in favour of recreational real estate that can easily be accessed from nearby Vancouver for weekend/summer use and eventual full -time retirement living."

When this 1,066-square-foot home hit the market, the response from buyers was "nothing short of spectacular, with it selling in less than two weeks after 21 showings," says agent Bruce Lasuta.
The three-bedroom home has "certainly grown" since its construction as a one-bedroom cabin over 50 years ago, he says.
When the previous owners purchased the home through Mr. Latusa, five years ago, they planned to tear it down and construct a new home on the half-acre lot. Instead, "they fell in love with the little home and had new electrical services installed, along with new plumbing, a natural gas fireplace, a new bathroom and new counters, appliances and sink in the kitchen," he says.
The previous owners also built a detached studio, or office, in the backyard. The new owners had been looking for years and they also "totally fell in love with this quirky little creeker (local slang for Roberts Creek) home," says Mr. Lasuta.
"They want to keep the home in its present form," apart from a few needed repairs pointed out in the inspection report, Mr. Lasuta says. "Folks that used to purchase a large boat or recreational aircraft are, in many cases, disposing of these high-cost, high-maintenance, depreciating acquisitions in favour of recreational real estate that can easily be accessed from nearby Vancouver for weekend/summer use and eventual full -time retirement living."

Building on thin ice

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/building-on-thin-ice/docview/382572515/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: I often work outside of Toronto, especially on cottages and vacation properties on Georgian Bay, Muskoka and Simcoe. I have some international residences under my belt as well, so the notion of working on a non-local site doesn't make me flinch. Besides, once it's more than an hour out of the city limits, it may as well be in Timbuktu. If you can't pop over for a quick on-site approval in between client meetings, than it's far enough away already!

Full text:   Dee Dee Hannah gets her ducks in a row as construction gets started on her new Stoney Lake cottage
Since last month's article about my island cottage, there's been a lot of progress on my summer getaway, but before we get down to the nitty gritty I want to thank the readers who contacted me with suggestions about island living. Lou Meehan, of Wallace Island in Ivy Lea Ontario provided me with 32 tips, covering everything from safety (knowing your island's fire code) to fun (buy a billiards table) - thanks Lou!
This week I'm going to focus on the challenges of building out of town, choosing a contractor and dealing with winter construction; all of which can be difficult tasks.
I often work outside of Toronto, especially on cottages and vacation properties on Georgian Bay, Muskoka and Simcoe. I have some international residences under my belt as well, so the notion of working on a non-local site doesn't make me flinch. Besides, once it's more than an hour out of the city limits, it may as well be in Timbuktu. If you can't pop over for a quick on-site approval in between client meetings, than it's far enough away already!
The key to making an out-of-town project successful is communication. Quick calls and e-mails to check-in never hurt, and drawings and other notes and materials have to be extra careful and complete to avoid unnecessary confusion and delays.
For my island cottage, I try to keep site visits down to once a month. That works because I can count on my contractor for this project, Robert McLellan, aka "Bob the Builder." Choosing a contractor is one of the most vital elements to a project's success, and Bob was the answer to my prayers.
Generally when you pick out a contractor, you need someone you can trust and who will work hard to do the job right. Personal recommendations are a must, and it's important for the designer or architect to have a good working relationship with the construction company.
I'm already partners in a contracting company, Montclair Construction, but my company collaborates on many projects, so it's not unusual for me to work with other contractors and builders. But I turn to David Strathy, president of Montclair, for advice and guidance on every job.
As much as I like keeping things in-house, for this project it was important to hire a contractor who lives on the lake and knows the region inside out. This ensures easy access to stay on top of upkeep and maintenance over the years, as well as thorough knowledge of the terrain and how to adapt construction methods to the more rustic landscape.
Bob Mclellan came highly recommended from other owners in the region. He not only lives on the lake year-round, but he has over 30 years experience in the field, personally works on the site with his trusted crew, and ships his own materials. I met him both in Toronto and at the lake, and immediately felt comfortable with his skills and the sense of ownership he carried over each project he works on.
After getting the thumbs up from David, I hired Bob to work on my island getaway.
Now, working on an island property in the winter is no easy feat, especially during a fairly mild winter that makes driving across the lake in a 2-ton truck an adventure, to say the least.
"The number one risk when it comes to winter construction here is dealing with the ice and the terrain, says Bob. "You have to be very cautious and play it safe."
In order to get materials from the landing to the island, they are piled on to a large red wagon and hauled across the icy lake with a truck. The crew is working out of a small existing shed with an outhouse.
Regular chats and e-mails between Bob and I keep things moving, and it certainly helps that I approach the project with knowledge from the trade.
"It is not hard to work with a client who is out of town, as long as you have a good plan and keep the communication line open," says Bob. "It has been a pleasure working with Dee Dee thus far, because she knows the language and how everything works."
As spring nears and the lake thaws, Bob is preparing for the two to three weeks when he will lose access to the island because travel by truck becomes impossible and travel by boat in the ice-clogged water is too treacherous.
"Mother Nature really dictates how much work we can get done during these next few weeks, but at least one advantage to working on construction [once the ice melts] is I don't have to deal with boat traffic," says Bob. "Post-Thanksgiving, you can shoot a cannon clear through the lake without hitting anyone."
Next month we will begin to tackle the actual structure, talk trades and delve into the design...stay tuned!

An artful addition to Queen West's changing landscape

Abstract: On the other hand, the residential development of what's left of the industrial zone south of Queen is helping drive up neighbourhood real-estate prices from cheap to dear, to the detriment of the gallery owners, designers, artists and artisans whose presence made Queen West interesting in the first place.

I am of two minds about the gentrification of Queen Street West between Dovercourt Road and the Gladstone Hotel. On one hand, the condominium projects rising on the south side of the avenue will bring more people into the once-desolate strip, boost local businesses, make the streets more lively by day and night - all good things, in my view.
On the other hand, the residential development of what's left of the industrial zone south of Queen is helping drive up neighbourhood real-estate prices from cheap to dear, to the detriment of the gallery owners, designers, artists and artisans whose presence made Queen West interesting in the first place. Add to that the poor artistic quality of the new architecture we've seen so far down there - for example, Baywood Homes's faux-Victorian edifices now under construction across the street from the Gladstone - and you may find yourself thinking, as I often do, that the spiffing up of Queen West is turning into a sad affair.
Which leads us to Art Condominiums, the latest addition to the mix of residential projects on the go along this short stretch of Queen. Viewed with a weary eye, Art is just another instance of the intensification that is already making life too expensive for the long-time creative citizens in the area.
That said, it's impossible simply to write off this 11-storey building on Dovercourt south of Queen.
For one thing, I've rarely seen a new, developer-driven Toronto apartment block that tries harder to distance itself from the run-of-the-mill conglomeration of tiny condos typical of Hogtown. Art features 148 suites, only half of which are studio or one-bedroom units. The rest contain two or three bedrooms, and the largest apartments (1,615 square feet) have dens. Prices range from $213,000 for a 460-square-foot studio to about $700,000.
These layouts and prices suggest that the target market is not merely the first-time buyer (though there is plenty in this project for a would-be new homeowner to look at). Couples with one or two children could be comfortably housed here. This fact alone makes Art worth noticing. For, though Toronto is not yet ready, it's only a matter of time until we get used to the idea of families living throughout the adult life-cycle in a downtown apartment. If Art is a success, its popularity could prompt other developers in the inner city to devote large swatches of their buildings to family-sized accommodations. This is something everyone who cares about Toronto's downtown vitality and diversity should wish for.
Another thing that's attractive about Art - though I have certain reservations - is the architecture. Designed for developer Gary Silverberg by David Oleson, principal in Oleson Worland Architect, and Sandro Zanini of Hariri Pontarini Architects, the north-facing building rises in three movements: a stout base, over which floats a glassy, terraced shaft, and a cornice line that acts as a lid on the whole composition.
In an interview, Mr. Oleson told me he means to clad the four-storey, "very robust, elemental, simple" base in stone as a nod to the gruff industrial buildings that once stood round about the site. But if the historical context is important enough to merit a gesture of recollection, it's surely worthwhile to get right what one is remembering: The older structures were humble brick, not high-toned limestone. Brick makes sense in this area of the city; stone just doesn't.
At ground level, Mr. Oleson said, the base will contain 1,000-square-foot live-work units, each opening directly onto the street, each with 15-foot ceilings. On the second level will be a business centre. Both the live-work suites and the business centre are intended to attract the entrepreneurial people who have made Queen Street West the vivid place it is.
As the building goes upward from the base, the shaft steps back on the north face, creating terraces off some units up to 15 feet by 20 feet in size. In this move, we again see the developer's objective at work: to draw in families with children who could enjoy what amounts to a back yard, along with the many freedoms and conveniences of condo living.
I hope children will be born and grow up in Art. I also hope these children will find Queen Street the enjoyable place it is today, and not the overpriced, mediocre tourist wasteland that Yorkville (to cite another Toronto place that began as an artists' hangout) has become. Perhaps Art Condominiums will set Queen Street housing in a new direction, one more welcoming to the best that's already there. But like so many aspects of Toronto in this transitional moment, everything remains to be seen.

Full text: Million-dollar gardens are taking root in a backyard near you. We unearth the latest home decor trend
dkelly@globeandmail.com
****
Recession or no recession, the demand for big-ticket landscaping is growing - spurred on by a booming local real-estate market and the presence of gardening shows like Canada Blooms, opening in Toronto on Wednesday.
With homeowners spending money as if it grew on the trees they are newly coveting, the million-dollar garden is - even before the snow melts - the season's hottest home decor trend.
"It's the new status symbol," says Ron Holbrook, the award-winning Toronto-based landscape architect who is booked through most of 2010 with no job costing less than $200,000 - his bare minimum starting price.
"A fabulous garden is what everyone wants these days."
To get it, Mr. Holbrook's Canadian clients - and they include billionaire David Thomson, fashion entrepreneur Joe Mimran, singer Nelly Furtado, media mogul Allan Slaight and an assortment of Reichmans too many to mention - are upping the ante, asking for outdoor rooms as meticulously designed as their home's (often) deluxe interiors. In them, Mr. Holbrook's clients are asking for the newest must-have garden accessory - the outdoor fireplace, which extends a summer garden's enjoyment (especially in Canada) into the cooler months.
For Toronto manufacturer Alan Gozlan's backyard, Mr. Holbrook started first with a walk-through of the client's Forest Hill home to ensure a seamless connection with what he was designing outdoors.
"Cost simply didn't matter," says Mr. Gozlan. "In fact, I never even looked at the price. [The garden] is something extremely emotional for us and it brings us great enjoyment each time we look at it."
Incorporating a pre-existing rectangular pool and a mature hedge that came with the property into his design, Mr. Holbrook's garden expanded on not only the home's interior design but its overall enjoyment. "We gave him very little guidance other than opening our doors to him so he could get a feel for what we like," Mr. Gozlan says.
Gentrifying nature isn't new, of course. European aristocrats have been artfully pruning their hedges for centuries.
But it's popularity among Canadians for whom the garden is an all-too brief one-season pleasure is often more a matter of lifestyle than real-estate value.
Mr. Holbrook cites the example of a Collingwood, Ont., client who commissioned $2-million worth of landscaping on a 10-acre property where the house was little more than a ramshackle chalet. It's the most expensive garden Mr. Holbrook has ever designed.
"Sometimes the garden ends up being worth more than the house," he says. "This is when the garden isn't just to accent the house, it's the more important experience."
Increasingly, a home's outdoor space is where people want to congregate.
For his downtown Toronto garden, Joe Mimran, founder of Club Monaco and Joe Fresh, asked Mr. Holbrook to create a great outdoor entertaining space with "a bit of folly."
"We also wanted a garden that looked very much the same in the winter as the summer," he says.
"All the rooms face the back garden, so we wanted a visual treat from every view.
"I think gardens are an integral part of the design of any home. It's about creating an atmosphere and environment that transports you."
But it's not just the very rich who are getting down to Earth - ironically, with the sky as their limit.
Nickolaos Kon, co-owner of Toronto-based Fossil Landscapes, says that his clients tend to be more suburban than socialite but even they are demanding gardens that cost as much as $600,000, the budget for a garden he recently completed in Oakville.
"We're seeing clients, not just the wealthier ones, spending more on their landscapes," Mr. Kon says.
"People who have luxurious backyard retreats want to spend more time at home because it's a wonderful way to spend the summer months. It's an investment in the home as a representation of personal style, similar to any other aspect of home renovation, these days."
But an expensive garden also represents an investment in a property's real-estate value, says Mr. Holbrook.
"You put in high-quality landscaping and you get your money back when you sell the house. A great garden really enhances a house. It just makes sense."
A case in point is a property in Rockcliffe, Ont., Ottawa's wealthiest neighbourhood, where last year Mr. Holbrook completed a $1.4 million garden.
The home recently went on the market with a sale price of $6.990 million, making it by far the most expensive house on the block.
It's the garden that tipped the scale.
"I think it's one of the finest in all of Ottawa," says the homeowner, a businessman who requested anonymity for this article.
"It's made the house more saleable, more valuable, that's for sure."
For the project, Mr. Holbrook departed from his signature classical approach to create an English-style garden that he felt better complimented the home's manorial architecture.
The sprawling property was originally built in 1932 to house the spinster granddaughters of 19th century Canadian lumber baron, Henry Franklin Bronson. In the 1950s it became the home of esteemed Canadian diplomat, Alfred Rive. His socialite wife, the memorable Harriet Rive, died there, at age 101, in 2005 - the year the present homeowner purchased it as part of an estate sale.
The house had retained its sense of old world elegance on the inside, but outside the grounds were run-down.
Neglect had turned the original 1932 garden into a forest, overrun with Norway Maple, an invasive species.
One of the first things Mr. Holbrook did in tackling the garden was cut it all down, save for three old trees he deemed worth saving.
Then to give the homeowner back his privacy, Mr. Holbrook planted walls of new but mature trees, some nearly six metres tall - Multistem Birch, Serbian Spruce, White Pine, Norway Spruce and Nootka Cypress, averaging in price between $1,600 to $3,500 each, depending on the species. This is where the bulk of the money was spent.
"The homeowner wanted instant satisfaction," Mr. Holbrook says. "You don't get that with saplings that take 20 years to fill out."
A lot of money was also spent on the garden's foundation, which Mr. Holbrook insisted on investing as much time, labour and materials as needed to ensure that the resulting garden never "shifts or heaves or settles" over a lifetime of enjoyment.
Add to that the $200,000 spent on custom stone work, the $250,000 spent on planting materials, the $35,000 pond decorated with an Art Deco sculpture, the $70,000 garden pavilion, $40,000 boxwood shrubs, the $20,000 irrigation system and the $100,000 sophisticated lighting system and there you have it, ladies and gentleman, a modern-day Garden of Eden with God in the details.
"It doesn't take much to spend a million in a high-end garden," says Mr. Holbrook, making no excuses.
"Especially when you are making one to last."

Within a mature waterfront community about 10 minutes from Blue Mountain's ski hills, this custom log cabin harmoniously combines century-old characteristics and modern conveniences.
"There's nothing quite like it in town," says Desmond Von Teichman, who is a local agent in the Georgian Triangle region. "It's a unique home in a unique setting."
For instance, many elements of the original log house were preserved, from an old fireplace to dovetail beams. "It was really quite a beautiful home," says Mr. Von Teichman.
Within the past couple decades, the interiors were renovated and expanded, so there is now 3,500-square-feet of living space and updated mechanics.
On the main floor, there is a den, living room, kitchen and family room, as well as a media room and two bedrooms, including one with access to one of three bathrooms.
The second level houses three bedrooms and the main bathroom.
For additional comfort, the house is equipped with air conditioning, central vacuum and security systems, as well as a main-floor laundry room and two walkouts to the partially fenced grounds.
In ground sprinklers are spread throughout the property, which has ample room for a barn and interlocking circular driveway.
The homeowners can easily walk distance to a waterfront park, trail and beach, or drive a short distance to specialty shops and gourmet restaurants along the town's main street.
"Sunset Point is a very desirable neighbourhood," says Mr. Von Teichman. "It's very close to downtown, but with tremendous exposure to Georgian Bay."

Fuzzy boundaries no more

Abstract: "It's easier for real-estate agents to sell houses that are in a quote-unquote 'neighbourhood,' " she said. "But it's just a lot of people wanting to make their lives easier: So when somebody asks you where you live, you don't have to describe it in a roundabout way."

Full text: West-end neighbourhood seeks to define and label itself, choosing from 10 names
What's in a neighbourhood name?
A lot - especially in a city defined by hundreds of differentiated municipal pockets.
And residents of one Toronto neighbourhood feeling left out of the name game have spent more than a year trying to come up with a suitable moniker.
Now the residents behind the Fuzzy Boundaries project - so dubbed for the west-end neighbourhood's blurry demarcations - are down to 10 finalist names in a second round of voting, ending Sunday. But the mission to define this fuzzy hood has made its residents rethink just how they view where they live. For Marcel Fortin, that's what's most interesting.
The University of Toronto librarian has lived in the area for a decade. As someone who specializes in geographic information systems, he's had residents map out where they think the unnamed neighbourhood begins and ends. And almost no two people have the same mental map: Even he and his wife disagree.
"It was interesting in terms of being able to map out how people actually visualize their neighbourhood. ... It's not something you really think about."
For Kevin Putnam, one of the primary Fuzzy Boundaries proponents, the need for a name stemmed from the desire to stake a claim to a rapidly changing neighbourhood, whose industrial sites and railway yards are giving way to new condo developments.
"Before a property developer comes in and imposes another fake 'village' name on something in the city, we thought we could get ahead of that," he said. "The value of the name is that it links the neighbourhood together."
More than a year ago, he convened a group of like-minded residents who held public meetings, door-knocked and dropped off flyers outside the 3,300-odd individual addresses in the loosely demarcated area bounded (depending who you ask) by Davenport, Bloor, Dundas and Lansdowne. More than 230 names were submitted for the first round of voting in January, now whittled down to 10.
Mr. Putnam is hoping the extensive outreach will also help galvanize area residents on other issues - namely opposition to a plan to dramatically increase the number of Metrolinx commuter trains zipping through every day.
"These are people who have demonstrated they're engaged with the neighbourhood and they care about the place," he said. "It gives us a base to build from ... to really take the fight to Metrolinx."
But as with anything as touchily Torontonian as a neighbourhood naming, the attempt to rechristen the area historically known as the South Junction Triangle has ruffled a few feathers.
"Yes, it brought people together, but it's also been divisive," said Jack Fava, who has lived in the neighbourhood since moving there with his parents from Italy in 1966, and who counts his 16-year-old son as a third-generation local.
He feels the naming process has shunted older residents aside.
"I'm hoping the city, down the road should put a policy in place ... If a community or a neighbourhood or a ward does decide they want to change names, you have a set of rules you have to follow before you can do it or it's not considered fair."
Yasemin Zorlutuna admits she was leery of the idea at first: She was worried it was just one more step towards gentrification.
"It's easier for real-estate agents to sell houses that are in a quote-unquote 'neighbourhood,' " she said. "But it's just a lot of people wanting to make their lives easier: So when somebody asks you where you live, you don't have to describe it in a roundabout way."
In the four and a half years she's run Yasi's Place, a cafe and community hub on Wallace Avenue, "people have been asking me, 'What do people call this neighbourhood?' 'Why don't you come up with a name?
"Toronto is such a neighbourhood city," she said.

Today's epistle is inspired by Antonio Gramsci's slogan "pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will." No, seriously, it really is. Stick with me here.
As I write this, the analysis of the Oscar frock opera is still going at full throttle. Newspapers and magazines, in print and online, offer copious coverage of best dress, best cleavage, best shoes, best hair and best bling. Me, I've nothing against gazing at comely women in expensive frocks and making catty remarks. It's an age-old pastime. Why, when I was a young fella in a small town in Ireland, half the women of the town could show up outside the church at the end of a wedding and, as the confetti descended, would mutter unkind remarks about the bridal party's sartorial deficiencies.
Same thing as gawking at pictures from the red carpet. Nothing wrong with it. It's a healthy outlet for spite and sarcasm.
What's unhealthy is the ever-growing obsession with celebrity. There's a thin line between gawking at frocks and taking seriously the opinions and attitudes of celebrities, and the line has been crossed.
I put it to you that much of the ordinary human experience is no longer a viable subject for TV coverage unless some celebrity is involved or invoked. One dismaying offshoot of this phenomenon is a widespread acceptance of an old-fashioned class system. There's the rich and famous, who are interesting in everything they do and say, and there's the rest of lumpen humanity, which is not interesting at all.
For instance, Undercover Boss (Sundays, CBS, A Channel, 8 p.m.) has been cited by some journalists as "subversive" simply because the chief executive officer of a company spends a brief time working as an employee and discovers that people are underpaid and overworked. This is nonsensical. Workers have gained better conditions thanks to trade unions and employment law, not because some boss spent time dabbling in the working-class experience.
We have Celebrity Apprentice (returning Sunday, NBC, Global, 9 p.m.), in which such people as comedian Sinbad are given the eye-opening experience of running a business and being judged by celebrity real-estate tycoon Donald Trump. And, you know, every time I hear Kevin O'Leary barking away about the idiocy of government regulation on CBC News Network, I think this "celebrity business guy" likes the limelight, thinks his wealth gives him heightened insight.
Coming soon on A & E, there's a reality show called Teach , which follows actor Tony Danza as he spends time teaching English at a Philadelphia-area high school. It has been reported, in a Philadelphia newspaper, that Danza "cried three times" during his first week as a teacher. The show might well provide entertainment, insight even, but it is not a substitute for coverage of what it's actually like to be a high-school teacher in urban America today.
Most TV news operations - here and in the United States - have essentially given up on covering working life. There's plenty of opinion, for sure, but little in the way of authentic documentation of life as it is lived by people who aren't famous or rich. There was an extraordinary outpouring of support for Conan O'Brien when he was squeezed out of the Tonight show by NBC. As if, you know, a guy walking away with tens of millions of dollars in compensation was an outrage of epic proportions. People are made redundant every day because of cutbacks or outsourcing, but an awful lot of TV viewers actually empathized with O'Brien. Some even staged a protest outside the NBC studios. What happened to O'Brien was, somehow, more real because he's a celebrity.
Of course, some celebrities are worth your avid attention because they actually try to achieve something that isn't all about their wealth or fame. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver (who has a show soon on ABC in which he tries to get the people of a U.S. city to eat healthier by making their own food) could be raking in the cash, with his popular cooking shows, books, endorsements and restaurants. Instead, he keeps trying to do something more worthwhile than cook on TV, market stuff and make money. Oliver built a TV series on turning a bunch of hopeless, wayward kids into cooks. Then he tried to change the food that kids eat in British schools. He has had some success at it too. Sure, he craves attention. But this guy keeps trying to do something noble. That's where "optimism of the will" enters the picture.
Frocks and looking fabulous makes for fine TV fodder. But, like the people Jamie Oliver tries to change, we've consumed too much junk. Oliver recognizes the existence of real work and real life even in the midst of his stardom. He's one to be optimistic about.
***
Airing tonight
CSI:NY
(CBS, TV, 10 p.m.) is a St. Patrick's Day-themed episode. Seriously. It's called Pot of Gold and here's the gist: "When a double homicide involving two young journalists who are investigating a story about gold fraud occurs on the eve of St. Patrick's Day, the CSIs must find the clue at the end of the rainbow." Indeed. Just in case that doesn't pique your interest, take note of this alert from CBC: "Madchen Amick ( Gossip Girl ) guest-stars as a woman who piques Mac's interest." Perhaps she's a fairy princess from the old sod. J.D.

Freud taught us that the repression of instinct makes it possible for us to live civilly in society. The great psychoanalyst might smile down on the Vancouver condo buyer, who has no trouble getting his mind around the idea of "frustration" and "living with others." Here, $400,000 gets you 600 square feet and one bedroom downtown.
The knock on Vancouver condos, however, is not their dearness or their size. It's how badly decorated they are. The interiors are so similar - all with engineered hardwood floors, glass backsplashes and steel appliances - it's a wonder that the occupants can tell one from the other.
The crushing sameness comes with a rote excuse: "We can't afford anything better right now. This place is temporary. We're saving for our dream home."
I'm all for saving money, but before we forsake the present for the future, we should ask a few questions about the necessity - and the ethics - of surrounding ourselves with cheap, disposable furnishings. Here are four questions that Vancouver condo owners should definitely ask themselves.
Where did all this ultrasuede come from?
At some point, the gods decreed that all condo furniture would be made of tubular steel and fake suede. They then awarded sectionals as purchasing bonuses to every new condo owner in the Lower Mainland from 2002 to 2006. Nice one, gods.
It's true, tube-and-suede furniture has its appeal: The pieces are small, easy to move and crazily resilient. But the same can be said of lawn chairs.
Tube-and-suede sofas are paragons of mediocrity: poorly built and poorly proportioned, filler until such time as we can afford something better. Their final resting place is, inevitably, the dump.
The alternative is to invest in well-designed furniture. It doesn't have to cost the earth. Excellent small-space furnishings have been around for decades. All that is required is a hunt through thrift and vintage stores for Danish modern pieces, old English antiques and classic mid-century Americana. They're stylish, comfortable and durable.
If you're ready to invest in new pieces, look to European-style lines from local design companies such as Bensen - excellent low-profile furnishings suited to condo living and transferable to larger homes.
Does everything need to be espresso coloured?
Even if we were able to wish all the faux-suede furniture away, we would still have an ocean of espresso-coloured side tables, armoires and shelves.
My guess is that the dark-wood trend was inspired by the sultry, lounge-like interiors of hotels such as W. The design-forward look, which had loads of sex appeal, coincided with the housing boom of the early 2000s. Picking up on the trend, Asian manufacturers mass-produced boxy dark furniture and flooded the market with cheap veneer and chipboard. In great numbers, people dragged the stuff home to their condos.
Not sure whether you got the sultry dark wood or the chintzy dark wood? If it came from Costco or Superstore, it's the latter.
If affordability is your furnishing watchword, go to IKEA, where the design is solid and the manufacturing ethical. Their pieces, mixed with vintage furnishings and statement pieces, can be a smart look.
If you really want to make an impact, have custom millwork built for your audio-visual equipment and your books - you'll always see that extra expense reflected in your condo's resale value.
Really? Parsons dining chairs?
Part Three of the Catastrophic Condo Furnishing Formula is the Parsons-style dining chair. Like many household items gone sour, the chair has its roots in good design.
Designed in the 1930s at Paris's famed Parsons School of Design, the piece was a successful experiment in paring the dining chair down to its essential elements. It has tapered wooden legs and an upholstered seat with a high back; the better versions have linen or leather upholstery and solid wood legs.
Most of us, though, are more familiar with the overstuffed brown naugahyde version - four of them parked around an espresso dining table. If you live in a Vancouver condominium, chances are you have them. Chances are so do your neighbours.
Luckily, dining chairs are one of the easiest furnishings to do right. My suggestion: Buy something - anything - different and don't worry if they match your dining table. It's more interesting if they don't. Remember to purchase a style that is always in production. That way, you can expand your collection when bigger digs are on the horizon.
Must this lighting be so cheap?
Cheap lighting fixtures are like knock-off sunglasses - you may luck out and get a deceptively great deal, but most people will recognize you for what you are: a cheapskate who has recently been to a night market.
Alas, people buy them anyway. Thousands of Vancouver condos have the wavy plastic orbs over the dining table and the gauze-shaded chandeliers over the bed.
Don't follow this lead. Your dining-room fixture is the one to spend some money on - take a walk around a high-end lighting store or vintage dealer. I like lights with an organic form - they contrast well with the boxiness of a typical condo. And don't be afraid to get something overscale - too big is always better than too small.
If you're being conservative with your cash, then stick to decor classics such as a white glass orb or a linen drum shade. They're unexciting, but they're timeless - and you'll avoid looking as though you bought the cheap cousin of the fixture you really wanted.

A city that elevates footbridges to a special status

Author: LeBlanc, Dave

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/city-that-elevates-footbridges-special-status/docview/382579422/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Not far away, the Glen Road footbridge soars high over Rosedale Valley Road. A comment at urbantoronto.ca was that this bridge is a kind of "purgatory" between leafy Rosedale and the forest of St. James Town high-rises. Start at the Rosedale side and you'll learn, via a Heritage Toronto plaque, that it was a favourite dog-walking route for writer Morley Callaghan.

Morning people must love footbridges. At sunrise, anything is possible; the day is a potential-filled croissant chased with a steaming mug of mystery. So, too, do footbridges bring possibility: A new neighbourhood awaits discovery on the other side, or a personal revelation could happen at mid-cross.
Using footbridges can help keep us safe, too, since the automobile-pedestrian relationship has been rather strained these past few months.
Fortunately, Toronto is blessed with many pedestrian-only bridges due to its many ravine systems - University of Toronto architecture professor Larry Richards once described the city as "San Francisco turned upside down" - and architourists would do well to regard them as an alternative way to navigate neighbourhoods. Also, whether great or small, bridges are beautiful for their simplicity.
While I'm aware of the major players, I asked friends, family and some of the nice folks at urbantoronto.ca to help me locate a few lesser-known gems.
We'll start, however, with a footbridge almost everyone knows: It connects Riverdale Park East at Broadview Avenue and Gerrard Street to Cabbagetown's Riverdale Park West. Hundreds of whizzing cars pass underneath the Riverdale Footbridge every day. Built in 1957, it hovers over so many "uses" - the Bayview Extension, railway lines, a footpath, the Don River and the Don Valley Parkway - crossing it never gets boring. I usually walk from west to east so I can admire the former Riverdale Hospital in all its macaroni-shaped, Modernist glory. When the 1963 building finally meets the wrecker's ball next year (or the year after), I'll likely switch my preferred direction. Regardless, it takes long enough to cross this one that contemplating the fate of Modernist architecture or the rejuvenation of the Don comes naturally.
Not far away, the Glen Road footbridge soars high over Rosedale Valley Road. A comment at urbantoronto.ca was that this bridge is a kind of "purgatory" between leafy Rosedale and the forest of St. James Town high-rises. Start at the Rosedale side and you'll learn, via a Heritage Toronto plaque, that it was a favourite dog-walking route for writer Morley Callaghan. Start at the other end and you'll no doubt ponder the fate of the boarded-up Victorian homes for so long, you'll forget to behold the breathtaking view of the road below as it snakes through trees, and the wonderfully warm "clunk-clunk" your footfalls make on the wooden planks. (For more information on Nos. 6 to 16 Glen Rd., go to www.heritagetoronto.org and type "South Glen Road" in the search box.)
Lesser-known footbridges are interesting because locals treat them as if they were private spaces; as such, these can help us pick up on a neighbourhood's vibe. The crossing over the Moore Park Ravine at Hudson Drive and Heath Street East is a welcoming and rather informal metal structure that looks similar to a railway bridge; here, strollers and joggers don't give strangers a second look. A few kilometres away, however, at the Glen Cedar Bridge over the Cedarvale Ravine, twin lampposts on either side signal a more serious enclave. Here, too many pauses or fiddlings with one's camera raise suspicion. Perhaps that's because residents had to fight long and hard to have the 1912 bridge restored in 1989; perhaps it's because they're trying to find out who's responsible for the dozens and dozens of plastic water bottles littering the ravine below. From here, one can spy the now-vacant 1957 Imperial Oil building at 111 St. Clair Ave. West, home to a stunning lobby mural by painting superstar R. York Wilson.
Footbridges spanning railway tracks are especially important to the urban flâneur , since these are usually found in inner-city neighbourhoods. Pape Avenue, for instance, is sliced in two by tracks that run behind Gerrard Square, resulting in twin dead ends for drivers. Walkers, however, get to wind their way up the somewhat Brutalist structure and drink in a great view of the city skyline as they cross. Living cheek-to-jowl with auto repair shops and former warehouses, the bridge that connects Dundas Street West to Wallace Avenue in the west end is a wonderful metal composition with a wide, grand staircase.
Parks contain many footbridges, but most are too small to be included in this survey; the exception, of course, is the favourite of student photographers, the 1994 Humber Bay Arch Bridge designed by Montgomery and Sisam. Nearby, and built just a few years later, is the "leaning" bridge over Mimico Creek by starchitect Santiago Calatrava, who gave us the Allen Lambert Galleria at Brookfield Place on Bay Street. While tiny at only 44 metres, the bridge is worth a detour to see.
Another tiny footbridge that's worth a special trip is the 1950s-era covered structure built by the Canadian Institute for the Blind over Bayview Avenue just north of Eglinton Avenue East.
South of that is the ex-railway bridge of the Kay Gardner Beltline Park near Davisville Avenue and Yonge Street, but I consider the beltline to be more of a footpath. In the coming weeks (and with your help via e-mail), I'll write on neighbourhoods with strong pedestrian footpath systems, such as Don Mills.
When the mega-resorts brought mega auto-pedestrian problems to Las Vegas in the early 1990s, the solution was to get pedestrians up off the streets and onto "skywalks." While these wouldn't work on our high streets for obvious reasons, with a little creative planning, the way we arrive at Bloor, Dundas or Queen streets can include a footbridge, where the views and the possibilities are endless.

'Smilence' is golden in China's parliament

Author: Mackinnon, Mark

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/smilence-is-golden-chinas-parliament/docview/382578933/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: While leadership is focused on ensuring economic growth and the military wants to build an aircraft carrier, it is official corruption that remains the most pressing issue in the minds of most Chinese, according to two separate newspaper polls published ahead of the NPC.

Full text: It is known as the period of "smilence" - the 10 days of fixed smiles and silent agreement that are the once-a-year sitting of China's rubber-stamp parliament. Though its job, theoretically, is to safeguard the constitution, proposals put forward by the ruling Communist Party are almost never rejected by the 2,987 legislators who make up the National People's Congress.
-3.2 v. +8.7
Percentage of economic decline among the world's advanced economies in 2009, compared with China's growth
Keeping the economy going
Premier Wen Jiabao declared today that China is the first major economy to emerge from the global recession after it surpassed nearly all predictions and posted 8.7 per cent growth for 2009. "Our economy was the first in the world to have made a turnaround," Mr. Wen said. Still, worries remain about the prospect of inflation, as well as skyrocketing real-estate prices. Mr. Wen said Beijing would build five million units of low-income housing this year and rehabilitate some two million slums in an effort to bring prices under control. Mr. Wen is expected to set the country's economic growth target at 8 per cent for 2010. Don't bet against them.
1.5 v. 4
Percentage of GDP China spends on its military, compared with the United States.
Slowing military growth
International observers were anxiously awaiting the unveiling of China's annual defence budget, looking for signs that Beijing was entering an arms race with Washington amidst a "spring chill" as a result of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and a visit by the Dalai Lama to the White House. The numbers released yesterday seem designed to send the opposite message. After two decades of double-digit growth, military spending will increase by a relatively modest 7.5 per cent this year, to about $78-billion (U.S.). It's unclear if that includes new money to continue building an aircraft carrier, seen as a crucial step if China wants to project its new military might. Officials are quick to point out that China's defence spending is still only a fraction of the $494-billion the U.S. spent last year.
103 million
Estimated number of rural Chinese who migrate to the cities each year .
Toppling "the last fort"
In a bold and rare move, 13 Chinese newspapers simultaneously published an editorial this week calling on the government to reform the country's household registration system, which relies on identification papers known as hukous and serves as a barrier to movement by tying social benefits such as schooling and health care to the place of one's birth. "China has suffered for a long time under the hukou system!" reads the editorial. "We believe in people born to be free and people possessing the right to migrate freely." The current hukou system, introduced in 1958 as the famine induced by Mao's failed Great Leap Forward set in, was a measure to prevent desperate peasants from flooding the cities. Though it has been greatly relaxed since then, allowing tens of millions of migrant labourers from the countryside to take up jobs in factory cities, it remains a barrier to migrants taking up permanent residence, helping foster the widening urban-rural divide in the country. One Chinese scholar this week described the hukou system as "the last fort" of the Mao-era command economy. It's a fort that may yet stand for some time. In a sign that at least some in the upper echelon of the Communist Party aren't keen to dismantle the regime just yet, the editorial quickly disappeared from many of the websites that initially carried it.
79
China's position on the latest annual Corruption Perceptions Index, which ranks countries from least to most corrupt. It's tied with Burkina Faso, Swaziland and Trinidad and Tobago.
Corruption and crusaders
While leadership is focused on ensuring economic growth and the military wants to build an aircraft carrier, it is official corruption that remains the most pressing issue in the minds of most Chinese, according to two separate newspaper polls published ahead of the NPC. As legislators convene this week, lurid details continue to spread online of a local official who kept a diary of all the bribe-taking, boozing and womanizing that came with his job as the chief of a local office of the Tobacco Monopoly Bureau. The bribe-taking diarist was suspended from his post after his exploits were anonymously posted on the Internet. The powerful Ministry of Supervision says upwards of 106,000 officials were punished last year and more than $650-million in public money was recovered. "The government has indeed put a lot of effort into cracking down the corruption. It has given out stronger punishments than ever. But we very much lag behind in the construction of corruption-free system" because of a lack of transparency and public supervision, said Hu Xingdou, a professor of economics and China issues at the Beijing Institute of Technology. Despite the public furor over a string of high-profile corruption cases, no one expects the Communist Party to introduce the kind of remedies Mr. Hu believes are necessary: greater media freedom and protection for whistle-blowers. Most NPC delegates will likely decide that when it comes to their own well-being, "smilence" remains the best policy.

The prodigal slider returns

Author: White, Patrick

Abstract: "It'll be the biggest event in my lifetime, that's for sure," said Damon Gillis, an event organizer and co-owner of the Russell Inn (don't ask, it's booked solid). "The old-timers will tell you that the troops' homecoming after World War II was a big event, but I'm not sure it can match this." Pound-for-pound, it may even prove to be the largest Olympic homecoming bash in the entire country.

Full text: Russell, Manitoba is set to party-hardy with Olympic gold medalist Jon Montgomery
Arthur the Bull has been fitted for his gold medal.
Several thousand 'Got R Done' T-shirts have been ordered.
Gold bows for all 189 trees lining Main Street have been tied.
To celebrate a single golden moment, the 1,700-strong town of Russell, Man., is ironing out a million little details. As the town that raised Jon Montgomery, the flame-haired hoser who shot head-first down an icy Whistler track faster than anyone in history, then won the country's unconditional love by chugging a beer pitcher on national TV, they have good reason to rejoice.
Such good reason, in fact, that March 14, 2010, Montgomery Gold Day, promises to be the biggest party in the town's 130-year history - bigger than the annual Beef and Barley Festival, bigger than the King and Queen Pageant, even bigger than the day Theoren Fleury, another native son, won Olympic hockey gold in Salt Lake.
"It'll be the biggest event in my lifetime, that's for sure," said Damon Gillis, an event organizer and co-owner of the Russell Inn (don't ask, it's booked solid). "The old-timers will tell you that the troops' homecoming after World War II was a big event, but I'm not sure it can match this." Pound-for-pound, it may even prove to be the largest Olympic homecoming bash in the entire country.
"Basically 15 per cent of the town has taken three weeks off work to dedicate to this one day," Mr. Gillis said. "A sociologist could probably make a lot of how something like this binds the town and the country; I just know it's intoxicating."
The official Montgomery Gold Team, a collection of over 200 volunteers organizing the event, are expecting the town's population to triple for the event. That's 5,000 people, including VIPs such as Premier Greg Selinger, Winnipeg Police Chief Keith McCaskill, and Miss Teen Canada all feting the charismatic son of Joan and Eldon.
"It's a little hard to grasp right now," said Ms. Montgomery, a real-estate agent, who first realized the scope of Russell's love for her son when she returned from the Olympics to find posters of him plastered outside and inside her home.
"This is a small place, so a good number of people know the code for our locks," she explained. "Best of all, we had dinner and a bottle of wine waiting for us when we got home as well. I don't think Jon will quite realize the scope until he gets here."
When he arrives, he'll find his nude image painted on the front window of the local credit union. He'll find 18 police officers and dozens of security guards. He'll find several yellow buses shuttling people back and forth from overflow parking situated in field outside town. He'll find a school band from Brandon and four Greyhound coaches full of school kids who made the four-hour drive from Winnipeg. He'll find his favourite delicacy on the Russell Inn's Menu: The Montywich, a strange mixture of pickles, cashews, cheese and hot-sauce pressed between two slices of bread.
He'll find 5,000 hot dogs, 25 buffet stations, a Jumbotron broadcasting his every move and ornamental medals around every neck in town, including its mascot Arthur the Bull.
"We don't live on big salaries here," said Perry Bulbuck, another organizer. "But we know a good time."
And they can identify with Mr. Montgomery's fanciful dreams.
Seven years ago, he stuck a picture of a skeleton racer to the family fridge and declared he would one day win a gold medal - a tad far-fetched for an auto auctioneer from the table-flat prairies.
And just as he made good on whimsy, so too has Russell. Once a farm town through-and-through, a group of locals dreamed of re-branding the area as a tourist destination about 10 years ago. Today the Asessippi Ski Resort pulls in 100,000 powder-seekers a year, eight sets of massive arches soar over Main Street and stores are being made-over in an "old world" style.
"No one ever believed that ski hill would happen," Mr. Bulbuck said. "It's all about believing in something, no matter what. Jon has that attitude and so does the town. I just know I haven't slept past 4:30 a.m. for days to work on this and I've never felt better."

Like the Fed's book, the U.S. recovery looks beige

Abstract: Beyond the "weather-related noise," the report confirms that the United States is in a phase of "gradual expansion, rather than robust growth," explained economist Zach Pandl of Nomura Securities.

Full text: After a burst of activity at the end of last year, the U.S. economy is gearing down into a pattern of slow, steady recovery.
Most regions of the country are growing again, consumers are starting to show some life, manufacturers are doing better and inflation is calm, according to the Beige Book, a monthly summary of economic conditions by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's 12 regional banks.
And if weren't for a series of massive snowstorms that paralyzed much of the Northeast and mid-Atlantic in February, conditions might be better still.
"Economic conditions continued to expand since the last report," according to the Fed report, which is culled from anecdotal contacts with local businesses and experts.
Nine of the Fed's regional banks reported improved economic conditions in February, "but in most cases, the increases were modest," the report said.
The bad news is that key parts of the economy remain weak. The pace of layoffs has slowed, but hiring is slow to come back, with the exception of manufacturers in the Cleveland district and temporary-help agencies in several regions.
Meanwhile, loan demand remains weak across the country and banks are leery about extending credit. And the housing and commercial-real-estate sectors continue to be a drag on the economy.
Beyond the "weather-related noise," the report confirms that the United States is in a phase of "gradual expansion, rather than robust growth," explained economist Zach Pandl of Nomura Securities.
The recovery seems to be spreading to new areas of the economy, which should allay fears that the United States could slip back into a double-dip recession.
The U.S. economy shot ahead at a annual rate of 5.9 per cent in the final three months of last year - the fastest pace in more than six years. Most economists say the economy is likely growing at less than half that pace now. That's still positive, but it could take years for the labour market to reabsorb the eight-million-plus Americans who lost their jobs.
There was further evidence of subtle economic improvement in a report yesterday on the service sector.
The Institute for Supply Management's index of non-manufacturing businesses rose to 53 in February from 50.5 a month earlier. A reading above 50 indicates the service sector is expanding.

OFF-BEACH MIAMI

Abstract: South Beachers have turned the fact that builders can't dig deep here - before 1913, Miami Beach was still a sandbar cut off by water - into architectural gold.

Full text: Sure, South Beach is a playground for the rich and famous. But here, a pedestrian mall leads to surprising weight and whimsy, from a designer parking garage to a moving memorial as well as great shopping
Miami Beach has seen plenty of waves, not just in the ocean but among its people: real-estate speculators and Rockefellers, Jews and Cubans, straights and gays, humble retirees and celebrities.
And today the city, especially the southernmost 25 blocks known as South Beach, bears traces of them all. Here, rich and poor and everyone in between exist side by side. It's a city with low-cost housing and $40-million mansions, and locals are proud of it all.
The result is that in South Beach, you feel like you're in a city, not an enclave; this effect is helped by the beach, 11 kilometres of public white sand that invites everyone to go out on foot, wander and mix it up. The pedestrian ethos carries through Lincoln Road, the area's shopping hub and one of the world's great pedestrian malls, recently made greater by a magnificent parkade - one of several that have become centrepieces in this singular town.
Parking with style
South Beachers have turned the fact that builders can't dig deep here - before 1913, Miami Beach was still a sandbar cut off by water - into architectural gold. This parking garage-slash-retail-and-residential building is by Herzog & de Meuron, the Pritzker Prize-winning Swiss architects behind the Tate Modern and the "Bird's Nest" Olympic stadium in Beijing (as well as a new Miami Art Museum expansion in the works right now). "The strength of our buildings," Jacques Herzog has said, "is the immediate, visceral impact they have on a visitor." And the impact of this eight-level concrete accordion, no two levels the same height, with sharp angles everywhere, is considerable: Just because a building is raw doesn't mean it can't also be gorgeous. Climb up the stairs, ignore the fact they've stuck on the big pink number for Level 3 upside down, and you'll get some of the best views of the Beach and the harbour, too. 1111 Lincoln Rd.; www.1111lincolnroad.com
The shoe fits
The owners of Tuccia di Capri, a small boutique just off Lincoln Road, went to Capri to study sandal-making before opening this beachy cobbler's shop. All sandals are made top to bottom in the small space, at a small table in the front of the shop piled with cobbling tools. With wooden soles brought in from Naples, Italy, three full-time cobblers (including Darya, a proud Maritimer) will customize your sandal with any configuration of strap, jewel or other accessory you like. Though the idea has tourist trap written all over it, the shop itself couldn't be more straightforward and authentic, a trade shop for people who prefer something a little more permanent than flip-flops. And nothing in the place costs more than about $300. 1630 Pennsylvania Ave.; 305-534-5865; tucciadicapri.com
Mod threads
New to Lincoln Road, the British clothing store All Saints Spitalfields has already become a destination. Some shoppers probably like the clothes, slightly distressed and best suited to self-conscious hipsters. But it's the Texas-meets-Industrial Revolution decor that draws people in: There are at least as many people with cameras out as wallets, looking at the hundreds of vintage sewing machines displayed floor to ceiling, or the steer skulls covering the wall behind the cashier. Designed by the brand's own team based in east London, this is a shop that fits well into this design-intensive city. 910 Lincoln Rd.; 786-517-8180; www.us.allsaints.com
Over-the-counter remedies
The 11th Street Diner was moved here in 1992 from its original home in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., but there are few enough of these genuine aluminum dining cars left (this one was built by Paramount Dining Car Company of Haledon, N.J.) that they're a treat wherever you find them. And the fact that this one fits into its neighbourhood, not coming across as a kitschy condescension to working-class dining but as a genuine example of it, seals it as a stop on any fun South Beach stay. 1065 Washington Ave.; 305-534-6373; www.eleventhstreetdiner.com.
Cuban delicacies
Open 24 hours, David's II - a Cuban counter diner with a dining room attached for fancy folks - is nearly perfect. Prices are about $2 higher than they should be (a reflection of the hot location), but the food's real and good.
The roast pork chunks achieve the precise balance of pig, cooking oil and fat that has made the meat the anchor of Cuban cuisine. For the best David's experience, though, stop by the coffee and empanada window at 6 a.m. and have a cortadito (a small espresso with steamed milk and, unless you ask for it sin azucar , lots and lots of sugar) alongside some Cubans who remember the motherland from its pre-Castro days.
1654 Meridian Ave.; 305-672-8707; davidscafe.com.
The art of salesmanship
Romero Britto, the art world's greatest gift to merchandising since Keith Haring, is the perfect Miami artist and he knows it; in 1993, he opened this permanent gallery of his shameless, colourful appropriations of Disney, Leonardo da Vinci and everyone in between right in the middle of the Lincoln Road mall. Brazilian by birth but South Beach in every other conceivable way, Britto has sculptural installations around the city (including one in Emeril Lagasse's restaurant at the newly renovated Loews Hotel). In any other city, they'd seem silly, and
possibly crass. In South Beach, they're virtual mascots.
818 Lincoln Rd.; 305-531-8821; www.britto.com
A sober moment
The first time you see the truly powerful Holocaust Memorial Miami Beach, the contrast between the bleached bright sun and the gruesome dankness of Kenneth Treister's sculpture is shocking. A massive bronze hand rises out of a pink Jerusalem stone with dying figures in poses of Dante-esque horror reaching out from the forearm. Surrounding it are emaciated, dying and dead figures from the camps. There's no serenity; just anguish, terror and death. This is by far the most affecting monument on the continent.

Full text: bmckenna@globeandmail.com
Economist Ed Yardeni is a constant traveller, relentlessly crisscrossing the globe and talking to investors.
It's a two-way flow of information. The former Wall Street economist, who now runs his own consulting business, offers his views on everything from the direction of corporate profits, economic fundamentals, geopolitics and even the latest movies.
And his customers - including asset managers, mutual funds, trust companies, hedge funds, banks and large corporations - share their thoughts about what's going on in their world.
There are a few other things you should know about Mr. Yardeni, who plied his trade at Deutsche Bank, Prudential Securities and E.F. Hutton before striking out on his own. He's not fond of Democrats or Washington, he loves movies and he's a confirmed optimist.
But these days, Mr. Yardeni acknowledges the W-word is high on everyone's mind - worry.
" 'So what is everyone else worrying about?' This is more or less the most frequent question I've been asked in recent visits," he says.
"There's a lot to worry about. However, some of the greatest bull markets in stocks occur when the Wall of Worry seems insurmountable."
Mr. Yardeni is also fond of lists. He recently put together a top 10 list of investor worries, which we've paraphrased and amplified here as a handy guide to why the stock market rally has stalled in recent weeks:
1 Sovereign debt Some analysts worry Greece could be to the sovereign debt market what subprime mortgages were to housing, spreading a new bout of financial contagion, affecting heavily indebted countries everywhere.
2 Washington gridlock Forget about Congress and the Obama administration tackling any of the country's big problems, including this year's record $1.6-trillion (U.S.) deficit.
3 Bloated state and local budgets States are generally barred by law from running deficits. So they must slash expenses or raise taxes to get back on track, causing a drag on the economic recovery. State shortfalls could sap nearly $194-billion from the U.S. economy this year and another $180-million in 2011.
4 Commercial real estate Half of the roughly $1.4-trillion worth of commercial loans coming due over the next four years are already "under water" and could trigger bank losses reaching as much as $300-billion a year, according to a recent congressional oversight panel report released yesterday.
5 Exit strategies The U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks are carefully laying the groundwork to retreat from all the easy-money policies they put in place to counter the effects of the credit crisis. Fed chief Ben Bernanke is probably singing that old Clash song Should I Stay or Should I Go . Exiting too early could push the economy back into recession, while hanging in too long could trigger inflation.
6 Inflation Some economists worry that inflation is inevitable with all that monetary stimulus sloshing through the system.
7 China So far, Chinese authorities seem to have engineered a soft landing of their economy. But with China now such a force in the world, a setback there could quickly ripple through the global economy.
8 Jobs The recession blew a gaping hole in the U.S. labour market. Just to get back to pre-recession employment levels, the country must create more than eight million new jobs. And that could take years, keeping a lid on consumer optimism and spending.
9 A double-dip in housing Mr. Yardeni says housing remains the "weakest link" in the U.S. economy in spite of historic intervention by the government. The concern now is what happens when the Fed stops buying all those mortgages, interest rates rise and mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stop backing every loan in sight.
10 Iran goes nuclear Any hint of real trouble in Iran could destabilize the Middle East, sending oil prices soaring.
Think of all this as a series of worst-case scenarios. Not all of them will come to pass. Indeed, many fears may prove exaggerated.
But it's a good guide to what the traders who move financial markets are fretting about.

Full text: Artists, attracted by cheap property and the blank canvas of abandoned buildings,are moving in to the dying city. They just might be its saviours, reports Siri Agrell
The corner of Brush Street and General Motors Boulevard is not the place you expect to see something beautiful. A row of abandoned houses droop in the snow, their windows broken and doors boarded up. Empty lots are overgrown with weeds and a fleet of police cars lines a fenced-in lot, ready for action in a neighbourhood where crime is the main inhabitant. There are no snowy footprints on the sidewalk, and a dingy gas station goes unvisited. But on the side of a nine-storey warehouse a huge mural cuts through the palpable gloom, more than 10,000 square feet of sky blue streaming drips of red, purple, orange and yellow down the building's western wall.
The Illuminated Mural was painted last August by artist Katie Craig, part of a citywide initiative that allowed six Detroit communities to commission large-scale works of art for their neighbourhoods.
Years of decay and decline have turned Detroit's downtown core into a ghost town, miles of crumbling houses, empty lots and boarded-up businesses creating an apocalyptic zone of nothingness between the central business district and the still-vibrant suburbs.
But a community of artists has moved into the void, drawn by the promise of cheap real estate and free rein.
Some of their projects are done in partnership with local businesses and cultural institutions, desperate to put a more attractive face on their blighted city, but others have adopted a guerrilla approach, taking over decrepit spaces only an artist could love. Together, the work is redefining a city best known for its dying automotive industry and Eminem's 8 Mile , and suggests that it may just be possible for a city to save itself with art.
The most visible of Detroit's artistic makeovers have utilized the city's most abundant found material: abandoned buildings.
Recently, two New York transplants covered a deserted house with water, transforming it into a glittering monument to decay called The Ice House . The work follows in the footsteps of Object Orange , in which a group of anonymous art students painted abandoned properties in bright orange paint, highlighting empty properties that had been left to rot, and expediting the demolition of many buildings by city authorities.
Another nameless crew draped blue flags from the windows of an empty building that was once Michigan Central Station. And when Olayame Dabls bought an empty building next to his store, the African Bead Museum, he responded to a city order to board it up by covering the exterior with a mosaic of mirrored glass, iron and wood.
"There's guerrilla art going on here. It's quite amazing," said Richard Rogers, president of the College for Creative Studies, a college of art and design. "Artists are moving in from other parts of the world to experience this energy that seems to be developing."
He moved from New York City 10 years ago, much to the surprise of his friends. People think of Detroit as decayed, destroyed, post-apocalyptic, he said, and largely beyond repair. "Artists don't really look at things that way," he said. "Artists go into places that other people aren't interested in and transform them."
The artistic vision for Detroit can be traced back to Heidelberg Street, where Tyree Guyton began an installation nearly 25 years ago transforming his childhood neighbourhood into a walkable museum.
His work exists in the midst of a huge residential wasteland, where more than 90 per cent of homes are abandoned. He has turned the street into some sort of Disney park gone wrong, with trees hung with shopping carts and a rowboat stacked with rotting stuffed toys. One home is covered in brightly coloured numbers, to help local children learn to count, and a residence known as the Dotty Wotty House is covered in bright circles of colour.
In the 1990s, the city twice attempted to demolish the work, but Mr. Guyton has since registered the Heidelberg Project as a non-profit, one that now employs three full-time and two part-time staff. They have 30 volunteers, a swarm of interns and a lead designer on loan from the University of Michigan. What once was seen as an eyesore is now viewed as a template for revival. Executive director Jenenne Whitfield, Mr. Guyton's wife, says the project draws 250,000 visitors a year, making it Detroit's third-largest tourist destination. Last summer, a group of European tourists held a picnic in the middle of the street.
But the aim is not just to become an outdoor gallery. Ms. Whitfield says they want to rebuild the community around the art. Already, two artists have moved onto the street, and Ms. Whitfield hopes that more will follow, and signs of life will spread outward from the project. "As far as I'm concerned, Detroit is a blank canvas," she said. "We're infusing energy into a community that has lost hope."
Artist Mitch Cope did not think of his hometown as a worthy palette when he was growing up, but during a brief western sojourn for graduate school, he could think only of projects that would improve Detroit.
In 2005, he and his wife, Gina Reichert, bought a home in the city for less than $2,000 and transformed the ramshackle property into a brightly coloured artist studio that is completely off the grid, powered by solar panels. The couple now own three houses and two additional lots, and have been recruiting artists from Germany, Chicago and San Francisco with the promise of homes as cheap as $100 and the ability to work outside the system.
"They come here because they see those cities as being unmovable," he said of his friends. "You have to have a normal job in order to survive and you can't do anything a little more creative or offline."
Although Mr. Cope and his wife go about most of their work unbothered by bureaucracy, they have been given the tacit support of a city with nothing to lose. One official from the mayor's office said he could not provide funding, but would take care of any local crime. Mr. Cope sent the man a list of nearby drug houses, which were raided by police the very next day.
Having hit rock bottom, Detroit is game to try something new, and there is a willingness to partner with artists that does not exist in other cities.
For years, the maze of buildings that make up the Russell Industrial Center sat empty, more than a million square feet of industrial space that once housed an auto-body supplier owned by Henry and Leona Helmsley. In the early 2000s, a new owner tried to find a manufacturer to move in, before realizing he could fill the space by renting individual studios to local artists. The centre is now home to photographers and musicians, film studios and architects, glassblowers and graphic designers.
Individual artists are not the only ones who see creativity as a means to improve Detroit's lot. Large-scale cultural projects have also been drawing attention to the city, and helping to establish its reputation on the international art scene.
The Detroit Institute of Art was renovated in 2007, receiving an additional 77,000 square feet to house its billion-dollar collection. The Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit opened in 2006 in a former car dealership, and the Kresge Foundation, a local philanthropic force, has begun issuing grants to 18 individual artists each year. A group called Detroit Renaissance has poured $50-million into the Creative Corridor project, which will fund artistic endeavours down Woodward Avenue, the city's downtown thoroughfare.
And last year, the College for Creative Studies took over General Motors' former engineering and design building, giving it a $145-million renovation to create a secondary campus, which houses undergraduate design programs as well as an art-focused charter school. In 2009, the college experienced its highest enrolment numbers to date.
"I think there's a very strong recognition of the role of art in moving the transformation along," said Mr. Rogers.
He believes Detroit is following in the footsteps of places such as the SoHo neighbourhood of New York and Berlin, where artists moved into the void left by industry and created vibrant communities.
But, for the transformation to flourish, Mr. Rogers warns that artists cannot feel co-opted by the redevelopment movement. "To some extent, artists prefer to operate outside," he said. "As soon as the mainstream recognizes them, it's over and they move on elsewhere."
The city's pull shows no sign of waning. Mr. Cope says he receives daily correspondence from artists around the world inquiring about the city, and how they can buy a house for less than $1,000. He encourages them all to come, but he takes a skeptical view of those who arrive without a community-improvement angle. He views The Ice House and Object Orange as dilettante excursions into the city by artists with no real message or motive. And he hopes Detroit draws creative minds who want to improve the city's portfolio, as well as their own.
"Instead of doing something that results in getting a house torn down, why don't you do something that results in a house being fixed up?" he said. "It's an end not a beginning."
And he is sure to warn his friends that Detroit is not an easy place to live. Yes, you can take over whole neighbourhoods as a canvas for your work, but finding a decent cup of coffee is not so easy. That said, he is glad Detroit is now being seen as an artistic draw.
"It's okay to be romantic about it," he said. "For a long time, people just wanted to get away from here."

Full text: Forty years later, Jimi Hendrix is about to release a new album. That's cool. But did you know he attended Grade 1 in Vancouver?
Forty years after his untimely death at 27, Jimi Hendrix's musical legacy continues to thrive.
"In two years, Jimi would have been 70," reflects his stepsister Janie Hendrix, president and CEO of Seattle-based Experience Hendrix, which safeguards the singer/guitarist's legacy for an estate worth over $80-million (U.S.). She adds, "That's hard to imagine."
Hendrix's catalogue sells about 1.2 million units annually worldwide. His songs have been recorded by Eric Clapton, John Mayer, Paul McCartney, Sheryl Crow and Bob Dylan in recent years.
"People are still interested in picking up Jimi Hendrix's catalogue," reports Ken Kirkwood, director of purchasing at HMV Canada, which operates 128 stores. "Without any new releases last year, his catalogue sold a bit less than Bob Dylan's and half of what the Rolling Stones sell. That's still pretty big."
"The older fans are now teaching the younger generation about him," says Janie. "We now have pre-teens wanting Jimi's music."
Under a new eight-year licensing deal between Experience Hendrix and Sony Music Entertainment, the album Valleys of Neptune is being released worldwide March 9th. Produced by Janie Hendrix, John McDermott and Jimi's former engineer Eddie Kramer, it features 12 previously unreleased studio recordings by the Jimi Hendrix Experience band.
"The tapes were in excellent shape ... we didn't have to 'bake' any tapes or get into any extensive restoration," says McDermott. "Everything we needed was right there."
Valleys of Neptune chronicles a turbulent period for Hendrix in mid-1969 as the Experience was developing songs for an album left uncompleted when the group lost its bassist, Noel Redding. (Redding died in 2003.) Hendrix then recruited an army buddy, Billy Cox. "There was a real shift in the music," says McDermott. "This record captures that shift."
Interviewing the Experience backstage at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver in 1968 for CBC-TV, Terry David Mulligan was startled when Hendrix asked, "Do they still have Dawson Annex School here? I used to go there ... My grandmother, her boyfriend and my cousins are out there. I haven't seen them yet. I will see them later on tonight."
"I couldn't believe it," says Mulligan, now host of Mulligan Stew for the CKUA radio station in Edmonton. "The marketing of the Jimi Hendrix Experience had been out of London. Nobody made the connection between Seattle and Vancouver with him."
Jimi's father Al Hendrix was, in fact, born in Vancouver in 1919. His parents, Zenora "Nora" Moore and Bertram Philander Ross Hendrix, were vaudeville performers who had moved there in 1912 after their Dixieland troupe had disbanded in Seattle. All four of their children were born in Vancouver. In 1922, Ross and Nora Hendrix became Canadian citizens.
Ross Hendrix worked as a steward in two of Vancouver's most prestigious private clubs, the American Club and the Transportation Club of Vancouver, before becoming first porter at the newly opened Quilchena Golf & Country Club in Richmond, B.C., in 1925. He held this position until his death in 1934.
Following their father's death, the Hendrix children went in separate directions. After a few years of attempting to find regular work in Vancouver and Victoria, Al moved to Seattle, where he married Lucille Jeter on March 31, 1942. Jimi was born later that year on Nov. 27.
While much of her family came to resettle in Seattle, Nora Hendrix remained in Vancouver where she was a well-known figure in the city's black community. She helped form the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Vancouver's first black church.
Jimi had a close relationship with his grandmother Nora. His parents had divorced when he was 9; and his mother died in 1958 at age 32. Jimi often stayed with Nora in her home on East Georgia Street. He attended Grade 1 at Sir William Dawson Annex in Vancouver's West End.
"Jimi stayed with grandma because my dad was working such long hours," says Janie. "It was hard for him to be there for Jimi. He didn't want him to be a latchkey kid."
After a one-year stint in the U.S. Army in 1961, Jimi often visited Vancouver, playing as a sideman in local clubs, including Dante's Inferno with Tommy Chong's band, Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers.
After Jimi's death, Al Hendrix continued taking his family to visit Nora. "Every other weekend, we were in Vancouver," recalls Janie. "We went to the PNE, rode around the bus for a dime all day long, and went to Chinatown."
Overseeing Jimi Hendrix's legacy is a massive task. Janie Hendrix, adopted by Al Hendrix in 1968 when he married her mother, has drawn unfavourable comparisons to John Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono. Janie laughs, "The evil one, right? Without me, my dad would have signed away everything."
The estate has been involved in conflicts for decades. "It is kind of like the Kennedy family curse; this is the Hendrix curse," says Janie.
Two years ago, Janie was sued unsuccessfully by Jimi's younger brother, Leon Hendrix, Leon's children and seven other members of the Hendrix family, who claimed Janie schemed for years to have Leon cut from Al Hendrix's will.
Many of the estate's legal wrangles can be traced to 1966, when Jimi Hendrix appointed Yameta, a Bahamas-based company operated by British nightclub owner Michael Jeffery and producer Chas Chandler (bassist of the Animals), to be his manager; and he granted the company exclusive rights to his performances.
Legal tangles would ensue after Jeffery was killed in 1973 in a mid-air collision over Nantes, France, while aboard an Iberia Airlines DC-9.
At the time of Hendrix's death on Sept. 18, 1970, in London, a coroner recorded an open verdict, stating that the cause was "barbiturate intoxication, and inhalation of vomit."
However, details about Jimi Hendrix's death have remained in dispute for decades. In 2009, there were even reports in the U.K. media about allegations that Jeffery had murdered Jimi Hendrix by plying him with pills and a bottle of wine.
"I remember hearing about all of these conspiracy theories when I was a kid," says Janie. "They were really heartbreaking for my father."
She recalls the immediate effect of Jimi's death on the family. "My dad was 50, and he loses his 27-year-old child. So we had to ship Jimi's body back. Jimi had a studio in New York (Electric Ladyland) but it still owed [mortgage payments]. Jimi wrecked two cars, and they were in the auto shop. Now dad flies back from London [where Jimi died] to New York to gather his things up. He's distraught. His son died. It was a very hard time.
"Do I know if he was murdered? Do I want to point fingers today? Well, [almost] every person that was involved with Jimi is dead now. There's no way of us proving if it is true or not."
After Jimi's death, a friend put Al Hendrix in touch with Leo Branton, Jr., a celebrated Los Angeles-based civil-rights litigator, and entertainment attorney. A handshake between the two led to Branton being hired to untangle the various contracts Jimi had signed and to oversee his musical legacy. Al Hendrix would receive $50,000 (U.S.) annually.
"My dad was an eighth-grade graduate," says Janie. "He had his own gardening business and had a great clientele. His son dies with this massive estate. My dad didn't know anything about the music business."
In 1993, Al Hendrix filed suit in federal court in Seattle against Branton as well as the Bella Godiva, Inherit, Elber and Are You Experienced companies. He charged that Branton had wrongly transferred Jimi Hendrix's assets to the co-defendant companies. In 1995, a settlement was reached that transferred ownership of all Hendrix musical works to Al Hendrix. He died in 2002 leaving Janie Hendrix in control of Jimi's heritage.
Since 1995, Jimi Hendrix's catalogue has been continuously issued under the officially sanctioned Experience Hendrix and Dagger Records imprints.
Also being released on March 9 are CD/DVD versions of the Experience albums, Are You Experienced?, Axis: Bold As Love, Electric Ladyland and First Rays of the New Rising Sun.

Full text:   The real problem in the GTA is not enough new houses
tbelford@globeandmail.com
***
There may be a perfect price storm brewing in the housing market of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Especially affected will be both new and resale homesl - all those detached and semi-detached houses and townhouses families look for. Federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty suggested the possibility when he announced changes to residential mortgages in mid-February. But he took only small steps toward reducing demand.
Mr. Flaherty's most significant move was to say that from mid-April on anyone seeking a mortgage at a rock-bottom variable rate had to prove they could afford payments on a five-year fixed-rate mortgage. Truth be told, for the past three or four months many lenders had already demanded that people looking for variable-rate mortgages qualify for the higher three-year fixed-rate ones, mortgage brokers say.
Brokers have also been advising clients that even if they get a variable-rate mortgage, they should make payments at the three-year fixed-rate level. That advice serves two goals: It pays down the mortgage faster and cushions borrowers against anticipated increases in interest rates.
Mr. Flaherty ignored the real problem, which in the GTA is the supply of houses.
There's no point in marginally reducing demand if the supply is not there. Continued high demand coupled with extraordinarily low supply mean prices will shoot up faster than dandelions after a spring rain.
Let me explain. Normally we would go into a new year with anywhere between 20,000 and 22,000 new homes in the GTA waiting for buyers. This year, there are just 7,400, according to RealNet Canada Inc., which tracks the market. This means anyone looking for a new family home has an extraordinarily small supply to choose from. But if you need a home, with mortgage rates still at historic lows, it continues to seem a great time to buy.
So, you look at resales, which is exactly what a record number of buyers did in the first six weeks of this year. Jason Mercer, the Toronto Real Estate Board's senior manager of market analysis, says the period between Jan. 1 and Feb. 15 set a new record - 8,464 resale home change hand, up a whopping 81 per cent from last year.
Listings were up 15 per cent as well; that number was 6,212. As people saw the prices their neighbours were getting, they decided to join the rush, sell and move up, down or sideways.
The result? Resale house prices in the GTA rose 18 per cent from the same period last year. The average resale price is now $417,915, which incidentally puts them solidly above the $400,000 ceiling for exemption from the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), due to come into effect July 1.
So the result of the small supply of new houses is huge pressure on resales and therefore a likely continuation of big price jumps.
"I think for the next six months at least the resale market will be the strongest game in town," says Cam Forbes, director of operations and a broker at Royal LePage Real Estate Services Inc. "Mid-year will be the telling point; I don't know if demand will continue at this level. "But if it does then the situation will indeed be worrisome."
Mr. Forbes and Mr. Mercer suggest that if interest rates rise as predicted - perhaps to the 5 per cent level - that will take some people out of the market, and yet the ones most affected are likely to be the young just starting careers whose chief interest is small, affordable downtown condos, not houses anyway.
The HST may also have an effect since, it will effectively drive up the price of all housing over that $400,000 mark.
But what the GTA really needs is a healthy supply of new low-rise homes and that rests largely in the hands of municipal politicians not builders.
The whole lengthy process of getting approval for new developments came almost full stop last spring in the wake of the global recession. Builders shelved plans for new developments until they could see signs that the GTA was starting to recover. By summer when demand came back strong they had lost half a year.
At the same time, local municipalities had started rethinking whether they indeed wanted new subdivisions, and for those already in the works, they boosted development charges, which have become a handy back-door way of raising municipal revenues without much public outcry.
As Stephen Dupuis, president of BILD, the home builders' association, points out, between 2001 and 2009, municipal charges on new development rose by 134 per cent, which is about four times greater than house prices rose during the same period.
It is indeed a gloomy picture. But unless we start focusing on the issues of supply and affordability, the GTA could be headed for trouble.

Builders on the beach

Author: Belford, Terrence

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/builders-on-beach/docview/382582564/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "It is really the perfect location," says Mr. [Joe Brennan], who previously partnered with Mr. [David Kosoy] on building a restaurant at the nearby Sandy Port, run by David Battle, who formerly managed the restaurants at Holt Renfrew. "There is no vehicular traffic; access is either by private water taxi or the walking path which connects with everything to the east. You can be all alone on your own private beach and then walk over for a coffee at Starbucks in 10 minutes," he says.

Full text:   Canadian developers are flocking to the Bahamas to feed a growing demand for luxury sand-side digs
What is the latest thing on the wish list of very rich Canadians? It is not the newest high-end Mercedes or even that $300,000 Rolls-Royce or Bentley. Nor is it a penthouse in one of Toronto's growing crop of ultra-luxury condominiums. They probably already have both.
What seems to be hot right now is a winter - or even year-round - mini-palace in the Bahamas: Places on or near the beach with price tags that start at $5-million (U.S.) and run up from there.
If you have any doubts, look at Ocean Club Estates on Paradise Island, just east of Atlantis and a short ferry ride or drive from Nassau. Canadians now own an estimated 30 per cent of the 90 $4-million to $20-million homes there, according to local sources.
That puts them above sun-seeking Brits, who are estimated to own 20 per cent of these astonishing homes. U.S. citizens own 20 per cent and Bahamians about 10 per cent. Various continental Europeans own the balance.
The demand for ultra-high-end homes has reached the stage where some vastly experienced Canadian real-estate developers have launched projects targeting what appears to be a growing number of very wealthy Canadians who prefer the lifestyle the Bahamas offers to more mundane choices such as Palm Beach, Fla., or any other North American sunspot.
Alexis Nihon, grandson of the Montreal developer of the same name, has launched Serenity Point on Great Abaco, where his company Anco Lands Ltd. is offering 24 building lots, ranging in price from $500,000 on the ridge overlooking the ocean to $850,000 for a chunk of land right on the beach.
In Nassau, Joe Brennan and Daniel Greenglass of Toronto's J.F. Brennan Design/Build, in partnership with David Kosoy, chairman of the Sterling companies, are developing The Beach Club Villas - five large, two-storey homes - on the former Charlie Chaplin Estate on Paradise Island, just west of Atlantis.
Why this sudden interest in the Bahamas, that chain of 130 large and small islands just off the coast of south Florida? Two chief reasons, say the developers: lifestyle and taxes.
Taxes first: Anyone who qualifies as a resident from Canada or several European countries under taxation laws in both the Bahamas and their own home country are exempt from income taxes on money earned in the Bahamas. Perhaps even more important, they are exempt from taxes on interest income from most places in the world, says Mr. Kosoy, who is now a Bahamian resident himself.
As for lifestyle, Mr. Brennan, who has had an office in Palm Beach as well as Toronto for almost two decades, says Florida's sparkle has been tarnished for the very well-to-do.
"It has become so commercial," he says. "The Bahamas, however, offers the lifestyle you could enjoy in Florida 40 years ago. You can have a home right on the beach and enjoy some seclusion not surrounded by traffic."
The two projects - Beach Club Villas and Serenity Point - are as different as the icy-clear sparkle of diamonds from the warm green depths of emeralds. Serenity Point represents the latter.
A bit of history here. Mr. Nihon's grandfather moved to Nassau in the 1960s. Born in Belgium, the elder Mr. Nihon immigrated to Canada at 18. In 1946, when he was 44, he started Corporation Alexis Nihon, which is now publicly traded as Alexis Nihon REIT. It owns the huge Place Alexis Nihon in Montreal among other holdings.
He saw enormous potential in Great Abaco, his grandson says, and in 1962 started buying up large chunks of land, mainly in the south end of the island; today, the family owns about 2,000 acres, Until recently, however, the family just did not think the potential for development was there. Now, however, following a decade of unprecedented wealth creation, there may be tens of thousands of people with enough money - and weary of the options Florida offers - to make development of luxury communities possible.
Anco Lands, the family company, has sold 270 acres to a Bahamian venture that is developing Schooner Bay Village on the adjacent Old Fort Bay. The site will eventually offer not just homes and villas, but also 50 retail shops and a new medical centre.
Serenity Point and its 24 building lots, which range from 21,000 to 72,000 square feet, will have its own private beach club with an infinity pool, tennis courts and change rooms. Each home will have its own solar-powered golf cart with which to run around the 40-acre gated community or visit the shops at Schooner Bay next door.
Each home also has access to all the bells and whistles the rich depend upon, such as concierge service, personal chefs, yacht rentals, fishing charters and inter-island expeditions.
"What we expect to see is a mixed group of people building winter residences, and those planning to live here to enjoy that tax-free status," he says. "Happily, right now, we are getting strong interest from Canada, mainly from Toronto and Montreal."
Where Serenity Point offers a respite from the hurly burly of city life, The Beach Club Villas on Paradise Island combine the amenities of a major tourist destination with the seclusion of a community flanked by private estates with only a walking path connecting it to the rest of Paradise Island. In fact, access is by private water-taxi service provided round the clock by the management company for the club.
The property is just two acres, but it stretches from the ocean to the channel between Paradise Island and the mainland. It's flanked to the west by Mr. Kosoy's home, which used to be long to the late actor Sir Richard Harris, and and to the east by the home of actor Nicholas Cage.
When completed, there will be two homes facing the harbour and three right on the ocean. Prices range from $1,500 a square foot for the harbour homes to $1,700 a square foot for the three on the ocean, according to Mr. Greenglass.
Sizes start at 2,990 square feet and go right up to 4,985 square feet. Anyone fortunate enough to take the ferry from Paradise Island to Nassau proper can see work under way on the private dock being built to serve the club.
"It is really the perfect location," says Mr. Brennan, who previously partnered with Mr. Kosoy on building a restaurant at the nearby Sandy Port, run by David Battle, who formerly managed the restaurants at Holt Renfrew. "There is no vehicular traffic; access is either by private water taxi or the walking path which connects with everything to the east. You can be all alone on your own private beach and then walk over for a coffee at Starbucks in 10 minutes," he says.
The Beach Club Villas take the level of service at Serenity Point quite a few steps higher. This is a community where the management company arranges everything. Call ahead and a complete staff of cooks, maids and butlers will be waiting. Need groceries? The management company will dispatch that water taxi and a personal shopper to the stores in town.
Want a place to moor that yacht? The club also offers moorings for boats up to 40 metres in length.
The idea for the Beach Club Villas came after Mr. Kosoy's success developing luxury homes at the Ocean Club Estates. While there were originally 119 lots available, that number is down to about 10, Mr. Kosoy says. The Ocean Club Estates boast owners such as Michael Jordan and Gary Sheffield.
"There is an increasing number of high-net-worth Canadians now looking for an alternative to Florida," says Mr. Kosoy, who for many years ran both his U.S. and Canadian real-estate holdings from Palm Beach. "I moved here because I like the lifestyle a lot better.
"Access from Canada is much easier now than to the U.S. because of recent security measures. Four different airlines fly non-stop."
Will there be more projects like The Beach Club?
"The challenge is going to be finding suitable sites," he says. "What we have on Paradise Island is that perfect combination of seclusion and yet ready access to everything that makes life here so great."

Full text:   The ultra-green athletes village came in on time but way over budget. How much will the units fetch once the party is over?
The man responsible for salvaging any profit from Vancouver's financially troubled Olympic athletes village - and saving local taxpayers from potential losses - is euphoric these days.
"Those opening ceremonies - that should add $25 a square foot to what I can get at the village," Bob Rennie says gleefully over lunch on the third day of the Games, as the street below the restaurant ran thick with thousands of 2010 Olympic Games tourists. Mr. Rennie, officially known as the city's best-known condo marketer but unofficially as one of the city's major power brokers, is kidding, as he often does. Well, sort of.
The reality is that many are hoping there's an element of truth in Mr. Rennie's humour.
Among them are brothers Peter and Shahram Malek who run Millennium Developments and who pledged $70-million of their assets to keep the athletes village project going when their financing started to collapse at the beginning of the recession. Another group is the City of Vancouver, which is owed almost $200-million for the land and was forced to loan the Maleks $800-million for their construction refinancing.
Both are depending on a healthy real-estate market to recoup the village's $1-billion cost. It would be a relief if the reflected glory from the Olympics would make a difference once the athletes go home.
Certainly the village, after a year of rocky news coverage, has been basking in the Olympic glow. A recent New York Times Magazine essay on the Games by Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff was accompanied by a picture worthy of an architecture magazine. The site looked like a modernist marvel on the water. Television shots frequently highlight it. Media outlets report that athletes love it.
And, amid the frenzy of the Games, the village, as part of the city's Southeast False Creek district, received LEED Platinum certification, making it the greenest neighbourhood in North America.
The question is: Will that make a difference? And will it be enough given the circumstances of the village's finances and the current state of the market?
Many are dubious.
"The problem with Millennium is their costs," says Cameron McNeill, another major development marketer who points out that the village was built at the peak of prices for labour and materials. "Will the market bear the $1,100 a square foot they need? I think that's stretching it. I think it's going to be extremely difficult for them to recoup their costs."
Mr. McNeill, the head of MAC Marketing Solutions, is selling a building across the street from the village, the James. He's pricing it in the $700-a-square-foot range. That's the average price Mr. Rennie got for the first 250 village condos before the crash.
It means the remaining 500 condos have to sell for much more on average for the project to break even. Although Mr. McNeill believes in the long-term benefit of the Games and agrees the city made the right move by taking over the village's finances to make sure it was completed, he can't see how the remaining condos will fetch those prices.
Development consultant Michael Geller, who recently oversaw the planning of Simon Fraser University's UniverCity project, said the athletes village project will likely sell at prices high enough to recover the $800-million in construction costs. "But I am worried about the city recovering the $193-million it was supposed to get for its land."
University of British Columbia business professor Tsur Somerville said that extensive research has provided zero evidence that Games cities experience real-estate booms after the tourists go home.
"I don't deny that there are going to be some purchasers who like the Olympics and say, 'I want to buy something in Vancouver.' That exists but it's not enough to move the whole market," Mr. Somerville says.
The Olympic athletes village was never meant to have these problems. For a decade before the Olympics, the neighbourhood - industrial waterfront land the city had slowly acquired over the years - had been planned as a showcase environmental district, a place that would pioneer the latest in green building technology, urban agriculture, innovative energy systems and more.
Vancouver committed itself to building an athletes village there as part of the Vancouver-Whistler bid in the late 1990s and promised to use $30-million of federal money contributed for a Games legacy to build social housing into it.
A new set of left-wing councillors elected in 2002 wanted to see the village's sustainability enhanced by having a good social mix - one-third market condos, one-third "affordable" housing, one-third social housing.
That aim was scaled back when a more right-wing council was elected in 2005, but the idea of having the village as a green showcase remained. As a result the Maleks, even after paying a then-record price for the city's land, came under extraordinary pressure from city planners to make the village as green as possible.
They complied, building eight blocks worth of buildings with rooftop gardens, energy-efficient heating systems and materials, rainwater collectors, grey water-recycling systems and more. But those efforts, along with rising construction prices, made their costs soar. By October of 2008, they were $150-million over budget and their financing agency, the New York hedge fund Fortress Investments, stopped providing monthly advances.
The city had to step in, first with some of the monthly payments and then, in February of 2009, by taking over the financing completely.
Now the city, which reverted back to a centre-left council in 2008, finds itself in the same position as any caught-by-the-crash speculator, hoping that market prices will rise enough to make the real-estate bet pay off.
Mr. Rennie believes what will ultimately work in the village's favour are the fundamentals of real estate: supply and demand.
(Although the developers will have to add some financial sweeteners to make the math work over all. They're expected to sell off the retail spaces that occupy the lower parts of some buildings, rather than continuing to lease them out. And they'll also likely have to sell another 110 rental apartments, on top of the 750 condos.)
Realistically, Mr. Rennie doesn't expect demand to shoot up because of the Olympics. But he does expect it to be strong for the same reasons it always has been in Vancouver. People do want to move here.
The supply-side picture is strong, too. "Any oversupply from the hype of the Games is gone. Thousands of developments went on hold or were shelved," he says.
Although developers are now starting to put themselves in gear again, the village has one advantage. In a city where buyers are often forced to buy units by looking only at plans and model suites, which often don't match reality, the village is built.
As for the Olympic glow? Will it help him sell the unit where gold-medal snowboarder Alexandre Bilodeau once slept?
"We are a brand society and Vancouver doesn't have a lot of legendary addresses," Mr. Rennie says. "It doesn't necessarily add value, but it makes choosing between here and down the block easier."

Abstract: When [Chuck Peterson] died in 2000, the fate of his Stokely empire fell into limbo. European logging company Astina Forest AG acquired much of the estate, and in 2007, long-time [Stokely] skiers Gaylen and Susan Byker of Grand Rapids, Mich., bought the lodge and partnered with Astina and the Algoma Highlands Conservancy to maintain Peterson's trails.

Full text:   With 120 kilometres of trails, Lake Superior vistas and a cozy lodge, it's no wonder this resort is a North American favourite
Every Friday at noon, all winter long, Gary Oak slips out of his office at an Ann Arbor, Mich., information technology firm, gets behind the wheel of his car and merges onto the Interstate. The traffic thins and the surrounding forest thickens as he drives north, eventually crossing the border at Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., and entering the Canadian Shield country northeast of Lake Superior. Six hours of driving later, Oak steps out of his vehicle and onto his cross-country skis for a couple of days of kicking and gliding in his favourite place in the world.
For three decades, Oak has spent nearly every winter weekend at Stokely Creek Lodge, a Nordic ski resort in the community of Goulais River, Ont., 30 kilometres north of Sault Ste. Marie. Over the years, he has watched Stokely's 3,400 hectares and 120 kilometres of groomed trails gradually morph from a small, secret hideaway to one of Canada's best cross-country skiing destinations. Though he still comes north to ski his heart out, Oak no longer spends his nights at Stokely bivouacked in the parking lot to save money. Like the growing number of other skiers who make the pilgrimage, he indulges in the lodge's gourmet cuisine and Scandinavian-style accommodations.
Stokely has been ripe with legendary characters, including Norm Bourgeois, a local who served tea, cookies and tall tales to skiers at his backwoods cabin to the age of 88 (Bourgeois, 94, died earlier this month), and famed cross-country skier Herman (Jackrabbit) Johanssen, who was 108 years old when he visited Stokely. Oak's ironman persona follows the example of the late Chuck Peterson, the resort's American founder who spent years combing the wilderness of Northern Ontario in search of a cross-country mecca. "You need a tremendous variety of terrain and very skillfully designed trails to bring Nordic skiing into its own," Peterson reportedly said.
He found ample space, topography and well over four metres of annual snowfall in the Algoma Highlands northeast of Lake Superior and recruited Hakon Lein, a Norwegian Canadian from Sault Ste. Marie, to help him plan a network of trails. Peterson established the Stokely Creek Ski Touring Centre in 1977. He commissioned an Ann Arbor architect to design a series of angular, red-trimmed and cedar-sided buildings to be erected in the valley of the area's namesake creek.
Oak remembers Stokely's first lodge manager shuttling patrons' overnight gear by dogsled along the snowy 500-metre corridor between the parking lot and the secluded enclave. Guests today face the same introduction to Stokely, though snowmobiles have replaced huskies for hauling luggage.
On a crisp, sunny Saturday in February, I planned a 25-kilometre ski on the Peterson, Trapper's and Pickard Lake trails. Groomed trails radiate in all directions from the lodge into otherwise undeveloped terrain. I followed an undulating plateau and then traced the shoreline of Bone Lake, where a waft of wood smoke lured me to Bourgeois' ramshackle cabin.
When Peterson died in 2000, the fate of his Stokely empire fell into limbo. European logging company Astina Forest AG acquired much of the estate, and in 2007, long-time Stokely skiers Gaylen and Susan Byker of Grand Rapids, Mich., bought the lodge and partnered with Astina and the Algoma Highlands Conservancy to maintain Peterson's trails. This past fall, the conservancy, which had already acquired Norm's Cabin, purchased 570-metre King Mountain (one of the highest summits in Ontario), giving nearly one-third of Stokely's trail network permanent protection.
The buzz at Norm's Cabin today is around conservancy plans to preserve its new property for "silent sports" such as skiing, mountain biking and hiking, and to use it in partnership with the Canadian Forest Service and area schools for ecological research and environmental education. A warming hut on King Mountain has been refurbished and a new 6.5-kilometre-long snowshoe trail switchbacks from the lodge to the peak, offering guests sweeping views of Lake Superior and another way to explore the backcountry. Several trails circling the summit have also been improved and track-set for classical skiing.
Later on, over appetizers in the clubhouse building, Oak says the future of Stokely is as bright as ever - because of the successful King Mountain campaign and the passion and commitment of the Bykers, who made "significant" financial contributions to its purchase. "They're the real heroes," he says. "They want this place saved for their grandchildren to enjoy."
Meanwhile, Stokely's kitchen staff is doing much to satisfy the current generation. Dinner consists of winter vegetable soup, pork tenderloin, sweet potatoes and vegetables, followed by apple cake and custard. Millions of stars speckle the night sky as I walked from the dining area to my room in the Ottawa Chalet. The absence of television and telephones defines the après-ski atmosphere at Stokely; options for entertainment include table tennis in the lodge games room, a sauna, or fireside reading in the overstocked library.
Inspired by the AHC's recent success and fuelled by a hearty breakfast, I spent the morning of my second day ascending 200 metres and then beelining down the rolling, three-kilometre-long King Mountain Run. After lunch, I hit the trails once again for a high-intensity skate-ski around Walker and Evans lakes and over the crest of Jackrabbit Hill. In a weekend, I've barely scratched the surface of the area's trails and crossed paths with only a handful of other skiers - even though the lodge's 25 rooms are nearly all full.
I think I've also figured out Stokely's cult-like following. Every Sunday, Oak says, there's only one thing he can think about: "I can't wait to come back next weekend."

Full text:   Other venues explored for prosecuting alleged mastermind after New Yorkers balk at cost and disruption
When word came down from Washington in November that the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks would stand trial in Manhattan, New York's mayor hailed the plan as just right.
"It is fitting that 9/11 suspects face justice near the World Trade Center site where so many New Yorkers were murdered," Michael Bloomberg said.
Less than three months later, Mr. Bloomberg had a change of heart. "It's going to cost an awful lot of money and disturb an awful lot of people," he said last month. Later he made his meaning plain: "Would I prefer that they did it elsewhere? Yes."
Getting the alleged plotters of the 9/11 attacks inside a courtroom was never going to be easy, but the way things have unravelled in New York is a warning of just how complicated it will be.
Lofty principles have degenerated into tussles over what the trial would cost and whose lives would be disturbed, not to mention its effect on property values. Faced with backroom lobbying and grassroots pressure, Mr. Bloomberg and other New York officials executed a hasty U-turn.
That has forced the Obama administration back to the drawing board as it seeks to try Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the self-described mastermind of the attacks, and other al-Qaeda figures now held in Guantanamo Bay.
Rather than "bring it on," New York's official position might best be described as "anywhere but here."
It didn't start out this way. Back in November, a poll found New Yorkers more or less evenly split over the prospect of holding the trials in the city. Officials began preparing a security plan for the area surrounding the courthouse, putting the tab at an estimated $75-million (U.S.).
One of New York's pugnacious tabloids, the New York Daily News, slammed the government for choosing a civilian trial rather than a military tribunal, but proclaimed the city's readiness. "Should there be an opening on a hangin' jury, it would be our pleasure to serve," noted an editorial.
Beneath the surface, however, discontent began to simmer. Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, a trade association for the property industry, said his group was upset from the get-go. It wasn't that New York wasn't capable of holding the trials, he said; what concerned him was the impact on the city's economy and quality of life.
He ticked off the likely consequences: Visitors would stay away from downtown, tenants would not sign leases, and condo owners would have trouble selling. "How many people would be ready to purchase an apartment, not knowing for two or three years if you're going to be able to walk your dog down the street?" he asked.
Throughout November and December, Mr. Spinola made a habit of intercepting members of the Obama administration on visits to New York. He buttonholed two of the President's senior staff as well as a cabinet member to express his group's concerns.
By last month, fresh details began to emerge. The cost of holding the trials in New York and the associated security measures would be far more than originally estimated, said Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. Rather than $75-million, the new NYPD analysis put the price tag at $200-million annually, repeated over several years.
Mr. Kelly also briefed a series of groups on the plan to secure the areas surrounding the courthouse. It included positioning sharpshooters on rooftops, setting up 2,000 metal barricades to influence the flow of traffic and pedestrians in the vicinity, erecting a number of watchtowers, and helicopter surveillance.
Danny Chen, who lives in an apartment building directly across the street from the courthouse and helped found a citizens group to represent residents, was at one of the briefings. "It was like a scene from Escape From New York , the 1981 sci-fi flick in which Manhattan has been transformed into a maximum-security prison, he said.
The extent of the security plan prodded local officials into action. "I almost fell off my chair," said Julie Menin, a former regulatory lawyer who chairs a community board representing lower Manhattan. She, too, originally favoured holding the trial in New York, but now began agitating full-time to prevent it.
By the middle of January, "I was working on this 24/7," she says, working the phones and setting up meetings to win over influential New Yorkers. "It was an all-out battle and I thought we had a very narrow window of opportunity."
By now, the opposition had become heated. Back at the real estate board, Mr. Spinola set up a website (movethetrial.com) through which residents could express their displeasure to elected officials. The next step: Property owners would encourage all the tenants in their buildings to visit the site.
In the end, it wasn't necessary. After Mr. Bloomberg expressed his qualms on Jan. 27, a host of other politicians rushed to say that they, too, thought having the trial in New York was ill-advised. Charles Schumer, one of New York's two senators, went further, and said it shouldn't be held anywhere in the state.
(At least one New York politician still thinks the trial should be held here. "We were all on board with it, and all of a sudden, I think, that the boys of Wall Street began to say, 'We don't want that in our neighbourhood,' " Jose Serrano, a congressman who represents the Bronx, told the New York Daily News.)
Without the support of the mayor and nearly all of New York's politicians, the Obama administration reversed course and said it would explore other venues. The bickering continues, however. Vice-President Joe Biden said in a television interview on Sunday that Mr. Bloomberg may have overestimated the costs of holding the trial, something the mayor then denied.
The trial's ballooning tab - which the federal government would cover - amounted to a "classic City Hall jam job," complained one anonymous administration official in The New Yorker magazine.
In the area around the courthouse, however, there is widespread relief that the trial will likely move elsewhere. "I'm ecstatic," says Jack Giacalone, who owns City Hall Barber Shop, which sits about two blocks from where the trial would be held. "The city was going to be a mess, and God only knows how long it would take."
Standing behind his cash register at Sam's Deli, Henry Ng looked across a small park directly at the federal courthouse. Already, he says, police in the area are on alert; last month, six officers barged in after seeing someone on the roof of his building (it was a repairman). A trial would only frighten away customers and block traffic, he worries.
"We all faced 9/11 already," said Mr. Ng, 46. "Do it somewhere else."

Abstract: In other words you can now phone 911, and say, "Hi, I think there's a worrisomely skinny guy in a hood handing out small packages to children in Al Purdy Lane." Or, "My baby carriage is wedged in Fresh Air Lane and I can't reach little Marcus." Or, you could helpfully suggest to a confused fireman fighting flames at the front of your house, "Hey! Why don't you drag a hose around through Catbird Lane and take this on from the back side, too?"

Full text:   If there is even so much as a breath of open space, it will probably get a name. Maybe the next laneway will be named after you
While leaning out into the cold morning air to collect my morning paper a few weeks ago, I noticed a concrete lamp post that had been freshly fitted with a large, shiny new street sign. The lettering - bold white against navy blue - announced the arrival of a brand new street, perpendicular to my own, called Tony Brady Lane.
The sign was topped with an arcing white backdrop embossed with the symbol of the City of Toronto, lending it an incontestable air of officialdom and grandeur. You would think that it all added up to a lovely tribute to the late Mr. Brady - his glorious career recognized at last.
And what exactly did Brady get up to in his time? Mr. Brady was a performing clown and planted forsythia in the local park. I know that because the Cabbagetown Preservation Association erected a commemorative plaque outside his former house on Wellesley Street - just like the blue plaques you see in London, noting something like, "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart lived here, and on this site wrote his first symphony at age four," but this one was a lot bigger.
The same association is behind the initiative to put up new City of Toronto street signs to name formerly anonymous laneways. The plan started slowly in 2006, but has gained momentum recently, some 52 Cabbagetown egresses dignified with official monikers.
I have spotted for example a dank, unpaved 44-inch gap between two sets of row houses that is now named Fresh Air Lane. The netherland just east of Parliament Street between Carlton and Spruce should no longer be referred to as "that hideous parking lot behind No Frills," but rather, "the intersection of Grandtoy and Exchange Lanes." We have a lane freshly anointed Goatsbeard and another called Chipping Sparrow, presumably in commemoration of the exciting local prevalence of one of the most common types of our most common bird.
And since every single newly minted city sign bears a recommendation from the Cabbagetown Preservation Association - and specifically, the Chair of their Laneway Naming and Signing Initiative, Douglas McTaggert - many of the names commemorate important figures in our very local history.
For example, we now have three lanes named for people who once owned and operated neighbourhood corner stores (Calgie, Verner and McNamara). And the Iroquois - once big around here but obviously deep into real estate freefall - now have a filthy, one-block-long pothole riddled alleyway east of Parliament to call their own. Lastly, in a convincing expression of the value we all place on poetry, a 29-inch gap between two houses on Salisbury Street now bears the label Al Purdy Lane. To be exact, Al Purdy Lane is precisely three inches narrower than the length of the mounted sign announcing that it's there.
According to the city, there is no strict minimum requirement of what constitutes a laneway. But if you must decree that ratty laneways, driveways and walkways for cats all constitute real roads, why go further and name them? According to Walter Kowalenko, city surveyor, director, city and mapping, whose department is responsible for the signs, it is an issue of safety. "The naming of lanes can assist police in responding to complaints of illegal activities in the lanes and also aid in the delivery of other emergency and routine services to a location."
In other words you can now phone 911, and say, "Hi, I think there's a worrisomely skinny guy in a hood handing out small packages to children in Al Purdy Lane." Or, "My baby carriage is wedged in Fresh Air Lane and I can't reach little Marcus." Or, you could helpfully suggest to a confused fireman fighting flames at the front of your house, "Hey! Why don't you drag a hose around through Catbird Lane and take this on from the back side, too?"
If mapping and safety were really an issue I encourage the city to number the laneways - and discreetly. As it is, the signs they are busily erecting to give Cabbagetown the look of some freshly minted suburban subdivision cost about $350 per lane. There are, by city estimate, some 3,000 unnamed laneways to go city-wide. So, if the city carries on erecting signs at the suggestion of local community organizations, ward councillors, developers and even concerned citizens, as they are apparently committed to doing, the total cost would be about $1.3-million.
This would come out of the transportation budget, which is also used from time to time for paying for useful things, like paving over potholes at $25 per. And given that my street is made up of such a lumpy mishmash of different asphalt that it looks like a patchwork quilt, I come out in favour of repaving over the right to say "I lost a wheel in a bitch of a pothole at the corner of Amelia and Swooping Swallow Way."
I suspect you do, too.

Full text:   Because make no mistake, we are being left behind by what are very exciting innovations in big city management all over the world. - Joe Berridge, urban planner, Toronto Star, Feb. 14, 2010
Just how much of this city's 4-per-cent tax hike is being wasted on your good-for-nothing garbage man? Now there's an app for that. The iWaste Smartphone App breaks down this city's $9.2-billion budget into line items guaranteed to induce fiscal rage. Just snap a photo of a municipal worker with your mobile phone and, in seconds, iWaste will give you the number of times he would have been fired in the private sector (seven); where he spent his last sick day (Casino Rama); photos of him sleeping/loafing/eating on the job; the duration of his most recent urination break (45 minutes); and a list of unintentionally hilarious union grievances ("butt getting sore," "inflatable pillow stolen").
As banks fail and bonuses get ever larger, the CEO of today doesn't have time to waste checking luggage or waiting for the hoi polloi to wedge themselves into their seats in economy. The Toronto Port Authority Board is pleased to announce a solution that promises to make Toronto the most business-travel-friendly city on the continent: the Execu-Cannon. Think of it as a giant gun that fires VPs, CFOs, bond traders - you name it! - from the Toronto Islands over upstate New York, through the Hudson Valley and into a giant net erected in Battery Park, where waiting Town Cars will whisk them to top New York restaurants to conduct vital business. (To test the Execu-Cannon, the Port Authority is offering free travel to Toronto Islands residents.)
Is your Alberta-hating roommate secretly gorging on steak fattened in an Edmonton feedlot? Finally, there are consequences to not eating local: the Locavore Score. In supermarkets all over the GTA, shoppers will be presented with a mark assessing the locality of their groceries that will be printed, in the form of a temporary tattoo, on their foreheads. Perhaps now your canvas-bag-carrying, greenhouse-gas-hating sister-in-law will think twice about buying grapes grown in Chile if it means getting pelted by locally grown tomatoes in a Loblaws parking lot.
Is the scruffy thirty-something in the Canadian Tire toque a loft-dwelling sculptor whose contrived blue-collar demeanour and gruff (if predictable) social commentary will add one more voice to the hipster harmony that is Ossington? Or is he, in fact, a Brantford meathead whose goatee is an homage to Don Cherry and who drifted over to Queen West while trying to find an Irish pub to watch an MMA match? At last, Ossington and Queen West bar owners have a new weapon in the war against 905 creep: the Hipstometer. Using complex algorithms designed by Google, this cutting-edge device analyzes such criteria as the irony of T-shirt slogans and pop-cultural facial-hair references to separate genuine downtown hipsters from suburb-dwelling imposters, allowing Queen West and Ossington to attain a level of hipster purity surpassing that of Williamsburg.
Real estate prices getting you down? Can't wait for the bubble to pop? Maybe it's time to start enjoying it. Just wave the Default Detector in front of any "sold" sign and this revolutionary device will tell you when the delirious new homeowner is going to default. That shabby two-storey craphole on the Danforth that just went for $760,000? Its new owner overpaid by $180,000. In April, 2015, her payments are going to go from $2,270 to $3,325, and a 35-year amortization means she'll only have paid off a pathetic - but totally hilarious - $60,000 in principal. Default! Hours of schadenfreude await.

Abstract: The rules state that an agent must be used throughout the entire process when selling a house on the association's trademarked database, no small thing considering that it's through MLS that an estimated 90 per cent of all sales in Canada take place. Last year more than 450,000 homes changed hands via MLS, generating billions of dollars in commissions for the association's members.

Full text: Calls to relax rules governing Multiple Listing Service are unlikely to be placated with window-dressing
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
There's little doubt the real estate industry in Canada is changing. The real question is who gets to drive the change - Canada's Competition Bureau or the Canadian Real Estate Association.
The regulator has had the trade association in its sights for three years, after the association tightened its rules around how consumers and real estate agents interact on the Multiple Listing Service.
The rules state that an agent must be used throughout the entire process when selling a house on the association's trademarked database, no small thing considering that it's through MLS that an estimated 90 per cent of all sales in Canada take place. Last year more than 450,000 homes changed hands via MLS, generating billions of dollars in commissions for the association's members.
Knowing the Bureau was losing patience, CREA's president Dale Ripplinger presented the commissioner a list of amendments last week that it felt went far enough to eliminate any concerns about monopolistic behaviour. The key change said consumers would be able to pay an agent to place a listing on the MLS, and then do their own thing the rest of the way. That means they could market their own properties, run their own open houses and negotiate their own sales terms.
More importantly, it would mean they'd be able to sidestep commissions and pay for services as they are needed.
CREA thought it went far enough, but the Competition Bureau escalated the case to the Competition Tribunal only days later, starting a legal process that could force changes regardless of CREA's objections.
The key reason? The clause contained language that still gave local real estate boards the ability to set their own rules, which could arguably render the whole amendment nothing more than a public relations exercise. What's more, CREA won't change its rules unless all of its members agree at a vote to be held in March.
The vote will go ahead next month, and the changes may just be enough to head off a fight at the Competition Tribunal. But if CREA insists on inserting clauses that give it wiggle room when setting the rules for housing sales via the MLS, chances are the Competition Bureau will be content to let the Competition Tribunal sort things out.

VANCOUVER'S GOLDEN ECONOMIC LEGACY

Author: Bouw, Brenda

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/vancouvers-golden-economic-legacy/docview/382586141/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "While the Olympics will be a boost to confidence and the mood of a lot of people in the province, it won't change the future growth trajectory of the economy, longer-term," said Jock Finlayson, executive vice-president of the Business Council of British Columbia. "That's putting too much weight on the shoulders of the event."

Full text: With hotels sold out and visitors spending, the city's economy is set to explode during the next few weeks. But Vancouver's business community is aiming for a different kind of global first: Turning the billion-dollar sports spectacle into a vehicle for long-term financial growth Brenda Bouw reports. Page 5
Games organizers have promised lasting benefits - a rarity for host cities. Other venues have failed to initiate a post-Olympic business plan, they say
DEVELOPMENT
What's in store for a post-Olympic Vancouver? Mayor Gregor Robertson has already started making his pitch. He and fellow mayors from across the region are hosting 100 executives from 70 international companies throughout the Winter Games with a clear motive: Get them to open an office in Greater Vancouver.
MARKETING
Elena Rivera MacGregor, creator of the Inukshuk design that won the Vancouver Games' logo competition, is hoping the marketing mania accompanying the Winter Games inspires many companies to rebrand. She says winning the logo competition in 2005 hasn't generated as much business for her company as she anticipated.
REAL ESTATE
The end of the Games will lead to higher commercial and industrial vacancy rates as dozens of companies and national organizations move out - bad news for landlords already hurt by the recession. Avison Young industrial real estate broker Michael Farrell calls it a tenants' opportunity 'that we have not seen in several years.'
TOURISM
Tourism officials are planning an aggressive attack on Winter Games visitors to ensure they are motivated to return. The city's Convention Centre expansion and a 53% jump in hotel bookings for the rest of this year over 2009 bode well for Graeme Benn of Fairmont Hotels, which has four properties in the downtown area.
REAL ESTATE
Retailers are eyeing the Winter Olympics as an opportunity to reinvigorate sales after the recession. While most people want snow during the sporting spectacle, Vancouver Umbrella president Shana Hochfelder, whose company is licensed to sell its products with the official 2010 Olympic logo, is praying for rain.
*****
Among the hundreds of thousands of spectators and participants pouring through the Vancouver area for the 2010 Winter Olympics, some 10,000 employees of security firm Contemporary Services Corp. are working to make the event run as smoothly as possible.
When the Games are over and the athletes go home, most of the CSC's staff will leave as well. But staying behind will be about 420 part-time and full-time employees, along with a new Canadian headquarters for the Los Angeles company.
"We're very excited that we've had the opportunity to leverage the Games in Vancouver ... and leave a legacy here," says Stephen Mirabile, president of CSC's Canadian division.
That legacy is one example of a major promise Olympic organizers have made for the Vancouver Games: economic benefits that last for years after the last medals are handed out.
Vancouver's economy is certain to explode while the Games are on. Hotels have long been sold out and visitors are spending heavily in restaurants and shops. But whether the billions of dollars spent leading up to the Games and the global spotlight on Vancouver translate into a long-term boost for the local economy remains a crucial unknown.
Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson has already started his post-Olympic pitch. He and mayors from across the region are hosting 100 executives from 70 international companies throughout the Games with a clear motive: Get them to open an office in Greater Vancouver.
It's a strategy borrowed from the 2000 Sydney Games.
"Our broad objective as a city is to put Vancouver on a global map," Mr. Robertson says. He hopes foreign companies involved in growth areas such as clean technology and digital media will set up operations in Vancouver.
Making Vancouver a bigger international destination will translate into more jobs, better business opportunities, increased tourism dollars and improved infrastructure, officials say.
But creating lasting economic energy from the Olympics is a big challenge, and something few other host cities have pulled off. Economists point to historical data showing Olympic cities see a short-term economic bump after the event, but then ease back into their regular economic routine within months.
Vancouver organizers scoff at such data. To them, it's just research used to create a new and improved post-Olympic business strategy.
What's been missing in past Olympics is an aggressive post-Games push, according to Tourism Vancouver.
"Where there was often a fault was in the post-Olympic messaging," said Steve Pearce, vice-president of leisure travel and digital marketing for the tourism agency. "Our challenge will be to be in the marketplace afterwards in an aggressive way, remind them of our relevance and ask them for our business."
CSC's Mr. Mirabile said strong economic growth forecasts for Vancouver in the years ahead - 4.5 per cent this year, 3.8 per cent in 2011 and 4.1 per cent in 2012 - were part of the security company's decision to stick around.
But many economists say Vancouver's future growth numbers, which are above the national average, have more to do with the overall recovery than the Winter Games themselves.
"While the Olympics will be a boost to confidence and the mood of a lot of people in the province, it won't change the future growth trajectory of the economy, longer-term," said Jock Finlayson, executive vice-president of the Business Council of British Columbia. "That's putting too much weight on the shoulders of the event."
Bank of Montreal economist Doug Porter said a review of past Games in Calgary and Montreal shows a small positive impact on jobs and retail sales "which soon wears off."
"Perhaps the most significant impact of the Games on the B.C. economy will be the long-term positives from the upgraded infrastructure and from any halo effect of what will essentially be a 17-day advertisement for the region - and that is nearly impossible to quantify."
The most popular infrastructure projects to come out of the Olympic economic movement include a tripling in size of the convention centre, upgrades to the Sea-to-Sky highway connecting Vancouver to Whistler, and the Canada Line rapid transit route from downtown to the city's airport, the first such link of its kind in Canada.
"Those infrastructure projects are by far the most important things" to come out of the Games, said University of British Columbia Professor James Brander. "That's where the real money is."
Prof. Brander said the only "bad" project that could lose money is the $1-billion athlete's village, which the city took over after the original financing plan involving a Wall Street hedge fund and a private developer fell through. The city is on the hook for about $675-million, according to the latest estimates from Mayor Robertson.
Vancouver's hot housing market could provide the city with an opportunity to profit when it eventually sells the athlete's village.
But experts don't credit the Winter Olympics for soaring prices of the city's real estate.
A recent study by the University of British Columbia showed Olympic host cities don't experience a real estate boom or bust as a result of the Games.
"While construction employment dramatically increases in the period prior to the Games, house prices are the same as they would be in the absence of the Games," said Tsur Somerville, one of the study's authors.
According to Mr. Somerville's research, Vancouver's economy will quickly revert back to its regular rhythms once the Games are over.
"We do not find support for the argument of host city backers that the Olympics delivers positive economic benefits, nor of the arguments made by opponents that there is some post-Olympic bust."
********
TOURISM The people who promote Vancouver as a tourist destination aren't about to let the scenic mountains and cosmopolitan streets speak for themselves during the Winter Olympics, especially not with the Americans.
Tourism officials are planning an aggressive attack on visitors to ensure they don't just enjoy Vancouver, but are convinced to come back. The advertising and social media blitz will also continue after the crowds have gone home.
On their hit list in particular are the Americans: easy targets because there are so many of them and they live close by, but hard to trap due to such barriers as tough financial times, the high Canadian dollar and tighter border security.
It makes the hunt that more challenging, but necessary given that increased tourism is said to be the key benefit of being an Olympic host city.
"We have to get people to pay attention to our message and make it relevant enough for them to consider us as a vacation option," said Steve Pearce, a vice-president at Tourism Vancouver.
He said the strategy for his organization, combined with all levels of government, is to attract international visitors to Canada, with British Columbia and Vancouver as a destination. However, when it comes to the Americans, the key is promoting the province and more specifically Vancouver.
"It's not hard to find people who know about Canada, but finding it as a vacation option, that's tougher," he said.
INFRASTRUCTURE
SNC-Lavalin didn't need the 2010 Winter Olympics to help put it on the map, but having a hand in two of the major infrastructure projects that make up a big part of the event has given it greater global exposure.
Its Vancouver-based transportation division built and now operates the Canada Line connecting Vancouver's airport to the downtown. It also oversaw the engineering behind upgrades to the Sea-to-Sky highway that winds from Vancouver to Whistler.
Both projects were going to be tackled at some point, but Vancouver's winning Olympic bid turned them into government spending priorities.
"The nice thing about the Olympics was that it gave a hard deadline for many projects," said Jim Burke, SNC-Lavalin's executive vice-president in charge of transportation.
SNC-Lavalin's biggest Olympic-related role is the Canada Line, which opened 15 weeks ahead of schedule last summer and boasts ridership levels years ahead of predictions. The transit line surpassed its two-year goal of 100,000 daily riders, within the first two months. More than 158,000 people travelled on the Canada Line on Thursday, the day before the opening ceremonies.
"This is a source of pride for employees, being involved in these projects," said Mr. Burke.
The Canada Line and Sea-to-Sky Highway projects helped SNC-Lavalin land work for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, as an adviser to state-owned Russian Railways, which is building road and rail infrastructure.
HOTELS/CONVENTIONS Vancouver's $880-million Convention Centre expansion project, which tripled its size, is the key to attracting more business to the city after the Winter Games.
So far the strategy appears to be working with room night bookings - a key measure in the convention business - poised to surpass 170,000 in 2010, not including the explosion of business during the Olympics. Tourism Vancouver says those numbers rise to a record 200,000 in 2011. Both smash the record 120,000 bookings in 2004, before the expansion.
Conventions are lucrative because of the economic spinoffs, such as restaurants, taxis and of course hotel stays.
Hotel bookings from March to December this year are up 53 per cent from the same time in recessionary 2009, and up 33 per cent from 2007, which was the best year in recent memory, PricewaterhouseCoopers data shows.
That bodes well for Fairmont Hotel and Resorts, which has four hotels in downtown Vancouver, its highest concentration of all cities in which it does business.
Fairmont's Graeme Benn said the economic recovery is boosting stays, but the Olympics is also a strong driver. "I expect the interest to only escalate," now that the Games are here, he said.
Rival Four Seasons, with one Vancouver hotel, sees Olympic hype helping sales."The Olympics will be a huge coup for us going forward, more so that Expo '86 ever was," said marketing director Kostas Christopoulos.
PROPERTY The end of the Winter Olympics will lead to higher commercial and industrial vacancy rates in Greater Vancouver as dozens of companies and countries move out of the thousands of square feet of space leased in months leading up the event.
More space is good news for tenants looking to rent property, but bad news for landlords already facing high vacancy rates as a result of the recent recession.
The collective moving out in a few weeks time has property owners scrambling to secure new tenants by offering deep discounts and other incentives.
For example, a 750,000-square-foot building leased by the Winter Olympics organizing committee in Delta, B.C., is now being marketed for around $5 a square foot on an annual basis. The space was being marketed for more than $7 per square foot when they took it over about 18 months ago.
Avison Young broker Michael Farrell said the Vancouver Olympics have become a "soft deadline" for lease renewals. Potential tenants are waiting to see what space will come free as other leases expire over the next 18 months or so. The result is even more vacant space on the market, which is good news for tenants.
"Tenants today have an opportunity that we have not seen in several years to lease space at reduced rents with generous inducement packages," he said.
The office vacancy rate for Greater Vancouver was 7.8 per cent at the end of 2009, which is up slightly from 7.4 per cent in the middle of last year.
MARKETING
Elena Rivera MacGregor is counting on the Winter Olympics to revitalize her Vancouver branding and design company, and not just because of the renewed attention she's receiving as creator of the Inukshuk design that won the Games logo competition.
Ms. MacGregor, who runs Rivera Design Group, is hoping marketing mania around the Vancouver Games will inspire many companies to rebrand, and then choose her company to do the work.
"The Olympics is really a demonstration of what I do," she said.
Since she won the logo competition in 2005, Ms. MacGregor said her phone hasn't rung off the hook as some expected. Instead, she has had to pound the pavement, sometimes harder than before, to convince both old and potential clients that she wanted more work, and does more than just design logos.
"We have finally come to the place where we are more of a magnet than a deterrent," said Ms. MacGregor of Rivera Design Group.
Her experience is not unlike the success of the Winter Games themselves, where hype can only go so far.
Ms. MacGregor said it will be an emotional time for her when the event ends.
"I will miss the attention. Right now the city is dressed in my colours. It will be a little sad, that's for sure," she said.
RETAIL While most people want snow during the Winter Games, Vancouver Umbrella president Shana Hochfelder is praying for rain.
"If it doesn't rain between now and the end of February, we'll be having a bonfire of Olympic umbrellas," joked Ms. Hochfelder, whose company has the licensing deal to sell umbrellas with the official 2010 Olympic logo.
Ms. Hochfelder is one of many retailers eyeing the event as an opportunity to reinvigorate sales after the recession. While her market is people who hate to get wet, others retailers, such as Roots and Lululemon, are playing up to the patriotic side by selling bags, jackets and shirts emblazoned with flags from various Olympic nations.
How successful the strategy will be won't be known for weeks, but Ms. Hochfelder's company is proof that having special Olympic retail status doesn't guarantee strong sales. "Sales are not nearly as high as we thought," she said.
Corporate sales to sponsors such as Visa and Samsung are 70 per cent below projections, and while retail sales have risen steadily in the past six weeks, the company has only sold about 50 per cent of its Olympic product so far, which is below expectations. The company has made about 20,000 Olympic-style umbrellas of various shapes and styles.
Ms. Hochfelder said the highest sales volumes are expected during the Olympics, but she's also looking to Mother Nature for help.
What happens if the umbrellas don't sell out? They'll go on sale, alongside all of the other Olympic paraphernalia left on the shelves.

As Games begin, real estate is all uphill

Abstract: "We are starting to see a levelling-off period where people are saying, 'Nothing is happening for the next month, so let's take it easy,'" says Rudy Nielsen, president of Landcor Data Corp. and Niho Land & Cattle Co. "Everything is stabilized. It's a holding pattern to see what will happen after the Olympics."

Full text: The Winter Games begin in Vancouver today, and so far it seems the big event has had zero impact on local real estate.
If anything, it might be a good time to buy because there's slightly less competition. However, prices for desirable mid-market homes are holding strong in the face of low inventory. Overall, Vancouver's market appears to be on hold, with buyers waiting post-Games, and many realtors, property inspectors and mortgage brokers choosing to go on vacation during the lull.
"We are starting to see a levelling-off period where people are saying, 'Nothing is happening for the next month, so let's take it easy,'" says Rudy Nielsen, president of Landcor Data Corp. and Niho Land & Cattle Co. "Everything is stabilized. It's a holding pattern to see what will happen after the Olympics."
That holding pattern doesn't mean a dip in prices, however. Buyers and sellers in this market mean serious business.
"There are still the hard-core types looking," says realtor Nancy Steele, who's a regular property investor in her own right. "And the people listing to sell are serious. They are not testing the market. They are wanting to move."
First-time home buyers continue to look on the city's east side, where the market is strong for houses between $650,000 and $900,000.
Ms. Steele went to an open house last weekend in Burnaby and the selling agent already had eight offers. She recently saw four parties go through a unit at the Maynards Block near the Olympic Village, and three of them made offers. A house in Strathcona near Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, listed for $1.58-million, sold this week for $1.6-million.
Ms. Steele managed to find a relative deal for herself recently in British Properties, a triple lot property for $1-million. She also bought a condo in the downtown Woodward's Building for $275,000 and flipped it for $350,000.
That said, she doesn't think the deals are currently any better than usual.
"There are deals in every market."
As to whether prices may go up after the Olympics, if they do, nobody feels it will be related to the Games.
"All I can say is our research shows in general that looking at prices rather than sales before and after the Olympics doesn't make much difference," says Tsur Somerville, University of British Columbia professor in real-estate finance.
One theory is that Vancouver prices are holding strong because of low inventory.
"We haven't been affected by the Olympics because the inventory is still quite low," says long-time realtor David Jones.
Realtor Kenny Wong concurs: "There's not much selection of anything, that's why prices are so high."
Prof. Somerville cautions that part of the reason for low inventory is that during the economic downturn of 2008, many major developers protected themselves by halting projects. Supply has been slow to catch up.
"There's a mismatch between demand recovering more quickly than supply," he says.
There is another factor at play in Vancouver - the perception that there is nowhere for real estate to go but up.
Mr. Nielsen's Landcor Data Corp. released a report this week that bolstered that view. House prices in Metro Vancouver have more than doubled in a decade, and sales have gone up 70 per cent. Foreign buyers comprised part of the market, but 94 per cent was local.
In 2009, a record was set for the highest priced detached house, sale price $7.4-million, and the highest priced detached house, sale price $14.2-million.
Those records were set after an economic downturn in 2008.
But sellers can get caught in a slump, as Ms. Steele herself did in 2008. "The only flip I ever lost money on was one I sold around Christmas time last year. I took a beating on that one," she recalls.
Mr. Nielsen says he lost everything in the recession of 1981. He quickly recovered, but promised himself he'd never again take on debt. And he recalls the post-Expo dip in real estate. After Expo, Mr. Nielsen says real-estate sales doubled over a four-year period, topping out at around $75-billion. But by 1989, those sales, he says, plummeted to $60-billion.
As to forecasting the state of the market post-Games, his answer is cautious.
"I think there is too many unanswered questions yet," says Mr. Nielsen.

Dee Dee stakes her claim

Author: Taylor Hannah, Dee Dee

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/dee-stakes-her-claim/docview/382592191/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: When my great-grandfather Daniel O'Connell moved to Canada from Ireland, he settled in Peterborough. It was customary in those days to summer in nearby Stoney Lake. Once he received a judgeship, he moved his family to Toronto. Even though he set up shop in a more urban area, he kept the tradition of summering at Stoney alive. He bought a summer residence on the mainland that was affectionately dubbed "Breezy Point."

Full text: Follow along as architect Dee Dee Taylor Hannah builds her Stoney Lake dream cottage. First of a six-part series.
This is the first part of a six-part series following architect Dee Dee Taylor Hannah as she builds an island cottage for her family on Stoney Lake north of Toronto.
I know we're still dealing with deep freezes and salt-stained Jimmy Choos, but while you have been patiently grappling with our Canadian winter's glories, I have been thinking ahead to the summer. While the snow falls, I have been hard at work creating my ideal summer destination: an island cottage on historic Stoney Lake.
As an architect, interior designer and partner in a construction and millwork company, building my own a cottage is a thrill and a half. After working on other people's projects every day, it's refreshing to work on something of my own for a change. I have always wanted to leave my permanent style stamp on Stoney Lake, and this is also a chance to experiment with new looks and materials. But even more than that, this island cottage is an opportunity to create a family home for my husband and kids that we can share for the rest of our lives.
For the first part of my 20s, I like many others would spend weekends over the summer in glamorous Muskoka. After a couple of seasons at the larger-than-life pace, I turned eastward and settled down in Stoney Lake, a more rustic spot of Canadian wilderness where my family had established roots.
Stoney Lake is nestled in the Kawarthas about an hour and a half northeast of Toronto. Stoney's calming open wetlands and rugged limestone bedrock house cottages that are built to blend in and complement their surroundings, rather than steal the spotlight.
When my great-grandfather Daniel O'Connell moved to Canada from Ireland, he settled in Peterborough. It was customary in those days to summer in nearby Stoney Lake. Once he received a judgeship, he moved his family to Toronto. Even though he set up shop in a more urban area, he kept the tradition of summering at Stoney alive. He bought a summer residence on the mainland that was affectionately dubbed "Breezy Point."
Three generations and many marriages later, my family is still at Breezy. I have known it as my second home all my life, having made my inaugural visit as a one-week-old newborn.
Forty-odd years have passed, and every summer my husband Rob, my two children Jake, 15, and Rachael, 10, and I move into the cottage for some serious summer fun, with the weekly Toronto fix thrown in of course (a girl can only run her business for so many days from the dock).
Also visiting the property are my parents, three siblings and a total of eight grandchildren. This means our vacations tend to lean more toward extended family therapy than kicking back with my nuclear family.
I can only say that as an architect and interior designer, and mother, daughter, sister, wife and aunt, I needed new horizons to explore.
Anyone who knows me knows I am a city girl, and my boating skills can be summed up by an incident last summer that left me stranded on the lake in my motorboat without any gas.
Nevertheless, I came down with a serious case of island envy last summer after an endless stream of dinner parties at friends' island properties. While on the boat drive back from a friend's, I passed a beautiful island not too far off the mainland that coincidentally was in the shape of a bowtie. Formally titled Wilcox Island, the property had always belonged to an American family, the Lewises, and it was known for its unmarked views and prime location. When I spotted a "For Sale" sign, I dialled up local real estate agent Craig Hamilton who filled me in on the property.
"The date on the original boathouse is 1895. Written on the walls of the other buildings are stories of summer fun ranging from jumping off the boathouse roof to maintaining various parts of the buildings," said Mr. Hamilton, an agent with Re/Max Eastern Realty Inc.
He also swayed us by sharing the benefits of living on an island property.
"The islands provide unique 360 views, deep clean shoreline and the ultimate cottage experience in terms of privacy. From an island you start your day watching the sun rise in the east with coffee, and then finish with a glass of red wine watching the sunset in the west after enjoying sun and water all day," he said.
Rob and I knew we had to put in an offer. We brought in a surveyor to take a closer look at the island, and right off the bat we were given some news that made us very happy, considering we planned on tackling construction in the winter.
"Wilcox Island is located relatively close to the mainland and, on average, the ice around the area of the island is thicker than most parts on the lake. This ensures logistical problems [such as transportation of people and equipment] are minimized," said Chris Musclow of Elliott & Parr surveyors.
It turns out Mr. Musclow was not the only one with concerns. As in any buying process, there was a conditional clause pending approval of our building plans. I scheduled a necessary hearing with the committee of adjustment in the local township of Douro-Dummer to discuss my plans for the island.
I wanted to grandfather the new cottage into the footprint of the old cottage, build a new 550-square-foot sleeping cabin in the "neck" of the bowtie and renovate the existing boat house.
As in any democracy, there are neighbours to be found, and those neighbours will undoubtedly have questions. The six to eight council members and single interested bystander at the hearing wanted to ensure that I respected the island's landscape and was mindful of sightlines from other cottages.
I deferred the hearing in order to get more feedback from the neighbouring islands, and was also told I had to review the existing septic system. I turned to local hero Darrell Drain, of Drain Brothers Excavating Ltd., who had put in the older system years ago and who owns all things stone-related at Stoney Lake.
Mr. Drain was quick to tell me how fond he was of the island's stunning westward views right down the lake and how he could trace back the previous owner's family lineage over three generations. He was also very fond of the existing boathouse.
"The boathouse has a lot of potential and is something real special. Once it's jacked up and level, it will be great because there are not many of them big boat houses left that are double-storey," he said.
After the final go-ahead, which meant dealing with a cross-border transaction and weathering the 20-day appeal process, I am officially water bound!

Full text: While Premier Gordon Campbell, Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson and VANOC CEO John Furlong are basking in the media sunshine these days, they were specks on the horizon when the idea of bidding for the 2010 Olympics first arose. A line of others cleared the way for them, players whose roles have been in many cases forgotten. They all got invitations to the opening ceremonies from the Premier's office, but most had little to do with the Games after they played their early part.
GLEN CLARK
The former B.C. premier gave the local bid group its first $50,000 and was credited with winning the national slot with his passionate speech to the Canadian Olympic Committee. Until recently, the only event Mr. Clark was sure of attending was a quarter-finals hockey game. "I don't expect any special treatment," he said. Two weeks ago, he was surprised to get the invitation from the Premier's office.
PHILIP OWEN
The former mayor of Vancouver encouraged the bid committee in its early days, although he and his council were reluctant to commit the city to any extra expenses. He has been an official Olympics ambassador the last four years and will attend several social functions related to the Games. But he'll watch the sports events on TV at home.
SAM SULLIVAN
Mr. Sullivan was the symbol of Vancouver for many when he circled a Turin stage at the 2006 Winter Olympics with the Canadian flag attached to his wheelchair. Now, he doesn't have any official role. "I offered to do something. But it didn't happen," Mr. Sullivan said. He is getting a coveted torch-run spot today, courtesy of RBC.
LARRY CAMPBELL
Mr. Campbell is famous as the Vancouver mayor who enraged and terrified organizers when he carried out a campaign promise to hold a referendum on the Games - and then thrilled them when he successfully campaigned for and won a yes vote. Now a senator, he got to run with the torch in Dawson Creek in a Concord Pacific spot.
ARTHUR GRIFFITHS
The onetime Vancouver Canucks owner was the leader of the Vancouver-Whistler bid effort for its first three years. Twelve years later, Mr. Griffiths is busy handling business files related to the Olympics for the company Prime Strategies. He ran with the torch at Whistler, thanks to an invitation from John Furlong, and will be going to many events with tickets from friends and business colleagues.
HUGH O'REILLY
Mr. O'Reilly spent years planning the Olympics as the mayor of Whistler, making sure there were policies in place to protect the town from out-of-scale development. He left politics and Whistler in 2005 to sell real estate in Maui, but arrived in Vancouver last night to attend the opening ceremonies and take in some of the Games events.

/ CO-OP AGENTS: Irene Kaushansky and Philip Brown, Keller Williams Advantage RealtyIrene Kaushansky and Philip Brown showed their clients over a dozen Victorians downtown to find one that would have enough period details and space to please their growing family.
This 2.5-storey, semi-detached house in Roncesvalles was the top contender, with a spacious five-bedroom plan and original characteristics preserved over the past 100 years.
"It really was a special home," says Mr. Brown, who warned his clients that bidding wars often break out over authentic Victorians like this one.
"It had a perfect mix of stained glass, high ceilings and beautiful, ornate plaster workings with just enough modern stuff to make it easy to live in."
For instance, the living room has a traditional wood-burning fireplace, hardwood floors and 12-foot ceilings, yet is fairly open to the adjacent dining room and hallway.
The eat-in kitchen was remodelled, and a family room was created with a walkout to the deck.
A powder room serves this level, while the main bathroom is on the second floor amidst three bedrooms. The level above is occupied by two bedrooms.
The lower level is a self-contained space with a kitchen, bathroom, recreation room and two bedrooms, including one with a second walkout to the courtyard.
"The fact that it had a fantastic basement apartment and a great tenant made it extra appealing," adds Mr. Brown.
The south-facing backyard is a fenced-in space with a patio and shed, plus two-car parking off a rear lane.
To enjoy the local social scene, the property is steps from shops, galleries and restaurants along Queen Street West, as well as a library, schools and community centre.
Waterfront amenities and the Queen Elizabeth Way lie further south. "It's a fantastic location," says Mr. Brown.

ASKING PRICE: $329,000SELLING PRICE: $345,000TAXES: $1,960 (2009)DAYS ON THE MARKET: seven / LISTING AGENT: Anthony Coretti, Royal LePage Supreme Realty
Despite a relatively slow fall market, three buyers acted swiftly at the prospect of owning this spacious two-bedroom suite downtown for less than $350,000, says agent Anthony Coretti.
"It's a great combination of location, layout and bang for your buck," he says of the seventh-floor unit, which is situated within a growing condominium community on the former Molson Brewery site by Fort York.
Local attractions include waterfront parks and trails, the CNE grounds and Rogers Centre. Restaurants, shops and night clubs are also nearby in the Entertainment District.
As for the unit, it has a square footprint without hallways. "There's no wasted space whatsoever," says Coretti. "It showed much bigger than it is."
Off the foyer, there is a kitchen with ceramic floors and backsplashes and a door to the laundry facilities.
A peninsula with a breakfast bar overlooks the living and dining area, which features laminate floors below nine-foot ceilings, expansive windows and a balcony facing northeast towards the Gardiner Expressway and CN Tower.
"It's got a nice city view," says Mr. Coretti.
To one side of the principal room, there is a master bedroom with a private bathroom, while the other side leads to a second bedroom and main bathroom.
The monthly fee of $386 covers heating cost and maintenance of a gym, indoor pool and rooftop deck with barbecue stations, as well as a theatre, billiards room and guest suites.
"It has everything you could possibly want in a condo," says Mr. Coretti. "It's very popular with the young professionals."
The unit comes with parking inside the pet friendly-building, though residents can also catch TTC routes running past its front doors.

An old heist classic, with killer new commentary

Author: Clements, Warren

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/old-heist-classic-with-killer-new-commentary/docview/382588206/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: DVD by boutique label Anchor Bay. This is not the Coen brothers' unnecessary 2004 remake, but the original 1955 Ealing Studios dark comedy starring Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom. It's a film so winning that directors as diverse as Terry Gilliam and Terence Davies sit for interviews on the Blu-ray to sing the film's praises. It works, says Gilliam, because the characters are grounded.

Full text: wclements@globeandmail.com
There has been a dust-up in the world of classic film on Blu-ray. Criterion, the boutique label that pioneered audio commentaries, has lost the rights to many of the titles it issued on DVD and planned to issue on Blu-ray. StudioCanal, the French powerhouse that controls many famous movies, has licensed those titles to Lionsgate Home Entertainment, represented in Canada by Maple Pictures. The list even includes Jean Renoir's Grand Illusion , the first title in Criterion's DVD catalogue. It's sad, yet reassuring to see a battle break out over who gets to release old films in the brave new Blu-ray era. People care!
The Lionsgate-StudioCanal consolidation doesn't stop there. Next Tuesday, Maple will release the Blu-ray version of The Ladykillers , previously issued on DVD by boutique label Anchor Bay. This is not the Coen brothers' unnecessary 2004 remake, but the original 1955 Ealing Studios dark comedy starring Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom. It's a film so winning that directors as diverse as Terry Gilliam and Terence Davies sit for interviews on the Blu-ray to sing the film's praises. It works, says Gilliam, because the characters are grounded. They have lives. "No matter how jokey it gets, you never feel this is just goofy, silly stuff."
The film centres on a ramshackle house perched over the railway tracks in central London. The tiny but indomitable Mrs. Wilberforce (Katie Johnson) rents out rooms to the sinister Professor Marcus (Guinness), a role that would have gone to the great Alastair Sim (Scrooge in 1951's A Christmas Carol ) if the head of Ealing, Michael Balcon, hadn't insisted on Guinness because of his success in such Ealing comedies as Kind Hearts and Coronets . Guinness realized the role had Sim written all over it, so he played it with false teeth that made him look and sound a bit like Sim.
Marcus tells Mrs. Wilberforce that he and a few friends rehearse regularly as an amateur string quintet, but this is a fiction borrowed from the 1938 movie The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse . They are plotting to rob a bank, and intend to use the old lady as an unwitting pawn. Plans go awry, the thieves turn on each other and, in Gilliam's words, Katie Johnson "is the little beam of light that floats through it all." It's a gem.
The Lionsgate Blu-ray takes some getting used to. The Technicolor film has always been dark, particularly in the climactic scenes. The Blu-ray transfer brightens those scenes and, for all the welcome clarity, dissipates some of the atmosphere. To its credit, Lionsgate has supplemented the film with interviews, a useful commentary and a 50-minute documentary on Ealing, which Balcon sold to the BBC not long after this film was made.
Maple's other Blu-ray releases next week include Ran , Akira Kurosawa's great late-career reimagining of Shakespeare's King Lear . The only extra held over from the Criterion DVD is AK , Chris Marker's documentary on Kurosawa. New bonuses include a 42-minute StudioCanal interview, in French with English subtitles, with French producers who came to Kurosawa's rescue when Ran 's funding fell short.
And, definitely not least, Criterion itself is coming out with both a DVD and Blu-ray of Lola Montes (1955), French director Max Ophuls's only movie in colour. This is a recently restored version of a stylish film that was impressive even in its long-seen truncated form, with Peter Ustinov as the ringmaster and Martine Carol as the title performer.

MORE NEW RELEASES
TV
HEAD CASE SEASON 2 (2009)
Other comedies have tackled the byplay between therapist and patient - The Bob Newhart Show, Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist - but Head Case , now sadly cancelled, is hands down the funniest. Elizabeth Goode (Alexandra Wentworth) is a counsellor far loopier than her celebrity clients (real celebrities playing mock versions of themselves). Wentworth's whip-smart portrayal can switch from giddiness to dry-heaving self-pity in a second. Cast includes Steve ( Barney Miller ) Landesberg as a mooching psychiatrist.
KINGDOM SERIES 3 (2009)
If this show were a cup of tea, it would be warm, not hot. There is human drama, but nothing too upsetting. There are offbeat problems, but few that can't be resolved by Stephen Fry as avuncular Peter Kingdom, an English solicitor working in a Norfolk village called Market Shipborough. Long shots of rural countryside? Check. Colourful locals? Check. Mouth-watering country estates? Check. It's well done if you're up for its cozy take on life. The six-episode Series 3 ends with a cliffhanger about Kingdom's identity.
******
MOVIES
YOU MIGHT AS WELL LIVE (2007)
Simon Ennis's low-budget dark comedy practically begs for cult status (shades of Napoleon Dynamite ). Nerdy, naive, suicidal Robert Mutt (co-writer Josh Pearce) is universally ridiculed in his town of Riverside (filmed in Hamilton). His Candide-like journey involves a washed-up baseball hero (Michael Madsen), two comatose women, gross-out jokes and a game cast that includes Stephen McHattie and Liane Balaban ("Why is it every time I meet a guy I like he doesn't want to blow up City Hall with me?").
COCO BEFORE CHANEL (2009)
Everywhere you turn, there's the great fashion designer - played by Anna Mouglalis in Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky , by both Shirley MacLaine and Barbora Bobulova in the TV movie Coco Chanel , and by Audrey Tautou in this tale of how Coco became Chanel, with her emphasis on elegant and comfortable couture. The Globe's three-star review found Tautou a "consistent delight to watch. ... Her dark, penetrating eyes are constantly scanning the surface of things, observing all and missing nothing."
******
BLU-RAY
LAW ABIDING CITIZEN (2009)
Hell hath no fury like a man assigned by the plot to blow everything up in fiendish and intricate ways. The film has a Death Wish beginning, as Clyde (Gerard Butler) sees his world fall to pieces and blames the justice system, personified by district attorney Nick (Jamie Foxx), for being unjust. Butler, who got to deliver the classic line "Tonight we dine in Hell" in the film 300 , here intones the ominous sentence, "It's going to be biblical." Though I don't recall the Bible mentioning death by cellphone.
GOODFELLAS: 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION (1990)
Based on Nicholas Pileggi's book Wiseguys , Martin Scorsese's violent, masterly film follows gangsters through their paces, as folks cater to the every whim of the bad guys (Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta as novice Henry Hill) for fear of having their heads blown off. The Blu-ray comes with a small booklet of photographs, two commentaries (one with the real Hill) and, on a bonus DVD (not high-def), the feature-length documentary Public Enemies: The Golden Age of the Gangster Film .

U.S. facing bleak outlook on property, new jobs

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/u-s-facing-bleak-outlook-on-property-new-jobs/docview/382580216/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "For growth to be truly sustainable - for our prosperity to be truly shared and our living standards to actually rise - we need to move beyond an economy that is fuelled by budget deficits and consumer demand," Mr. [Barack Obama] said. "We need to export more and borrow less from around the world, and we need to save more money and take on less debt here at home."

Full text: As the U.S. Congress pushes ahead with another stimulus package, two sobering government reports paint a picture of an economy that still faces huge hurdles - absorbing losses in commercial real estate, and creating jobs.
Half of the roughly $1.4-trillion (U.S.) worth of commercial loans coming due over the next four years are already "under water" and could trigger bank losses reaching as much as $300-billion per year, according to a Congressional oversight panel report released yesterday. A loan is considered underwater when a borrower owes more than the underlying property is worth.
The panel, headed by Elizabeth Warren, said it is "deeply concerned" that faltering loans on malls, condos and office buildings could cause hundreds of small and mid-sized banks to fail, dragging down the broader economy.
"A significant wave of commercial mortgage defaults would trigger economic damage that could touch the lives of nearly every American," the 189-page report concluded.
"In the worst case scenario, hundreds more community and mid-sized banks could face insolvency ... Their widespread failure could disrupt local communities, undermine the economic recovery, and extend an already painful recession."
Also yesterday, President Barack Obama's top economic advisers warned that unemployment will hover around 10 per cent through this year and not recede to the pre-recession level of 6 per cent until 2015.
The White House Council of Economic Advisers, chaired by Christina Romer, said it expects the economy to generate a net average of 95,000 jobs per month in 2010. The economy lost 20,000 jobs in January and 8.4-million jobs since the recession began at the end of 2007.
Unless the rate of job creation predicted by the White House picks up beyond 2010, it would take more than seven years to replace all those lost jobs.
The jobs picture is unlikely to get a boost from the commercial real estate sector.
Property values have tumbled more than 40 per cent since 2007, rents are way down and acres of space sits vacant, including 18 per cent of office space and eight per cent of multifamily-housing units.
The Congressional oversight panel urged bank regulators and lenders to come clean and address the threats facing commercial real estate "forthrightly and transparently," short of another bailout. Loans to the commercial real estate sector total more than $3.4-trillion.
"There is a commercial real estate crisis on the horizon," the report said.
The reports on real estate and jobs coincide with the release of an $85-billion stimulus plan by Senate Democrats that includes extended jobless benefits, tax breaks and more money for infrastructure projects. The Democrat-held House passed a $155-billion in December, which comes on the heels of last year's $787-billion stimulus bill.
To pass a final bill, the Senate and House must now reconcile their differing versions.
Ms. Romer said the dismal conditions inherited by the Obama administration mean the recovery will be long and hard.
"I think there's just no way to understate how huge the economic challenges facing the country have been this past year," said Ms. Romer, currently on leave from her job as a University of California-Berkeley economics professor.
"So everything obviously from the financial crisis, the terrible recession, but the longer-run problems - the stagnating middle-class incomes, soaring health care costs, the failure to invest in education, innovation, clean energy - we certainly inherited an economy with a number of economic problems."
The 462-page annual report also forecasts that Americans will save at a much higher rate than they have in recent memory, slowing the pace of recovery.
In a statement accompanying the report, Mr. Obama said both the government and individuals are facing budget pressures that will make it particularly challenging to rebuild the economy.
"For growth to be truly sustainable - for our prosperity to be truly shared and our living standards to actually rise - we need to move beyond an economy that is fuelled by budget deficits and consumer demand," Mr. Obama said. "We need to export more and borrow less from around the world, and we need to save more money and take on less debt here at home."

Place, which has a capacity of 60,000. All told, more than 4,500 athletes, dancers and performers from around the world will appear in the mega-budget show.

FOOD
The Wild Chef
Food Network, 8 p.m.
Restaurateur Martin Picard is the lively tour guide of this road-trip series. The proprietor of the Montreal restaurant Au Pied de Cochon, Picard is most often accompanied by his sous-chef Hugue Dufour on his culinary journeys. Tonight, the unkempt cooks fly off to the northernmost corner of la belle province . Once landed, they hop on snowmobiles to explore the Arctic landscape, where they also take time out to cook up fresh mussels and render some seal blubber. Bon appetit .
REALITY
Kitchen Nightmares
Fox, 9 p.m.
Hot-tempered chef Gordon Ramsay reaches out to help another hopeless eatery in tonight's show. The location: Fiesta Sunrise, a struggling family-owned Mexican restaurant in West Nyack, N.Y. Upon arrival, Ramsay ascertains the problem is Vic, a stubborn stepfather who seems intent on running the place into bankruptcy. Vic's partner Yolanda and her daughter Patti are counting on Ramsay to give Vic a stern lecture. Watch what happens when immovable object meets irresistible force.
MOVIE
Reds
TCM, 10 p.m.
Directed by Warren Beatty, this 1981 epic about American journalist John Reed was a critical hit, and a box-office bomb. Beatty also took on the role of Reed, who began covering Soviet political news for a progressive American publication and eventually found himself playing a key role the middle of the Russian Revolution. Diane Keaton is powerful as Reed's comrade/lover Louise Bryant and the late author Jerzy Kosinksi delivers a surprisingly strong turn as a Soviet apparatchik.
SATURDAY
FEBRUARY 13
HISTORY
Ancients Behaving Badly
History, 6 p.m.
The eight-part series takes a second look at famous historical figures, with emphasis paid to their less virtuous character traits. Case in point: Tonight's profile of Alexander the Great, who is acknowledged to be a brilliant military strategist and also a hopeless alcoholic. According to this report, Alexander rarely made a military decision while sober and was prone to mindless drunken rages, including one in which he killed his best friend.
COMEDY
The Jane Show
Global, 7:30 p.m.
Broadcast for two short seasons (2006 and 2007) on Global, this half-hour comedy starred the engaging Teresa Pavlinek as Jane Black, a wannabe novelist forced to work in a small-minded corporate office environment to pay the bills. In tonight's show, Jane deals with the unexpected arrival of her sister Kathleen (Stephanie Belding) and the office's decision to enforce its unreasonable dress-code rules.
REAL ESTATE
Million Dollar Listing
HGTV, 8 p.m.
This series follows the lives of Los Angeles real-estate agents whose commissions are in the six-figure range. As might be expected, these agents will do anything to make a sale happen. Tonight, be amazed at the slick sales technique of Josh, who believes he can move a dumpy Hollywood Hills domicile by coercing buyers to focus on its view. Later, the house hustler Madison destroys a personal relationship by convincing a friend to lease his home instead of selling it.
REALITY
Ghost Lab
Discovery, 11 p.m.
Meet the blue-collar brothers Brad and Barry Klinge, who co-founded their own little supernatural investigation business called Everyday Paranormal. Sticking to the template of Ghost Hunters or any of the other ghost-chasing teams currently on television, the brothers are accompanied on their missions by a cadre of unassuming lunch-pail types, including Katie Burr and a guy named Hector. This evening's jaunt takes them to Louisiana, where they investigate spirit reports at a former cotton plantation and ghostly sounds at the Shreveport Municipal Auditorium.
SUNDAY
FEBRUARY 14
ANIMATED
6teen
Teletoon, 6 - 9 p.m.
Viewers in the tween demographic are already in mourning over the departure of this worthy Canadian-made cartoon, which leaves the air after four seasons. Launched in late 2004, the original Teletoon production focused on six teen friends - Nikki, Jude, Wyatt, Jen, Caitlin and Jonesy - working and hanging out at a mall. Along with the requisite teen-show life lessons, 6Teen was popular for its unique animation style. Tonight's marathon rebroadcasts the final four episodes of the show's last season, in which Jonesey received a new baby sibling and two of the gang became romantically involved, followed by the series finale. And then the mall is closed.
DOCUMENTARY
My Kidnapper
CBC News Network, 10 p.m.
This documentary retells the strange-but-true story of British TV producer Mark Henderson, who in 2003 was kidnapped with seven tourists in Colombia and held by Marxist rebels for three agonizing months. Several months after his release, Henderson received an e-mail from his kidnapper, who claimed he had fled Colombia and was in dire need of Henderson's help. The kidnapper's fiancee similarly contacted another hostage named Reini and even sent her a Facebook friend request. The film follows Mark and Reini back to the mountains of northern Colombia for a face-to-face meeting with their former captors.
DOCUMENTARY
Invisible City
TVO, 10:45 p.m.
Directed by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Hubert Davis ( Hardwood ), this documentary chronicles three years in the lives of two teenage boys in Toronto's tough Regent Park neighbourhood. The two youths, Kendell and Mikey, are shown dealing with academic roadblocks (Kendell is suspended from school for two months) and brushes with the law (Mikey is arrested). A compelling character study of two kids struggling to survive.
MONDAY
FEBRUARY 15
HISTORY
What the Ancients
Did For Us
TVO, 7 p.m.
What impact did ancient civilizations have on our modern society? Here's your chance to find out, one civilization at a time. First broadcast on BBC, this series hosted by Adam Hart-Davies pays solemn homage to the contributions of ancient cultures. Tonight's episode focuses on the Egyptians. Not only were they skilled at mummification and pyramid building, they were pioneers in the fields of medicine, mathematics and irrigation. And who knew the ancient Egyptians invented recreational fishing?
REALITY
The Bachelor:
On the Wings of Love
ABC, CITY-TV, 8 p.m.
Anybody who believed The Bachelor franchise had outlived its appeal with viewers is sorely mistaken. The 14th edition of the romance-reality series has been performing strongly for ABC on Monday nights, even against stiff competition from Fox's 24 . For those who lost track and still care, airline pilot Jake Pavelka is now down to three remaining bachelorettes, who join him on the island of St. Lucia (hence, less clothes to be worn). The big drama: Each woman must decide if she wants to join Jake in the "fantasy suite" following their romantic date. Either way, somebody's going home, likely in tears.
DOCUMENTARY
Facing Ali
Spike, 9 p.m.
Make time to watch this remarkable new documentary, which seems oddly out of place in the Spike lineup. An official selection at the 2009 L.A. Film Festival, the film profiles 10 boxers who stepped into the ring with Muhammad Ali in the sixties and seventies. Accompanied by archival fight footage, the program includes such pugilistic names as Ernie Terrell, Larry Holmes, Joe Frazier, George Foreman and Leon Spinks, whose upset victory over Ali shocked the boxing world in 1978. The highlight is the segment with Canadian boxer George Chuvalo, who went toe-to-toe with Ali twice, in 1966 and 1972. Ali later called Chuvalo "the toughest fighter" he ever faced.
DRAMA
CSI: Miami
CBS, A, 10 p.m.
For fans of the franchise, tonight's episode picks up from a three-part story arc that began on CSI last week. In Miami, Horatio Caine (David Caruso) rings up his Las Vegas counterpart Ray Langston (Laurence Fishburne) to inform him that a severed leg found in the everglades belongs to a woman who went missing in Vegas one week before. Everyone caught up now? Good. The story concludes Thursday on CSI .
TUESDAY
FEBRUARY 16
BIOGRAPHY
Toller Cranston:
The Art of Being
Bravo!, 7 p.m.
Love him or hate him, Toller Cranston changed the face of men's figure skating in Canada back in the seventies. Cranston was the first skater to bring a level of artistry to men's skating, which resulted in him winning the Canadian skating championship for several years running and collecting a bronze medal at the 1976 Olympic Winter Games. This program focuses less on Cranston's on-ice accomplishments and spends more time filming him at his home in San Miguel, Mexico, where his creative muse has returned to his original love of painting.
MOVIE
Walter's War
TVO, 9 p.m.
First broadcast on British television, this 2008 movie profiles a little-known legend. The film is inspired by the life of Walter Tull, (O.T. Fagbenle), the first black officer to lead British troops during the First World War. As shown in the film, Tull was also one of the first black soccer stars to play professionally in Britain, and was a formidable striker for both Tottenham Hotspur and Northampton Town between 1909 and 1914.
DRAMA
the forgotten
ABC, 10 p.m.
Even Jerry Bruckheimer has a bomb once in a while. The major domo behind the CSI and NCIS franchises, Bruckheimer seems to have misjudged current TV tastes with this drama starring Christian Slater as a former cop heading up a ragtag group trying to put names to unidentified murder victims. Before ABC officially cancels the forgotten , the network occasionally uses the show to fill space, as in tonight's episode, which follows the group's attempt to identify a woman's body found in a bar.
FOOD
Restaurant Makeover
Food Network, 11 p.m.
If you stumble upon a good episode of this series, you'll watch it every week. The show challenges two restaurant hotshots to renovate a local restaurant in need of a boost. On occasion, the show tugs the old heartstrings . Tonight profiles Sam and Rifca, who came to Canada with no money but a fierce entrepreneurial spirit. Both have suffered serious health problems in recent years and their pita business is being kept alive by their five daughters. Chef Brad Long and designer Glen Peloso supply the Pita Stop with a much-needed revamp.
WEDNESDAY
FEBRUARY 17
REALITY
Ice Pilots NWT
History, 7 and 10 p.m.
The best new reality show on Canadian television wraps its first season tonight with more plot twists than an episode of Desperate Housewives . In storylines, Kelly's husband Juan makes an acrimonious departure from Buffalo Airways, leaving her to decide whether she should do the same; Jeremy makes a career-ending mistake. The bigger story: An aviation gas shortage threatens to ground Buffalo Airways altogether (but not really, the show has been granted a second season).
REALITY
At the End of My Leash
Slice, 8 p.m.
Host Brad Pattison describes himself as a "dog advocate and human being life-coach" in this popular series. Sort of a more hirsute Larry David, Pattison applies his tough-love principles to both pet and owner in the series, which can be pretty entertaining in most cases. Tonight, he meets a marathoner named Trish, who adopted a dog named Hannah in hopes of getting a running partner. Instead, she got an uncontrollable canine that trashes her property. The bigger problem: Trish's seven-year-old daughter is crazy about the pooch. Brad puts his principles to work.
DRAMA
Criminal Minds
CBS, 9 p.m.
Still one of the tightest-written crime dramas on television, Criminal Minds has recently reached some of its highest ratings numbers in five years. Are people watching for the gripping plot lines or the occasional flashes of graphic violence? Both, probably. Tonight, agent Rossi (Joe Mantegna) and the Behavioural Analysis Unit launch a statewide manhunt to find a group of suspects with a pack mentality who kill simply for the thrill of it all.
REALITY
Steven Seagal: Lawman
A & E, 11 p.m.
Former action star Steven Seagal may be a big puffy dude now, but he still likes to mix it up with the bad guys. As per the title, this show follows Seagal on his rounds as a deputy with the sheriff's office in Jefferson Parish, La. In tonight's first episode, Seagal comes to the assistance of two men who have been robbed and shot, after which he helps rebuild a home for a family who lost everything in Hurricane Katrina. In the second, Seagal helps victims of a car crash and pulls over two men with a bottle of rum in their car. It's not a job, it's an adventure.
THURSDAY
FEBRUARY 18
MOVIE
San Francisco
TCM, 6 p.m.
One of the original MGM epics, this 1936 feature merges a grand story with impressive special effects. Clark Gable plays Blackie, a Barbary Coast character who hires an opera singer (Jeanette MacDonald) to perform at his rowdy club. Spencer Tracy plays Father Tim, a tough priest who dispenses Bible verse with a mean right hook. The characters bounce off each other for the first half of the film and then it comes: The great San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which is recreated in all its street-splitting glory.
ARTS
Writers' Confessions
Bravo!, 8:30 p.m.
Kudos to Bravo! for supporting this smart and important series. Now in its fourth season, Writers' Confessions enables authors to meet and discuss their craft and debate issues in an open forum. Tonight, authors Lawrence Hill, Isabel Allende and Robert J. Sawyer (who penned the novel-turned-TV-series FlashForward ) convene in an attempt to settle an eternal question: Are good writers born or made?
HISTORY
Britography:
Winston Churchill
PBS, 9 p.m.
The acclaimed anthology series kicks off a three-part profile of former British prime minister Winston Churchill, who was named "the Greatest Briton" in a 2002 BBC poll. The first instalment focuses on Winston's days as a rambunctious youth, first at the Harrow School and later at the Sandhurst military academy. The program also touches on young Churchill's taste for the fine things in life (including Pol Roger champagne) and his early bouts with depression.
DRAMA
CSI
CBS, 10 p.m.
A rebroadcast in an irregular timeslot (CBS isn't wasting any new shows up against the Winter Olympics), tonight's show concludes the story left hanging on Monday's edition of CSI: Miami . The story: Ray Langston (Laurence Fishburne) continues his investigation into a young girl taken hostage as part of a human trafficking operation. Eventually his search leads him to a seedy Las Vegas prostitution ring.

Full text: In Kensington Market, a Victorian house built in 1875 flaunts the opulent detailing that was the trade of its first owner
29 LIPPINCOTT ST.
WHAT:
A hidden gem near Kensington Market, dating to about 1875 and built by Philip Balmer, co-founder of Balmer Architectural Mouldings Inc. The company, founded in 1835, continues to make architectural mouldings to this day. The detached 11/2-storey, three-bedroom, 11/2-bathroom house, featuring 1,400 square feet of living space, is filled with heritage examples of Balmer's custom interior detailing. ASKING PRICE: $569,000 / TAXES: $3,239 (2009) / AGENT: Russell & Ward Realty Corp., (Allan Ward)
Paul Jenkins lives in the past.
As a member of the Toronto Consort, he plays the harpsichord and sings early Baroque songs. Bach is as much his idol as the Beatles.
Even his house is old, dating to the Victorian era, and filled with such rococo-inspired treasures as crown and ceiling mouldings original to the home's construction around 1875.
Since purchasing the house 17 years ago, Mr. Jenkins has lovingly restored the heritage mouldings to their previous glory, painting them gold to lend his tiny home on the edge of Kensington Market a feeling of Old World grandeur.
"This isn't a heritage site and it's not designated, but it should be," says Mr. Jenkins, who shares his home with a 1910 Steinway anda grey tabby. "It's a piece of Toronto history."
Which is another way of saying the structure - both interior and exterior - is old, but in a good sense of the word: the home as antique brooch.
The glamour comes courtesy of the original owner, Philip Balmer, who co-founded Balmer Architectural Mouldings Inc. in 1835. It is still operating to this day as one of North America's premier suppliers of custom interior detailing.
The firm's renown is rooted in the kind of work Mr. Balmer left behind in the house he had built for himself but apparently didn't enjoy much. City archives show that in 1876, a year after construction was completed, he sold it for $300, hand-carved banisters, sculptural niches, crown and chandelier mouldings and all.
Most of the decorative work he did for himself is centred on the main floor, in the dining and living rooms located toward the front of the house. These include cove, or three-dimensional, running ceiling mouldings carved into a grape and vine motif.
Local history buffs might recognize the unique design as also being a feature of historic Spadina House, once home to a wealthy Toronto family and now a city museum. Balmer had decorated that interior as well.
Mr. Jenkins's home, at 29 Lippincott St., is more modest in scale than Spadina House, measuring just 1,400 square feet on a 22-by-100-foot lot. But its vintage beauty is just as noteworthy.
The mantel surrounding the living-room fireplace, for instance, is a work of art. Original to the home, it features a brace of chiton-clad caryatids carved into a stone slab further decorated with a flourishing floral motif. Its dynamic sculptural presence compelled Mr. Jenkins to clear the room of all furnishings, save that of his grand piano, to allow the mantel to be the room's star attraction.
"It's where I play and rehearse chamber music," he says of the living room-turned-arts space, the home's innate decor being all the inspiration he apparently needs.
But pianos are big and orchestras, even if they are chamber-sized, are bigger. So Mr. Jenkins, after having renovated and personalizedhis space with upgraded electrical, plumbing and roofing and the addition of a rear-of-house sunroom and an extra bathroom in the unfinished basement, is forced to move on.
He is in search of a home big enough to accommodate his growing repertoire of period instruments.
The past is now orchestrating his future.

No U.S.-style market seen in MLS push

Author: Blackwell, Richard; Ladurantaye, Steve

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/no-u-s-style-market-seen-mls-push/docview/382580628/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The bureau's challenge, to be heard by the quasi-judicial competition tribunal, addresses the Canadian Real Estate Association's (CREA) rules that force sellers to buy a full range of agents' services, and thus pay full commissions, if they list on MLS.

Full text: Competition Bureau's efforts to force industry to loosen listing rules won't be as sweeping as south of border
The Competition Bureau's move to force the real estate industry to loosen its rules governing the multiple listing service will not bring to Canada the huge range of house-hunting tools available in the United States.
That's because the bureau's actions - if successful - are designed specifically to let sellers cheaply list their properties on MLS and avoid full-service commissions, not to broaden the availability of MLS data.
The bureau's challenge, to be heard by the quasi-judicial competition tribunal, addresses the Canadian Real Estate Association's (CREA) rules that force sellers to buy a full range of agents' services, and thus pay full commissions, if they list on MLS.
The bureau decided it would not push for further changes that would allow brokers or others to repackage MLS data with ancillary data, creating the kind of feature-rich websites that Americans have grown to love.
Currently, Canadian brokers cannot take MLS listings, enhance them with more information, and provide that to the public on a searchable website.
While the competition bureau has said in the past that it is interested in this issue, "it is not the focus of this particular case," Competition Commissioner Melanie Aitken said on Monday.
So far the courts have supported CREA's view that it owns MLS data and can limit its use. In December, an Ontario judge ruled that a Toronto-based website had to shut down because its use of data violated the standard agreement between brokers and real estate boards.
CREA president Dale Ripplinger said yesterday that anyone is free to create these kinds of sites, but only if they use data from their own sources, not from MLS. That, however, would make it almost impossible to create a site with a full range of listings.
In the United States, however, a 2008 settlement between the Justice Department and the National Association of Realtors opened up the market to a wide range of value-added real estate sites. Internet-based agents were given access to the data in the 800 multiple listing services that were affiliated with the realtors association.
That allowed Internet services such as Redfin.com and Zillow.com to expand their sites, which now have a vast array of features, and provide à la carte alternatives to traditional commissioned agents.
On these sites home buyers can look at the value of homes surrounding the one that is for sale, check local crime statistics, look at test scores at neighbourhood schools, and check out the previous purchase price on the property.
Steve Neil, a Vancouver agent who runs HomeBuyAndSell.com, said he would like to offer those kinds of features on his Canadian site, and he's confident that eventually he will be able to. Currently, he can download MLS data to his website, but he cannot add other material to it, such as the prices of recently sold homes.
"The goal is to provide [clients] with all the information they could possibly dream of," he said.
The Competition Bureau's actions will not bring those features to Canada in the short term, Mr. Neil said, but eventually the industry will have to go further to match what is available in the United States.

Abstract: By the time Mr. [Dale Ripplinger] and the association's legal team met last Wednesday with Melanie Aitken, the Commissioner of Competition, CREA had agreed to a number of concessions. But the language of CREA's proposal contained some wiggle room that allowed local real estate boards to retain the power to enforce their own rules.

Full text: As he walked out of a Toronto boardroom last week following a meeting with Ottawa's competition watchdog, Dale Ripplinger thought he was close to a deal.
The Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA), of which Mr. Ripplinger is president, had been negotiating for five months with officials from the federal Competition Bureau. The goal was to settle concerns that CREA was engaged in anti-competitive practices through its tight control of the Multiple Listing Service or MLS database, through which the vast majority of Canadian home sales are done.
By the time Mr. Ripplinger and the association's legal team met last Wednesday with Melanie Aitken, the Commissioner of Competition, CREA had agreed to a number of concessions. But the language of CREA's proposal contained some wiggle room that allowed local real estate boards to retain the power to enforce their own rules.
"For the most part the conversation was quite amicable - I thought we were making progress and weren't that far apart," Mr. Ripplinger said.
It was a calculated bet by the real estate industry association that is now threatening its 50-year lock on the country's home sale business.
On Monday, the bureau escalated the case by serving notice that it would be challenging the association's practices before the Competition Tribunal. With no settlement in sight, Ms. Aitken said that three years of investigation and negotiations had "come to an end."
The bureau's tactics have put trade associations and companies on notice that the competition regulator, long criticized for being too soft, is taking a tougher stance on alleged anti-competitive conduct.
"They are taking an aggressive enforcement approach. This shows they're prepared to take a hard line when it's appropriate," said Omar Wakil, a competition specialist with Torys LLP.
The stakes are high for the bureau. When Ms. Aitken was appointed commissioner last summer, she promised to improve the bureau's lacklustre record of challenging companies and organizations accused of anti-competitive conduct. By taking the case against CREA to a tribunal, the bureau will have to convince a specialized body that the association's practices are limiting competition in the home-selling business.
CREA could prolong the legal battle by challenging any tribunal decision in higher courts.
In real estate, Ms. Aitken is taking on an industry that has faced the commission's interest before. Following a lengthy investigation by the bureau of its practices in the 1980s, CREA agreed in 1988 to a prohibition that restricted it from setting rules that standardized commissions and restricted advertising and incentives.
The current investigation dates back to 2007, when the bureau began investigating new rules CREA brought in to manage the way consumers and agents interact on the MLS. The rules dictate that anyone using the system - which accounts for about 90 per cent of all home sales in Canada and generates billions of dollars in commissions - must employ a real estate agent throughout the whole process.
Ms. Aitken said the rules restrict competition, because real estate agents are unable to hive off certain services within the system and offer them on a flat-fee basis. Agents who want to offer such services have been excluded from the MLS by CREA, she said.
"What that means is consumers don't have any choice. It's either all [services] or nothing," she said.
One of the changes that was discussed during the talks would have allowed homeowners to list on MLS but handle offers without the help of an agent.
The real estate industry has made itself somewhat of an easy target, said Century 21 president Don Lawby. It has spent millions of dollars developing the site, but hasn't made it clear why real estate agents are an essential part of the offering.
"A sense of value may be lost because that story isn't being told," he said. "There is a perception selling a home is real simple, that someone just comes along and says I will pay you X amount ... it takes expertise, especially in large cities where we're talking about very significant dollars."

Full text: Bureau challenges real estate rules that restrict consumer choice, a move that could change the way houses are sold in Canada 8 Hot market Rush to buy spurs sharp housing rebound 8 Pop primer How a bubble begins REPORT ON BUSINESS 0
The federal Competition Bureau has launched an aggressive attack on the Canadian Real Estate Association, challenging its rules governing the Multiple Listing Service and calling for a radical change in how homes are sold in Canada.
"Our concern is that [CREA] are improperly and unlawfully leveraging [their control over MLS] in order to impose these restrictions and to deny competitive forces and to deny good old-fashioned market competition," said Competition Commissioner Melanie Aitken. "This case is focused pure and simple: Let consumers have the choice, let agents have the opportunity to satisfy and serve those choices."
The MLS has been around for more than 50 years and only registered agents are allowed to list homes on the service. The MLS trademark is owned by CREA, which has nearly 100,000 members, and each real-estate board operates the service in their region. Roughly 90 per cent of all residential real-estate transactions in Canada involve MLS data.
The bureau has asked the federal Competition Tribunal to strike down a series of rules CREA adopted in 2007 that tightened the MLS listing requirements.
Ms. Aitken said the rules stifled competition because they restricted the type of services real-estate agents offered, which resulted in higher fees for consumers. Agents who wanted to offer a wider range of services, such as flat fees instead of traditional commissions charged by full-service agents, have been excluded from the MLS by CREA, she added. "What that means is consumers don't have any choice, it's either all [services] or nothing," she said.
CREA president Dale Ripplinger called Ms. Aitken's decision "surprising and disappointing," and said her allegations about the MLS restrictions were "simply false."
"We do not agree with the bureau's position that certain CREA rules are anti-competitive, either as a matter of fact or as a matter of law," he said in a statement. CREA has insisted the 2007 changes were meant to protect the integrity of the MLS and ensure consumers had accurate information.
Mr. Ripplinger added that CREA had always expressed a willingness to work with the bureau to clarify the MLS rules. He said the association notified the bureau last week that it had drafted rule changes.
Ms. Aitken said CREA's efforts did not go far enough. "Unfortunately, CREA's leadership has taken the view that they don't accept what we think is absolutely necessary to protect Canadians, to inspire the kind of competition we all deserve," she said.
Many industry players said the bureau has been building a case against CREA for three years and federal officials approached several real-estate agents up to half a dozen times seeking information.
"This is big news for us," said Steve Neil, a Vancouver agent who runs HomeBuyAndSell.com and has pushed for changes. "There is no question it will change things in the next several years."
Discount brokers, who mostly operate online, have long argued that CREA's rule changes were designed to put them out of business and protect full-service agents who rely on commissions, which average about 5 per cent in total on a residential sale.
Before the 2007 changes, some discount brokers offered to list homes on MLS for a fee, typically less than $700. The homeowner then handled the sale.
The CREA changes required all agents to inspect homes before listing them on the MLS and work with other agents throughout the sale. As a result, discount brokers say they could no longer offer their low-fee services and had to charge more to carry out the various CREA requirements.
Mr. Neil, for example, charges customers $299 to list their home on MLS, plus $79 for each week the house is listed. When the house is sold, he charges a fee of 0.25 per cent of the sale price. Mr. Neil said if the bureau wins its case, he would likely lower his fees and change his services.
"We would offer probably a sort of à la carte -type menu of services; if [customers] want them they can pay for them," he said. He also believes several American online services would expand into Canada.
"The consumer demand is phenomenal for this service," added Donald Hewie, a real-estate agent in Ottawa who has also been pushing for changes. "This could be the beginning of the end for CREA."
But others, such as Phil Soper, CEO of Royal LePage Real Estate Services, say consumers already have a significant amount of choice, and the bureau's move could create a "frontier mentality" that might leave consumers worse off.
"CREA has gone to great lengths to understand the bureau's concerns," he said.
By breaking off settlement discussions and publicly challenging CREA's practices, the bureau also appears to be signalling new and harder stand against anti-trust targets.
Shortly after Ms. Aitken was named commissioner of the bureau last year, she identified anti-competitive conduct as a priority for the regulator, which has been plagued for years by a poor enforcement track record.

MLS AT A GLANCE
The MLS - or multiple listing service - is a database of information about houses that are currently for sale.
Information is gathered by local real estate boards and compiled by the Canadian Real Estate Association, which owns the MLS system.
Years ago, the information was distributed to real estate agents on paper; then the service moved to an electronic form.
For more than a decade, some - but not all - of the information has been made available to the public on a CREA website (realtor.ca). But some details, such as past sale prices of properties, are restricted to licensed agents.
To get a listing on MLS, a seller must agree to have a licensed real estate agent handle all aspects of a transaction, including the presentation of offers and negotiation of the deal.
The Competition Bureau wants sellers to be able to list for a simple fee, and then deal with buyers themselves or go through a discount-priced agent.

Oh eff it. And frig it. Sometimes you look for a little relief, a distraction. You turn on the TV and you're all "Whatever, here I am, entertain me." And then you get annoyed. Last thing you need.
Happened to me recently. One night I watched Law & Order: Special Victims Unit . A police procedural to pass the time after a day of dealing with matters that make you demented. Some ultra-rich New York city socialite, an arrogant floozie was the suspect. Floozie lands in the hoosegow but says they'll never hold her there. Hires a gang to free her. Turns out the gang is, you know, the cops in disguise. A car blows up and stuff. I'm staring at this is disbelief. So tired is Law & Order that it has morphed into The Mod Squad .
Which got me started. There's a lot of tired TV. And stuff that was a mistake to begin with. Herewith, a list: These Shows Blow. Add your own, if you like. I'm open to suggestions.
Law & Order: SVU . It wasn't just that episode. After 12 years, the series became formulaic and then became just plain ridiculous. A strength of the show (and the original Law & Order ) at the start was its focus on middleclass criminals - well-off professional people who had a hidden dark side and committed terrible crimes. Then it concentrated on perverts. And the cast seemed to be on autopilot. At least one has recognized the impasse - Chris Meloni, who plays Detective Elliot Stabler, has said he intends to leave the series when his contract is up after next season.
Survivor . Oh please. After 10 years of the show it has come to this - Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains , which starts this Thursday on CBS and Global. That's so old and tired. Maybe - just maybe - if the show put the increasingly ridiculous contestants in the snow and ice somewhere, instead of the jungles and a desert island, it could be revived. Or not. The contestants are too self-consciously obnoxious, sneaky and attention-seeking these days.
Accidentally on Purpose . An example of an appalling comedy - a low-rent, lame TV version of a rom-com movie - that continues to exist only because it is "hammocked" between two successful shows. Jenna Elfman ( Dharma & Greg ) plays Billie, a journalist (ha!) who gets pregnant from a one-night stand with a penniless younger guy. The only thing more annoying than Elfman is the grating canned laughter. A show watched only accidentally by people who've just seen How I Met Your Mother or tuning in early for Two and a Half Men . Never watched on purpose.
The Bachelor . Sleazy, cheesy and somehow always capable of rounding up a passel of women eager to debase themselves on TV. This season they played touch-football in their sleepwear. Kill it off and let The Bachelorette rule - the men battling to woo the Bachelorette are priceless idiots. Enough with the catty-women contestants.
Agent vs. Agent on HGTV. Seen this? Real-estate agents competing "to find desperate home buyers the house of their dreams." All phony aggression and awful people. The agents are described as "the shamelessly confident, warts-and-all types, who are not afraid to say it like it is." Or exaggerate, flatter and freak out. It's inanity epitomized.
Love Incorporated on Slice. Shallow, crass docu-soap about married couple Justin and Annabelle, who run FastLife, a matchmaking and speed dating company. They're forging a new marriage - will it survive their constant work for all those sexy, needy singles? That's some sick premise.
Connect with Mark Kelley on CBC News Network. CBC says: "Each weeknight, Connect with Mark Kelley turns the day's news into a personal experience. He peels back the layers behind the big stories that everyone is talking about and shows us what is missing." The "missing" is Kelley informing us what people are saying on Twitter and Facebook, as if that was a secret, and then overemoting about it. Look, if I want to overemote, I'll do it myself, watching this irritatingly self-aggrandizing hooey.
Right. That feels better.
Check local listings.
***
Airing tonight
Past Life (Fox, A, 9 p.m.) is a new drama series about "past-life detectives who investigate whether what is happening to you today is the result of who you were before." No, seriously it is. And it's as achingly bad as you'd suspect. We meet Dr. Kate McGinn (Kelli Giddish), a psychologist "dedicated to the study of the science of the soul." The good doctor totally believes in reincarnation and stuff. The opening episode, about a traumatized teenage boy, is witless, woeful, overblown nonsense. Unless "past life" stuff is your bag. In which case knock yourself out. But you'll pay for it in the next life.
The fifth estate (CBC NN, 10 p.m.) is a good examination of the case of Earl Jones, whose Ponzi scheme defrauded investors of $50-million over two decades. How was he able to get away with fraud for so long, the program asks. And raises questions about a bank that seemed oblivious. J.D.

Soured NYC deal portends property storm

Author: Slater, Joanna

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/soured-nyc-deal-portends-property-storm/docview/382581462/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Enter Tishman Speyer, one of New York's most high-profile developers, and BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset managers. Persuaded that they would be able to spruce up the apartments and jack up rents, the pair paid $5.4-billion for the complexes in 2006, the most expensive price ever for a residential property in the U.S. They also raised an additional $900-million to cover future expenses like interest payments and renovations.

Full text: Sale's failure seen as harbinger of trouble ahead in U.S. commercial real estate market
It's a deal so big - and so bad - that one observer mused it was the city's worst property transaction since a group of Native Americans were swindled out of the island of Manhattan by Dutch settlers.
Struck at the height of the real-estate boom, the $5.4-billion (U.S.) purchase of two storied New York apartment complexes finally crashed to earth in late January when the owner walked away, turning over the keys to a group of creditors.
The deal's failure is a harbinger of trouble ahead in the U.S. commercial real estate market, where prices have tumbled but many say the woes have just begun.
Much like overstretched homeowners, developers borrowed heavily to buy office buildings, shopping malls, hotels, and apartments across the U.S.
Now the bill is coming due. The number of such property loans going bad is set to climb for at least another year, experts say, provoking a new round of bank failures that will weigh on the economy for years after that.
Sifting through the debris of the deal for the two New York apartment complexes - Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village - shows how complicated the process can be. Whoever controls the property will face scores of investors manoeuvring to recover billions in losses, not to mention thousands of worried tenants.
"We are a little bit in uncharted territory here," says Sam Chandan, chief economist at Real Capital Analytics, a property research firm in New York. "It's the scale, the scope, the number of participants to the transaction."
The most likely candidate to take over: CWCapital, an arm of the Caisse de depôt et placement du Quebec, which is representing a group of lenders with the top claim to the property.
CWCapital is one of a handful of firms with a specialty that's in increasingly high demand: attempting to recover value from soured loans.
Compared to the housing market, commercial real estate runs on a slower metabolism, meaning it takes longer for the business to react to changes in the broader economy. The sector "was the last to get into the recession and will be the last to come out," says Aaron Bryson, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York.
The bad news is that once the slow-burning fuse is lit, it will take years to be extinguished. After the last recession ended in 2001, office vacancy rates didn't top out for another two years, and an actual improvement in the market didn't happen until early 2006, Mr. Chandan said.
The proportion of commercial real estate mortgages going bad won't peak until next year, predicts Thomas Fink, senior managing director of Trepp, a mortgage data firm. Sorting out the detritus of imploded deals - either by restructuring or liquidating them - will continue into 2015, he says.
Shouldering much of the losses will be scores of regional and local banks across the U.S., which are far more vulnerable to the sector than their larger counterparts. These banks stand to lose up to $300-billion on commercial real estate in the coming years, a recent Deutsche Bank report estimated. Hundreds of them are likely to fail as a direct consequence of such investments, it predicted.
While such failures likely won't rattle the financial system as a whole, they will echo through their communities, making an impact on local businesses and homeowners who depend on these banks for access to credit.
The U.S. Federal Reserve was so worried at the prospect of trouble ahead that in January it launched a nationwide training program for all of its bank examiners on how to assess banks that are struggling with bad commercial real-estate loans.
Sorting out the mess will take years - as shown by the tangled path ahead for New York's Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village.
Built in the 1940s by insurer Metlife to house veterans returning from the Second World War, the two complexes occupy a swath of lower Manhattan bordering the East River and encompass over 11,000 apartments.
In the ensuing decades, their brick facades and winding paths became an oasis for middle-class New Yorkers, who flocked to the rent-regulated apartments as market rents in the city soared.
Enter Tishman Speyer, one of New York's most high-profile developers, and BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset managers. Persuaded that they would be able to spruce up the apartments and jack up rents, the pair paid $5.4-billion for the complexes in 2006, the most expensive price ever for a residential property in the U.S. They also raised an additional $900-million to cover future expenses like interest payments and renovations.
All but $1.9-billion of the funds were borrowed, mainly in the form of commercial mortgages, which were then repackaged and sold in interest-bearing slices to hundreds of investors around the world.
None of the buyers' exuberant expectations materialized. Rents and property values in New York fell as the recession deepened. The plan to raise rents ran into fierce opposition from tenants and later from the State of New York's top court, which ruled last year that Tishman had improperly increased rents on 4,400 apartments, opening the door to more than $200-million in rebates.
By last month, the complexes were worth an estimated $1.9-billion, about a third of the purchase price. That means the investors who put up the original equity - among them two California pension funds and the Church of England - have seen their investments wiped out. Those who provided money for the mortgages, depending on the level of risk, will also take heavy, and in some cases total, losses. The owners defaulted on their loans, and at the end of January, said they would hand over the property to creditors rather than file for bankruptcy.
Now CWCapital, which represents the holders of the senior mortgages, must find a new manager to run the properties. Then it will need to figure out how much the property is worth and how much tenants are owed. And all the while, different types of creditors will be jockeying to protect their interests ahead of a potential renegotiation of the loans or a sale to a buyer. It's a process that could take years.
CWCapital is owned by Otera Capital, one of the Caisse's real estate arms. The Caisse suffered massive losses on its real-estate portfolio last year, which pushed it to write down $5.7-billion (Canadian) in investments in the first half of 2009.
An Otera spokesperson declined to comment on events in the U.S. CWCapital also wouldn't comment. The firm holds some of the repackaged slices of the property's mortgages, according to a person familiar with the transaction, which is why they were tapped to represent lenders.
In exchange for those services, CWCapital will likely earn fees according to the industry standard, which include 0.25 per cent annually of the total loan value.
The size of the mess at Stuyvesant Town prompted Willy Staley, writing on the website of Next American City, a quarterly magazine, to compare it to the purchase of the island of Manhattan by Dutchman Peter Minuit in 1626 (which, according to legend, took place in exchange for 60 guilders worth of trinkets).
Separated by 380 years, the two transactions "are completed unrelated," he wrote, "aside from the fact that they may go down in history together as the worst real estate deals to ever happen, ever."

Abstract: Chutzpah: The word fits the 44-year-old Israeli immigrant snugly. Since arriving in Canada 12 years ago, he's never had this many irons in this many fires generating this much financial and publicity heat. He's building a $1.7-billion project on Georgian Bay centred around a struggling town he bought for $100-million (U.S.) five years ago. He's putting up a mixed condo/office tower on one of the last skyscraper sites in Toronto's downtown core.

Full text: Gil Blutrich's been called a 'miniature Donald Trump' but his gamble on developing the King Eddy has many questioning his instincts
Gil Blutrich couldn't let the idea go. Last spring, whenever he visited the Pantages Hotel & Spa, one of his two boutique properties in downtown Toronto, he'd look out at St. Michael's Hospital across the street and say, "Why aren't we doing more business with them?"
The recession was walloping high-end hotels like his, so why not fill the empty rooms with recuperating patients and let OHIP pick up the tab? His staff told him that the provincial health insurance plan would never go for it, but, says a former employee, Mr. Blutrich just didn't understand why. It just made so much sense!
Chutzpah: The word fits the 44-year-old Israeli immigrant snugly. Since arriving in Canada 12 years ago, he's never had this many irons in this many fires generating this much financial and publicity heat. He's building a $1.7-billion project on Georgian Bay centred around a struggling town he bought for $100-million (U.S.) five years ago. He's putting up a mixed condo/office tower on one of the last skyscraper sites in Toronto's downtown core. And, to top it off, he's fighting a lawsuit launched by a group of Israeli investors. (His company, Skyline International Development Inc., denies the allegations.) Last fall he bid $52-million on the storied but notoriously unprofitable King Edward Hotel - a white elephant from which a succession of owners failed to squeeze a consistent profit - confident he could transform the nearly 100-year-old landmark into an urban destination despite the city's upcoming mini-invasion of five-star hotels. But he's proven he can deliver. "He's a true entrepreneur," says Andrew Van Buskirk, a former director of operations at Skyline. "He'll have these ideas, and out of 100, 80 are good, 10 are crap and 10 are brilliant."
THE PROMISED LAND
On a day in mid-December, Mr. Blutrich is nursing a nasty case of jet lag, having just returned from a 10-day investor-courting trip to Singapore and Israel. Still, seated in his airy corner office decorated with archival photos of Toronto and a replica of a steamship that used to ply the Great Lakes, he describes every project feature in the brochure-speak of his profession - "fantastic" and promising a "better lifestyle."
Mr. Blutrich has been in real estate his entire adult life. Born in a small, middle-class town 30 minutes outside Tel Aviv, he got into development while still a teenager. In 1998, looking to diversify his business, he moved with his wife and three children to Canada. Since then he's built his Toronto company, Skyline International Development Inc., into a $75-million business that owns and manages two luxury hotels, four spas, two golf courses, a ski resort and more than 700,000 square feet of office and commercial space, all in and around Toronto. An Israeli colleague once called him "a miniature Donald Trump."
In the first few years, he funnelled much of his money into condominiums he purchased and managed as short-term rentals on the investors' behalf. In 2004, he expanded the mixed condo-hotel model by opening the Pantages Hotel across from the Eaton Centre and, less than two years later, the Cosmopolitan. Aside from about 100 hotel rooms, each building also contained residential units, a development tactic which, at the time, was all the rage. "You could sell a condo at twice the amount per square foot if you put a luxury hotel in the building," says Matthew Opferkuch, general manager of the five-star Hazelton Hotel in Yorkville, which uses the same model.
But in October, 33 investors filed an $8-million lawsuit in Israel alleging that Mr. Blutrich and Skyline's various affiliates misrepresented the buildings' purpose and the potential profits. One investor, who owns a unit in the Cosmopolitan and insists on anonymity, says that none of the sales materials she received mentioned a hotel when she invested her life savings in the deal in the early 2000s.
The upshot of the Cosmopolitan becoming a hotel, the investor says, is that her property taxes have skyrocketed, as have the operating, sales and marketing expenses to which the investor contributed. What's more, "We are informed by local brokers that suites have been on the market for long periods of time, and there are no buyers," the investor says.
Jack Berkow, Skyline's lawyer, disputes the allegations, citing a disclosure statement for the Cosmopolitan that states the residential units may be rented "short term (i.e. daily)."
Mr. Blutrich added that in December, Skyline sold about 10 Cosmopolitan condos at over $650 per square foot; the original purchase price had been $525. "There is no loss. There is gain," he said.
HE TOOK A VILLAGE
Still, these words might not comfort residents of Port McNicoll. When Skyline bought the hamlet near Midland, Ont., five years ago, the community of some 1,500 families swooned over its grand plans for their economically depressed town. The company intended to reopen the port, shut down by Canadian Pacific in 1965, and build ye olde village along 11 kilometres of Georgian Bay waterfront to serve as a gateway to the Thirty Thousand Islands.
Just two problems: Port McNicoll has little tourism infrastructure, and in winter months it's a ghost town. So, two years ago, Skyline purchased the Horseshoe Valley ski complex about 20 kilometres from Port McNicoll, with the idea of linking the two into a year-round destination.
To make this bucolic region (already dubbed "Georgian Valley") a reality, however, Skyline needs the help of the provincial and federal governments, and has been lobbying - alongside the two municipalities - for development dollars. Paul Ward, Skyline's vice-president of land development, says that Skyline hopes to get some money commitments early this year.
If there's impatience in Port McNicoll with the slow pace of progress, Mara Burton, director of planning and development for the township, doesn't let on. "The community is very supportive," she says. "They've been waiting a long time."
Mr. Ward says that some 30 lots have been sold. That's not a lot for five years work, but until a more substantial tourism infrastructure exists, "there's not a lot of absorption there," he says. But Skyline sees the project as a 10-year haul. Mr. Blutrich is philosophical: "At Skyline, we're marathon runners, we're not sprinters."
VIVE LE ROI
Mr. Blutrich's bid to buy the King Eddy has also hit delays. Until the deal (which he describes as "very complex") is done mid-March, he won't reveal his plans, other than to say, "I think it's one of the very few landmark hotels we have in Canada and my dream is to maintain this historic feel."
Skyline insiders familiar with his plans say he hopes to spruce up the property and turn it into another hotel-condo hybrid. "It's a big gamble," says Mr. Opferkuch of the Hazelton. "It's tough enough to operate a luxury hotel and make a margin in this market." An entrenched union defies cost-cutting, and its location is a challenge.
Meanwhile, Toronto is about to fill up with high-end hotels. Mr. Blutrich interprets this five-star invasion as good news, because it will put Toronto more firmly on the international map and help raise the entire hospitality sector's prices.
With King Eddy in negotiation limbo, Mr. Blutrich is spinning new twists for Georgian Valley. That steamship that hangs behind his desk? It's the replica of a steamer that used to service Port McNicoll. "And it's not here," he says. "It's in the States. Michigan. Under a huge American flag!"
So he's trying to push the government to repatriate that piece of Canadian heritage, hoping to turn it into a tourist attraction in his redeveloped port. A difficult proposition ensnarled in red tape? Maybe - but it just makes so much sense!

A THOUSAND DREAMS
Vancouver's Downtown Eastside and the Fight for Its Future
By Larry Campbell, Neil Boyd and Lori Culbert

******
If Vancouver doesn't make you a little crazy with grief or laughter, you probably aren't paying enough attention. Canada's major Pacific port is getting a lot of attention these days, what with its lucrative globalized trade, the imminent arrival of the Olympic circus and the vertiginous excitement of a real-estate market on crack. Add to this the frequent shootouts as the city's drug gangs settle territorial disputes with AK-47s, and the quotidian comedy of errors as politicians from all three levels of government tap-dance and manoeuvre around the city's baffling problems, and you have an urban landscape guaranteed to appall and fascinate.
Vancouver is any writer's dream subject, whether the genre is poetry, such as Malcolm Lowry's searing visions of hell on Hastings Street, the novel, such as Timothy Taylor's comic masterpiece Stanley Park , urban history, such as the magisterial and entertaining works of Chuck Davis, or volumes of earnest social analysis, produced by the cubic yard during the city's tumultuous history. Here are two new contributions to the city's canon.
Vancouver Special is an entertaining and intelligent collection of essays by Charles Demers, a multitalented local stand-up comic, TV personality and social critic. (He's also recently published a debut novel, The Prescription Errors .) Demers writes with impressive erudition and wit about everything from the distinctive and graceless Vancouver residential design that gives the book its title to the city's approaches to racism, pot, anarchism, rich people and the homeless. There are, of course, a few passages in which his attempt to find the comic element in essentially serious subject matter comes off as strained, but these are mercifully few.
Demers also provides a wonderful guide to Vancouver's many neighbourhoods, a more pungent and nuanced account than you would get from the chamber of commerce, but a loving and accurate view of the city's dizzying diversity nonetheless. His portrait of Commercial Drive, one of the city's most interesting bohemian enclaves and his current home, is particularly vivid, but he is also impressive on Chinatown, the gay village along Davie Street and the Little India neighbourhood around Main and 49th. Readers who loved Stan Persky's classic book of Vancouver essays, Buddy's , or Bruce Serafin's Stardust , will find Demers's blend of acute observation, wit, intelligent reflection and lapidary prose similarly attractive.
One of the most moving chapters in Vancouver Special addresses the ongoing tragedy of the city's Downtown Eastside. The chapter opens with an account of a CBC-TV special that featured haggard drug addicts, the exploitative pharmacists who prey on them, pathetic anecdotes about petty crime and an interview with a hard-boiled cop who has grown old and cynical. The kicker to this otherwise unremarkable account, Demers tells us, is that the special ran six decades ago. Some urban nightmares seem to go on forever.
While Demers takes on the whole city, former Vancouver mayor and now Liberal Senator Larry Campbell, criminologist Neil Boyd and journalist Lori Culbert focus on the Downtown Eastside and its poverty and addiction-ravaged streets in A Thousand Dreams . They bring a rich body of varied experience to bear, and the book's lucid prose - most probably the work of Culbert, an award-winning Vancouver Sun writer - makes their policy suggestions and the storytelling that supports them equally accessible. Some of their stories horrify, especially the account of police and public indifference long after neighbourhood activists suspected a serial killer was preying on sex-trade workers in Vancouver.
The otherwise impressively fair-minded and persuasive work is marred by a few puzzling omissions that seem hard to explain as anything other than lapses into professional or political spite. Campbell's left-wing opponents within his own caucus during his term as mayor, for example, receive little narrative attention, and the explosive fracturing of his majority - which might have been able to do more to address the tragedy of the Downtown Eastside absent his heavy-handed leadership - does not, perhaps unsurprisingly, get the attention it deserves. And the work of Simon Fraser University researcher (and Neil Boyd colleague) John Lowman, which brilliantly documents the lethal stupidity of Canadian prostitution law, is mentioned only once, and parenthetically at that.
Most of the book's suggestions for reform - saner prostitution and drug policies, adequate social housing and more effective outreach to the vulnerable - are sound and have been heard before. What remains to be seen is whether we can muster the political will to make them work. If that long-deferred goal is finally achieved, books like these will have played a role in making it possible. In the meantime, no one in Vancouver, or the nation, should miss these two remarkable and valuable works.
Tom Sandborn is a writer and social-justice activist who has lived in Vancouver since 1967.

Reading Vancouver
ALONG THE NO. 20 LINE
By Rolf Knight
Here are three books anyone who wants to understand my town should consider. Start with Rolf Knight's little-known classic of Vancouver's working class history, Along the No. 20 Line: Reminiscences of the Vancouver Waterfront (New Star, 1980), a memoir of growing up along the city's harbour in the 1940s. The No. 20 was a streetcar that ran from the city's eastern edge to the downtown core, and at every stop Knight tells vivid stories of those whose labour built the city.
BLOOD SPORTS
By Eden Robinson
Eden Robinson's Blood Sports (McClelland & Stewart, 2006) is a well crafted noir masterpiece set years later in the east side Vancouver that Knight describes. Deftly embedding a gritty story of family pain, drugs and violence in an artfully evoked mythic background, Robinson creates a vision of the city that would alarm the tourist bureau but delights the attentive reader.
STANLEY PARK
By Timothy Taylor
Timothy Taylor's Stanley Park (Knopf Canada, 2001) is another Vancouver delight, moving smoothly from comedy in the kitchens of the city's luxury restaurants to pathos in the homeless camps of the city's largest urban park. Along the way, the book portrays a tender if eccentric father-son relationship and a decades-old murder mystery - not to mention a gourmet meal that features free-range raccoon.

Full text: lmclaren@globeandmail.com
Warning: This column contains dry-eyed realism, economic frustration and intergenerational resentment. Parents or young people wishing to preserve a sense of blind optimism about the future are advised to turn the page. Reader discretion is advised.
So you thought Generation X was angry? Baby, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Gen X - strictly defined as the generational cohort born in the two decades following the baby boom - came of age during the recession of the 1990s, while the generation that followed - variously called Gen Y or the Echo Boom in the media - is bearing the true brunt of the economic collapse. As the voices of Gen X, Douglas Coupland and his ilk complained about having to take on McJobs in veal-fattening pens, but today's graduates should be so lucky. Times are tough, and there's no relief in sight.
I have expressed my indignation at the overlooked plight of youth in the wake of the global downturn in this space before, but it turns out that I may have underestimated the true cost of both this recession and our place in history.
My fellow Gen Xers and those younger than us have been robbed of our rightful inheritance, says David Willetts, author of the recently published book The Pinch: How the Baby Boomers Took Their Children's Future - And Why They Should Give It Back .
While the book, which became available in Canada this week on Amazon.ca, is an exhaustive social history of postwar Britain to the present, the author's central thrust is this: In their embrace of their beloved counterculture of the 1960s, boomers across the Western world adopted a kind of radical individualism that broke with their parents' ways and eventually became the mainstream. Instead of feeling beholden to the generation before them - and, by extension, to future generations - the boomers saw fit to do precisely as they pleased. This included cool stuff like listening to rock 'n' roll, getting married young and burning bras, but also not-so-cool-stuff, like getting divorced, going into debt and throwing all their money into what they blithely believed was an eternally rising real-estate market.
Well, we all know better now, don't we? Unfortunately, though, it's too late. The damage has been done. And that damage, according to Willetts, can be summed up in one very trendy-sounding word: fragmentation.
In essence, fragmentation means more people living alone, working alone and, to use a hippie phrase, "following their bliss." The problem is, all this radical self-involvement doesn't help young people coming up through the ranks or society as a whole. It's good for one powerful generational cohort: the boomers. But who will pay the price? Their children, who, in fact, are already paying it.
According to The Pinch , 40 per cent of unemployed people in Britain right now are 25 or younger; by comparison, those aged 50 or older own four-fifths of the nation's wealth. In Canada, the situation is similar, although not quite as dramatic. The overall pattern, Willetts writes, is "a completely raw deal for the young people today compared to the experience of their parents."
As a 54-year-old Conservative MP and shadow cabinet minister for education and skills, Willetts (whose cabinet nickname is "Two Brains") has benefited enormously from the luck of his birth date. "The impetus to write the book," he tells me, "came from listening to my wife worry about how our teenaged sons were ever going to be able to get onto the property ladder or have the same advantages we had." (Short answer: They probably won't.)
And while the current credit crunch too shall pass, things are not likely to get much better for millennials in the long run. Willetts predicts that, once the inevitable pension crisis hits and the boomers' offspring (finally employed) find themselves working for companies whose profits are being diverted to plug gaps in schemes not open to younger staff, the real resentment will start. "The demographic environment is now changing - and will be one of the biggest shocks to our economy since [the Second World War]," he says. "Having had easy sailing with favourable tailwinds, we will be battling against demographic headwinds for the next 20 or 30 years."
Yes, you read that right: He's talking about a 20-to-30-year decline from the heights of the postwar advantages that boomers enjoyed.
This drop goes far beyond the kind of intergenerational griping we've heard much of in recent decades. It makes the main characters in movies such as Reality Bites and books such as Generation X look positively sophomoric in their combat-booted disappointment at not having been handed groovy media jobs right out of university.
For the generation that followed mine, the stakes are much higher. The problems they are grappling with and will continue to grapple with are not existential but fundamental. In Reality Bites , suffering the indignity of folding sweaters at the Gap was among the protagonists' biggest hardships, but that pales next to such 21st-century realities as being laid off at 25 or getting saddled with a subprime mortgage. How can you "lower" yourself to take a job at your local factory, moreover, when there are no more factories left?
After putting the bulk of their money in real estate and gambling away the rest on the markets, baby boomers are now holding on to their jobs and pensions for dear life. And who can blame them? The fact that subsequent generations will be forced into spending their prime earning years paying for their retirement with no promise of an inheritance is not the bommers' problem but all of ours. That's how ultra individualism works.
And it promises a raw deal indeed - one that Willetts likens to opening up a treasure chest and finding a bunch of IOUs that now have to be paid.
As a politician, Willetts doesn't want his book to be a bad-news story, but his solutions to this demographic quagmire sound a bit flimsy to me.
Among his recommendations are better career counselling, work and housing arrangements that intermingle generations and an increase in the retirement age in an effort to defer mass pension payouts.
Here's another one: The next time you're in a bar and the harried twentysomething cocktail waitress forgets your order, don't stiff her. Instead, leave her a big fat tip. At this rate, the poor kid is going to need it.

Abstract: "What we're going to put up is going to blow Toronto away - it's going to light it up," Mr. [Ian Gillespie] said. "The reality is most of the other guys don't get it and they never will. If you look around at a lot of the [buildings] that get built, it's really sad."

Full text: Developer Ian Gillespie has reimagined Vancouver's skyline, building towers that will define the city for visitors during the Winter Olympics
At the corner of Cordova and Burrard, a one-line poem by British artist Liam Gillick wraps the facade of the new Fairmont Pacific Rim. The 60-centimetre-tall steel letters repeat for 17 storeys: "lying on top of a building the clouds looked no nearer than when I was lying on the street."
Inside, a few weeks before tomorrow's opening, construction workers buzzed through the hotel lobby, working on final touches. A marble staircase, the stone quarried in Italy and cut in China, was sheathed in a protective yellow coating. Around the corner, a trolley carrying mirrors rolled through what will be a café/bakery/library/gift shop, the walls adorned with dark American walnut.
With the Winter Olympics just a week away, Ian Gillespie is poised to unveil his latest creation, the $450-million luxury hotel-condominium tower on Vancouver's harbour.
The 48-year-old developer is among Canada's most original builders, blending daring design with development savvy while focusing on commercial success. "People can build a fantastic building and lose money. It has to make financial sense. Otherwise it's cheating," Mr. Gillespie said. "We put soul in. We build Ferraris."
Mr. Gillespie, president of privately held Westbank Holdings Ltd., makes big bets in an industry where names and fortunes are slowly built, but can collapse quickly. Westbank and regular partner Ben Yeung of Vancouver's Peterson Investment Group Inc. are behind some of Canada's most ambitious developments, including Vancouver's $350-million Shangri-La hotel-condo, the city's tallest building, and the $450-million Shangri-La under construction in Toronto.
At the Fairmont, the public art goes beyond the poem: part of another side of the building shimmers in stainless steel, punctuated by 166,333 circles of varying sizes and accentuated by 75,385 bumps and dimples. Step back, and an image of the local rain forest emerges.
"Not every developer would be so adventurous," said James Cheng, the Fairmont's 62-year-old architect, a protegé of Arthur Erickson and one of the best-known leaders of Vancouverism - a style of architecture and urban philosophy that is all about density and design.
Westbank grapples with the dual challenge of selling high-end real estate and relying on long-term revenue from its hotel customers, such as Fairmont and Shangri-La, aiming to establish five-star businesses in a country where ultrahigh-priced hotel rooms aren't all that common.
Westbank made it through the financial crisis partly by using modest leverage, as property prices in Vancouver and Toronto managed to avoid the dramatic plunges seen in other countries.
But high-end development isn't an easy win: Plans by others to build Shangri-La projects in New York and Chicago failed, broken by the recession.
In Vancouver, Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Cheng have reimagined the city's once-drab skyline, building towers that become instant icons and will define the city this month for the hundreds of thousands of visitors, and hundreds of millions of television viewers, during the Winter Olympics.
Mr. Gillespie, who was raised in the Vancouver suburb of Port Coquitlam, was a track star in the 800 metres and almost made it to the Olympics himself in 1984. He earned his MBA at the University of Toronto and returned to the real estate business in Vancouver.
He was barely 30 years old when he started Westbank and established a relationship with Abbey Woods Development Ltd., the Canadian branch of the sprawling empire of Malaysia's Robert Kuok. With a string of suburban shopping malls anchored by grocery stores in development, Mr. Gillespie met Mr. Cheng, which sparked Westbank's evolution.
"My background, shopping centres, wasn't terribly aesthetically or intellectually rewarding," Mr. Gillespie recalled. "I was looking for a challenge and Jim offered an education."
Fully established in Vancouver, the challenge of building in Canada's biggest city excites Mr. Gillespie. The Toronto Shangri-La is another mixed-use building, a hotel-condo, a strategy that Westbank and Peterson believe is the future of urban development in North America.
"What we're going to put up is going to blow Toronto away - it's going to light it up," Mr. Gillespie said. "The reality is most of the other guys don't get it and they never will. If you look around at a lot of the [buildings] that get built, it's really sad."
Situated on Toronto's broad University Avenue, the 66-storey Shangri-La is about to rise from the ground, with completion set for 2012. Advertised as "A World Address," it will be Toronto's tallest residential building. Most of the 352 units have been sold; prices range from $850,000 to $16.9-million penthouses.
"If people didn't know about him before in Toronto, they'll know about him now. It's only going to get bigger. He understands who he is selling to. You walk into the Shangri-La in Vancouver, it's frankly unlike anything else in the city," said Bill Stone, executive managing director at broker Colliers International Hotels in Toronto.
Westbank has also built projects in Victoria, Edmonton and Dallas, and a $310-million Calgary hotel-condo is in the works. The company is busy securing a second site in Toronto, working on several new ideas in Vancouver and is looking at prospects in the United States.
"We have the highest regard for Ian," said Jim Pattison, Canada's fourth-richest man, who worked with Mr. Gillespie on the shopping malls, putting in the grocery stores that served as anchor tenants. Most recently, Mr. Pattison put a store in the $375-million Woodward's project, which converted a former Vancouver department store in the city's run-down Downtown Eastside into an elaborate mixed-use facility - condos and social housing, commercial space and university art school.
"He's creative, innovative," Mr. Pattison said. "He's not a traditional thinker."

Full text:   In the United States, you can find and bid on a house using an iPhone. So why is it that in Canada, much of the information prospective home owners need is a tightly held secret, unlocked only by real estate agents? It's the question at the heart of a dispute between the industry and the Competition Bureau -- the resolution of which could radically change how houses are bought and sold
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
One day in 2002, a self-professed computer nerd named Glenn Kelman scratched his head. Why was it, he wondered, that he could get more information about a $20 book for sale at Amazon.com than he could for a $500,000 home listed on the national Multiple Listing Service?
Later that year, Mr. Kelman founded Redfin.com. He describes the site as a cross between Century 21 and E*Trade. A more pointed description would be to call Seattle-based Redfin a dart aimed at the heart of the real estate industry. Internet-savvy companies like Redfin are breaking MLS's lock on listings data, which the industry uses to ensure that consumers buy and sell houses the traditional way: through real estate agents who are paid hefty commissions.
The move hasn't endeared Redfin to the real estate industry.
"I get death threats," Mr. Kelman says. "I gave the finger to an industry that only exists to charge a commission on the most important buying decision you'll ever make. We save people money by automating most of the process."
The battle to free real estate data is well advanced in the United States. Now, it is coming to a head in Canada as the technological attack on the old order is bolstered by both industry rebels and government: The federal Competition Bureau accuses the industry of dampening competition and consumer choice. To consumers whose houses often sell in a few days - but still net agents tens of thousands of dollars in commissions - Canada's real estate boom has made MLS's monopoly on information seem all the more anachronistic.
Like sectors such as travel and retailing before it, the multibillion-dollar Canadian real estate industry is finally facing a reckoning with the Internet's power to make data free and open.
Watchdog intervenes
"There is a lack of information and a lack of transparency in this industry that simply does not exist in any other industry," says Bill McMullin, an industry dissident who owns Halifax-based ViewPoint Realty. "The real estate industry may be uncomfortable with this, but once you automate a lot of that data, you circumvent the need for a realtor. Things are changing, and they are changing quickly."
In 2009, 465,251 homes changed hands on the Realtor.ca system, at an average price of $320,333. Owned by the Canadian Real Estate Association, the database amasses listings from Canada's 101 local real estate boards. Only registered real estate professionals can obtain key data such as selling prices, and only they may use the site to connect buyers and sellers.
CREA tightened its access policy in 2007, after rival real estate websites such as Toronto-based Housing123.com emerged. The interlopers downloaded data from MLS and enhanced it to draw consumers to their own services.
But the clampdown backfired, catching the attention of the federal Competition Bureau, which told the CREA that its rules "restricted consumer choice and limited the scope of alternative business models." The bureau questions whether consumers should continue to be forced to employ a registered real estate agent to represent them throughout the entire listing and sale process on MLS, including the shepherding of all offers and counteroffers.
In a letter written last October, CREA said it hoped to resolve its differences with the Competition Bureau by Christmas. The bureau says it is willing to wait for a negotiated settlement, but it will move unilaterally if necessary. CREA says it needs more time to figure out what to do next.
"We've had a number of meetings with the bureau and are trying very hard to understand their concerns and come to a mutually acceptable solution," says Katherine Kay, outside counsel for CREA.
Any resolution is apt to erode real estate agents' traditional gatekeeper status. One possible resolution would allow a seller's name and address to appear on a listing so they can be contacted directly by potential buyers. A bigger step would be to allow homeowners to list their homes on MLS for a small fee, then negotiate the sale of their homes without the help of an agent. As the process becomes commodified, consumers stand to benefit in lower transaction costs.
The American Way
The transformation of the real estate industry in the United States was spurred by a 2007 Department of Justice order to relax restrictions on how brokers could use MLS information. The change seeded dozens of companies that created feature-rich websites offering à la carte services as an alternative to the traditional commissioned agent.
House hunters can find and bid on a home using one of dozens of Web-based applications. A single map can show which houses are for sale, the area's crime rate, average test scores at the local elementary school and the location of the nearest Starbucks.
At Zillow.com - created by the founders of travel site Expedia.com - consumers are flooded with information. Not only do they see a home's complete sales history and average tax bill, they can find out the assessed value of each house on the street and other neighbourhood information, such as how many married couples live on the block.
At Mr. Kelman's Redfin, commissioned agents are replaced with salaried (and registered) agents. Consumers are expected to do most of their own legwork, and to deal with an agent only if they hit a roadblock.
"Our agents aren't paid to make it rain," Mr. Kelman says. "They are paid to serve the customers who want to be served. Ninety per cent of the cost of real estate is finding customers, and the Web can do that for us."
While Redfin does charge commission - about 3 per cent - it gives half of the payment back to the customer when a deal closes. Thus the average cost on a $500,000 sale is $7,500, compared to a traditional commission of $25,000.
Mr. Kelman says his privately-held company posted its first monthly profit in June and is generating $20-million (U.S.) of revenue a year.
While American consumers are using their phones to scope out houses they drive by, the best Canadians can hope for is CREA's low-tech mobile website, which provides the phone number of the relevant agent for a property. And that only works if you know the property's six-digit Multiple Listing Service number, which someone whizzing past in a car would not. A more feature-rich version is expected to be in place by summer.
Consumers can get selling prices, room measurements and a couple of snapshots for a property on the official industry portal, Realtor.ca. But the most valuable market intelligence - such as what the property sold for in the past, and recent sale prices in the neighbourhood - is kept out of the consumer's reach, forcing prospective home buyers to call an agent. CREA and its affiliates are strict about keeping it that way: Even agents who simply want to repackage such real estate data online into more user-friendly formats as a marketing tool have found themselves slapped down by local real estate boards.
The Canadian Roadblock
The real estate industry's lock on information is one reason why the process of buying and selling a home in Canada has changed little since online real estate listings began in 1996, even as other customer-service-intensive industries such as travel and tourism have seen radical technological transformations. An estimated 90 per cent of all home sales in Canada are still done in the traditional manner.
If the Competition Bureau gets its way, consumers would be able to pay a flat fee to an agent to have their home listed, and then choose how involved the agent would be through the rest of the process.
But even before the CREA settles with the Competition Bureau, some smaller brokers are brazenly defying local real estate associations by providing consumers with richer data than the associations allow.
Mr. McMullin, of Halifax's ViewPoint Realty, has spent close to $1-million on the company's feature-rich website - he's downloaded all of his region's listings onto his server, and then enhanced them with previous sale prices and maps. The service far surpasses what's available on realtor.ca, and he's counting on it to win him customers in a competitive market.
He's navigating tricky territory - in the past several years, local real estate boards have shut down several brokers who have attempted to repackage data without permission. The industry won a key court ruling in Ontario in December against Toronto-based realtysellers.com. The judge said the upstart company's use of data violated the standard agreement between brokers and real estate boards. He added that he wouldn't speculate on whether the industry engages in anti-competitive behaviour by keeping its own members from using the data as they wish.
Lawyer Lawrence Dale, who represented realtysellers.com, said the judge's decision effectively established that the industry's rules are restrictive. "In the United States, the government found that these identical rules were anti-competitive and the Department of Justice had them removed," he said following the decision.
In another new model distinct from the likes of realtysellers.com, Ottawa's Ziglu Real Estate Brokerage employs traditional real estate agents, but charges a flat fee to get someone's listing on MLS. The agents then take a barebones approach to the process, leaving the consumers to do the bulk of the legwork.
Ziglu charges half the commission of most realtors, and the company plans on dropping it altogether if the Competition Bureau gives consumers more access to MLS.
"We're obviously counting on the bureau to come through and allow people to order specific real estate services in the same way they'd order a pizza," says Ziglu's founder, Gilles Menard. "Right now we still have to represent the seller through the process, but we're expecting changes. Our whole business model is based on high volumes and low prices."
A market too small?
There's a good reason the Canadian industry is fighting to keep its listings system exclusive, says Phil Soper, chief executive officer of Brookfield Real Estate Services, a subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. that owns real estate brokerages Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd. in Canada and Real Living Real Estate LLP in the United States.
With a great database comes great responsibility, he says. An advantage of the traditional system is that anyone using MLS has an agent to help them through what can be a confusing process.
"Most of that information needs to be taken in the proper context and protected from mistakes," he says. "With a central system, you are protecting the customer's listing - it is in the hands of people who constantly update their skills.
"Anyone who suggests that somehow organized real estate is protectionist, and created a model that others can't make a living at by charging lower fees, is saying something completely false," he adds. "The problem is they can't attract high-performance salespeople and still make a buck - the best agents will make the best money and want to work where that is possible. The only reason someone would compete on price is because they can't compete on service."
As well, there's a reason a high-traffic site such as Redfin has only just turned its first profit - there is little money to made offering cut-rate services. The model may not work in a market as small as Canada's, according to Mr. Soper.
"You look at something like Zillow and it can function with 0.2 per cent market share," he says. "In Canada, you can't keep your doors open with numbers like that. It's like that in all our industries - we have a handful of real estate companies, a handful of banks. That's because just to exist, you need a pretty big chunk of market share."
The upstarts disagree - and are anxiously watching the Competition Board for clarity on which services they can offer. Redfin considered entering Canada last year, Mr. Kelman says, but decided to wait until the regulatory issues were resolved. Meanwhile, Mr. McMullin wants to sell his tech services to the big brokerages, and Ziglu expects a crush of customers the minute it can start to hive off portions of a transaction.
Most people in the industry realize they are losing their monopoly on information. Royallepage.ca, long a leading real estate site in Canada, has fallen behind a site that only dabbles in listings - kijiji.ca, a free online classified service similar to Craigslist.
"Some in my industry feel that it will be a disaster if and when the rules change," Mr. Soper says. "Yet as we debate, Kijiji grows in popularity. That doesn't mean the world doesn't need realtors - it means the world needs better agents who are trustworthy and knowledgeable and can walk them through what is usually one of the most financially significant transactions of their lives."

I prefer that my socks and trousers not match precisely. I'm happy to wear grey socks with a grey flannel suit, as long as the socks have light blue polka dots to pick up my blue shirt, or a green and yellow check to riff dashingly off my tie.
Alas, this will offend the city of Vancouver.
On the eve of hosting the 2010 Winter Olympics, the biggest hoohaw the former lumber town has ever known, the city fathers have issued a 141-page Protocol Manual that tells Vancouverites how to shake hands, smile, point, sit, stand, think, talk, dress and behave. The message is crystal: We don't want our fancy visitors to think we're hicks. To judge from the protocol guide, the authorities consider the city's residents as sophisticated as a band of damp gorillas.
Please do not misunderstand me: I am not about to do the eastern-Canadian, passive-aggressive, Toronto thing that Vancouverites hate, which is to decry Vancouver as a beautiful but empty-headed woman you long to sleep with and then can't wait to ditch so that you can talk about something other than the muscle tone of her thighs.
Vancouver has always been unspeakably beautiful, but the Olympics stand to launch it into the global stratosphere.
At that point the city will completely replace Toronto and Montreal and (really?) Ottawa, which actually has more residents than Vancouver, as the go-to city in the mind of the world, when the mind of the world thinks of Canada - especially the mind of Asia, which is going to control most of the money on the planet for the next 200 years.
Vancouver's manners, on the other hand, reveal the blemishes of insecurity that still be-zit an adolescent city, for all the covering hype. When a local website published the protocol rules this week, hundreds of online Vancouverites spat in the face of being told how to behave. This is vintage Vancouver whining, harking back to its working-class past. But this time the whiners have cause.
Clothes (in Vancouver, where you can go for days without seeing a tie or a crease) are suddenly crucial: "A neat appearance isn't enough. You must be exemplary all the time. Others will infer qualities of your [city] from your appearance and behaviour."
The tone is hectoring and demands complete submission: Faced with a helpless visitor, "there is nothing too demeaning, too demanding or just plain beneath you."
The binder offers instructions on how to listen ("Lean forward slightly and look directly at the person who is speaking"), how to smile (" 'gently' and with sincerity"), and how to point politely (section 7.3, Using Proper Hand Signals: "Use an open hand").
"Try not to be too chatty," the guide suggests, lest one be confronted with (section 5.8) Embarrassing Situations. "Try to move the individual out of hearing range of others, and quietly let them know 'Your trousers zipper is open.' "
No wonder an online Vancouverite dryly responded, "So ... I guess farting is out of the question."
Questions of etiquette always pop up when prosperity and social mobility threaten the comfortable stability of a city. The Vancouver Olympics will be many things to Vancouver, and one of them is a two-week-long, globally televised, real-estate ad. The city pooh-bahs want to ensure the natives don't scare away prospective buyers.
"We've become the Geneva of the North Pacific," a well-connected Vancouver businessman explained the other day. He has been watching this happen since Expo 86. "People from Asia come to educate their kids, to have operations and cosmetic surgery, and in general have an experience that is non-Asian."
The Olympics, he insists, will lure more Asians, and mainland Chinese and Americans and everyone else to boot.
Vancouverites are aware of this. A fortnight ago, when I was last in Vancouver, it rained for two-and-a-half days straight - and I do mean non-stop, hard, day-and-night, without a single ray of sunshine, for more than 50 hours.
There was so much rain the city had a baggy, amniotic feel, as if we were all waiting to be born. People were cranky: The first ten locals I met derided the Olympics and their conforming presence. When the sun finally broke, the men and women of Vancouver streamed for the light like shad to a screen door.
To beat the rain I decided to take a ride on the brand-new Canada Line subway that connects the downtown, via the west side and the Olympic Village, to the front door of Vancouver's international airport - door to door in 22 minutes, for $3.75. Brilliant.
The Canada Line is a pretty subway - clean, with that new-subway smell. The corridor of each subway car sports vertical stanchions for standing passengers to hold onto. They're shaped like the wire frame of a paint roller on end, except they're citrus yellow and stand out like blossoms.
There were 20 people on the platform in front of me, waiting to climb on. A car slid to a stop. The doors opened. The crowd took a single step in and then stopped, blocking the entrance. They were still learning how to ride the underground. It was kind of sweet.
"Could you move in, please?" I said in what I considered to be a friendly-but-authoritative, big-city voice. "So the rest of us can get on?" Every face in the car turned to me in shock. A man in the crowd had spoken out loud!
That's when I realized how quiet the streets of Vancouver still are, how little its residents kibitz in public. Their minds are elsewhere, possibly contemplating the beauty around them, and wondering how much the rules will change now that their city is renting out Paradise.

Full text:   Debt-embattled company keeps paring down assets as it tries to avoid auction by lenders
Intrawest ULC has sold its second ski resort in three months, this time unloading Panorama Mountain Village as the heavily indebted owner of Winter Olympics venue Whistler Blackcomb tries to stave off a planned auction of its assets by lenders threatening foreclosure.
Even with the sale, observers yesterday said New York-based Fortress Investment Group LLC, which bought Intrawest for $2.8-billion in 2006 at the peak of the real estate bubble, is likely to still lose control of the resort operator. Olympic ski races on Whistler Mountain are not expected to be affected.
The price for Panorama - located in southeastern British Columbia - was not disclosed but the buyer, a new company led by B.C. real estate developer Rick Jensen, said it was far less than the estimated $100-million (U.S.) paid by Utah-based Powdr Corp. to Intrawest late last year for Copper Mountain in Colorado.
A portion of the Copper proceeds went to reduce Intrawest debt but Fortress didn't pay the full $524-million due in December, which led lenders to push Intrawest toward foreclosure with an auction of assets set for Feb. 19 - right in the middle of the Olympic Winter Games.
The value of Fortress's equity is reported to be down 96 per cent from its purchase of Intrawest in 2006. Fortress could avoid the auction by putting Intrawest into court protection from creditors but its equity would likely be wiped out by such a move. Fortress, a hedge fund operator and private equity player, has tried to convince lenders to refinance debt owed with a new five-year loan.
"It seems very likely the lenders will take it over," said James Brander, a business professor at the University of British Columbia. "Whistler will keep operating. The Olympics are fine."
The situation is "complex," said Intrawest spokesman Ian Galbraith. The company's official position is unchanged from last week when the auction notice was posted.
"Serious" talks are ongoing with lenders to refinance the debt and business at Intrawest continues as usual, the company said in last week's statement. Mr. Galbraith yesterday described the auction as a "tactic that our lenders are using."
Another source close to the company described the planned auction as "brinkmanship."
Fortress did not return a call for comment. It has not commented publicly on the situation, beyond oblique remarks during quarterly financial conference calls.
A spokesman for Davidson Kempner Capital Management LLC, one of the main lenders, declined to comment on the Panorama sale yesterday.
"Fortress is cornered," said business professor Lindsay Meredith at Simon Fraser University. "The banks have pretty much had it with Fortress."
The deal for Panorama is slated to close next week. The new owners plan to build more real estate at Panorama, expand the beginner terrain at the mountain and make it Canada's No. 1 destination for skiing families, Mr. Jensen said.
Mr. Jensen led a group of 18 investors - owners of vacation homes at the resort and local business people - who have formed Panorama Mountain Village Inc. to make the purchase. Mr. Jensen is co-owner of a development company that started building for Intrawest at Panorama in 2000.
Intrawest bought Panorama in 1993 when the ski area was losing money and developed it in the model of Whistler Blackcomb, two large mountains underpinned by lots of expensive vacation real estate. Panorama has about 200,000 skier visits each winter, which is roughly one-eighth of the traffic at Whistler Blackcomb.
Mr. Galbraith said Intrawest's new strategy is to focus on its larger resorts that can attract international guests.
Intrawest now owns eight winter resorts, including Blue Mountain in Ontario and Mont Tremblant in Quebec, as well as a golf-beach resort in Florida.

"What a difference a year makes," says agent Bruce Lasuta.
Last summer he listed this 1,816 sq. ft. home at $429,000. After 133 days, "we found that buyers were just too nervous to commit to purchasing real estate when the six o'clock news overwhelmed them with night after night of bad economic times," he says.
When he re-listed the home this year, 64 days on the market brought numerous viewings, interested buyers and a sale.
"The buying public is beginning to realize that the sun will continue to rise tomorrow," says Mr. Lasuta.
This three-bedroom home was custom built in 1995.
It has 24 foot ceilings, exposed log beams, wood-framed double glazed windows, pine wood floors, wrap around decks, a metal roof and natural cedar siding.
"This is a West Coast contemporary-styled home, and the way it blends into the surrounding woods would have made Frank Lloyd Wright mighty proud," says Mr. Lasuta.
The house sits on a 12,315 sq. ft. wooded lot and is within walking distance to the beach and just a few minutes outside of Sechelt.
The new owners of this home are a "family from Vancouver who appreciate the uniqueness of its construction and the quality of the lifestyle that our local community offers," says Mr. Lasuta.

If you are in the market for a ski chalet or maybe a year-round retirement home in the Georgian Bay Triangle, a word of advice: Start looking now. The next six months could see a boom in both new and resale properties in areas such as Collingwood and Blue Mountain.
What happens after that, however, is anyone's guess. The new harmonized sales tax kicks in July 1, instantly raising prices.
On what am I basing my predictions? Nothing fancy, just the usual indicators: measurable demand, available supply, and shifting demographics, drawn from figures supplied by the Georgian Triangle Real Estate Board and industry insiders.
Board president Andres Paara says residential sales figures cover three main markets: recreational properties such as cottages and chalets; retirement and semi-retirement homes; and demand from locals for year-round housing. The first two represent about two-thirds of annual sales. The largest market segment by far includes buyers from the Greater Toronto Area.
The winter months of last year were tough on housing, he says. "From October of 2008 through early April of 2009, almost nothing got sold or built. Then, in spring, sales really started taking off again."
Because little got built, the demand was filled mainly by resale properties. The board ended the year reporting sales of 1,857 homes, up 8 per cent from 2008. The total dollar value of sales was up 10 per cent; and just 15 per cent off 2007, which was a record year.
That strong finish took its toll on inventory - the number of resale listings. They finished the year at 5,875 homes, down 2 per cent from 2008.
So, with supply of resale homes down and demand strong, have conditions improved so much that builders are willing once again to start turning out new chalets and retirement homes?
Morris Kansun, president of Sierra Building Group of Markham, says he certainly is. Sierra is in the midst of its third major recreational and retirement project in the Triangle since 2000. He says that by his own estimate, Sierra accounted for between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of all ski chalets built in the area in the year or two leading up to the recession.
"The market is driven by demand from the GTA," he says. "And that demand has changed. When we first started, we focused on estate lots and homes that sold in the millions right in the town of Blue Mountain.
"Today we are in the middle of developing Tanglewood, which is between two golf courses and close to the ski hills. Eventually, there will be 800 semi-detached and town homes selling for between $199,000 and $400,000."
To boost sales, Sierra, similar to GTA developers, has been offering incentives. For its $199,000 townhomes, for example, if buyers put down 25 per cent of the purchase price, Sierra guarantees to cap monthly mortgage payments at $500 a month for the next five years.
"The market has changed and we have to change with it," he says. "The softest spot is $1-million-plus homes. The sweet spot are chalets between $250,000 and $350,000. I think that reflects the buyers. They are ordinary people looking for an alternative to southern family vacations or for a great place to retire."
Today's market also differs greatly in another way from that of 10 years ago. Then, a ski chalet was usually just a small (maybe 1,100-square-foot) cottage - "a shack," in Mr. Kansun's words. Today's buyer, however, wants that chalet or retirement home to have all the fancy bells and whistles enjoyed or dreamt of in a year-round city home.
"They are willing to come down in overall size, but want to go top-drawer in finishes," he says. "That means things like eight-inch plank flooring, marble countertops and big stone fireplaces."
The downside, of course, is that limited supply and anticipated high demand means prices are bound to rise. "Last year, the average selling price for resale homes went up by 2.4 per cent," says Mr. Paara. "But I think this year we can look for something well above that."

Reno scaled to an everyday budget

Abstract: In 2007 when the kitchen interior was under control, the couple turned their gaze to the kitchen doorway, which opens onto a back deck that Mr. [Nakamura] described as "a concrete pit that had been used as a garage space for a compact car." At the time, he was working on designing and building a predominantly glass house for his parents in Port Hope, Ont.

Full text:   Short on cash but bursting with ideas, two architects tackle a 120 year-old Victorian row house
A $1,300 cash house-warming gift was the fuel that started a renovation odyssey for architects Megan Cassidy and Haji Nakamura.
In 2005, with little savings, the couple moved into a 120 year-old Victorian row house in Toronto's Dundas West neighbourhood. "We didn't have money to do much by way of renovating," Ms. Cassidy said, "so we worked in a way that was small and thoughtful and spent time considering how to proceed."
On evenings and weekends over five years, Ms. Cassidy and Mr. Nakamura upgraded the home. Their tiny budget gave them an opportunity for a "more efficient" renovation, and the chance to learn about living minimally.
First, the architects tackled the kitchen, which was characterized by old laminate counters scarred with burn marks and water damage. "The area around the stove was covered by sheets of aluminum foil from what must have been a Chinese newspaper press," said Mr. Nakamura, who recently established the practice Nakamura|Cassidy Design + Architecture. There was no backsplash, and the gleaming white faux-marble tiles on the floor offended the couple's tastes.
With the initial $1,300, they purchased white cabinetry and an oak butcher-block countertop from Ikea to replace the damaged lower cabinets and laminate counters. The upper cabinets, which were in good condition, got a fresh coat of paint to match the Ikea cabinetry, and they installed new hardware.
Ms. Cassidy, who works at the Toronto architecture firm Levitt Goodman, constructed a new backsplash from a subtle rainbow of Bisazza tiles. While products from the Italian mosaic company can be expensive, Ms. Cassidy picked them up for free, leftovers from pavilions she worked on at Toronto's Interior Design Show.
During their first summer in the house, they tore out the kitchen floor and inserted painted plywood until they saved enough money for the Jelinek cork that now covers the kitchen. The warm, natural, and resilient product came with an $1,800 price tag. A new dishwasher was a gift from Ms. Cassidy's mother, and they splurged on a $450 Blanco sink from Home Depot.
In 2007 when the kitchen interior was under control, the couple turned their gaze to the kitchen doorway, which opens onto a back deck that Mr. Nakamura described as "a concrete pit that had been used as a garage space for a compact car." At the time, he was working on designing and building a predominantly glass house for his parents in Port Hope, Ont. Guided by a desire "to get as much of the outdoors as possible inside the house," he created a unique custom wood curtain wall system that allowed the Port Hope landscape to be visible from most anywhere in the home.
Mr. Nakamura applied the design principals from his parent's project to the couple's Toronto home by way of oversized, asymmetrical glass French doors, which occupy the entire back wall of the kitchen. To achieve the glass house effect, he demolished the kitchen wall and inserted steel supports to hold up the existing walls. Then, he built a 6-feet by 9-feet pivot door using glue-laminated and milled ipe wood (for about $800; the hinges cost an additional $1,000).
"We wanted to maximize the amount of light and space from our tiny [10-feet by 12-feet] back deck," he explained, "and the large doors work to integrate the large kitchen to the small outdoor space."
The company that delivered the $800 worth of glass for the door wanted to charge the couple another $900 for installation. "That wasn't in our budget so we rented suction cups, and asked six of our most trusted friends to come over and help us lift the glass into place," Ms. Cassidy said.
When the door was finished, they extended the newly modern kitchen outside by building a countertop for the deck with an integrated BBQ, creating a seemingly continuous line from interior to exterior. They tore down a 60 year-old fence that lined the deck and replaced it with a white steel enclosure made from perforated mesh. Beneath the deck's countertop, they hid a storage unit - for garbage, recycling, and bicycles - that can be accessed from both the deck and the laneway.
"Every square inch of space on the [13-feet by 60-feet] lot is used," Ms. Cassidy said. "I really started to develop a sense of how small things can be and how efficient that could be."
The front of the house still boasted a half-century old fence, so they tore that down, landscaped with perennials that bloom throughout the summer, and convinced their neighbours to chip in for a custom bike rack and planter box that now divides the properties.
Of the rest of the interior renovation, Ms. Cassidy said they kept the work to a minimum by adding modern touches to an otherwise Victorian space. Old wall paper was peeled away, and the walls were repainted in a warm grey colour to offset the trim. "We wanted to get at the inherent character of the original house," Mr. Nakamura said. "We wanted to distinguish clearly between what was our design and what was original to the building."
The total renovation cost the couple about $20,000. But this investment paid off: When they put the house on the market last year, the modern touches - particularly the glass kitchen door - roused interest from buyers.
Of their February move from Dundas West, Mr. Nakamura said he will miss his neighbours, the local coffee shops, and "of course, our back deck and all the light that pours into the house. All that hard work."
But, he added, "We breathed a lot of dust over the years. Doing renovations in one shot will be more satisfying."

Vale's fertilizer deal has bankers praying for Inco spinoff

Abstract: Mining nickel, then feeding the metal into Brazil's commodity-hungry economy and to any other industrial customer, makes all sorts of strategic sense for [Vale], and there's no reason that company can't do that at the same time it makes fertilizer.

This is probably wishful thinking, but a strategic shift into fertilizer at Vale SA has Canadian investment bankers hoping, even praying, that the Brazilian conglomerate may spin off its nickel mining assets.
This concept - and there's no sense that Vale is actively working on a spinout - comes on the heels of the Rio de Janeiro-based company's $3.8-billion (U.S.) purchase yesterday of phosphate mines in Brazil that were owned by Bunge Ltd., listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
In announcing the deal, its largest acquisition since the $18.2-billion takeover of Inco back in 2006, Vale chief executive officer Roger Angelli said: "This transaction is instrumental to the consolidation of Vale's strategy on focusing on Brazil as the main market for its production of phosphates."
With those words, Mr. Angelli kicked off dreams that the Street should get ready for a screening of Inco, the Sequel . To get to this point, local mining types boiled down what Mr. Angelli said, right down to the words "focusing on Brazil."
Those three words were taken as a sign that Vale wants to concentrate its sprawling operations in its home market, where the former Crown corporation is also into iron ore, railways, copper, coal and power generation. This company is like Canadian Pacific, a generation back. And we all know what happened to CP.
And there was something larger at play here. What Mr. Agnelli said yesterday feeds into speculation that's been making the rounds for some time: that Vale is deeply disenchanted with its Canadian holdings, in large part owing to lousy labour relations at its mines, and the burden of owning commodity-based companies in the midst of a recession.
Here's what we do know: There are buyers in Canada if Vale is a seller of its nickel-mining assets - which include a massive but strike-bound mine in Sudbury and the Voisey's Bay project in Labrador.
That's the other side of Inco, the Sequel : Chatter on the Street has a number of Canadian money managers approaching Vale to say that if the company wants to sell its nickel operations, they would be glad to put up a substantial lead order. Domestic institutional investors have all kinds of expertise in valuing base metal miners, and are still looking to replace Inco and Falconbridge as core portfolio holdings.
Now, here's where the speculation falls apart: Vale has given absolutely no indication it wants out of the nickel business, according to Canadian financial advisers who work with the company.
If anything, the thesis of building a mining play that's a market leader in a number of commodities is stronger now than it was in 2006, when Inco was acquired.
Look at the big dog in mining, BHP Billiton. That company is bulking up in fertilizer by developing potash mines in Saskatchewan, while continuing to add to its strength in a grab bag of other metals.
Mining nickel, then feeding the metal into Brazil's commodity-hungry economy and to any other industrial customer, makes all sorts of strategic sense for Vale, and there's no reason that company can't do that at the same time it makes fertilizer.
I'd love to see Inco reborn on Canadian markets, and a pure play on nickel would garner a premium price. But I can't see Vale parting with the prize it won in the great mining takeover contest of 2006.
SHE'S GOLDEN
The last time we saw Margot Naudie, the top-performing fund manager from TD Asset Management was gamely spray-painting her face gold for a Report on Business magazine shot. The next time we see her will likely be in the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board annual report.
After averaging a lofty 16.4-per-cent annual gain over the past five years on the $257-million TD Precious Metals Fund, Ms. Naudie announced yesterday that she is heading to the $124-billion national money manager.
Ms. Naudie, a Montreal native, will be a senior portfolio manager and head of the materials sector at CPPIB, which makes her a senior member of the fund's public market investments team.
While its asset mix is fluid, CPPIB is the largest capital markets player in Canada and a significant global investor. At last count, the fund had $55.3-billion tied up in public equities.
That makes Ms. Naudie one of the world's biggest players in mining stocks.
Ari Levy, the lead manager on TD's energy and resource funds and a co-manager on the precious metals fund, has taken over Ms. Naudie's duties.
PAYBACK TIME
When the financial world was melting down in December, 2008, H & R Real Estate Investment Trust got a $200-million lifeline from Fairfax Financial. H & R REIT was badly in need of cash to finance construction of The Bow tower in Calgary.
Fairfax stepped up by purchasing five-year debentures, bonds that carried an 11.5-per-cent interest rate. It was expensive capital, but the bond offering kept H & R REIT going.
In the latest sign of just how credit markets have improved, H & R REIT did a pair of bond sales yesterday that will allow it to retire the debentures. The insurer will receive $230-million for the paper it holds, for a tidy 15-per-cent capital gain.
H & R REIT sold $115-million of five-year debt that pays 5.196-per-cent interest, and a second slug of seven-year debt that banks 5.902 per cent. The bonds were purchased in a bought deal financing by a syndicate of dealers led by RBC Dominion and TD Securities.

Abstract: "At Yonge and Sheppard, we're reserving some properties for employment use because it's close to transit. And around Union Station, we want to make sure that's not residential," says Robert Freedman, the director of urban design for Toronto.

Full text:   Will the recipe work? Vancouver, Toronto test the contentious concept in their downtown cores
Canada's fourth-richest man, Jimmy Pattison, doesn't change office locations quickly.
The British Columbia king of grocery stores, car dealerships and outdoor advertising moved into the Guinness Building when it opened in 1969 in downtown Vancouver. He was still there 35 years later.
But when his long-time assistant Maureen Chant, who wields considerable power, heard that there was a new tower planned for a block away, she said, "We're going to be moving into that building."
The choice might have seemed odd to some. The Shaw Tower is not a traditional "power broker" building. The 42-storey structure next to the city's convention centre has 18 floors of offices on the bottom and 24 storeys of expensive condos above them.
But that didn't make Ms. Chant blink. It's a beautiful building and it's right on the waterfront.
"As far as the residential here, you don't even know," Ms. Chant says from her 18th-floor office, where she and her boss moved four years ago. "It's not an issue at all. We couldn't be happier."
It might not be an issue for the occupants of Shaw Tower. But city planners, downtown business groups and commercial brokers worry about mixing high-end office buildings with condos in or near central business districts.
Their big fear: that condos will end up crowding out work space, which could have an impact on cities' economic health.
That's been a point of tension in Vancouver, where skyrocketing sales of downtown condos have led developers to pay any price for land to build them on. That drove up the price of real estate to the point where office-development economics didn't work in a city where the demand for Class A space is lower, compared with that of Toronto or Calgary, and where people were willing to pay a premium for luxury condos downtown.
After several high-profile sites near the central business district were either converted from office to condo or were built as new condo towers, enough alarm set in that Vancouver put a moratorium on condo development in a large downtown area.
Vancouver's planning director, Brent Toderian, has had to fight local developers who argue that the city can't support a large area of office-only development and that the condos in mixed-use buildings help subsidize office space.
"Vancouver is not a large head-office town, but it still doesn't mean you can default to mixed-use towers. You still need office space," Mr. Toderian says. "And if you mix, you replace office volume with residential."
Even Toronto, with its much more robust office market, has seen condo development encroaching on its downtown and important satellite downtowns, to the point where planners have had to declare that residential development won't be allowed at key points.
"At Yonge and Sheppard, we're reserving some properties for employment use because it's close to transit. And around Union Station, we want to make sure that's not residential," says Robert Freedman, the director of urban design for Toronto. "If you allow your sites that are best serviced by transit to be surrounded by residential, that creates problems."
He acknowledges that he feels pressure from developers who say the market and not egghead planners should decide what gets built where and when.
Toronto has allowed projects that mix residential - no more than 50 per cent - and non-residential in an area south of Union Station where development had been sluggish. That allowed Maple Leaf Square, now under construction, to combine offices, shops and condos.
That policy is working for the city, says Toronto's senior urban designer for the downtown, James Patakh. Why? Because it has sparked office development. "Now we have two other purely office buildings under construction near there," he says.
Which is all good, as long as the pattern holds.
City planners aren't the only ones who worry and wonder, though. The move to mixed uses downtown sparks passionate debate in the development and business communities about what makes a downtown or a good office building.
Ian Gillespie, who built the Shaw Tower in Vancouver (and is building Toronto's Shangri-La), believes that mixed-used office and condos in downtown districts are here to stay and those who don't realize it are stuck in last-century ideas.
"By any measure, the Shaw Tower is a huge success. This is the most sought-after building in the city," says Mr. Gillespie, although he acknowledges that the location is a critical factor for any mixed project.
Development consultant Michael Geller, who has worked in both Toronto and Vancouver, says he thinks Vancouver is "making a mistake by discouraging mixed-use next to the CBD [central business district] - one subsidizes the other."
And even Vancouver's top office developer thinks mixed buildings have a place in his city. "Mixed use really depends on the size of the city, the nature of the community and the residential demand," says Tony Astles, vice-president of real estate service for Bentall Corp. "For a small city, mixed use makes a ton of sense. There isn't enough demand to build a full office."
But others argue that, with rare exceptions such as the Shaw Tower, a developer will never get the same price for office space in a mixed building compared with an office-only tower. That means an ultimate reduction in space available for Class A buildings, which are essential to a downtown core.
"Mixed-use developments are only for certain types of office tenants," says Rob Armstrong at Avison Young in Toronto, where he is managing director of the tenant representation group. "Lawyers, accountants, head offices, stockbrokers want office space that's going to help brand you. It's not just about the money, it's about who I am."
He notes that Maple Leaf Square - the mixed project that the City of Toronto allowed - had some trouble finding the right companies who wanted to move in because of that dynamic. The building apparently is now 87 per cent leased.
Some firms will happily move in to a mixed-use building if it works with their image. But they are few and far between. They're also likely to pay less.
While a top Class A building would lease for $70 a square foot, says Mr. Armstrong, mixed-use projects, especially one south of the tracks, would more likely fall in the $35-to-$45 range.
One of the partners in Maple Leaf Square agrees that his kind of project takes special tenants.
"It was thought there was an opportunity for a special kind of office user who would like to take advantage of the signage and the branding opportunity, who could take advantage of the types of businesses that were attracted by that," says Wayne Barwise, senior vice-president at Cadillac Fairview. His company developed the project, which is next to the Air Canada Centre, with Lanterra, a residential developer, and Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment.
But for other sites, Mr. Barwise said, the mixed-use model that his company has been employing more often is one where office and residential exist on the same property but in separate buildings.
Cadillac Fairview's RBC Centre and Ritz Carlton project is an example of that approach. Cadillac built a 1.2 million-square-foot office tower on one part of the land and is completing the second tower, which will have the Ritz Carlton Hotel on the bottom 20 floors, with 30 floors of condos above.
Cadillac wouldn't necessarily try even that combination just anywhere. But, says Mr. Barwise, such mixing is appropriate for certain places.
"They work in highly concentrated urban settings."
HURDLES FOR BUILDERS
"In mixed use ... the management process if very inefficient. We did a residential-and-office tower in San Francisco and it was awkward dealing with the tenants. It was a lot of work."
Tony Astles, vice-president, real estate services, Bentall Corp., Vancouver
"[Construction] is more complicated and it's more expensive than a standard office building. Buildings that mix office, where users typically want big open spaces, and condos, where the interior space is divided up more finely, need different size floor plates, for one. That means having to incorporate transfer slabs - extra-strong concrete platforms built in to the floor where the use shifts so that the structural pillars can be shifted to different positions."
Wayne Barwise,
senior vice-president,
Cadillac Fairview, Toronto
"Projects have to be designed in such a way that the components are properly separated. Office tenants want a separate identity and they want a professional business environment. Where tenants have pushed back is if they aren't separated and then owners have had to offer lower rents."

Full text:   From a plush chair, behind a hand-carved desk crowded with custom china and a tissue box made entirely of gold, Atta Mohammad Noor rules his province with an iron fist.
In the five years since the former warlord was crowned provincial governor of Balkh, he's defied every odd: He's eradicated poppy cultivation and driven out the Taliban. He's sowed security that's fuelled stunning economic growth.
Under his forbidding watch, Balkh has become a model of peace and prosperity for the rest of Afghanistan.
Now, Mr. Noor has a modest proposal for Canada: "Your country is spending billions of dollars in Kandahar, but you are also losing lives. ... The Taliban are killing your sons, burning your schools and your clinics," he points out, seated beneath a gilt-framed oil painting of Hamid Karzai, his political rival.
"If you spent money in my province, where there is safety and security, we can deliver results," he promises, with a wave of his hand and flash of his diamond-studded watch.
When Mr. Noor speaks, people tend to listen. Three aides seated on the sidelines diligently take notes of our interview. Outside, a team of his personal bodyguards stands sentry, more powerful than the local police or national army.
Holding court in his office, Mr. Noor, who refers to himself as a full-rank general, appears immensely confident, immensely pleased.
Not long ago, the international community shunned the former mujahedeen commander, viewing his violent past with disdain. He was seen as vestige of Afghanistan's warlord culture, an obstacle to the country's development.
Now, with Mr. Karzai perilously weak, the West is poised to reach out to local Afghan leaders such as Mr. Noor in an effort to bypass the corruption and incompetence of the central government.
In provinces such as Balkh, such a move would further entrench the warlords and rekindle ethnic tensions, but some analysts say the trade-off would be worth it.
As frustration mounts with Mr. Karzai's government and the West seeks strong partners, Mr. Noor is an obvious candidate.
An ethnic Tajik, he was a high-school teacher before he took up arms.
He helped raise an army against the Soviets, fought mercilessly in the civil war, and, ultimately, helped oust the Taliban from power.
He makes no apology for his past. "I'm not saying I'm perfect," he says, with a bored sigh.
Today, he wears designer suits. His authority is no longer solely derived from by the barrel of a gun. He also holds substantial interests in real-estate and transportation across Afghanistan's strategic north, home to a vital new NATO supply line.
Mr. Noor has plenty of ideas for how the West might win his support, saying he is ready to forgive "years of neglect."
"The world community should have two policies: one in the stable provinces; and one in the insecure provinces," he says.
"Unfortunately right now, they are playing a double role. In those areas where there is fighting, drugs and killings, there are also many projects. But here, in Balkh province, it is very secure, yet the people feel they are being punished with no projects."
Canada, he believes, should lead the way, "Canada is losing its sons in Kandahar, but the world does nothing. They should also pay attention to other provinces, like Balkh," he says.
"Look around," he says with pride. "Instead of calling me a warlord, they should call me a hero."
The bustling provincial capital of Mazar-I-Sharif has transformed itself into one of the most stable and prosperous in Afghanistan. Since the fall of the Taliban, its population has doubled, topping one million people.
New housing developments and hotels are being built. Banks, telecom and transportation companies have rushed to set up shop.
Yet Mazar, and the province of Balkh, have received minimal international aid, compared with other provinces. Prominent businessmen banded together to build the city's elaborate traffic circles adorned with soaring bronze statues and neon lights.
The vast majority of Afghans here credit Mr. Noor for their city's success. They view him with equal measures of fear and respect.
"If Atta left for even one hour, the whole city would be looted," says Hajji Mohammed, an elderly shopkeeper who sells traditional emerald green chapan coats in the city's bazaar.
"I am happy. We can work day and night and there is no problem. It's not like Kabul," says another man, who drives an ancient taxi through the city's traffic-choked streets.
General Sardar Mohammad Sultani, the local police chief, says Mr. Noor - not him - deserves credit for keeping the peace.
"Nobody can deny whatever [Mr. Noor] says. It's the law. ... The governor has every department under his order. Whoever tries to disobey will be punished," Gen. Sultani says.
Mr. Noor's appointment by Mr. Karzai in 2004 was part of a complicated calculation on the President's part to appease former warlords to consolidate his power.
Many, like Mr. Noor, agreed to lay down their arms, and forced their followers to do the same.
But in recent years, he has emerged as one of Mr. Karzai's fiercest critics. During the last presidential election, Mr. Noor backed Abdullah Abdullah, Mr. Karzai's chief rival. Campaign posters featuring the faces of both men are still plastered all over the city.
However, Mr. Karzai's presidential victory has fuelled speculation that Mr. Noor might soon be removed from his post, a move that would prove deeply unpopular in Balkh and could trigger a larger conflict along ethnic lines.
Northern Afghanistan is dominated by Tajiks and Uzbeks - whose loyalty to Mr. Noor runs deep - and backed by armed force if necessary.
Any attempt by Mr. Karzai to replace him is bound to backfire, observers say.
"The government can't find better than Atta," says Sayeed Mohammad Tahir Roshanzada, who heads the provincial Chamber of Commerce, which boasts several hundred members.
"He himself is a businessman," Mr. Roshanzada points out. "If his stomach is full and his pockets are full of money, he doesn't need to go and get money from other people," he reasons.
Opposition to Mr. Noor's iron-clad control exists, but is muted.
Zainab, a senior government official in the Education Ministry, would like to see Mr. Noor ousted.
She visited the governor's office one day last week to complain about an three-centimetre-thick file folder full of fraudulent 12th-grade diplomas, signed by Mr. Noor.
However, she agreed to be interviewed in a whisper, and did not want her last name published for fear of retribution.
"He is a millionaire. Where did he get that money?" Zainab asks. "He doesn't obey the rules, but because he is a warlord, nobody will oppose him."
Even if someone does, Mr. Noor has no intention of going anywhere. He has just signed off on a new five-year plan for his province, which he plans to execute with or without outside help.
"There are still some goals I would like to finish," he says.

Full text:   The crisis in U.S. banks is not over. In some ways, it is getting worse. As President Barack Obama moves to prevent banks from making risky trades, regulators prepare to seize dozens more financial institutions. Now, bad loans have crept from homes to commercial real estate, where large mortgages take a heavy toll. Barrie McKenna reports from Otsego, Minn.
It's a Tuesday afternoon, and M & M Associates is busily preparing for yet another big transaction.
At M & M's offices in Irvine, Calif., staff scramble to line up lawyers, accountants, leasing agents, human resources specialists and loan officers - all the expertise needed to run the bank it's taking over.
By Thursday, M & M's team of more than 60 people are ready - flights are booked, bags packed, hotel reservations made. They're bound for Otsego, Minn., a sleepy bedroom community of Minneapolis and home to the Riverview Community Bank.
Most of Riverview's 50 employees have no inkling of the drama that is about to unfold. Minutes after the large wooden clock behind the tellers' stalls strikes 5 p.m. on Friday, the bank will cease to be.
That's because M & M is a cover name for the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. And Riverview, weighed down by a swelling portfolio of bad real estate loans, is about to be shut down by the regulator.
Exactly at closing time, a convoy of cars and vans passes by the neighbouring Denny's restaurant and quickly fills up Riverview's parking lot. FDIC officials swarm through the bank's double front doors, filling up the lobby and an adjoining toddlers' play area. It's the financial equivalent of a SWAT team doing a perfectly executed takedown.
For all its drama, this scenario - which occurred last Oct. 23 in the case of Riverview - is now a Friday routine in American banking. On the day of the invasion, Riverview entered the annals of U.S. banking history as shutdown No. 106 of 2009.
Riverview's demise is one data point in the grim and still-rising toll of the financial crisis and the ensuing recession. Every Friday, between two and five failing banks are taken over by the FDIC, and typically sold to a healthy survivor.
The spectre of more bank failures - one of the legacies of the meltdown - is a constant reminder of the challenges still facing the financial system. The upheaval continued this week as U.S. President Barack Obama moved to limit the size of the country's largest banks and crack down on the kinds of risky trading that got many of them in trouble. These efforts to regulate the largest banks could trigger a new wave of consolidation among regional and community banks.
Despite the linchpin role played by the likes of Citigroup Inc. in the financial crisis, there's no such thing as "too big to fail" in most of U.S. banking, which is far more polymorphous than Canada's concentrated industry. Last year, regulators shuttered around 140 banks, six times the number closed in 2008.
What concerns regulators in particular is how bad loans have spread from housing to commercial real estate, where loans tend to be larger, and therefore riskier to smaller institutions. "A handful of bad commercial real estate loans can take down a bank," says FDIC assistant director David Barr.
Regulators and analysts are bracing for 2010 to be even worse. More than 550 banks are on the FDIC's watch list - the highest level since the savings and loan crisis peaked in early 1990s. More are added every week.
A few days before the FDIC officials strode through Riverview's doors, the bank was sold at a secret online auction - to Central Bank of Stillwater, another exurb of Minneapolis. The invasion is the FDIC's way of completing the transaction.
"I wondered if they might come swinging down on ropes from the roof, but they all came in through the front door," recalls Mike Granda, the bank's 35-year-old chief financial officer.
"It was kind of emotional for employees and customers. Their old bank, as they knew it, was not going be."
The United States isn't at risk of running out of banks, of course. There are still about 8,100 of them - from one- and two-branch operations such as Riverview to giants Citibank and Bank of America.
But the carnage has left the FDIC, which is funded by fees levied on financial institutions, on its most precarious footing in nearly two decades. The FDIC, which insures deposits up to $250,000, budgeted $1-billion (U.S.) last year for receiverships, such as the Riverview shutdown. It is projecting a cost of $2.5-billion this year.
At the end of November, the FDIC's deposit insurance fund was $8.2-billion in the red. By law, the agency must keep reserves in the fund equal to no less than 1.25 per cent of all insured bank deposits. It recently raised its estimate of the reserves it would need to cover losses this year to nearly $40-billion.
The FDIC isn't without options. It can borrow up to $100-billion from the U.S. Treasury. But analysts say the regulator is wary of going down that road for fear of creating the perception that the system is getting another bailout - or that it's going to collapse.
Instead, the agency has opted for a temporary fix, requiring banks to prepay $45-billion worth of premiums - essentially covering today's losses with tomorrow's backstop.
The real estate factor
Riverview, like much of the U.S. bank sector, lived by the real estate boom - and died by the real estate boom.
Otsego, which sits on the inside bank of a wide bend in the Mississippi River, was farm country until a decade ago. But like rural areas outside fast-growing cities across the country, Otsego was swallowed up by the economic boom.
Here in the burgeoning exurbs north of Interstate 94, land was cheap and dreams were big as the prairie sky. Everywhere, developers were turning farm fields into shopping malls, office towers and vast new subdivisions, often on spec - with borrowed money and no firm customers. Demand for loans seemed to be unlimited. And as the price of land soared, it seemed like you couldn't miss in the development business - or in lending.
Into that overheated environment came Riverview in 2003. A team of career bankers founded the bank as a faith-based institution, targeting the area's growing evangelical community.
Beginning with no assets and a single branch, Riverview rapidly picked up new business throughout the Minneapolis area. It made loans indiscriminately to builders, developers and homeowners, quickly expanding to three branches and $140-million in assets.
It wasn't any one project or loan that got the bank in trouble, says a former Riverview director, who declined to be identified. It was the whole business.
"We put the pedal to the metal and just grew," the director says. "We were growing so fast, we thought it was God. But it wasn't God. We just weren't being careful."
Riverview's executives never saw the real estate crash coming, says Kurt Weise, chairman of Central Bank, the purchaser of Riverview.
"They thought things would go crazy for ever and ever," he says. "And then it stopped. The outer fringes always go down the quickest."
Local real estate prices plummeted in 2008 and 2009, and Riverview suddenly found itself owning a whole lot of repossessed real estate it couldn't unload. Lots that had been selling for $100,000 were now worth $30,000. By last summer, the bank owned more than $7-million worth of commercial and residential property, up from less than $1-million a year earlier. The bank's overextension set off alarm bells with state and federal regulators.
Current and former bank officials say there was plenty of warning in the months before the closing. There were letters, phone calls and cease-and-desist orders from regulators, telling Riverview to find new capital or face closing. The final warning expired Oct. 23. Mr. Granda knew the feds would soon be at the door.
In the hours after the shutdown, Mr. Granda found himself sharing his office with as many as six FDIC auditors. Late into the night, and for the next five days, the auditors sorted through the bank's messy finances. At one point, one of them turned to Mr. Granda and asked why he looked so relaxed amid the mayhem.
"They were actually a welcome sight," explains Mr. Granda, who was hired by Riverview in 2008 as part of an effort to revive its fortunes. "We had been under such regulatory pressure to recapitalize. I was just relieved that it was over."
Central Bank's Mr. Weise was also at the bank that first weekend. Shortly after the closing-time invasion on Friday, he gathered Riverview's employees and explained what was going on, and his plans for the future.
"There were a few tears, from people not knowing what was going on with their jobs," he says. "But most of the employees knew the bank was in trouble."
The SWAT Teams
Employees' tears are not unusual in these takeovers - nor are demands from customers to get their money out. But Mr. Weise says the industry has grown used to the steady pace of failures, which can number up to eight a week. And the FDIC's flying squads have become well-oiled operations.
The FDIC is headquartered in Washington, just around the corner from the White House. But the shutdown operation is run out of Dallas, with satellite offices in Irvine, Calif., and Jacksonville, Fla. The three cities offer "good airport hubs with dependable weather," enabling the SWAT teams to fly anywhere in the country quickly, according to the FDIC's Mr. Barr.
Once regulators determine a bank won't make it, the FDIC quietly shops the institution to potential acquirers, sometimes contacting as many as 600 parties. After signing a confidentiality agreement, bidders get access to a secure website that provides the FDIC's take on the failed bank's financial situation.
While Friday is seizure day, Tuesday is auction day. And virtually every Tuesday, there are winning bidders. Nine of 10 failed banks wind up with an immediate buyer.
The next step is to assemble a team that replicates everything a bank does - loan officers, accountants, lawyers, human resource specialists, leasing experts and the like. The teams typically number 50 to 60 people. For larger banks, the squads sometimes grow to 100.
"When we go into a bank, we temporarily mirror everything a bank does," the FDIC's Mr. Barr says.
Although the FDIC's staff has grown to 7,000 from 4,500 in 2006, many squad members are not full-time staff but professionals working on contract - and often plucked from the ranks of laid-off bank executives. "There are a lot of displaced people out there," Mr. Barr says.
Among everyone involved in a shutdown, secrecy is vital. If word leaks out that a bank is about to fail, customers could start a run on deposits, spreading panic and destroying what value is left in the bank. So the teams book hotels under false names, often two or three towns away from the target institution. And they don't use their government IDs or credit cards.
All the preparation leads up to Friday evening.
The shutdown is always done at closing time, so disruption to business is minimized. The FDIC deploys teams to a target bank's headquarters and, frequently, key branches. They lock the doors, secure the bank's records, open up the vault and temporarily shut down ATMs, Internet access and all computer systems, cutting off access to the bank's cash. Over the next 48 hours, they do what amounts to a complete audit.
"We put a lid on the bank and take a picture," Mr. Barr summarizes.
Working with the bank's staff, and often with officials of the acquiring bank, the FDIC operates like a receiver in a bankruptcy, its staff labouring through the night and the weekend to sort through the bank's affairs and prepare to reopen. Employees who thought they were headed home for the weekend may wind up working for the FDIC Saturday and Sunday.
The trick, according to Mr. Barr, is to "make it look like you were never there," so customers may not even know their bank has been shut down. Banks with Saturday hours often open their doors according to the normal schedule.
Whenever a bank's doors reopen, an FDIC greeter is there to explain to customers what's happened - that their insured deposits are safe and that the bank has a new owner.
Over the ensuing week or so, the FDIC and the acquiring bank will start to divvy up what each party is taking. The purchaser then has 90 days to make a final decision about how much of the institution they want, leaving the FDIC with any remaining assets and liabilities. Riverview's misfortune has been Central Bank's gain. With this acquisition, it has now swallowed four failed Minnesota banks, doubling its assets since the crisis started to nearly $1-billion and giving it 18 branches in three states.
And as far as the FDIC is concerned, that's all good - for the banking system and for Otsego.
"A shutdown can help a community," Mr. Barr says. "You take out a sick bank and bring in a healthy one that wants to lend."

How to close an American Bank
When a bank is no longer able to meet its obligations to depositors and/orcreditors due to a lack of capital or cash, regulators at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. may decide to shut it down.
Once the decision has been made, a well-rehearsed and secretive process begins.
Tuesday is auction day.
1 Up to 600 potential acquirers, all of whom sign a confidentiality agreement, are given access to a secret websitethat provides the FDIC's opinion on the bank's situation and prospects. Nine out of 10 failed banks will find an immediate buyer. Secrecy is vital to ensure customers don't panic and begin a run on deposits, destroyingwhat value the bank still has.
2 The FDIC assembles a team of anywhere from 50 to 100 people to replicate everything the bank does - loan officers, accountants, lawyers, human resources experts, etc. - and dispatches them from one of three satellite offices in Dallas, Irvine, Calif., and Jacksonville, Fla., places with major airports and good weather.
3 At closing time on Friday, the team is deployed to the bank's headquarters and key branches. They lock the doors, seal off access to bank records and temporarily shut down ATMs, Internet access and computer systems. Over the weekend, they perform a complete audit. The goal is to make the ownership transition as seamless as possible.
4. The bank reopens the next business day with FDIC greeters to explain to customersthat their deposits are safe and the bank has a new owner. Over the next week, the FDIC works with the acquiring bank to divide
assets, leaving the FDIC with whatever assets and liabilities the purchaser does not want

Listing agents: Jill Stewart and Rob LePage, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
To attract a crowd to this 2.5-storey, semi-detached duplex, agents Jill Stewart and Rob LePage listed it for less than $600,000.
The strategy effectively brought in nine offers, including one proposing $127,000 over the asking price.
"We were looking for lots of attention, but it was greater than what we expected," Ms. Stewart says.
"The sellers also hired a home stager and spared no expense to have it properly show to its best."
Plus, a new porch, roof and mechanics - ranging from a furnace to an air conditioning system - were added to the century-old Victorian, while period details were preserved.
"A lot of the original features were intact," Ms. Stewart says, noting its brick façade, bay windows, plaster mouldings and 10-foot ceilings.
Equally impressive was the property's size with one unit on the top two floors and another on the main and lower levels. "It could easily be converted back into a single-family home," Ms. Stewart says. "Or ... you could rent it for now to supplement your income."
The first unit contains a fireside living room, formal dining room, and updated kitchen with access to the deck and patio in the private south-facing garden. "It's a very pretty landscaped backyard," Ms. Stewart says.
The bedroom, bathroom and a laundry room, which has a walkout, are in the basement.
The upper level apartment houses a living room with a sundeck, a dining room, kitchen and bathroom, along with three bedrooms above on the third floor.
Off the rear lane, there are two parking spots, "which is a premium in the Roncesvalles area," Ms. Stewart adds.
Local amenities include Roncesvalles Village shops, school and waterfront trails. "Sorauren Park is a stone's throw from this property, so if you had young children, that would be a real plus as well," Ms. Stewart says.

Full text:   Architect Fritz Haeg wants to change the way homeowners think about their yards. His book Edible Estates plants the seed
jmays@globeandmail.com
For millions of Americans and Canadians, the front lawn is a sacred place. It symbolizes home ownership quite as forcefully as the house itself does. Kept vividly green and neatly clipped throughout the summer months, the open space between front door and street expresses for all to see the pride and care of its owners. Most importantly, it advertises a dream of prosperity and stability.
But the lawn has its enemies. One of them - a gentle, thoughtful foe, indeed - is Los Angeles architect Fritz Haeg, who was in Toronto yesterday to speak at the World Without Oil symposium held at the Design Exchange in conjunction with the Interior Design Show. (The trade fair continues through Sunday at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre.) For the past five years, Mr. Haeg has been teaming up with museums in several regions of the United States, and in London, to transfigure carefully selected front lawns into kitchen gardens. The results of this gesture have been written up admiringly in Time Magazine and The New York Times, and numerous design magazines in the United States, Europe and the Far East.
So what has captured the imagination of arts journalists around the world? I tried to find out during a telephone call last week to his home and studio in the hills outside Los Angeles.
Mr. Haeg certainly doesn't think what he's doing is all that startling. "Planting the garden takes only about three days," he told me. "The larger part of the project is telling the story of what happens through videos, weekly visits by a local photographer, exhibitions and workshops and websites and the book." (Mr. Haeg's documentary account of the first few gardens, Edible Estates: Attack on the Front Lawn [Metropolis Books, $16.27], appeared in 2008. A second edition will appear in April.) "I'm not doing anything new. I think it's hilarious when people write about the project as radical or crazy or new."
But however ordinary and simple Mr. Haeg's garden venture seems on the surface, it touches a deep place in the contemporary psyche, and therein lies its appeal. Many people are worried these days about the high cost of consigning millions of arable acres to purely symbolic use. Some are concerned about suburban loneliness and alienation, and share Mr. Haeg's vision of the front yard as a new place of sociable micro-farming, a zone that could help reconnect neighbourhoods around a topic we're all interested in: food.
"There's something very American about it," he said, "but everybody globally is already thinking about the issues - how we are living together, how we're making cities, how we are dealing with cities that already exist.... Instead of starting over with some new, grand, top-down kind of utopian plan, I am starting from the bottom up, thinking about reappropriating, reconsidering spaces that already exist."
As things happened, the initial impulse that led to the garden scheme had nothing to do with gardens at all. It was the 2004 U.S. presidential election, which revealed painful fault lines in the American political landscape, and got Mr. Haeg thinking about what he could do to help heal the situation. That's when doing something with the lawn occurred to him.
"There's something iconic about it," the architect reflects, "but if you dig deeper into the story of it, it's quite an insidious space, the way it pollutes and wastes water. I wanted to do a series of gardens throughout the country, each one in a different region, showing what's possible in different neighbourhoods, by different families, in different climates. Not a perfect garden, but a simple, cheap, quick, easy garden anyone can do themselves. It's about how we choose to live, and hopefully every one of these gardens creates this chain reaction of thought. You realize we have choices about how we live in these cities we've inherited."
The first front-yard conversion was in Salina, Kan., and featured squash, tomatoes, beans, strawberries and other fruits and vegetables suitable for a harsh summer climate. Since Salina, Mr. Haeg has taken his idea (and the museum exhibition that accompanies it) to Texas, New York City, New Jersey, California and Maryland, and to a council-housing estate in London.
What inspires Mr. Haeg to keep seeking out new venues for his conversion program is his sense that we are in the midst of an environmental emergency that requires bold moves, but also very small ones, at the scale of the neighbourhood.
"I think people are realizing that the systems that we're trapped in, that we're born into, now are leading us to places that are neither pleasurable nor sustainable. Food production, transportation, energy, city-making, building construction. It's all inherently flawed and we're all looking for ways to change it. The question is: Will we be able to do it in time?"

Developer Gary Silverberg faced a challenge with his new ART condo on Dovercourt Road just south of Queen Street West. To make suites affordable for the widest range of buyers he would have to offer in the mix studios measuring less than 500 square feet.
So how do you create comfort in small living spaces? In retrospect his decision seems like a no-brainer: He recruited interior designers with experience in boutique hotels.
Hotel rooms, after all, have to combine efficiency and comfort; spaces to sleep, bathe, relax and maybe even do a bit of work on the road.
With 3rd Uncle Design Inc. Mr. Silverberg got an added bonus. The 15-year-old firm also knew the neighbourhood and its special arts and design culture. 3rd Uncle had previously done the interiors for the Drake Hotel, which with the nearby Gladstone, serve as the rocks on which the local neighbourhood is built.
"It just made a lot of sense," says Mr. Silverberg. "To get the most out of smaller spaces you can't take a traditional design approach. You need a special understanding of how to make small spaces seem larger and to make every detail count.
"At the same time I wanted a design team that understood we were doing something different with ART. It is very much a neighbourhood-focused condo; its look and feel had to reflect the character of Queen West's special culture."
John Tong, a partner in 3rd Uncle said there were some advantages going in. Architect David Oleson of Oleson Worland Architects had delivered a structure with nine-foot ceilings and balconies or terraces on many suites. Both lend to the feeling of spaciousness.
"Then we had to find ways to make all open spaces seem part of a larger whole rather than separate defined spaces," he says. Use traditional ways to define living, dining and sleeping spaces and you would wind up with tiny chunks instead of one roomy open area.
3rd Uncle did that by extending millwork to encompass the entire space and limiting bulkheads and protrusions from the walls. In areas like bathrooms the company set the medicine cabinet and lighting into a recess and flanked the mirror with recessed shelving. The vanity appears to float above the tiled floor, which allows room for storage. Wall and floor tiling are the same size and colour and present no visual barriers.
And yet life in a single room can limit a sense of privacy so 3rd Uncle created sliding doors to separate sleeping space from living space if necessary and also designed a bed, which incorporates side tables and storage drawers. Mr. Tong says his company is now working on pricing with a manufacturer for both the bed and a television cabinet.
But innovation in studio design is only one part of where ART diverges from the rest.
Mr. Silverberg is an artist of some note himself. He wanted ART to be something much more than another condo. He wanted it to be a celebration of a distinct neighbourhood at a specific point in time. That meant providing a complete range of suites to meet the needs of anyone who loves the area - from singles through to families and especially artists and creative types who want to work from home.
"We wanted them to be able to live above the shop just like people do on Queen Street," he says.
To do that Mr. Oleson replaced traditional concrete walls on the ground floor with pillars. That simple design change meant buyers of ground floor units could essentially create their own suites, something usually limited to pricey penthouses.
"They can decide how many square feet they need or can afford and then arrange interiors so rooms are all on one floor or two," says Mr. Oleson. "Each ground floor suite will have its own separate address and entrance so in effect you have perfect live/work units."
While there are small suites there are also large three-bedroom ones too - they come in at more than 1,600 square feet, big enough for a small family. ART also offers two-storey suites on its upper floors, each with a large terrace, a backyard in the sky.
All those terraces face to the north, a small but important touch for artists seeking northern light.
"In essence what we are creating is a manageable size vertical village with all the elements you would expect in a village," says Mr. Silverberg. "At just 11 stories and 147 units ART is neither high- nor low-rise and really does reflect the neighbourhood."

At the time this semi-detached residence was listed, there were no comparable properties available in the family-friendly neighbourhood known as Davisville Village.
This created demand for the roughly 60-year-old house, though its hard-to-find attributes made it even more alluring to eight couples who submitted offers to agent Darryl Quinn.
"It is a quiet side street, and it has parking, a deep lot and a finished basement," he says. It was about two years ago when the lower level was completed with recreation and laundry rooms, both with shelving, and a full bathroom. Other improvements include new windows and updated kitchen finishes.
Hardwood floors and crown mouldings polish off the main-floor living and dining rooms.

Full text:   When architect Bruce Haden began his redevelopment of Koo's Garage in 2001, he was a trailblazer in a residential backwater. Almost a decade later, the compact townhouse project continues to inspire
Back in 2001, a few boom cycles ago, Vancouver architect Bruce Haden embarked on a housing project that was both professionally strategic and intensely personal. On the threshold of joining the partnership of acclaimed firm Hotson Bakker, he wanted to design a home for himself that would be close to his workplace and imbued with the spirit of urbanism on which his new partners had built their reputations. Almost a decade later, this compact townhouse continues to inspire. "It would take a lot for me to leave," Mr. Haden says. "Four kids, maybe. Or a spectacular job offer in Copenhagen."
Mr. Haden chose Strathcona as his neighbourhood and a dilapidated commercial parking garage as his base material. Orchestrating a six-unit deal with Robert Brown of Chesterman Property Group, they transformed the garage into a block of compact, urbane lofts and townhouses and made the corner unit Mr. Haden's own. The resulting 850-square-foot townhouse is now a local fixture.
It's still known as Koo's long after the garage's conversion, even as the neighbourhood transforms around him. Last year's market yielded the first Strathcona house to sell for more than $1-million, Mr. Haden notes, and his own unit's market value has more than doubled. Yet even as the proverbial movers, shakers and young families lope in, the neighbourhood is still dotted with teardowns, drug dens and the occasional brothel, which to some observers just add to the area's Runyonesque charm. "It's not completely yuppified," Mr. Haden says. "I moved [to Strathcona] because I thought it was interesting and quirky and fun. ... The feeling I get now is that it's even more interesting and more quirky and more fun."
Mr. Haden is renowned as a social architect, in all senses of the word. He loves designing community projects such as the Okanagan's Nk'Mip Desert Cultural Centre - and he loves parties. Every November, Koo's Corner serves as a base camp for friends and colleagues partaking in the annual Eastside Culture Crawl of gallery open houses.
The floors, cupboards and dining-room tabletop are crafted with reclaimed wood. The compact living room segues into a dining-room zone that could be dubbed Gothic modern, with its double-height ceiling and 13-foot-tall south-facing window. Off the dining room, a staircase turns down to the guest quarters and garage-cum-party room and up to the main sleeping quarters. At arm's length from the table is the semi-open kitchen, a cube-like niche accented with deep-red ceramic tiling.
With minimal floor space, the furniture has to multitask. Mr. Haden custom-designed his dining-room table, a two-piece Corian tabletop that can be reconfigured to seat up to 12 people. During casual gatherings, the architecture itself becomes the furniture: the generously deep Gothic modern window ledge, a banquette; the snug staircase off the dining room, a side chair. And, most unusual multitasker of all: the birch-framed queen-size master bed that conceals a bathtub within.
At the recent culture crawl bash, architect pal Jennifer Marshall offers to do the bed-to-tub demonstration, now a regular party event at Mr. Haden's.While a reporter and a visiting Viennese curator look on, Ms. Marshall grabs the castor-legged bed frame with one hand and pulls it open like a matchbox, revealing a generous-sized Kohler tub.
This is a home that's highly owner-specific. The tiny upstairs bathroom features only a shower stall and the toilet, with the requisite sink stand installed just outside the bathroom door and, of course, that bathtub/bed. Mr. Haden's highly personal rationale: Most washrooms are designed in such a way that when you're soaking in the tub, the dominant view is usually a close-up of the john. His view from the tub is of Strathcona's MacLean Park across the street.
Mr. Haden exults in the neighbourhood camaraderie and impromptu social visits encouraged by the design. The floor-to-ceiling living room window brings in a full view of whatever urban theatre happens to transpire across the road. His home is the end unit of the three asymmetrical-roofed townhouses affixed to the south end of the transformed garage. On this architectural triptych, the glass awnings form canopies over the front decks, which align in such a way that a single step outside can throw you into an instant tête-à-tête with the guy next door.
Depending on your perspective, this is architecture as friend-making machine, or architecture as fishbowl. As Mr. Haden concurs, it blurs the boundaries of private life in a way that many would find unsettling - but not him, not yet.
"I don't get sick of that fishbowl, but I recognize that I'm somewhat unusual that way," he says. "The way we build our cities, privacy is easy to achieve. It's community that's difficult to achieve."

Full text:   Authorities rein in rapid growth in loans - up 32 per cent last year - over fears of brewing bubbles in real estate prices and stocks
China's banking regulators are clamping down on a massive lending spree amid fears the world's third largest economy is overheating.
Several major Chinese banks, including Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China were given verbal orders to halt new lending for the rest of January following a binge of loans in the first two weeks of the month totalling as much as 1.2-trillion yuan ($175-billion U.S.), according to reports.
Government authorities are worried that free flowing capital lent to Chinese companies and citizens is stoking bubbles in real estate prices and stocks.
"Bank of China's lending system has been 'shut down,' so technically no loans can be issued in the remainder of January," Na Liu, China analyst at Scotia Capital said in a report, citing banking sources in China.
A $600-billion stimulus package and a willing lending sector has helped shield China from the global recession. But there are concerns that China may move too quickly to choke off capital and stall a nascent global recovery.
In a speech at a conference in Hong Kong yesterday, the chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission said China would rein in the rapid growth in loans, which increased 32 per cent in total to 9.5-trillion yuan or about $1.3-trillion (U.S.) last year.
"We shall control, and we have controlled, the credit growth the whole year round," Liu Mingkang said at a financial forum.
Mr. Liu said that bank loans would decrease to about 7.5-trillion yuan in 2010 and that "corrective actions" had been taken against banks that lent too much or made bad loans.
China's two major stock markets declined about 3 per cent yesterday on worries the new credit restrictions would inhibit investment. As well, the markets were hit by rumours and unconfirmed media reports that China's central bank could increase interest rates by 27 basis points as soon as tomorrow, following the release of GDP data.
Scotia Capital's Mr. Liu said the rumour is unlikely to be true, as "the tightening pace will be deemed to be too quick."
China's central bank hiked banks' reserve ratio earlier this week, increasing the amount of capital they had to have on hand to make loans. China also boosted interest rates on second home mortgages and increased the down payment on second homes to 40 per cent of the purchase price.
"The reactions in the Chinese stock market and property market so far should satisfy the Chinese authorities already, at least in the near term," Mr. Liu said.
China suffered along with the global economy during the worldwide downturn, but it has bounced back faster than economies elsewhere. Beijing hopes cooling the pace of lending will keep its economy growing without creating inflation and overheating. Other nations are counting on that growth and a healthy demand for their goods for their own recoveries.
Chinese regulators are paying special attention to loans for local government projects and real estate. All banks have been ordered to "heighten their vigilance" against credit risk, the regulatory commission's Mr. Liu said.
By most measures, Chinese banks are among the world's healthiest at the moment. Not only are they flush with cash, but their bad loans, known as non-performing loans, stand at just 1.6 per cent.
But with China's economic growth pegged at a blistering 8 per cent after a torrent of lending, banks will see a rise in bad loans in the coming years, though losses are expected to be manageable, said Alistair Scarff, head of Asia financial institutions research for Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong.
Smaller commercial banks in China's cities are likely more at risk than are the country's heavyweight institutions, he said.
At the same time, China's modern banking system has yet to be fully tested.
China's banks have never faced a recession or big losses as profit-driven companies answerable to shareholders. What's more, advanced risk management systems and lending practices are a relatively new arrival at some banks.
"You have a banking system that has never really been through a down cycle," Scarff said. "This is the first time they're really facing these challenges as separate entities and modern financial institutions."

Full text: Heeding the words of Rupert Murdoch, global powerhouse Macquarie is taking on the big domestic players in a specific niche
Canada, meet Macquarie Group .
In a little more than two years, with three major acquisitions, the giant Australian bank has become one of the biggest foreign challengers in Canadian high finance, with about 1,000 employees across a broad range of businesses.
And the name is about to become a lot more familiar.
With the most recent purchase, the acquisition of Blackmont Capital's chain of financial advisers, Macquarie is the first big non-Canadian player in years to try to face off against the RBC Dominion Securities and BMO Nesbitt Burns of the world in the business of stock brokerage and mutual fund sales to everyday Canadians.
As of next month, when Blackmont is rebranded as Macquarie Private Wealth, the name will be on the wall across Canada in cities such as Victoria, Edmonton, Ottawa and Guelph, Ontario.
It's all part of a strategy by Paul Donnelly, who came to Canada from Sydney in 2007 to head Macquarie's business here and exploit what the company believes is a gap in the Canadian market, now dominated by big banks and small boutiques. Those banks are huge but mostly focused on Canada, giving Macquarie what it believes is an edge because of its global presence. At the same time, the Australian firm plans to offer more services than the boutique investment dealers.
Mr. Donnelly wants Macquarie to feel like a Canadian firm, rather than like a small branch of a global bank, which is the model for many of the immense so-called bulge bracket foreign firms that try to do business in Canada with just a few locals and others who fly in from head office when needed.
"We're proud to be different and we're deliberately different," Mr. Donnelly said. "We're global perhaps in a way that the large Canadian banks aren't. We're truly committed to Canada perhaps in a way the bulge brackets aren't, and we're really full service in the way perhaps the boutiques aren't."
Starting in 2007 with the first big deal, the purchase of Orion Financial Inc., the Australian firm has built a business in Canada that specializes in financing industries such as construction, real estate and infrastructure, and that aims to offer all the products of a big Canadian bank along with international experience and access.
Mr. Donnelly's philosophy is based in part on a quotation from tycoon Rupert Murdoch, who Mr. Donnelly laughingly calls "that famous ex-Australian." Mr. Murdoch once said "You have to look for a gap where competitors in a market have lost contact with the customers" - words that stuck with Mr. Donnelly.
"If we are really strong in something, but all the Canadian banks are equally strong, maybe you can break through but you're going to butt your head against the wall a lot before you succeed. So we just focus on a clear and discernible difference: Where can you sit down and have a conversation with someone that's going to be different than any other conversation they're having."
Prior to the acquisitions, Macquarie's presence in this country was a mixed bag of businesses few Canadians would have run across: A group of mining bankers here, an infrastructure investment fund there, a mortgage business on the side. All in all, there were about 300 people, but few outside of niche finance businesses would have run across them.
Starting in late 2007, that changed. The Orion purchase gave the firm a big team focused on energy and mining.
Then Macquarie began to broaden further, spending money on high-profile hires. Former senior bureaucrat Stanley Hartt, once a top man at Citigroup Inc. in Toronto before the bank shut down its operations here, is now chairman of Macquarie in Canada.
Top-ranked analysts followed in key areas such as utilities, real estate and banking.
With the purchase last year of Calgary-based Tristone Capital, Macquarie added expertise in energy. It also became a player in what's known as acquisition and divestiture - the business of helping oil and gas companies buy and sell real estate.
It hasn't all been smooth. Some key personnel left Tristone, and one of the biggest mining bankers who came from Orion recently departed for a competitor.
But the result of all the expense has been some big clients. Now, the firm is advising the government of New Brunswick on the sale of its power producer to Hydro Quebec and helping Suncor Energy Inc. sell natural gas assets.
The final piece was Blackmont, which gives the firm a force of about 130 brokers who can sell shares of companies that Macquarie finances to individual investors. The goal now is to double that number in three to four years.
Doing the acquisitions of Tristone and Blackmont in quick succession wasn't part of the original plan, but fast growth has been a hallmark of Macquarie globally.
"When you want to act and when the opportunities are available rarely line up," Mr. Donnelly said. "You can't do a linear strategy. You have to take advantage of the opportunities"
He doesn't expect there's anything more that Macquarie needs to buy in Canada.
But then, Mr. Donnelly points out that getting bigger fast is in Macquarie's DNA - globally the firm has expanded at a furious pace - giving the sense that if something offbeat were to come up, something unexpected that could help the company, Macquarie might be there with a check book and a plan to grow.
"We didn't know we were going to do Tristone, and we didn't know we were going to do Blackmont, but that's the nature of our organization."

Full text: Townhouse design close to Yorkville includes high-tech security and maintenance systems
20B WOODLAWN AVE. W.
WHAT: This lavish neo-classical residence offers three bedrooms and five bathrooms, plus a private elevator servicing all four levels, including the finished basement. ASKING PRICE: $2,995,000
TAXES: Not yet assessed
AGENT: Boris Kholodov, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd., Johnston and Daniel Division
For years, the sight of a dilapidated rooming house among multimillion-dollar estates greeted residents entering the western stretch of a popular street off Yonge Street in the Summerhill community.
But the century-old property - likely one of the oldest on the block - was recently replaced by two striking three-storey homes, including one with a unique neo-classical limestone façade.
"You don't find many detached town homes like this right in the city," says agent Boris Kholodov.
"You see these types of homes in New York and London, and sometimes in San Francisco."
Mr. Kholodov says he believes the townhouse-like design will be a big selling feature, which may only be surpassed by its desirable location close to the subway, upscale shops, and restaurants.
"The street [itself] is fairly quiet," says Mr. Kholodov. "[Buyers] want to be able to leave their house and walk to Yonge Street."
Like other new properties being built in the area - including some worth up to $6-million - this 4,050-square-foot house caters to the lifestyle of modern buyers, Mr. Kholodov says.
The local builder and designers - including Toronto-based architect Lorne Rose and design firms from Toronto and London - incorporated casual and formal entertaining rooms and secluded sleeping quarters, plus high-end operating systems, media equipment and construction materials.
"I have not seen such a perfect combination of traditional and modern [elements] in Toronto," says Mr. Kholodov. "It's a beautiful contrast."
The main floor easily demonstrates his point, he says.
The kitchen was given sleek stainless-steel appliances, including a Sub-Zero refrigerator and Wolf dual convection oven; white lacquer and brown oak cabinetry; floating marble slab backsplashes behind the gas cook top; and white glass backsplashes on perimeter walls.
Across the rear, the great room displays intricate decorative details, such as coffered ceilings, white oak herringbone hardwood floors and patio doors flanked by matching floor-to-ceiling windows. The gas fireplace has a custom wood mantle and marble surround.
"The great room is stunning," says Mr. Kholodov. "And it has views of the garden at the back, which is terraced and landscaped." Another focal point within the principal room is the custom spiral floating staircase with wrought-iron pickets.
"This staircase is the heart of this house," says. Mr. Kholodov. "Whereas other staircases are more incorporated into the house, this is a space of its own."
For instance, its curves are mimicked by a circular window in the landing to the second-floor library, laundry room and two bedrooms, which each contain bathrooms and walk-in closets.
"The landing on the second floor is beautiful as a result of this staircase," adds Mr. Kholodov. "This is a feature that is in line with what's expected in a property like this."
For buyers who appreciate the elegant appearance it adds to the interior, but question its practicality, there is an elevator servicing each floor, which range from nine to 11 feet in height.
"It is in high demand," states Mr. Kholodov. "Many people don't want to use the stairs all the time."
This also allows wheelchairs to manoeuvre easily inside the house, which has an entrance from the double garage to the lower level.
The latter is occupied by a recreation room wired with an in-ceiling video projector and surround-sound system integrated with other areas of the house.
Nearby, a climate-controlled cellar provides optimal storage for up to 600 bottles of wine. It was designed to maintain temperature at 55 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity at 70 per cent, then fashioned with California red wood racking and a glass door with a lock.
"That way the guests don't help themselves to a bottle of Château Petrus for cooking," Mr. Kholodov jokes. "Or the children don't take the Château Margaux to make their cocktails."
To address major security systems, the house is equipped with motion and glass break detectors and pre-wired for the cameras that can be monitored from any television inside.
The property is also equipped with various high-tech systems to ensure easy maintenance, including in-ground sprinklers, central-vacuum system and heated front steps and terrace.
"It should be something that is standard for something in this price range," says Mr. Kholodov, who notes that this is not always the case in comparable properties.
Even the fireside master suite on the top floor has the luxury of heated floors throughout the marble bathroom and a terrace with a motorized awning.
A walk-in closet with his and her cabinetry, an island and make-up area complete the space.
"One of my favourite parts of this house is the master bedroom on the third floor," adds Mr. Kholodov. "I love this house."

MOVING AT THE PACE OF AN AVALANCHE

Abstract: He ran away with the circus when it moved to Quebec City in 1984 and then Montreal in 1985. But he says he always intended to return to the region. "The circus left Baie-Saint-Paul, but Baie-Saint-Paul never left me," said Mr. [Daniel Gauthier], an avid "ski bum."

Full text: Le Massif's setting is breathtaking: a commanding vista high above the broad St. Lawrence River, the mountain nestled in the pristine beauty of the Charlevoix region about an hour's drive northeast of Quebec City.
Local residents hope Daniel Gauthier keeps it that way, even as the entrepreneur launches a major expansion of the small ski resort.
In its early days as a wild, rudimentary ski hill during the 1980s, intrepid skiers would ride to the top of Le Massif on snowmobiles and then thread their way down in the deep snow, the thrill heightened by the illusion of being about to drop off the steeper runs straight into the ice-packed river. In time, lifts were installed and the mountain became a conventional, regional ski centre, but with a negligible hotel infrastructure.
Now, Le Massif is getting a massive makeover as a four-season "anti-resort" under Mr. Gauthier, a co-founder (with Guy Laliberté) of Cirque du Soleil who cashed out his stake in 2001 and bought the money-losing ski operation the following year for $9-million.
In keeping with his alt-circus roots, Mr. Gauthier is taking a novel approach to the $230-million project, putting the accent on sustainable development with a twist, including plans for cottages perched on gusty crags, cozy treehouses, a farmers' market, a railway, and lots of ecotourism.
For the residents of nearby village Petite-Rivière-Saint-François, the project is welcome news. But there are concerns that, for all Mr. Gauthier's sensitivity to local needs, the scheme has triggered an orgy of real estate development that is going far too quickly for the tiny community of 740.
To be completed in the 2013-14 ski season, the new rustic-chic Massif aims to attract a more international clientele. The expansion of the centre - which will include a rail link from Quebec City and on to La Malbaie further north - will mean hundreds more jobs, on a year-round basis, rather than seasonal ones.
But the town recently imposed a moratorium on new real estate plans after more than 1,000 lots were sold for development over the past several years. The fear is that the huge influx of vacation and retiree homes will spoil the area's natural beauty, put pressure on the existing infrastructure, push up property values and thus price many locals out, and create a community of part-time residents who rent out to strangers for most of the year.
"There are a lot of developers' mouths watering," says Jean-Baptiste Boucher, owner of a local art gallery and head of the village's urban development committee.
"This is moving at a pace that's a little too fast," he said. "We're aware of the need for development but we must take the time to do this correctly. This is going to totally transform the region."
Mr. Gauthier, 51, applauds the moratorium and is a firm believer in a cautious approach to development.
"The village is going to undergo a real estate boom," he said in an interview from his Quebec City office. "It's a matter of finding the right balance in all of that."
Jonathan Chagnon, whose Le Versant du Massif-Immobilier Inc. is a major developer of single-family homes in the area, says his company takes great care to ensure its buildings blend harmoniously into the landscape and that good relations are maintained with the population. The home prices range from $250,000 to $1-million.
"We are on excellent terms with the municipality and the local residents, and respect for the environment and architectural standards is very high," he said.
In addition, some reasonably priced housing is being built for locals who live and work there, he said.
Mr. Gauthier, who sometimes commutes between Quebec City and Le Massif in his private helicopter, says he's committed to low-density construction on his mountain. He insists he's limiting lodging on the slopes and at the hill's base to half of what it could be.
The development includes a four-star, 150-room hotel being built at Baie-Saint-Paul, about 19 kilometres from the ski hill, heated entirely with geothermal technology. There are also plans for some 450 rooms spread out in various configurations and locations on Le Massif and at its base. None are for sale; they are all overnight or rental units.
"We want this to be on a human scale," in contrast to the high-density approach taken at some major ski resorts, Mr. Gauthier said.
"We want a product that's different, innovative and in the vanguard of new trends in tourism," said Mr. Gauthier, who fell in love with Charlevoix when he hitchhiked there from Montreal for a brief stay in the summer of 1975, fresh out of high school.
He later ended up working at the youth hostel in Baie-Saint-Paul, where he met Mr. Laliberté and other dreamers behind the idea of a street busker-type show that eventually morphed into the wildly successful Cirque du Soleil.
He ran away with the circus when it moved to Quebec City in 1984 and then Montreal in 1985. But he says he always intended to return to the region. "The circus left Baie-Saint-Paul, but Baie-Saint-Paul never left me," said Mr. Gauthier, an avid "ski bum."
After deciding he had accomplished all that he wanted to as president of the Cirque, he left in 2001 with a fortune that made him independently wealthy but also with a desire for a new venture that would challenge him creatively.
Le Massif, a debt-ridden enterprise run by a not-for-profit group, came up for sale and he realized it fit the bill perfectly.
He remains friends with Mr. Laliberté, who has $10-million invested in Le Massif. The federal and Quebec governments are also in, for a total of $65-million.
"The idea is to do something that is of benefit to the region, that is inclusive," Mr. Gauthier said. He sees Le Massif as a venue that will help stitch together the disparate elements in Charlevoix and enhance the region's value - including its two provincial parks and a casino at La Malbaie - as a tourist draw. Other attractions planned include a concert hall, spa and food exhibitions, and in the off season, hiking and biking in the area, which is designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.
"We want this to be green, socially responsible development," he said.
Working in tandem with the local population is part of that, he added. "You can never take the community for granted."

As we all know by now, crackpot decisions and major mistakes abound in the TV racket.
As I write this, the latest is that Conan O'Brien might jump to Fox. Apparently he's annoyed with NBC. Totally steamed (about the network's tentative compromise plan to move Jay Leno back to his old 11:35 p.m. slot for a half hour and then have O'Brien follow at 12:05 under the Tonight show banner). Lawyers, agents and TV-racket execs are locked in meetings. And whatever transpires, you can guarantee that tens of millions of dollars will be wasted shifting around the late-night lineup on U.S. network TV. Ludicrous amounts of money will change hands and millions of words of irrelevant reporting, blogging and pontificating will ensue.
Down in Pasadena, where the TV critics' tour is taking place - and where I am not - the gathering is probably so mesmerized by the late-night shenanigans even that party to celebrate 10 years of Survivor on the weekend seemed a bit lame.
Meanwhile, up here in our boring backwater, major mistakes are also made. Like the idea that Kids In the Hall deserved a return to CBC and an eight-part series.
Kids in the Hall: Death Comes to Town (CBC, 9 p.m.) is just awful, an absolute mess of lame, laughless ineptitude, and a dismal coda to the comedy troupe's outstanding career. It is a fact of life that a lot of kids grow up and then aren't that lovable and funny any more. Such is the case here.
CBC officially describes the opening episode as this: "The award-winning Kids in the Hall comedy troupe star in an eight-part quirky murder mystery. In tonight's season premiere, Death arrives in Shuckton, Ont., while the town waits for news about their bid for the next Olympic Games." Excuse me - "quirky"? That's the default word for descriptions of things that are indescribable for people with a limited vocabulary. "Quirky" doesn't cover anything that goes on here. The episode has no comic rhythm, it's mediocre and maddeningly pointless.
Time was, Kids in the Hall made great sketch-comedy TV. Original, smart material emanated from these guys. Sometimes, it was outright deranged and fuelled by Lord knows what - anger, creativity, the need for these guys to outdo each other in originality. Many of us remember the original series with fondness. Some of the characters (such as Cathy and Kathie and The Headcrusher) and jokes entered the popular culture as touchstones.
Now it has come this - excruciatingly awful attempts at humour and a self-indulgence depressing to witness.
In fictional Shuckton, the mayor is murdered. The Kids - Dave Foley, Kevin McDonald, Bruce McCulloch, Mark McKinney and Scott Thompson - play all the major characters, male and female. McCulloch, the executive producer of the series, plays an obese, housebound ex-hockey player who spends a lot of time with a pizza-delivery woman with Alzheimer's disease called Marnie (McDonald). A lot of time is taken up with Foley's portrayal of the mayor's wife, a boozehound. Some scenes in which she encounters the town coroner (Thompson) have some vague comic sizzle, but the real fun is being had by the actors, not the audience.
There are attempts to satirize easy targets - local-yokel cops, a local TV news crew - and there are countless ill-defined bits that satirize elements of formulaic TV shows, but nothing really clicks. This is appallingly slow-witted TV, a mistake of major proportions.
Check local listings.
***
Also airing
American Idol (Fox, CTV, 8 p.m.) returns tonight, and if it weren't for NBC's late-night shifts creating all that noise, American Idol probably would have generated a lot more buzz. This is the post-Paula Abdul era for Idol . And yesterday it was announced that this is the post-Simon Cowell era too - he will leave the show after this season. Tonight, apparently, Victoria Beckham is in what was Paula Abdul's chair, as the ninth season kicks off with the Boston auditions. There will be some slight changes to the familiar format this season, it seems - no "wild-card" round - but there will still be those tedious times when it's Motown night or Disco night.
The fifth estate (CBC News Network, 10 p.m.) is a handy repeat of last Friday's program, and if you missed it, it's a shocker. It's about the short and troubled life of Ashley Smith, who was a 19-year-old when she choked herself to death at Grand Valley Institution in Kitchener, Ont. Her death led to a devastating report by Canada's federal prison ombudsman. As the program explains, Smith was barely into her teens when she was first sent to a youth-detention centre in her home province of New Brunswick. Her crime, we're told, was this: She had tossed crabapples at a mailman. A one-month sentence would evolve into a seemingly endless series of terms spent in 11 institutions in five provinces. As we are told here, "What she really needed was mental-health assessment and treatment. She never got it."

From bikinis to burkas: A Yemeni memoir

Author: Al-Solaylee, Kamal

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/bikinis-burkas-yemeni-memoir/docview/382590130/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Local events didn't help. One of the turning points in Yemen's recent history came in 1990, shortly after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August. Yemen stood out for its support of [Saddam Hussein]'s invasion, and paid a dear price.

Full text: In his childhood, Toronto writer Kamal Al-Solaylee recalls a cosmopolitan, secular family from southern Yemen. Today his sisters and brothers are close-minded Islamists. As one middle-class clan loses its own struggle with extremism, so goes the country
Shopping for bikinis with my four sisters in the summer of 1975 brought out the fashion beast in me, an 11-year-old living in exile with his family in Egypt.
"The colour on this brown two-piece makes you look darker," I tell my sister Raja. She picks a lime-green bikini instead. "I love this one so much, I want to wear it myself," I blurt out to Ferial, clinching her choice of a black-and-white striped swimsuit.
The fruit of that shopping trip hangs on the office wall of my Toronto apartment - a photograph taken a few days later of myself, my four sisters and three brothers on a beach in Alexandria.
The photo captures a moment of bourgeois life in the Middle East, before the region became associated in the Western collective psyche with exporting terror or the subjugation of women. It's an image of a large and admittedly privileged family, led by enlightened, secular parents from southern Yemen.
Yes, the same Yemen that, since Christmas Day, has been reintroduced to the world as a second Afghanistan or the third front in the war on terror - where my family still lives, in the capital, Sanaa. But the Yemen of today is nothing like the one where my older siblings came of age in the 1950s and 1960s. And when I speak to my family now, they have changed so much that it's hard to believe we are even related.
Yemen's new notoriety doesn't surprise me; what does is how all the warning signs went unnoticed for so long. I saw it in my own flesh and blood: An open-minded family defined by its love of arts and culture embraced hard-line interpretations of Islam and turned its back on social progress and intellectual freedom.
Whatever happens next in Yemen, my family there, and no doubt millions of other middle-class Middle Eastern families, has been losing the war against extremism.
Goodbye, Ringo Starr.
Hello, street curfew
Our Camelot was the ancient port city of Aden. There in 1945 my father, Mohamed, then 19, wed the 14-year-old Safia, a shepherdess from Hadramut, a part of Yemen now known as the birthplace of the bin Laden family. With his high-school education and some support from my grandparents, my father started a small real-estate business in what we would call flipping today: He would buy old buildings, renovate and sell them at a profit, as well as renting some units to the British expatriates who "managed" Aden as a colony.
His properties multiplied in number almost as fast as his progeny, 11 in all, born from 1946 to 1964 - the Yemeni version of the boomer generation. The youngest is me.
Today, Aden is home to a growing, violent southern secession movement, and the place where al-Qaeda hit the USS Cole with explosives in 2000 while it was in the harbour. But, according to my family, it was once a model of peace and harmony.
"The Brits brought order," my father used to tell us. My sister Faiza talks of a cosmopolitan port where European ships would stop on the way from Europe to the Indian subcontinent, often bringing with them such coveted merchandise as the latest fashions or, more thrillingly for my then-teenage sisters and brother, early Beatles albums. For some reason, Yemenis especially liked Ringo Starr.
But that security was rocked by guerrilla uprisings in the mid-1960s, and came to an end in the fall of 1967 when the nascent nationalist movement declared independence from the British.
That November, rebels kidnapped my father for two days and released him for a large sum of money, under one condition: We were to pack and leave Aden in 24 hours. Imagine having to find a new home for a family of 11 children in less than a day. Decades later, my sisters would still ask an aunt if she ever found the Beatles records my mother made them leave behind.
What followed were 15 years of exile between Beirut and Cairo. By the late 1970s, though, neither of those tension-filled cities felt safe or welcoming any more, and my father decided there was no choice but to return to Yemen - not to socialist Aden, but to pro-business Sanaa in the north, which was slowly making contact with the outside world after decades of insular, caste-based pseudo-monarchy.
Sanaa? That medieval-looking city? As a young gay man still exploring his sexuality, I knew I couldn't spend the rest of my life in a place where hangings were still held in broad daylight as part of sharia law. But I had to go along, and lived there from 1983 to 1985.
It was a jolt to the system: The streets came to a standstill at 9 p.m. - no one went out, and vans carrying uniformed security guards roamed the city as added security. It was too much silence for a teenager used to the bustle of Cairo.
My sisters' adjustment was more complex. Women were now expected to cover their heads and wear the burka in public, and walk a few steps behind their husbands, fathers or brothers. When I was reunited with my cousin Yousra, who had been living in Sanaa for more than a decade, I reached out to give her a hug, but she pushed me away and shook my hand instead, within the bounds of propriety.
In 1985, I left to study in England, and later migrated to Canada, returning periodically to Sanaa for visits that became more distressing as the years passed, as the gap narrowed between my family and Yemen but widened between them and me.
Of migrants and militants:
The Saddam Hussein factor Local events didn't help. One of the turning points in Yemen's recent history came in 1990, shortly after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August. Yemen stood out for its support of Saddam Hussein's invasion, and paid a dear price.
As hundreds of thousands of migrant Yemeni workers in Saudi Arabia and neighbouring Gulf countries were expelled in retaliation, many of them settled in Sanaa. A small capital city in an impoverished country, already ill equipped to serve its citizens, it cracked under the pressure.
Streets teemed with the unemployed, particularly young men, many of whom succumbed to the Wahabi brand of Islam that the exiled workers had picked up in Saudi Arabia and brought back.
At the co-ed Sanaa University, female students began to complain about harassment from repatriated Yemenis who blamed women's education for the fast-rising unemployment. I don't recall seeing a single beggar in Sanaa during the early 1980s. Now, they stood at virtually every street corner. That medieval but safe city was now gritty - and still medieval.
I paid a visit to my family in the spring of 1992, my first in almost six years, and was shocked to see how just a few years changed us both so dramatically. There was a defeatist quality to their lives, while mine had hopes of a better future. My sisters seemed especially dispirited. Four of them worked for a living, but although their jobs gave them some economic independence, their lives remained limited. Beyond their commute to work, they rarely ventured anywhere other than grocery or clothing stores.
Returning again in the summer of 2001 - my first visit since I had moved to Canada in 1996 - I encountered a family that was a lot closer to the stereotype of regressive Muslim culture than I had ever known.
The veils were in full view. Everybody prayed five times a day. My brothers were unapologetically sexist in their dealings with their wives. Was this the same family that once took turns reading the great works of literature and subscribed to four newspapers daily, three in Arabic and one in English?
One of my brothers was actually suggesting that his eldest daughter need not go to university because education wouldn't help her much as a housewife. One of my sisters, who is in the 1975 beach photo, now works as a librarian at Sanaa University and wears the full niqab, covering her whole face except, just about, the eyes. One day, she followed me around town for half an hour, just for fun, to see if I would recognize her. I never did.
Collectively they have become television addicts. Satellite TV, featuring hundreds of channels from the Arab world and beyond, has taken over from reading and socializing as the main form of entertainment. Why? Because among the many channels you can watch are the more Islamist ones (Hezbollah's Manar TV, for example) that promote a rigid version of the faith.
By the time I visited Sanaa again in 2006, anti-Western and pro-Islamist sympathies intruded on virtually every conversation with friends, neighbours and family. The presence of al-Qaeda is never spoken of as positive, but it's not challenged or condemned either.
The real danger is the tacit acceptance - an acceptance that has been building slowly for more than two decades and has claimed even progressive families like mine.
The government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, in power for more than 30 years now, is too busy protecting its own interests from Yemen's relatively small oil wealth - businesses contributing to it include some Alberta oil companies - to show any real interest in the well-being of its middle-class citizens.
Under his watch, Yemen has gone from a poor country to the most destitute in the Arab world. He fortified his stronghold on the country's larger cities in the north (Sanaa, Taiz, Houdeida), but lost control of the vast tribal terrains outside them. The result is a political culture where the cities are riddled with government red tape, while everywhere else is virtually lawless.
Comparisons to Afghanistan are not entirely warmongering on the part of the U.S. media. My family is reasonably well connected, so it keeps surviving one crisis - food and water shortages, health scares - after another. But for how much longer?
Coming down
to a photo finish
In a black photo album tucked inside an old filing cabinet, I keep more recent family photographs, from my visits to Sanaa, or ones they send in the mail. I don't believe that even my closest friends have seen them. The rare times I look at them, I see only a family that has betrayed its secular, intellectual history and has either chosen or been forced to accept intolerance instead.
One photograph from April, 2006, particularly infuriates me. My family's penchant for group photos never wavers, but this time my eldest brother voices his concern about my sisters being photographed in their "indoor" clothes.
"What if the men who work at the photo-developing shop get to see your sisters in short sleeves or without a head scarf?" he asks, as if it's something I should have thought about myself. This is the same brother who is standing behind me in that 1975 picture I love so much.
My sisters immediately see his point. I'm stunned. We reach a compromise. I can pose with my sisters and mother if they wear the hijab , or at least long sleeves and skirts. I fake a smile as my heart breaks. The last thing I want is an argument on my last night in Sanaa.
I haven't seen my family since.

GOOGLE TAKES AIM ... AT EVERYTHING

Abstract: There's more at stake in this battle than Mr. [Rupert Murdoch]'s threat to have his news sites - including such heavy-hitters as Barron's and the Wall Street Journal - removed from [Google]'s search engine. The news industry represents a prime example of a sector where Google's innovation has changed the entire landscape.

Full text: Long established as the premier search engine, Google is flexing its muscles and venturing into a host of other industries, from news and publishing to telecom, and threatening to change the landscape for all. Omar El Akkad and Iain Marlow report
It's being called the "Google tax."
A report commissioned by the French government and released this week suggests slapping a tax on the online ad revenue of the Web giant and of other major Internet portals. The purpose? To finance France's ailing cultural institutions, which the government believes are being hit hard by illegal downloading made possible in part by the search services of companies such as Google .
Critics panned the proposal as a lazy reaction to innovation in the digital age. But it's France's answer to the same question that is being asked in array of industries ranging from news to telecom, books and music: What do you do when Google comes along and changes everything?
A decade ago, the Web company made its name by helping people find things on the Internet. But Google no longer believes the future of the Web is on the personal computer. Instead, the company predicts most people will soon be connecting to the outside world through mobile devices. If that prediction is right, it means that's where advertising dollars are going too.
Today, Google is expanding into more areas than at any time in its history: smart phones, e-readers, operating systems, on-line stores. Its unveiling this week of the first Google-branded phone running on the Android system, the Nexus One, was just the latest such expansion.
And in almost every sector it touches, Google is disrupting the ecosystem, creating a new wave of winners and losers in its wake.
THE FUTURE OF NEWS
In the battle between News Corp. and Google over the future of digital news, Josh Cohen comes armed with the persuasive power of billions of eyeballs.
Of course, the senior business product manager at Google News doesn't frame the tirades that News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch has unleashed against Google as anything other than an continuing conversation between friends. But when he talks about Google's effort to act as a one-stop hub for the world's news, Mr. Cohen emphasizes that publishers are getting something out of it, too.
"No doubt Google benefits from the ability to index lots of high-quality information - news or otherwise," he says. "But the other part is the value we deliver for publishers: Just in traffic alone, in any given month, Google News sends a billion clicks to publishers worldwide."
The tensions between the Web giant and Mr. Murdoch heightened last month when the media mogul accused Google of stealing information - and revenue - from his company's many news websites.
"Our customers are smart enough to know that you don't get something for nothing," Mr. Murdoch told the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
"And yet there are those who think they have a right to take our news content and use it for their own purposes without contributing a penny to its production."
There's more at stake in this battle than Mr. Murdoch's threat to have his news sites - including such heavy-hitters as Barron's and the Wall Street Journal - removed from Google's search engine. The news industry represents a prime example of a sector where Google's innovation has changed the entire landscape. While several news outlets, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, have embraced Google's news services as a means to survive, others still believe the search engine is engaging in little more than high-tech theft.
Some newspapers have focused on beefing up their digital offerings in order to better compete against myriad blogs and other Web outlets, while others have also turned a critical eye to where many of those Web outlets are getting their news in the first place.
During a recent 30-day period, more than 75,000 websites reused at least one U.S. newspaper article without obtaining a licence, according to a study released last month by the Fair Syndication Consortium, a collection of publishers looking for ways to compensate content creators.
It's that kind of unlicensed use that's at the heart of the dispute between some of the biggest names in traditional news and their new-media counterparts.
"We can no longer stand by and watch others walk off with our work under misguided legal theories," Associated Press chairman Dean Singleton said at the AP annual meeting last year.
However, Mr. Murdoch is in a better position than most to fight Google because News Corp. is in possession of a rare entity among news organizations: the newspaper that has made a pay-wall model work. The Wall Street Journal is one of the few newspapers that has succeeded in getting readers to pay for on-line content, in large part because the paper dominates a niche market with plenty of exclusive stories. But for news outlets that do most of their reporting on non-exclusive stories, such as breaking news, getting people to pay when a free alternative exists has proven very difficult.
"What we're seeing is a forcing of the issue over what's 'differentiating content' versus 'commodity content,' " said Jim Pitkow, chief executive officer of Attributor, a Web-content monitoring firm that founded the Fair Syndication Consortium.
"Competition is now a click away, and that forces differentiation - there used to be little market substitution. Now there's complete market substitution. None of this stuff is going away."
DIAL G FOR GOOGLE
What traditional newspapers have gone through, telecom companies may be next to suffer.
With the launch of its Nexus One smart phone, Google has waded into unfamiliar and very sensitive territory. By selling the phone through its own online store, the Web giant is essentially giving carriers a taste of a less lucrative future.
"This is a complete end run," said Peter Misek, an analyst with Toronto's Canaccord Adams. "What it does is basically try to disintermediate the carriers and make them nothing more than dumb pipes. That's what happened in the landline world of the Internet. It is a significant risk for telcos around the world."
In pairing its Android mobile operating system with a sleek, HTC Corp.-designed phone, Google is staking out valuable real estate as the premier gateway between smart phone users and the Web.
The company is still partnering with some carriers: first and notably, T-Mobile USA, through which Google is offering its $529 (U.S.) smart phone for $179 on a two-year contract. But Canaccord Adams' Mr. Misek doubts "partner" is the right word: No carrier will be allowed to sell the phone through its own retail stores. Google is also shopping it around, striking a blow against carrier exclusivity.
For carriers, that exclusivity can be a big deal: Rogers Communications Inc., for example, had a lucrative iPhone monopoly over its rivals until the end of 2009. Indeed, all three major carriers in Canada boast at least one exclusive model.
But carriers aren't the only companies feeling the effects of Google's move. When the search firm first developed Android, the mobile operating system was presented as one that anybody could use or alter. It still is, but for phone makers such as Motorola and LG who designed Android sets, they now find themselves in direct competition with the very same company that was supposed to be their software ally in the fight against BlackBerrys and iPhones.
"[Google] would directly benefit from accelerating the adoption of the mobile Internet by democratizing it," writes Richard Tse, an analyst at National Bank Financial.
"The problem is, they could disrupt the landscape in doing that, especially if they don't care about making money the traditional way."
It is, ultimately, the traditional way that is in jeopardy, and not just in the world of news and telecom. Google's penchant for the unprecedented extends to myriad other industries.
When the search firm began digitizing and indexing books, it didn't take long for authors and publishers to dispatch their lawyers.
Whereas Google believed it could take snippets of any work it pleased and make it available online under the fair use policy, many of the creators of those works disagreed.
The Google Books project, as such, is still stuck in the courts, with everyone from Google's competitors to foreign governments chiming in with legal opinions.
Recently, the company even went into the electricity business. Upset at its options for purchasing renewable energy, Google simply applied for permission to become a wholesale power distributor. After news of the move surfaced, a Google spokeswoman was forced to make clear that the application "does not signal our intent to operate as a retail provider of electricity."
Even in the traditional online search market, Google is in uncharted territory. No search engine firm as big has dominated the market as long. Hoping to quell accusations of monopolistic behaviour before they surface, Google is spending much more time and money on lobbying, and its lawyers are studying every acquisition target very carefully for the likelihood it would be viewed as an anticompetitive move.
Still, in news, telecom and virtually every other industry, many companies would rather side with Google than against it. Wind Mobile, the upstart wireless carrier that launched in Toronto and Calgary in December, says it wants to bring the Nexus One phone into Canada.
Wind is hoping Google will help Canada follow the lead of Europe, where the GSM phone standard and switching SIM cards between phones is commonplace.
"People don't get subsidized TVs when they sign up for cable," said Chris Robbins, Wind's chief customer officer, knocking the practice of selling expensive phones cheaply with long, fixed-term contracts. "The whole concept doesn't make sense."
THE E-BOOK MARKET
On the same day Google announced the Nexus smart phone, a few smaller firms also made announcements.
A couple of electronic book-reader manufacturers at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas said their devices - which run on Android - would give users access to about one million free public domain works from Google's massive digital library. Google had previously worked out such a deal with Sony - now, it's providing the operating system as well as the books. Add e-readers to the list of industries in which Google has picked a side, and is helping determine a winner. Add Amazon to a list of competitors that ranges from Microsoft to your local phone book.
It is the sheer variety of pies in which Google has a hand that make the company such an important test case. Even as traditional industries struggle to deal with the Web firm's presence, smaller startups can look at Google's experience to determine what they too will face should they attempt to innovate in a well-established field.
That's perhaps why so many critics were quick to pan the French government's proposed tax on the big Web portals as a way to subsidize traditional cultural industries.
"The likes of Google and Facebook are crucial partners for media companies," wrote Forrester analyst Ian Fogg.
"Yes they should be doing more, but they should be encouraged to co-operate as key business partners, not alienated and made enemies of with levies."

GOOGLE'S GROWTH / SECTOR BY SECTOR
SMART PHONES
Google's role: First, it created the Android operating system for mobile devices. Now, it's selling its own Android phone.
Who's happy: HTC, the company that helped Google create its own phone; consumers who don't want to buy their smart phone from a carrier.
Who's not: Smart-phone makers who designed Android phones only to find themselves competing with the company they thought was their ally; carriers, who don't want their business models disrupted.
******
NEWS
Google's role: It runs perhaps the largest news aggregator online, giving millions of people access to the world's information.
Who's happy: News outlets, which get billions of clicks from the service.
Who's not: News outlets, which feel Google is taking their content and making a fortune from it.
******
E-READERS
Google's role: Twofold. Its digital collection of books makes it a great source of content for any manufacturer willing to partner up. Because its Android operating system is made for mobile devices, its a good fit for dual-screen e-reader tablets.
Who's happy: Sony, which previously partnered with Google for book content, and several smaller e-reader manufacturers who have utilized Android.
Who's not: Amazon. The on-line retailer now sees its relatively tiny competition in the e-reader market backed by the world's biggest Web firm.
******
BOOKS
Google's role: To put it simply, Google is trying to make a digital copy of every book ever written.
Who's happy: Publishers who feel this is the next evolution of bookselling. Authors who would otherwise make no money because their books are so hard to find.
Who's not: A slew of authors, publishers, competitors and even governments, who all feel Google is essentially ignoring years of copyright law and trying to create its massive library without properly compensating those who produced the content.

Abstract: While it's true that some wags refer to it as "Scooterville" - referring to a population of seniors twice the size of Victoria's - Sidney is an especially affable seaside city. It looks out on the Strait of Georgia or, as it's about to be renamed according to aboriginal history, the Salish Sea (this, on top of the renaming of the Queen Charlottes as Haida Gwaii, could have monarchists burning their powdered wigs in protest).

Full text: The Island's oft-neglected east coast offers locavore cooking, calm winter fishing and close encounters with sea life
Visitors roaring off the boat for a fast look at Victoria and a $60 cuppa tea at the Fairmont Empress have missed the boat.
Postcard-pretty though the B.C. capital is, it barely hints at the wonders of what locals know as "the Island." For a sense of genuine exploration, the ticket is a breezy road trip up the island's oft-neglected east coast.
The distances aren't great - only 458 kilometres in all - and winter is no great concern, with daytime temperatures even at the northern end hovering at a very mild six degrees or so.
The pauses include a modest aquarium that delivers immodest results, Canada's most dedicated locavore restaurant, the casual acquisition of 80-million-year-old souvenirs and a magnificent and calm archipelago for winter fishing.
Stop 1: Sidney While it's true that some wags refer to it as "Scooterville" - referring to a population of seniors twice the size of Victoria's - Sidney is an especially affable seaside city. It looks out on the Strait of Georgia or, as it's about to be renamed according to aboriginal history, the Salish Sea (this, on top of the renaming of the Queen Charlottes as Haida Gwaii, could have monarchists burning their powdered wigs in protest). Sidney has a fine hotel, the Sidney Pier, a handful of restaurants as good as any in Victoria and 12 bookstores within a four-block radius. It's a place where most people actually read.
Sidney's bona fide tourist attraction is the Shaw Ocean Discovery Centre - think Monterey Bay Aquarium on a much smaller scale. Located in the Sidney Pier, the 17-aquaria complex reveals a local marine ecosystem as spellbinding as it is fragile.
Jellyfish and sea nettles captivate visitors at the outset as choreography. Their dance is something to behold, the orange nettles leaving trails of flame as they cascade to the zzzt of digital cameras: tiny creatures kick-starting a very large sense of wonder.
Among the centre's four galleries, the Gallery of the Salish Sea reminds us that 99 per cent of the living space on Earth actually lies underwater, that we're odd men out in nature's grand scheme. It brings you nose to nose with fishes from salmon to wolf eels. The popular fave is the Giant Pacific octopus, whose shape keeps changing as it negotiates its grotto. Greek chefs look on covetously.
Stop 2: Courtenay
Courtenay lies 3½ hours north of Sidney, but spelunkers may come to a screaming halt 63 kilometres south of town at Horne Lake Caves Provincial Park. The caverns are rife with underground rivers and waterfalls, fossils and crystal formations. Helmets, lights and maps are available for independent explorers.
But Courtenay's claim to fame comes through a different passion: It wants to be foodie capital of the island. Assembling and showcasing the produce of the ultra-fertile Comox Valley, it has accumulated considerable credentials.
Courtenay's proudest restaurant is called Locals. Chef Ronald St. Pierre has done what other chefs only talk about: His restaurant is almost entirely about ingredients. He pulls it off with style and largesse. He shines the spotlight on local producers - Prontissima for pasta, Island Bison for buffalo, Christine's Quackery for duck - at every turn. Wasabi comes farmed by Nature Springs Wasabi, and it's the real thing, not the horseradish and food colouring used in most of Canada's sushi houses.
When you offer eight species of fresh fish from ling cod to sablefish, you're brave. When you offer each in five ways from steamed to stir-fried, you're very brave. Seared albacore loin reveals the St. Pierre modus operandi, the nicely seared tuna served with a brace of vegetarian sushi rolls and, as accents, soy ginger dip, chili oil and cashew coriander pesto. Bison tournedos bring juicy Campbell River bison medallions wrapped in double-smoked bacon, charbroiled, set atop a bed of perfect lentils and garnished with caramelized onion and lavender confit. It's a wonderful dish.
Even the drinks are local. Try a robust Red House Ale from Surgenor Brewing Co. Or a silken cabernet sauvignon from the Beaufort Vineyard and Estate Winery. Never heard of them? Don't snicker: The husband-and-wife winery walked away with a gold at the 2009 All Canadian Wine Championships.
For seasoned fossil hunters, another draw is the presence of 80-million-year-old souvenirs, fossils of creatures 15 million years older than T. rex. Seems 80 million years ago, the Courtenay and Puntledge River areas were a marine version of Jurassic Park. Steven Spielberg might love the elasmosaur, a fearsome marine reptile 12 metres long, with ferocious teeth and a turtle-like body. Its skeleton was unearthed near-fully preserved on the Puntledge River in 1988.
"It's an ongoing process," explains Pat Trask, assistant curator of the Courtenay and District Museum and Paleontology Centre. "The island is always rising. The mud keeps pushing up, bringing fossils to the surface. The rivers wash forest away. The fossils arrive on the surface."
The Courtenay River estuary is a remarkable fish and waterfowl habitat, home to bald eagles, great blue herons, gulls and 13 species of raptors. In winter, expect up to 3,000 trumpeter swans on the wetlands of the river's east side. With wingspans of more than two metres, the swans alone justify the journey.
Stop 3: Port McNeill
It's three very scenic hours north to Port McNeill, a friendly town of loggers, fishermen, outfitters and artists. This is the gateway to the wild and misted Broughton Archipelago, B.C.'s largest marine park.
What amazes anglers is the astonishing calm of the archipelago. Miraculously, there's no swell. No being flung around like rag dolls while reeling in a winter salmon or halibut, the chinooks up to 20 pounds. Local fishing outfits, including Code 3 Charters, take anglers out 12 months a year. Leisure Suit Charters specializes in winter steelhead fishing from heated drift boats.
As important, McNeill is a 40-minute ferry ride from the Kwakwaka'wakw First Nations community of Alert Bay. This is the home of the remarkable U'Mista Cultural Centre. Its heart is the Potlatch Collection, a trove of 450 ceremonial masks and artifacts of regalia outlawed as subversive and seized by Canadian authorities in 1921. The masks were eventually returned, often from private collections, until the 1970s and 1980s.
Powerful expressions of a culture on the rebound, they haunt those who look at them - and continue to do so on the return journey to the realm of the familiar and predictable.

Abstract: Seasoned chick-flick fans will instantly recognize [Anna] as a standard postfeminist Hollywood type: the romantically-starved, overcontrolling young professional woman (substitute Jennifer Lopez, Renee Zellweger or Katherine Heigl) who's adorable, supercompetent and a bit stuck-up. What she needs to be taught is a lesson in romantic humility by the kind of boor she thinks she doesn't like.

Full text: Leap Year
Directed by Anan Tucker
Written by Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan
Starring Amy Adams
and Matthew Goode
Classification: PG
*
L eap Year is the second romantic comedy in a month, following the Hugh Grant-Sarah Jessica Parker movie, Did You Hear About the Morgans? , which proves the most charming of actors can be left flailing in the face of a feeble script and direction.
In both films, there are unnervingly long silences after the intended jokes where, you imagine, the screenwriters must have penciled in some down time for the rollicking laughs they expected.
Leap Year stars the reliably endearing Amy Adams ( Julie and Julia, Enchanted ) as Boston native Anna, a professional real-estate "stager" who fluffs and prepares luxurious homes for potential buyers. She's moving into her dream condo with her blow-dried BlackBerry-addicted cardiologist boyfriend (Adam Scott), but after four years, he hasn't popped the question.
Seasoned chick-flick fans will instantly recognize Anna as a standard postfeminist Hollywood type: the romantically-starved, overcontrolling young professional woman (substitute Jennifer Lopez, Renee Zellweger or Katherine Heigl) who's adorable, supercompetent and a bit stuck-up. What she needs to be taught is a lesson in romantic humility by the kind of boor she thinks she doesn't like.
On the verge of moving into the condo of her dreams, Anna mistakenly believes her beau is about to propose. When he heads off to Ireland for a conference instead, she decides to follow him, following a folk tradition that says women can propose to men once every four years on Feb. 29. Bad weather leaves her stranded in a town in Dingle, in the southwest of Ireland, where she hires a scruffily handsome, surly pub owner, Declan (Matthew Goode) to escort her to Dublin to meet her future husband.
Essentially, Leap Year isthe umpteenth variation on Frank Capra's 1934 classic, It Happened One Night , in which the ill-matched couple is thrown together on a road trip, where, amidst a series of misadventures, their initial antagonism gives way to romance. The predictable comic formula is, in a sense, part of the contract with the audience. Of course, Anna must fall on her behind in mud and step in cow dung and share a small room with Declan for the night. What the contract doesn't include is that the execution should be so clumsily obvious, that every moment should be telegraphed before and after it happens.
But then, director Tucker and screenwriters Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan ( Made of Honor, Josie and the Pussycats ) have such a fondness for the trite they can make even the beautiful hills and stone-wall fenced fields of Kerry seem flat as the pages in a coffee-table book. Scenes are filled with flat-capped Irish locals who dispute, fight and spend their lives in pubs, holding forth on antiquated superstitions.
At least Adams and Goode are always watchable, even when you occasionally feel embarrassed for them. Goode ( A Single Man ) suggests a dreamy young Jeremy Irons (he played the same role in the movie version of Brideshead Revisited ). He growls, and shows his contempt for Anna's fancy American ways by rolling his eyes and eating with his mouth open, but his character's fundamental vulnerability is always discernible.
Adams harrumphs, pouts and tosses her hair while tottering around the luminous southwest of Ireland in bum-hugging skirts and stiletto heels. (If there's one thing you imagine super-competent young professional women would understand, it's how to dress for travel.)
Though she always carries a childlike innocence that goes with her snub-nosed, girlish features, Adams is a real actress, and there are flashes of her talent here, moments when she shows her mercurial ability to change from despair to exuberance in a heartbeat. Here, she seems to be working at about 2 per cent capacity, but her performance is still the best 80 per cent of the picture.

Full text: cblatchford@globeandmail.com
A judge's decision last month ordering OPP Commissioner Julian Fantino to face allegations he tried to influence the Caledonia, Ont. town council isn't the only instance where the Ontario Provincial Police boss has acted out of fury in connection with what appears to be his private war with Gary McHale.
Mr. McHale is the controversial 47-year-old activist who has led protests against the four-year-old native occupation of a former Caledonia subdivision called Douglas Creek Estates and who is perhaps the longest-standing and most vocal critic of how the OPP has handled the crisis there.
He is also editor of the website, CaledoniaWakeUpCall.com. A little like Mr. McHale himself, the site's colourful, almost cartoonish appearance belies its careful documentation.
It was Mr. McHale who laid a private information, as it's called, against Mr. Fantino, alleging that in an April 7, 2007, e-mail to Caledonia Mayor Marie Trainer and her councillors, he attempted to influence or influenced the council.
In August last year, a Hamilton justice of the peace refused to proceed with the charge, though he found that Mr. Fantino indeed had made a threat. But on Dec. 31 Mr. Justice David Crane of the Ontario Superior Court overturned the JP's decision and ordered him to "issue process" - basically, to get on with it and issue a formal information against the Commissioner.
That, Ontario Attorney-General spokesman Brendan Crawley said last night, will happen in the lower court today.
In his e-mail, Mr. Fantino was responding to a new posting on Mr. McHale's website from Caledonia councillor Craig Grice, defending Mr. McHale and supporting "his stance on two-tier justice," as many Caledonians describe the OPP manner of policing there.
Evidence in a recent lawsuit against the government and OPP, settled out of court just after Christmas, showed the OPP treated the native occupiers with kid gloves, anti-occupation activists such as Mr. McHale as trouble-makers.
Mr. Fantino labelled the Grice e-mail "deeply disturbing," slammed Mr. McHale as "a lightning rod for confrontation and potential violence," and told Mayor Trainer that if any of his officers was injured as a result of "forays into the community by McHale" - at the time, Mr. McHale and his wife Christine lived in a Richmond Hill condo - he would hold Councillor Grice and Haldimand County responsible; support any OPP officer who wanted to sue the county in the civil courts; bill the policing costs back to Haldimand and "strongly recommend" that the OPP not renew its policing contract.
Curiously, Mr. Fantino copied three senior Ontario government officials on his lengthy note - Tony Dean, then the Secretary of Cabinet; Chris Morley, press secretary for Premier Dalton McGuinty, and Peter Wilkinson, Mr. McGuinty's chief of staff.
When Mr. McHale asked him, during the preliminary hearing last April, why he had copied staff in the Premier's office, Mr. Fantino replied that the Caledonia occupation "was not solely, and never has been solely a policing issue."
But the OPP boss, court documents show, also personally twice complained about another Caledonia resident, David Hartless, a Hamilton Police Service officer whose home is within 100 feet of the occupied site.
Like many other residents, Detective-Constable Hartless, as he once testified, found the situation "absolutely abhorrent" and said "policing was in effect suspended in that town."
Mr. Fantino, reached yesterday on his cellphone in Ottawa, where he attended the funeral of slain Ottawa Constable Ireneusz (Eric) Czapnik, told The Globe and Mail he couldn't comment.
"This whole thing is all up in the air," he said. "Pieces of it are still before the courts." He added that, "We're a police agency trying to do our utmost in a very difficult situation and we seem to be getting slagged left, right and centre."
But last year, under oath at a preliminary hearing for Mr. McHale's bizarre charge of "counselling mischief not committed" - even the judge who presided over the preliminary hearing said he'd never heard of it - Commissioner Fantino admitted he wrote Hamilton Chief Brian Mullan "formally taking exception" to Det.-Constable Hartless's "mean-spirited and totally false accusations directed at the OPP."
Det.-Constable Hartless made the disputed remarks in a Feb. 17, 2007, "open letter" addressed to Premier McGuinty which he e-mailed to more than a dozen people, including several MPs and MPPs, local newspapers, the government's senior negotiator, John Nolan, and Mr. McHale's website.
Mr. McHale did what he always does with public documents, and promptly posted the letter on his website; Mr. Nolan forwarded a copy to OPP Inspector Dave McLean, who sent it to Superintendent John Cain and a few minutes later to Mr. Fantino.
In his note, Insp. McLean suggested perhaps Chief Mullan "might like a heads up should the Premier's office...want to discuss it with the officer's chief..."
The next day, the OPP boss e-mailed Chief Mullan, saying, "We, the OPP, have had enough of this nonsense" and characterized Det.-Constable Hartless's remarks as "conduct unbecoming".
The following day, Det.-Constable Hartless was informed the complaint "from the Commissioner of the OPP" had been forwarded to Hamilton's professional standards branch for investigation and was subjected to a gag order, which he contested successfully in court.
Eight months later, Halton Regional Police, which eventually conducted the probe, cleared Det.-Constable Hartless of any misconduct.
But last year, he testified, the OPP boss filed another complaint against him, this time for signing an online petition criticizing Mr. Fantino and more generally for what Det.-Constable Hartless called the OPP's "failures of policing duties."
That complaint was also found to be unsubstantiated.
Det.-Constable Hartless's real sin in Mr. Fantino's eyes was to have been badmouthing the OPP through signs on his lawn, letters to the editor and signing petitions.
But as Det.-Constable Hartless put it ringingly in testimony on April 24 last year, "I had not been discrediting the OPP; the OPP had been openly discrediting the OPP, and I simply pointed it out."
As for Mr. McHale, despite Mr. Fantino's clear efforts, as documented in e-mails and court transcripts, to "take him out" - that is, have him charged with something, anything - the only crime the OPP has charged him with is the novel "counselling mischief not committed."
A date for the resumption of the preliminary hearing on that charge has yet to be set. Mr. McHale, as he almost always does, will represent himself - a portly, bespectacled fellow who is nonetheless proving a spirited and sharp combatant.

20 go-to bottles, all under $20

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/20-go-bottles-all-under/docview/382592871/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Many of us have a mental list, though, of go-to brands. Wines that are good to have on hand and won't involve a second-mortgage application. Wines that fit the bill for when the spouse says, "It's the last day of my Gwyneth Paltrow cleanse and we're out of pinot grigio. Could you pick some up?"

Full text: Think of these wines as pantry staples to keep on hand for easy pairings, everyday meals and last-minute toasts
bcrosariol@globeandmail.com
What's in your wine pantry? Not your cellar. I mean pantry.
And I'm speaking figuratively, of course. People generally don't keep kitchen larders stockpiled solely with bottles for everyday drinking. (Well, I do, but I'm funny that way.)
Many of us have a mental list, though, of go-to brands. Wines that are good to have on hand and won't involve a second-mortgage application. Wines that fit the bill for when the spouse says, "It's the last day of my Gwyneth Paltrow cleanse and we're out of pinot grigio. Could you pick some up?" I'm talking affordable kitchen-counter staples for when the cookbook advises: "Serve with a syrah or gutsy French red."
If there are empty slots in your wine pantry, consider the candidates that follow. It's hardly a definitive list. For one thing, I restricted it to widely available selections. Most great wines simply aren't available in more than one province at a time, let alone nationally. That's not just because fine wine tends to be made in small quantities but also because parochial Canadian liquor legislation renders it cumbersome for wineries and importers to operate nationally: They have to deal with government agencies in each and every province for every single product.
I've also spread the selections across a variety of major grape types rather than sticking with just one or two popular styles. After all, you wouldn't stock a food pantry with just sugar and flour. Variety is the spice of wine.
There is another restriction: I've placed great emphasis on price, setting the cap at $20, based on Ontario retail. Any higher, and we're talking about the cellar rather than pantry. So, think of this list as my Pop 20 under $20 for 2010. In some cases, where important, I've listed the vintage year to look for. All prices are those in Ontario, except where specified.
Chardonnay
One nominee raced to mind here. Louis Jadot Bourgogne Chardonnay ($19.95). Year in, year out, this entry-level white from the one of France's best large producers overachieves. And the fresh 2008 vintage is very good. White Burgundy is almost always made with chardonnay, and chardonnay is nowhere more food-friendly than in a well-made Burgundy. Pair with anything, but this medium-bodied white is especially fit for poultry, richer fish dishes, and lighter-coloured red meats such as pork and veal. Runner-up: Louis Latour Chardonnay 2007 , also from Burgundy ($15.95).
Cabernet Sauvignon
So much competition in this category. Every region wants to grow the most coveted red grape. But no region does it better in such an affordable way than Chile. Concha Y Toro Marques de Casa Concha ($19.95): Part of the premium label of the popular Concha Y Toro brand, this cab outclasses most in its price range. Ideal for steak, lamb or rare roast beef. Runner-up: Santa Rita Medalla Real Cabernet Sauvignon 2006 ($19.95).
Sangiovese
Available only in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta, Remole Toscana 2007 ($12.95) tastes a lot like a decent Chianti, but without the price premium. Medium-bodied, fresh and unoaked, it's super-versatile at the table. Tremendous value. Runner-up: Gabbiano Chianti 2007 , another good Tuscan red for the price.
Merlot
There is good merlot and there is dirty dish water disguised as merlot. Most of the stuff in your local store falls into the latter category. I'm usually so thrilled to find an example of the former for less than $20 that it makes me want to invent a 140-character text-messaging system so I'd have a way of alerting my friends. Ghost Pines Merlot 2006 ($19.95), a new label from the Louis Martini winery in California, now owned by the Gallo family, delivers. Smooth like a merlot should be, and luscious with creamy mocha and succulent fruit flavours. Runner-up: Leaping Horse Merlot 2007 ($11.50), also from California.
Syrah/Grenache
Unless your cookbook, or your personal preference, specifically calls for the jammy, high-alcohol Australian style of syrah better known as shiraz, look to southern France for bargain-priced syrah and syrah-grenache blends. They are nothing if not versatile. Most French versions are named after places where the grape grows rather than after the grape varieties themselves. That's the case with Château de Gourgazaud Minervois 2007 ($12.95). A blend containing mostly syrah, it hit a high note in 2007, the vintage widely available now on shelves. Plummy fruit and classic southern French notes of wild herbs. A good full-bodied red for stews, braised meats and any dish that could be described as "hearty." Runner-up: Perrin Reserve Côtes du Rhône 2007 ($14.95), a very good vintage of this grenache-syrah-mourvedre blend from the family behind the great Château de Beaucastel Châteauneuf-du-Pape.
Sauvignon Blanc Chile also is a great source of cabernet's white relative (parent vine, actually), and Santa Rita 120 Sauvignon Blanc ($10.45) is a standout value. Herbaceous, and zesty and plump with citrus-tropical fruit, this fresh, light-bodied white is good for shellfish, lighter vegetable dishes such as poached asparagus, and even a variety of cheeses. Runner-up: Les Fumees Blanches from France ($11.95), a whiff of delicate, elegant Sancerre at about half the price.
Pinot noir
At under $20 and widely available, this category comes perilously close to being more deserted than a Leafs locker room during playoff season. But thanks to a few exceptions, the everyman's-pinot category remains alive. Oneof those is MacMurray Ranch Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast 2007 ($19.95 - though it's as high as $24.99 in B.C.). Nice for pork, duck or other poultry, and even grilled salmon. Runner-up (and hot tip): Villa Maria Private Bin Pinot Noir 2007 (about $19.95); though not yet available, this excellent New Zealand pinot is on its way to Ontario later this year at a great price of $19.95.
Pinot gris/grigio
Compare most similarly priced Italian pinot grigios with Bodega J & F Lurton Pinot Gris 2008 ($10.95) and, well, there's no comparison. Yes, they're made from the same grape, but this consistent, Argentine winner is more flavourful while also achieving an elegant balance. Light- to medium-bodied, it's a very versatile white. Runner-up: Bollini Pinot Grigio ($16.95), better than the average crisp grigio from Italy.
Riesling
Lots of choice here. This is the best territory for including domestic wine in your liquid pantry. It's hard to do much better than Cave Spring Estate Riesling 2007 from Niagara ($17.95). Great balance and complexity in this German-style, virtually dry white. Runner-up: See Ya Later Ranch Riesling 2007 from B.C. ($16.99 in B.C.)
Gewurztraminer
If you cook Asian food, especially Thai or Indian, park this grape in your pantry. There are terrific examples from Canada. But Pierre Sparr Gewurztraminer from the grape's spiritual homeland of Alsace ($16.50) is classic and very competent for the money (though sadly $21.99 in B.C.). Runner-up: Red Rooster Gewurztraminer from B.C. ($15.99 in B.C.).

Full text: Vancouver's long-awaited Woodward's project officially opens this month, gambling on a unique blend of uses in the Downtown Eastside
For almost two decades, it was a black hole at the eastern entrance to Vancouver's downtown: a hulking empty building surrounded by vacant storefronts and drug dealers.
But now, the former Woodward's department store - once the centre of gravity on a bustling commercial street - is coming back to life, as one of the most complex urban-rehabilitation projects in Canada nears completion.
This fall, more than 1,000 people moved into market condos that are part of the $500-million project, including Joe Lousa and his wife, part of the crowd that bought the idea of living in a unique experiment aimed at creating a socially mixed microcosm of the city.
"I had a hard time explaining to people why we decided to do this," said Mr. Lousa, a security guard who works a few blocks away from his 16th-floor condo, which sits on the border of the Downtown Eastside. "But the more time you spend down here, the more you realize it's not bad at all."
Soon, an additional 400 people, including 75 families and another 125 singles who suffer from a combination of mental illness, drug addiction and poverty, will also move in. It won't cure the area's notorious homelessness problems, but it should certainly make a dent.
A grocery and a drugstore opened in early December, bringing legal commercial activity to the block that hasn't been seen since Woodward's closed in 1993. Staff from Vancouver city hall and three federal departments, including the National Film Board and Health Canada, will move in this month, as will non-profit groups. And there's a rooftop daycare on top of the restored original department store.
In February, Simon Fraser University will open its massive Centre for the Performing Arts in the project. It includes half a dozen performance or cinema spaces, with a gala launch of theatre director Robert Lepage's The Blue Dragon .
All of that interlocking activity is what project developer Ian Gillespie, architect Gregory Henriquez and political advocate Jim Green say will make this project a success where so many urban-regeneration developments have failed.
"It's transformative," says Mr. Gillespie, who, with business partner Ben Yeung, has spent six years fine-turning details on the building, from the enormous Stan Douglas photo mural in the central atrium to the sculpted "French fry" columns on one of the condo towers to the handmade benches on the rooftop garden. "And part of the reason for that is just the amount of body heat from all these people who will be using it. You need that mass and scale to make it work."
Mr. Henriquez says the project is unlike anything he's ever done or expects to do again in his lifetime.
"As a model of inclusivity, it's a really beautiful statement," said Mr. Henriquez, who spent years figuring out such details as entrances that would suit each client group and common spaces they could share comfortably, such as the main civic plaza, which has entrances from three sides.
Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Henriquez are getting calls from people around North America who want to know more about the project. They expect to spend the 2010 Winter Olympics month giving tours to out-of-town visitors who have expressed interest and are looking at replicating the ideas in their own cities.
But as they and others say, this project demanded an unusual level of political will, blind faith and collaboration - something others would have to be prepared for if they wanted to undertake something similar.
"It involves a lot of people taking risks," says Mr. Gillespie, who adds he won't know for several years whether he broke even, lost money, or made a profit on the project.
The block was a yawning pit of development demons six years ago.
The store was a designated heritage site, filled with asbestos and crumbling brick that hadn't been maintained for 15 years. Downtown Eastside groups had a passionate attachment to it, and it had been the site of a famous squat for a couple of months in 2002 with hundreds of people demanding that it be turned into social housing.
And it was unclear whether anyone would be willing to buy a condo, run a store, or establish an office in the rundown area - at any price.
The recovery started when Mr. Green, a long-time Downtown Eastside advocate for saving the building, was elected to council in 2002 and he pushed a deal for the provincial government to buy it for $5.5-million - a quarter of its assessed value.
But the project was far from a done deal, because of all the negatives. "I didn't have a single developer willing to take it on," said Michael Flanigan, the city's director of real-estate services, the bureaucrat whom many credit with making the project a reality.
City planners ran lengthy consultations with the local community to get their ideas and find out what would make the project work for them. The city also appointed a community advisory committee - a crucial step, Mr. Green said. "This was a great victory for the people of that community who worked to save that building for years."
But it did mean that anyone developing the site needed to do it in a way that was going to include the existing neighbourhood, the poorest in Canada, and not just prompt a wave of gentrification. The project also had to include homes for 125 of the neighbourhood's poorest people - those who had been homeless or close to it.
When Mr. Gillespie's group won the bid, it took years of negotiating with major local retailers - Jimmy Pattison's group for the Nesters Market grocery store, and Brandt Louie's drugstore chain, London Drugs, and the Toronto Dominion Bank - to ensure they would come in, something that Mr. Gillespie felt was essential.
To help convince them, "they got deals that you wouldn't typically find," he admits.
In the end, says Mr. Gillespie, "they said, 'We've had a fortunate business model and we want to give something back to the neighbourhood.' So they closed their eyes and went in."
Which is, in a way, what happened with everyone in the project.
*******
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
"We think it's a big gamble but we're committed to making it work."
Mark Townsend, director of PHS Community Services, which will run the 125-unit singles housing and provide security in the public areas.
"It's still a compromise with a massive private component in it. To the extent that there is public space in the building, it is due to community pressure. That does show some success."
Nick Blomley, Simon Fraser University professor and author of Unsettling the City .
"The creativity within this neighbourhood is really strong, and we do have projects that intersect with the residents here. It's good to be living with people rather than being on the outside. And it closes the divide."
Tracey Friesen, executive producer, Pacific and Yukon Centre, National Film Board, whose 12 staff will be moving to the Abbott building of the project
"Historically, that area was the centre of the only commercial activity. We can never go back in history and assume this is going to be a great retail area again. Instead, we should try to establish beads on a necklace instead of small businesses. And Woodward's is going to be that big bead on one end. But the really important thing is that we're going to repatriate this area."
Blake Hudema, retail consultant
"It's definitely been our most complicated development. It's such a high-density environment that trying to meet everyone's needs is a challenge. But everyone's looking forward to the positive contribution it's going to make to the community."
Bob Nicklin, Affordable Housing Societies, which manages the 75 units of family housing.

Forest companies gain legal traction for tax revolt

Author: Hunter, Justine

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/forest-companies-gain-legal-traction-tax-revolt/docview/382588672/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Mr. Justice Peter Voith noted that property tax rates on industry are "markedly higher" in B.C. than they are in Ontario or elsewhere in Western Canada, but he ruled that municipalities have the legal right to set tax rates. "These matters are properly addressed by different levels of government and not by the courts," he ruled.

Full text:   A brewing tax revolt by B.C. forestry companies has gained a legal foothold after the B.C. Supreme Court found a Vancouver Island community cannot boost its tax rate for forest lands.
This week's court decision will cost the City of Campbell River $1.2-million, but it is also sending ripples through other B.C. communities where forest companies are withholding tax payments in what they say is a battle for survival.
The tax rebellion began in January, 2009, when Catalyst Paper Corp. announced it would not pay its tax bills in the communities where it operates, saying industrial tax rates are too high.
A series of lawsuits against the municipalities of Castlegar, Powell River, Port Alberni, North Cowichan, Kitimat and Campbell River soon followed from companies seeking tax relief.
TimberWest Forest Corp. joined the movement after getting a tenfold increase on its tax bill in Campbell River - a change designed to give other industry ratepayers a break.
"It seemed unreasonable, unrealistic," Steve Lorimer, a spokesman for TimberWest, said yesterday. "There is a bit of a discontent here with the tax rates, which are generally not related to how much profit you make." He said the rate increase would have made it even harder for the company, which has already branched out into real-estate development, to keep forestry operations afloat.
But Campbell River Mayor Charlie Cornfield said council will discuss next week whether to appeal the ruling. The city is already struggling to cope with an outstanding tax bill of more than $4-million from Catalyst - roughly 20 per cent of the city's budget.
"The difficulty that local governments face is that we have only one way to raise revenue, that's taxation," he said. "We still have to provide the services to our citizens and corporations, and that costs money."
Thursday's court ruling gives TimberWest some relief, but the victory is expected to increase pressure on the provincial government to intervene - especially if it encourages other companies to join the fray.
TimberWest's success in court is a first for the industry in this battle.
Catalyst Paper Corp. withheld $15-million in taxes in 2009, but has lost three court challenges in recent months. All three of those rulings are under appeal.
British Columbia's forest industry has been contracting heavily in the face of the high Canadian dollar, a devastating pine beetle infestation and the collapse of the U.S. housing market.
The downturn has taken its toll on the provincial coffers as well. Last fall, the B.C. budget was revised in part because forest companies clawed back corporate income taxes paid in previous years.
The provincial government has refused to get involved to date, but both industry and municipal governments say that must change.
"This is a provincial issue and it is just beginning," Castlegar Mayor Lawrence Chernoff said yesterday. "Corporations are watching this with an eagle eye and I have talked to mayors across the province and they are worried."
The forestry downturn has hit his Kootenays community hard. The main sawmill closed 18 months ago, and the only other major employer, the Celgar pulp mill, refused to pay its July tax bill.
Celgar's taxes usually cover 45 per cent of the city's entire budget. "We stopped paving," Mr. Chernoff said. Maintenance spending has been frozen, and the shortfall derailed planned infrastructure projects designed to attract new industry.
The mayor fought back, calling on Celgar's parent company to use some of the tens of millions of dollars of federal grant money it is getting for energy-efficiency efforts to settle its bills.
On Christmas Eve, the pulp mill's owners unexpectedly backed down. They delivered a cheque for $470,000 and promised to talk about a payment plan on the remaining $2.7-million bill.
Now Mr. Chernoff is worried that the TimberWest ruling could set back that bit of progress.
"We've got Teck Cominco [now Teck Resources] down the road, are they going to do the same thing? The corporations are saying, 'We just can't afford to pay no more.' "
The picture looked rosier for the municipal governments last October, when a B.C. Supreme Court judge dismissed Catalyst's claim against North Cowichan.
Mr. Justice Peter Voith noted that property tax rates on industry are "markedly higher" in B.C. than they are in Ontario or elsewhere in Western Canada, but he ruled that municipalities have the legal right to set tax rates. "These matters are properly addressed by different levels of government and not by the courts," he ruled.
On the heels of that ruling, Catalyst president Richard Garneau wrote to Premier Gordon Campbell, asking him to help secure interim relief for B.C. municipalities that heavily rely on an industrial tax base.
"Without your leadership, I fear efforts to resolve the challenge will lose the race against time," he wrote. "We need a made-in-B.C. ... solution to ensure our province retains and expands its industrial base."

Full text:   After 25 years of defying expectations in the male-dominated industry, Edmonton-born vintner celebrates her pioneering success
gyork@globeandmail.com
The Afrikaner men who reigned over South Africa's wineries in the apartheid era were amused by the former ski instructor from Alberta who was trying to break into their ranks.
She was a foreigner, she didn't speak Afrikaans, she was trying to convert a fruit farm into a winery - and she was a woman in a male-dominated industry.
"I was a bit of a novelty - like their mascot," says Norma Ratcliffe, the first female winemaker to become commercially successful in South Africa. "They couldn't believe that I was making this fabulous wine."
A quarter-century after selling her first bottle of wine, the self-described tomboy from Edmonton is today seen as one of the pioneers of contemporary South African winemaking, an industry that has boomed globally in the post-apartheid years.
Her company, Warwick Estate, has gained recognition as one of the best wineries in the world, with its products often landing in the annual top 100 lists of leading wine magazines. Even in the midst of a global recession, her winery is expanding, adding new buildings to boost its capacity by 30 per cent.
And now she is helping other women breach the barriers to South Africa's wine industry in a mentoring project that involves apprenticeships and networking events. There are 50 women winemakers in Stellenbosch alone, she says, yet none have been invited to join the Cape Winemakers Guild, the elite group of South African winemakers.
Ms. Ratcliffe is still the only woman in history to become a member (and chairwoman) of the Cape Winemakers Guild, which remains a highly exclusive body. "I think it's very bad," she says bluntly. "It's disgusting. They've never had another woman member. The attitude seems to come from the young guys, not the old guys. I'm after them all the time about it."
Ms. Ratcliffe, a science graduate from the University of Alberta and a former competitive skier, was running a restaurant on an island in Greece when she met Stan Ratcliffe, a South African who owned a 200-year-old farm in a stunningly beautiful valley near Stellenbosch, capital of the South African wine industry.
They were married in Edmonton in 1971 - in the middle of a blizzard, to the shock of the South African family members - and then settled at his farm, where they grew pumpkins and cabbages and drove them to local markets at dawn. They soon began to take an interest in wine, planting grapes vines and making experimental wines throughout the 1970s and early 1980s.
The apartheid system was a constant presence in South Africa at that time. An ancient "slave bell" - for calling the workers to the farm - is still visible at Warwick's entrance, a legacy of its history. Until the end of apartheid, the farm's workers were sometimes hauled away by police for lacking the "passes" that blacks were required to carry under the notorious pass laws. And global boycotts kept South African wine out of the international market.
Lacking any background in the wine business, Ms. Ratcliffe started at the bottom. She studied the Afrikaans language, took classes in winemaking, pored through books, bought second-hand equipment, learned to fix pumps and patch leaks in barrels and worked for months at a wine cellar in the Bordeaux region of France. In 1984, she released the first Warwick vintage, a cabernet sauvignon, which became an instant hit.
She credits the valley's rich soil, and the help she got from generous neighbours, as big factors in her success. But she was also innovative: she was one of the first South African winemakers to make Bordeaux-style blends and to put wine into French oak barrels.
Her true genius, however, was the branding and marketing of her wine, which soon built an international name for Warwick, especially after the boycotts were lifted when apartheid ended in 1994. Her winery created the First Lady and Three Cape Ladies vintages, a reference to her pioneering status and her daughter and granddaughter. One of her most famous wines, Warwick Trilogy - a blend of cabernet sauvignon, merlot and cabernet franc - has become a South African flagship brand and has been served at state dinners.
Her daughter, Jennifer, has inherited her mother's touch for marketing. A wine master and wine judge in her own right, she wrote a sex-themed wine manual entitled Spit or Swallow: A Guide for the Wine Virgin . The book helped to demystify wine and "sold like crazy," her mother says.
Ms. Ratcliffe and her son, Mike, who has taken over management of the winery, still travel the world constantly to market their wines and keep up with global knowledge. "Some of the best information you can get is from a wine bar in Bordeaux," she says.
Although her estate is still considered a boutique winery, it sold 420,000 bottles of wine last year, including 144,000 bottles in the United States and tens of thousands more in Asia and Europe, and managed to remain profitable even during the world recession.
Her Canadian homeland, ironically, has been the toughest market to penetrate. Warwick sells fewer than 5,500 bottles annually in Canada. She blames the stodgy managers of Canada's government-controlled liquor monopolies, who have little knowledge of South African wines.
"They're out of touch," she says. "If they don't sell the wine in a certain period of time, they don't care, they still get their paycheque. They favour volume brands from South Africa - real plonk. Nobody here would touch it. We've been fighting this for a long time."
But the problem of the Canadian liquor boards is far from her mind as she drives around her 127-hectare estate, surveying the vineyards on a beautiful summer day. "Everything is so healthy this year," she marvels. "Everything is looking stunning. We're really full of joy."

Abstract: Mr. [Ian MacLeod] and a friend, Mike Bonneveld, started the Toronto Polar Bear Club five years ago. Both are in real estate and have known each other since university and have been doing New Year's Day dips for 20 years, said Mr. MacLeod. When they realized Canada's largest city didn't have a Polar Bear Club, they decided to link their love of chilly New Year's Day dips with another passion, helping build homes for those in need.

Full text:   Polar Bear Club's annual New Year's Day swim raises thousands of dollars for Habitat for Humanity
New Year's Day for many people means the dawn of a new year with new resolutions, and for some, it's the day they go for a swim in Lake Ontario and support a local charity.
"For most dippers, it's a spur-of-the-moment decision," said Ian MacLeod, co-founder of the Toronto Polar Bear Club.
Hundreds of people clad in bathing suits and running shoes will run into Lake Ontario's frigid waters today for the annual New Year's Day Polar Bear Dip to support Habitat for Humanity Toronto. The dippers will take their chilly swim at noon at Sunnyside Beach. The event has already raised more than $15,000 for the charity, said Mr. MacLeod, and much more is expected.
"We never know until the day of, but based on web traffic and pledges, we're way up over last year so far," he said.
Mr. MacLeod and a friend, Mike Bonneveld, started the Toronto Polar Bear Club five years ago. Both are in real estate and have known each other since university and have been doing New Year's Day dips for 20 years, said Mr. MacLeod. When they realized Canada's largest city didn't have a Polar Bear Club, they decided to link their love of chilly New Year's Day dips with another passion, helping build homes for those in need. Combining the dip with a good cause brings a lot of people out, Mr. MacLeod said.
"Part is the thrill of doing it," returning participant Jeff Bell said. "But then when all the money goes to a great charity, it makes it even more appealing."
Habitat for Humanity Toronto gives poor families a chance to buy a home at an price that's affordable for them and pay back their mortgage interest-free. Last year, the charity had 86 homes under construction in Toronto, Habitat for Humanity Toronto CEO Neil Hetherington said, adding that the funds from the annual polar bear dip have been invaluable.
Most Toronto families living below the poverty line are either in overcrowded apartments or damp, cold and illegal basement dwellings, and helping them buy their own home can break the cycle of poverty, Mr. Hetherington said.
According to Mr. Hetherington, who will lead by example and take a dip himself, the event will raise more than the already pledged $15,000. That's enough money to build foundations for three new homes, he said.
"In a concrete way, the dippers are changing the lives of three families," Mr. Hetherington said. "So we'll have a good dip and some families will have a great life."
For those interested in the New Year's Day Polar Bear Dip in support of Habitat for Humanity Toronto, visit www.torontopolarbear.com. There is a minimum donation of $20, and participants must arrive by 11:30 a.m. at 1755 Lake Shore Boulevard West to register.

AT LONDON'S CROSSROADS

Abstract: Most of the hotels in King's Cross are either budget chains or slightly frightening flophouses. But Rough Luxe, a "little bit of luxury in a rough part of London," is less fleabag, more posh teabag. The orange shag carpet and Gilbert & George poster in the parlour are clear signals to the style conscious. Each of the nine rooms is decorated in shabby-sumptuous fashion, with prices for a single starting at $294 - that's with a shared bathroom.

Full text:   King's Cross has been gritty for three centuries or so. But now that the Eurostar stops here, cool chefs and hoteliers have arrived, and artists are following suit
Even the Elizabethans were wary of the London neighbourhood now known as King's Cross: "Walk not there too late," one scholar warned in the 17th century, and that was before the bone boilers and horse butchers moved in, followed by the slum dwellers and, more recently, the drug dealers, pickpockets and prostitutes.
When I moved to London in 2004, I looked at an apartment in King's Cross, a notorious area of central London sandwiched between the Regent's Canal to the north and Bloomsbury to the south. It was a lovely place, full of light, spread over three floors, with a shiny red plastic button by the front door.
"What's this?" I asked the real estate agent, who shrugged and looked sheepish.
"It's just a precaution," he said. "You won't ever need it."
It was, of course, a panic button, and when I noticed the bars over each of the big, bright windows, I decided perhaps this was not the apartment for me. These days I probably couldn't afford it, because rents are soaring in this once-decrepit neighbourhood. ("Mountains of filth," sniffed a 19th-century politician making an official report on King's Cross. "Hillocks of horse-dung.")
The renewal of the past few years is largely due to the refurbishment of St. Pancras rail station, the Victorian gem that, until 10 years ago, was the derelict home of crackheads, hookers and out-of-their-heads ravers. Now, as the London terminus for the Eurostar train, it's home to bon vivants, gourmands and out-of-pocket champagne swillers. In 2011, a luxury hotel will reopen in the station, giving the local economy another boost. One of London's top art schools, Central St. Martins, is relocating to King's Cross; can avant-garde shoulder pads be far behind?
For now, the neighbourhood is still sleazy enough to provide an illicit thrill for the urban explorer - it is home to Soho Books, which proudly proclaims itself "Adult Retailer of the Year, 2009." (I didn't know they'd already held the awards ceremony.) But the rubber fetishists and weed peddlers are increasingly being squeezed out by the design and advertising agencies, and the young professionals who've snapped up Victorian row houses - even if they have to step over drunks to get their kids to school in the morning.
It's a glorious part of London because it's the real London: squalor and beauty living in companionable peace. But the Elizabethans were right; you really should watch your purse at night.
Getting off the train
You could spend an entire day at St. Pancras, the most beautiful train station in Europe and now a mini-mall filled with clothing boutiques and food shops. If you're going to Paris or Brussels, you should factor in at least an extra hour for a stop in Europe's longest champagne bar, where you'll be drinking on the platform only a few metres away from the wheezing Eurostar trains.
If you're hungry, the St. Pancras Grand serves classic English cuisine - bubble and squeak, liver and bacon - with a 21st-century twist. You'll feel like Celia Johnson in Brief Encounter (and hopefully not like Anna Karenina).
www.stpancras.com
London Broil
Who knew you could feed a restaurant full of people using food raised and grown within the boundaries of dirty old London? But that's what chef Oliver Rowe has done at his popular, inviting restaurant Konstam, where the windows are draped in swaths of bathtub chain. Start with pigeon breast (not from Trafalgar Square) and horseradish crème fraîche, and follow it with duck leg (not from the nearby canal) and gooseberry compote. Book early. 2 Acton St.; www.konstam.co.uk
Good, and Good For You Altruism and gluttony live in lovely partnership at Acorn House, a homey restaurant that locally sources both food and staff - it trains young people from the King's Cross area in cooking and restaurant management. Enjoy a tasting menu followed by cheese made nearby (but not too near - there's no need to be reckless) and locally brewed beer. 69 Swinton St.; www.acornhouserestaurant.com
Roughing it, sort of Most of the hotels in King's Cross are either budget chains or slightly frightening flophouses. But Rough Luxe, a "little bit of luxury in a rough part of London," is less fleabag, more posh teabag. The orange shag carpet and Gilbert & George poster in the parlour are clear signals to the style conscious. Each of the nine rooms is decorated in shabby-sumptuous fashion, with prices for a single starting at $294 - that's with a shared bathroom. Oh, what's wrong with a shared bathroom? Stop being so North American and make friends. 1 Birkenhead St.; www.roughluxe.co.uk
The gorier the better The Wellcome Collection is one of the city's hidden gems, a museum devoted to art, science and medicine and the place where those three meet. Downstairs is a gallery featuring changing exhibitions (currently a fascinating show on the nature of identity) while upstairs showcases the demented collecting sensibility of philanthropist Henry Wellcome (chastity belts and Napoleon's toothbrush - could it be better?). In the lobby you'll find a lovely café and an outstanding bookstore. 183 Euston Rd.; www.wellcomecollection.org
Words and music
I was initially set against Kings Place because of its ridiculous lack of an apostrophe, but it really is a most welcoming space to hear classical music and to see contemporary art. It's a brand new arts hub set on the canal, with concert space and gallery below and the offices of the Guardian and Observer newspapers. A soothing place to have a drink and watch the joggers puffing on the canal's towpath (maybe they're chasing the lost apostrophe). 90 York Way; www.kingsplace.co.uk
Where the art is King's Cross is not yet the art capital of London, though that may change when Central St. Martins moves in. For now, there are a few good places to see art, including an outpost of Larry Gagosian's empire, where on "private view" evenings you can watch art world stars in amazing shoes negotiating the cobblestone streets. The crypt at nearby St. Pancras church is a small but reliably interesting venue for smart contemporary art. Gagosian Gallery, 6-24 Britannia St., www.gagosian.com; Crypt Gallery, St. Pancras church, Euston Road, www.cryptgallery.org.uk
The best for last London is a famously green city, and while King's Cross is a bit of an industrial wasteland, it conceals a secret jewel in the shape of the Camley Street Natural Park. Hidden away behind the rail station, the park is a tiny, sublime oasis: There's pond dipping and nature trails for the kids and bird watching for the adults (do moorhens have red beaks, or is that coots?). Buy a picnic at St. Pancras, come here to watch the swans glide past on the canal and forget that the grimy city is only steps away. 12 Camley St.; http://bit.ly/EFUg3

First Dubai, now Shanghai: Housing bubble that burst in the desert threatens China's boom

Author: MacKinnon, Mark

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/first-dubai-now-shanghai-housing-bubble-that/docview/382595541/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "They're different places and different environments, but Dubai and China have one thing in common: Both are using bank money to hype the prices of real estate and drive them higher," Prof. [Yi Xianrong] said. "Dubai's problems are actually not as serious as those of Beijing and Shanghai. If the government doesn't see this clearly, we're going to have a very big problem."

Full text:   The young couple had just finished another disappointing round of house hunting when Sun Chun turned to his wife with more bad news. Their real-estate agent had called to say that an apartment they liked had been sold, but not before the price jumped dramatically at the last instant.
"Are they crazy? How come the price rose so suddenly?" Mr. Sun asked as his wife's eyes widened in disbelief. "Right now, it is still us who are selecting the house. But it won't be long before it is the house selecting us."
The trials of a young couple trying to find affordable housing may not sound like gripping television fare, but with real-estate prices spiralling out of control in China, Snail House was a hit when it went on the air in July. The gritty plot - revolving around two sisters trying to establish themselves in a fictional city that looks a lot like Shanghai - hit so close to the bone that Chinese authorities cancelled the show after only 10 episodes. It quickly found a new life online, where some 30 million people have viewed it.
The runaway popularity of the show highlights a dark undercurrent to what has otherwise been a successful year for the Chinese economy.
While the world marvels at China's ability to maintain an 8-per-cent growth rate amid a global recession, many ordinary Chinese don't see that translating into the better standards of living they envisioned. Economists, meanwhile, worry that speculation-driven investment is creating an expanding Dubai-style bubble in China's real-estate market.
The high cost of urban housing has become public issue No. 1 in the world's most populous country in recent months. A recent university graduate recently became an Internet celebrity after pictures were published online of the home she had made for herself in the washroom of the office building where she works. An online poll of more than 10,000 people on the sina.com Web portal found that 47 per cent of respondents would have an extramarital affair if it would help them get a big-city apartment.
Despite a building boom in recent years, real-estate prices in China's crowded cities are increasingly out of reach for most ordinary Chinese. Average housing prices recently hit $2,200 (U.S.) per square metre in Beijing, one-third of the average annual income in the capital, and developers have been reporting record profits even as newly built skyscrapers and vast shopping malls sit partially or completely vacant around the city.
According to one report by a government think tank, half of the property purchases in Beijing are made by people who live outside the city, and 20 per cent are for investment purposes only, with the buyer having no intention of actually using the property. In Shanghai, prices are even higher, having shot up 60 per cent since last year.
"In Beijing, about 90 per cent of homes are hardly affordable to ordinary people," said Yi Xianrong, a member of the Institute of Finance and Banking at the China Academy of Social Sciences. "If the government doesn't adjust its policies, these financial problems will definitely cause social problems. There will be an earthquake in society."
Prof. Yi says the government's otherwise successful $586-billion stimulus program has caused "not just one bubble, but many bubbles" in China's real-estate market.
Last fall, as diving export numbers led to factory closings and mass layoffs, Beijing ordered banks to intervene by massively increasing lending. Loans for real-estate developments jumped 121 per cent in the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 2008, while the amount of land under development rose 15.8 per cent. The total area being developed forms a construction site larger than New York city.
"They're different places and different environments, but Dubai and China have one thing in common: Both are using bank money to hype the prices of real estate and drive them higher," Prof. Yi said. "Dubai's problems are actually not as serious as those of Beijing and Shanghai. If the government doesn't see this clearly, we're going to have a very big problem."
Economists say the worst offenders are often government departments, which raise cash for themselves by selling land to corporations they control at sky-high prices.
One recent example in Shunyi, a posh suburb on the outskirts of Beijing, saw a residential plot sold for a record $4,300 per square metre. The buyer happened to be a development company owned by the local government, but that didn't stop Shunyi county from recording $740-million in revenue from the sale.
Although few ordinary Chinese are exposed to the real-estate market - most keep their savings in bank accounts - some look at China's economy and see parallels to Japan's just before the stock and property markets there collapsed 20 years ago.
The problem is dramatic enough that the usually tame Chinese media have weighed in with a rash of articles uncharacteristically critical of government policy. One pointed out that house prices in Beijing are now higher than in Dubai, despite the fact the latter's population is far wealthier on a percapita basis. Another said the government had "little excuse" for not taking action to control speculation in the real-estate market.
"The soaring price of property has become a serious national issue and the economic distortions it gives rise to are affecting the everyday life of the majority," read a recent editorial in the Global Times, a paper closely affiliated with the ruling Communist Party.
However, some say the government is unlikely to take measures - such as raising interest rates or tightening lending policies - to curb runaway prices because it sees unemployment as a far bigger danger than a real-estate bubble. The fear that factory closings would lead to unrest among millions of laid-off migrant labourers was cited as one reason that Beijing acted as aggressively as it did in introducing its massive economic stimulus last fall. Now, the same ultra-loose fiscal policy blamed for rising property prices has fuelled a construction boom that is keeping millions of workers employed.
"[The government is] stuck in a tough position. On one hand, they're worried about non-performing loans and bubbles in real estate and the stock market. On the other hand, they're worried about rising unemployment," said Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Beijing University. "The tools that they have to solve one problem are likely to make the other problem worse."

Little slum on the Prairie

Abstract: "I made five bucks!" one woman bragged to my partner Grant as she held out a handful of change. "How many couches did you have to rifle through to get that?" he asked, eyeing a ski hill of castoff sofas. "All of them!" she beamed as she climbed into her Escalade.

Full text:   How much did your house make this year? That's the tired Christmas-party banter circulating in Saskatchewan.
Here in the country, we do our cost comparisons at The Dump. "How much did you say they paid for that new Snout House?" we gasp, while we watch another resourceful local climb Couch Mountain.
"I made five bucks!" one woman bragged to my partner Grant as she held out a handful of change. "How many couches did you have to rifle through to get that?" he asked, eyeing a ski hill of castoff sofas. "All of them!" she beamed as she climbed into her Escalade.
Prairie people are full of contradictions. Although sodbusters currently enjoy good times, we still scrounge for change like it's Next Year Country. I've been known to harvest the odd Pilsner bottle while I walk my border collie Laddie along Railway Avenue.
When we visited gritty downtown Regina this month, Grant had to restrain me from bending over to pick up a flattened Red Bull can on the way to see to see Bright Star at the Regina Public Library cinema.
It's late 2009 and the Regina boom is still in full bloom. In 2007, for seven long months, we naively rented a former drug house. Note to self: Don't use Google Earth to locate a rental property. You can't see the crack pipes from that vantage point.
The other lesson I learned from my Regina slumlord experience was: You don't want to be a renter in a boomtown. For most of 2009, a 1-per-cent vacancy rate on Regina apartments meant many long-time renters were squeezed out and left homeless.
As a smug homeowner, I can make light of my former housing situation. But many Saskatchewan low-income people who have been punted from the rental market are not laughing.
Forget about Saskatchewan home ownership. That dream died when housing prices soared in the past three years. Now a local renter's only solace may be a bus ticket to down-market Winnipeg.
But it's not just Regina on the uptick here in the Land of Bloated Real Estate. Prince Albert, Moose Jaw, Saskatoon, Yorkton and the Battlefords have all seen a remarkable rise in prices due to economic gains and speculation prompted by our previously undervalued real-estate market.
Even my humble little town of Wakaw is enjoying an unprecedented housing bubble. My elderly neighbours can now rent their basement suite for $500 a month. When we first rolled into town in 2004, a whole house rented for $200.
Ever since 1993, when the federal government offloaded the funding of social housing to the provinces, the free market has set the Dickensian agenda.
Affordable housing in Saskatchewan has now exceeded the reach of low-income renters. Condo conversions and exalted loft projects dominate the original three-storey, Boomtown-facade skyline. What remains for many Saskatchewan renters are overpriced ghettos. You want running water and heat? One Regina tenant recently forked over $1,000 for a substandard rental without proper amenities.
No one should have to choose between paying the slumlord and buying groceries, yet many do. Affordable housing, public health and food security are all interconnected.
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty contemplates tinkering with the CMHC so the current housing bubble doesn't implode.
Yet I hear no similar excited talk about affordable housing, co-operatives or homelessness. Just more middle-class moaning about the "sustainability" of bloated mortgages and furrowed brows about whether Mr. Flaherty will excise the 5-per-cent-down program.
If Prime Minister Stephen Harper wants my support, he must expropriate the housing portfolio from his hapless provincial premiers. If he curtails his $19-billion annual defence budget - bloated by our Afghanistan folly - the feds can finally afford to address the messy business of social housing.
Let's start with North Regina.

Abstract: Islanders owner Charles Wang plans to use a $1-billion real-estate development around the team's arena to finance renovations to the Nassau Coliseum, but the idea has stalled over squabbles with the Town of Hempstead. Wang has threatened to move or sell his team if the town and Nassau County do not approve his huge project, which calls for 1.5 million square feet of retail and office space plus 2,300 residential units to be built on 77 acres around the Coliseum.

Gary Bettman and the NHL will celebrate the new year with their most feel-good event, the annual outdoor game, but once the warm-and-fuzzies fade from Fenway Park, the commissioner will have lots of fires to put out.
Thanks to the recession and "the usual suspects," as a banker of our acquaintance put it, Bettman can expect 2010 to be another year in which he makes like the fellow who keeps a dozen or so plates spinning on sticks. The only difference from 2009 is that the Phoenix Coyotes may not be the plate on centre stage.
Oh, the Coyotes will still be a Class A migraine, since they are losing a good $5-million (all currency U.S.) a month that will be billed to the NHL until it completes the sale of the team to the group of businessmen known as Ice Edge Holdings LLC. But once Bettman convinced the governors at their annual meetings last week that those losses will come out of future NHL revenue and spare them from writing cheques, he kept that plate spinning.
But a couple of dark clouds - the New York Islanders and the Nashville Predators - are moving front and centre.
Islanders owner Charles Wang plans to use a $1-billion real-estate development around the team's arena to finance renovations to the Nassau Coliseum, but the idea has stalled over squabbles with the Town of Hempstead. Wang has threatened to move or sell his team if the town and Nassau County do not approve his huge project, which calls for 1.5 million square feet of retail and office space plus 2,300 residential units to be built on 77 acres around the Coliseum. He sees this as the only way to stem his team's losses of more than $20-million a year.
Most of the news concerns Wang's fight with the local politicians, some of whom want the project scaled back and/or offered to other developers. Wang said last week at the governors' meetings that the future of the Islanders is up to the local politicians, but an investment banker who knows the Long Island market well says that is not the owner's biggest problem.
"Who wants to finance this project even if it gets political approval?" said the banker, who requested anonymity. "The last thing Long Island needs is more office space."
It should also be noted there is a huge shopping mall a few miles from the Coliseum.
There is talk of keeping the Islanders in the area through moves to a new arena in Brooklyn or even in Queens, although nothing is certain.
The Predators, meanwhile, once again have Nashville politicians and bureaucrats worried about the financial viability of their owners. When it came out this month that David Freeman, the managing partner of the ownership group, had a $3.35-million tax lien put on his house by the Internal Revenue Service, questions arose about the financial guarantees the owners had to maintain with the city and CIT Group, which has its own bankruptcy woes but holds about $85-million in loans to the Predators.
The Nashville Sports Authority, the municipal group that oversees the arena and the agreement with the Predators, asked the owners to clarify their financial situation. Nobody felt too good when the owners refused, since an escape clause in the arena lease kicks in if the Predators have an average crowd of less than 14,000 a game (they were at 13,060 this week) and post a combined loss of $20-million on the team and the arena.
Word out of Nashville is that the other owners in Freeman's group will soon take a more active role because of his financial troubles. NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said recently the league is not worried, which could be because Calgary oil tycoon Brett Wilson and perhaps one or two associates are waiting to put money into the team through the 27-per-cent interest held by a bankruptcy court as a result of last year's scandal, the William (Boots) Del Biaggio flameout.
If Bettman gets tired of this, he can turn to the Dallas Stars and owner Tom Hicks. The group of 40 bankers dealing with Hicks are hoping his Texas Rangers baseball team will be sold in the next 30 days to a group headed by Nolan Ryan so they can then untangle the Stars' mess.
Then there are the Atlanta Thrashers, the Tampa Bay Lightning ...

Full text:   New portfolio of vacation homes shows the world's best - including one Georgian Bay beauty
jmays@globeandmail.com
For thousands of Torontonians, the oncoming winter is but a long prelude to the all-important Victoria Day weekend, when cottages open and the Friday night treks up the 400 begin.
Most cottagers already know where they're going to spend their summer holidays. But for those who are still dreaming of acquiring a getaway or who are thinking of involving an architect when they build their dream cottage, I've found an interesting book worth leafing through during the holiday season. It's called Arcadia: Cross-Country Style, Architecture and Design) .
This 260-page annotated portfolio offers a panoply of new and recent hideouts, bunkies, farm houses, country villas, chalets and secluded luxury resorts, and the furniture to go in them, by 136 architectural and design firms in Europe, Asia, Australia and North and South America. The breathtaking places where these creative people have worked similarly span the planet, from the magnificent drowned landscape of Ontario's Georgian Bay, through the Rocky Mountains and the Alps, to the deserts of Spain and the forests of Japan, Scandinavia and New Zealand. Whatever the merits of this or that project portrayed in it, this collection is a remarkable overview of the ways contemporary architects are responding to the long-standing human desire to find a safe, comfortable perch from which to enjoy the beauties of raw nature.
As you may expect to find in such an omnium-gatherum, these responses vary widely in their appeal and applicability. I really don't like the flamboyantly experimental house by Japanese architect Kotaro Ide, for example: It looks like a big chicken wrap dropped in the woods. Nor do I have much time for the Swedish forest hotel that resembles a corner of a mirrored-glass skyscraper stuck halfway up a tall tree.
The more successful buildings here are by architects who take seriously the contexts (both natural and cultural) of their projects and who avoid making any greater impact than necessary on the shoreline or mountainside or forest glade where their buildings stand. The Scandinavians, by and large, are good at respecting both human nature and nature in general. So are the Canadians and many of the Americans.
I was struck, for example, by a curious extension to an existing cottage deep in a Swedish nature preserve, for which the architects used cedar shingles to create a low, billowing roof that blends in perfectly with the forest floor. The same respect for surroundings is evident in a Norwegian coastal cabin, "shaped," a note tells us, "like a mountain fox curled up to avoid the wind." Local building traditions are echoed in this structure and with good reason: The same harsh gales that battered the old villages along the coastline also sweep over this handsome contemporary house, which is ready for them.
But nothing in this book embodies more wisdom about its environment and its occupants than the featured Georgian Bay house known as Molly's Cabin. (Reporter Carolyn Ireland visited the cabin and wrote about it in these pages earlier this year.)
Designed by Adam Thom and Katja Aga Sachse Thom, principals in Toronto's Agathom Co., this fine 1,000-square-foot building occupies a stony island thrusting out from the shoreline toward open water.
Instead of springing the cottage wide toward Georgian Bay, where the savage storms come from, the Thoms have turned a largely featureless wall in that direction. The cottage's other three sides allow views of the more docile nature round about, though the emphasis throughout is on protection from the elements, not the provision of natural spectacle. A sharp plunge in the roof edge - it looks like a tent flap pulled down - allows a peek, but not a panorama, beyond. Even the widest prospect here, off across the channel toward rough bush above sheer stone drop-offs (with a glimpse of Georgian Bay), is still framed mindfully.
The result is a humble Muskoka cottage that's had a complete makeover by a sensitive modernist beautician. The rustic simplicity, the solid build, the straightforward manner that everyone found so attractive about her in the first place have not been styled right out of her. But she's contemporary now, with everything updated - the cut of her profile, her posture in the landscape - to suit the best sensibilities of the present age.
The Thoms's excellent reinvention of the old cottage-country house is something many designers could learn from. Arcadia: Cross-Country Style, Architecture and Design is full of still more hints and suggestions for building wisely and beautifully in the wilds. It's a book to put on a bedside table and occasionally dream on until summer and Victoria Day arrive at last.

About a decade ago, a local builder and architect, Terry Wilkins, bought a city-owned lot - virtually tucked beneath an elevated section of Richmond Street at King Street on a reverse ravine - to create a completely non-traditional duplex, agent Lawrence Day says.
"One of the things that make it so unique is that it's a side-by-side duplex," he says. "[Plus] it's very uncommon to see a duplex that has a contemporary feel."
The two-bedroom units - one has three storeys, the other two storeys - both offer main and second-floor bathrooms and finished basements, plus stainless steel kitchen appliances and laundry machines.
Principal rooms feature walkouts, custom windows of varying sizes and shapes, and double-height ceilings. "I liked the fact ... there are 18-foot ceilings in more than one place," the agent says. "There was just tremendous light everywhere."
For instance, the three-storey unit has an open kitchen and dining area with a single porthole window and a group of square windows above sliding doors to the gated courtyard.
The space is visible from the second floor where there is a fireside living room - situated above the garage - and a bedroom with a semi-ensuite bathroom.
The master loft is on the top level with a third bathroom and a deck.
The two-storey unit is accessed by a gated walkway along to the property's west side.
It contains a combined kitchen and living room designed with a section that opens to one of two bedrooms upstairs, as well as windows along a sharply angled corner of the room and sliding doors to another private courtyard.
"[The builder] did a wonderful landscaping job as well to create ... several green spaces ... that absolutely belie the location smack dab in the middle of a city of five million people," Mr. Day says.

Abstract: A series of sluggishly paced scenes deal with predictable jokes about [Meryl]'s vegetarianism, and the pair's leftish politics, and unfamiliarity with box stores, milking cows, chopping wood and escaping from grizzly bears. There are a few underdeveloped local rubes - a dim-bulb nurse, a doctor who treats everyone as a child, and an old grouch (Wilfred Brimley), who takes an instant dislike to [Paul].

Full text:   Did You Hear About the Morgans?
Written and directed by Marc Lawrence
Starring Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker
Classification: PG
*
If you've seen the lively trailer for Did You Hear About the Morgans? , you will already know it's a couple comedy starring Hugh Grant, cast as - surprise - a bumbling, charming and sarcastic Englishman, and Sarah Jessica Parker as - surprise again - a winsome and fashionable New Yorker.
They co-star as a soon-to-be-divorced couple who are relocated to a small town in Wyoming as part of a federal witness-protection program. While being guarded by a crusty old sheriff and his Annie Oakley-like wife (Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen), these city slickers get close again. They also learn to shoot and ride horses, Western skills that will undoubtedly come in handy when the bad guy or guys come after them.
If you are expecting a pleasant evening of escapism, you will be cruelly fooled. The editor responsible for the trailer is clearly a genius. Every remotely humorous moment from Did You Hear About the Morgans? has been carefully included, and in most cases improved, in the trailer.
Stretched out to its full 106 minutes, this is a fish-out-of-water comedy gasping for comic oxygen. Grant plays a lawyer named Paul, and Parker his estranged wife, Meryl, a real-estate agent (allowing for some Sex and the City -style condo-porn tours). Each has a cute personal assistant, respectively, Jackie (Elisabeth Moss of television's Mad Men ) and Adam (Jesse Liebman), who spend a lot of their time texting on their BlackBerries.
One night, Paul and Meryl witness the murder of one of her clients, who turns out to be an arms dealer. The assassin, Vincent (Michael Kelly), who is working for some undefined foreign interests, recognizes Meryl from a magazine cover and makes an attempt on her life. The FBI puts them on a plane and they find themselves in the hamlet of Ray, Wyo., where they are taken in by the sheriff and his wife.
A series of sluggishly paced scenes deal with predictable jokes about Meryl's vegetarianism, and the pair's leftish politics, and unfamiliarity with box stores, milking cows, chopping wood and escaping from grizzly bears. There are a few underdeveloped local rubes - a dim-bulb nurse, a doctor who treats everyone as a child, and an old grouch (Wilfred Brimley), who takes an instant dislike to Paul.
Writer-director Marc Lawrence has delivered competent comedies starring Grant before - Two Weeks Notice and Music and Lyrics - so it's a puzzle why this feature feels more predictable but less polished.
Particularly painful is the poor integration of a subplot about the couple's marital difficulties (infertility, infidelity), crudely sandwiched between the stereotypes and slapstick.
The nights in Wyoming, says Paul, are so quiet "you can hear your cells divide." That's not a bad description of the feeling during most scenes between Grant and Parker - those long painful moments after the actors deliver their lines, where the laughs are meant to be.

Elevated parking

Full text:   Architect David Fujiwara's sculptural carport is high design on a small scale
The lowly carport is a poor cousin to the deluxe and much more practical garage. They're how home builders keep costs down, right? And they're certainly not something that serious architects spend much time thinking about.
Or are they?
While cost-cutting may have been one factor in the carport's birth some time during the early years of the 20th century - the first is often credited to ex-Frank Lloyd Wright employee and architect Walter Burley Griffin in 1909 - by the 1930s, the "father" of the California ranch-style home, Cliff May, was using them to great effect, and so, too, was Mr. Wright on his smaller-scale Usonian homes.
Architect David Fujiwara was no doubt thinking of these things when he got a call from homeowner Hugh Dillon, one of the stars of the hit CTV series Flashpoint . He and his wife, Midori, had just pulled down a two-car garage at the rear of their Danforth Village home that was threatening to become "a raccoon home" and were thinking of replacing it with a carport.
"It left them with no yard," remembers the architect of the dilapidated structure. "They were happy with their little house but there was no opportunity to come outside and enjoy a little bit of greenery." A carport, the couple told him, could do double duty as an automotive shelter and as a garden-party roof. He agreed, remembering the carports called "kinchos" he'd seen in Argentina, which creatively feature brick walls with built-in barbecues for entertaining: "In fact, the kincho is an outdoor room; the car will go there, but they'll move the car out in the evening [or] on the weekends."
The many carports in his childhood neighbourhood near Scarborough's Birchmount Road and Lawrence Avenue provided inspiration also: "I think about how useful they were; if it was raining out, you'd get under the carport and you could hang out, play games, whatever, because they were open."
After studying the Dillon property inside and out, Mr. Fujiwara realized the new carport would dominate the view from the kitchen window "where you spend 90 per cent of your time." For that matter, it would also dominate during the 10 per cent of the time the couple would be sitting on the deck right outside that window. Therefore, a boring flat roof just wouldn't do, so the 57-year-old started to think of angles: What if the corner that faced the kitchen was tilted dramatically upward to reveal its structure? What if one of the back corners bent down and the other up? Not only would this make for an interesting shape to gaze upon, but it would allow water to drain back onto the property, where a rain barrel could be located.
The final sketch of this 24-by-15-foot "twisted trapezoid" took about an hour to complete and a week to model on the computer. After an engineer was consulted about wind and snow loads, and made his recommendations about post and beam sizes and how deep to dig the holes, it took about three weeks to build (once the city workers' strike was over this past summer) by contactor Mike Heron and crew using material available from the local lumberyard: "We don't want to get precious with this thing," says Mr. Fujiwara, laughing, pointing out that only the metal "saddles" that connect the galvanized posts to the LVL (laminate veneer lumber) beams were custom-fabricated.
During construction, two key alterations were made to the design as it appeared on paper: Because all agreed that asymmetry was a good thing, one side of the roof support beams were left hanging out a little further over the main beam rather than being trimmed to match the other side; the shed, as drawn, stretched all the way up to meet the roof but it was shortened at the last minute so more daylight could peek through, and yet another angle could be added to the composition. "Sometimes, these things," muses Mr. Fujiwara, "you work it all out, you spend a lot of time drawing it and then it's still not good enough, you can still make improvements on site."
The only other improvement, really, would be to place this exuberant and sculptural carport in the front yard; sitting secretly in the backyard as it does, this "monument" - as Midori calls it - can only be enjoyed by a few. "My husband sits out here every morning just having his coffee and then he comes in the house and says, 'I love our house!'" she confirms with a big smile.
Lowly carport? No way. This is high design on a small scale, proving that good architecture can rekindle the romance between home and homeowner.

To cater to buyers concerned with the financial and physical burdens of owning a cottage in a weak economy, a community of fractional-ownership cottages will be built on one of the largest clear lakes in Muskoka.
Situated within the village of Dwight - about 2.5 hours north of Toronto near Algonquin Park's West Gate - the upscale project, called Black Pebble, will feature eight fully furnished pine-log homes facing 330 feet of private shoreline on the Lake of Bays.
"We offer an authentic Muskoka cottage experience in a prime waterfront location - which is scarce to begin with - without forcing buyers to make what would be a much larger financial commitment if they were to purchase a cottage of this stature outright," states Gary Hanel, who is developing Black Pebble on land where he and his family - Margaret Hanel and Karen and John Szykoluk - have owned Nor'Loch Lodge Resort for 21 years.
"Because all of the maintenance is taken care of, owners can have a carefree vacation."
For $98,900, buyers will get a 1/12 share of a cottage, which entitles them to four weeks, including one fixed summer week and one week in each season.
"A lot of people don't have that many weeks available because they have such busy lifestyles," says Ms. Szykoluk, who adds that the family also manages another fractional property nearby.
"When they do have a week or two to come up to their cottage, they don't want to put it all into work, painting or maintenance. They just want to come and relax."
An eight-week interval - priced from $197,800 - will come with two consecutive summer weeks and two in each remaining season. A 12-week interval will consist of five summer weeks and seven seasonal weeks for $315,000.
For each four-week interval owned, an annual fee of $2,586 will pay for the upkeep of the cottage and property, as well as insurance, utilities, housekeeping and a capital reserve fund.
"We've had lots of people that have been coming to resorts for years and years and years," says the project's marketing manager, Brenda Paterson.
"If they looked at ... what they spent on their holidays versus having an equity share of a fractional [ownership property], they come out way ahead with a fractional."
In terms of amenities, residents will have exclusive use of a heated salt-water pool, a private sandy beach and boat slips, along with kayaks, canoes and swim-up docks.
"It's a really beautiful, large lake, great for boating and sailing," Ms. Szykoluk says, adding that the cottages have southwest exposures.
Additional attractions are easily accessible in town or at Algonquin Park and Huntsville, which are less than 20 minutes away. "You're secluded on the project, but you can walk to the local stores and bakeries," says Ms. Paterson.
To travel further, owners will be able to swap weeks at resorts worldwide through RCI's vacation exchange program.
At Black Pebble, owners will retreat to three-bedroom cottages - constructed by 1867 Confederation Log Homes - designed with open principal rooms featuring gas fireplaces, vaulted beam ceilings above hardwood floors and large windows facing the water.
For outdoor entertaining, each cottage will have a deck, a patio with an outdoor fireplace, and a four-season Muskoka room with an indoor grill. "It's a more functional room than just a screened-in porch," says Ms. Szykoluk.
Last of all, interiors will be equipped with stainless-steel, energy-efficient appliances, furniture and media devices such as televisions and CD players. Wireless Internet service and individual storage lockers will also be available.
Purchasers are scheduled to move in starting next spring.

This semi-detached house is ideally situated in Leaside, which is among the city's most popular residential neighbourhoods.
The property is within steps of schools, parks and sports facilities, as well as local shops and buses along Eglinton Avenue and big box outlets off of Laird Avenue.
The two-storey house - built circa 1940 - is also in good shape, especially after renovations were done in areas such as the kitchen and basement within the past decade.
The central kitchen was outfitted with appliances, undermounted sinks and slate floors.
The living room features an electric fireplace, the dining room is surrounded by wainscoting and the family room addition has a walkout to the deck overlooking the fenced backyard.

Full text: Residents of this banking centre of the U.S. South were living the high life. Then came the market meltdown and the resultant evaporation of high-paying jobs and confidence
Recessions often strike like a hammer - you lose your job, your home or a big customer.
The onset of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression was more subtle for Pee Dee Sharp, a waiter and bartender at the Capital Grille in downtown Charlotte, N.C.
His customers - the free-spending bankers, traders and deal makers who inhabit the gleaming financial towers of Tryon Street - actually began to pay attention to the cheques laid before them at the chic eatery, where a steak will set you back at least $40 (U.S.).
"Before, no one really cared who paid, or how much it cost," Mr. Sharp said. "That's all changed."
On the surface, there's little to suggest Charlotte, the great banking centre of the American South, is hurting.
And yet, the financial crisis has probably hit harder here than just about anywhere outside of Lower Manhattan, jeopardizing the city's status as the No. 2 banking centre in the United States.
In the past year, Charlotte has lost the headquarters of homegrown Wachovia Corp., once the fourth-largest bank in the country. That brought the additional pain of losing some 2,000 high-paying jobs that were cut following its shotgun marriage with San Francisco-based Wells Fargo.
No. 2 Bank of America is still here, but it's in the ranks of the country's many "zombie" banks - still hoarding cash and reluctant to take on much risk as it operates under the watchful eye of regulators.
There's speculation that whoever succeeds Bank of America's chief executive officer Ken Lewis when he leaves at the end of the month will order a breakup of the financial behemoth, delivering another indignity to Charlotte.
(Yesterday, Halifax native Bob Kelly, previously vice-chairman of Toronto-Dominion Bank and now CEO of Bank of New York Mellon, quashed speculation he was in talks to succeed Mr. Lewis. In a memo to staff, Mr. Kelly said, "I firmly concluded that my place is here at BNY Mellon.")
Before the crisis struck, the two fast-growing banks employed nearly 34,000 in Charlotte. The next largest bank headquartered here has just six branches and fewer than 50 employees.
As the banks' problems rippled through the broader economy, the jobless rate in Charlotte has more than doubled. Unemployment now stands at 12 per cent, nearly two percentage-points higher than the national average. Everyone, it seems, knows a family member, a neighbour, a friend or a colleague who's lost a job at one of the banks.
But the depth of banking crisis isn't just measures in lost jobs, as Mr. Sharp is finding out. It's calculated in the diminished prestige, along with a whopping loss of wealth caused by the collapse of Wachovia and B of A shares. Gone too are the dividends, bonuses and the rich stock options that many employees enjoyed.
"Income that was here yesterday is gone tomorrow," explained Bob Morgan, president of the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce. "There has been a reset that's affecting the public sector, the non-profit sector, and it has affected companies that do business with the banks."
Housing starts and retail sales are still weak, and remain well below what they were a decade ago.
It's an "open question" whether Charlotte can survive as a banking hub as the fallout from the crisis continues to reverberate, said John Connaughton, an economics professor at the University of North Carolina (Charlotte). Civic leaders have launched a spirited campaign to convince banks elsewhere in the country to relocate here. But Prof. Connaughton isn't convinced it will work long term.
"There's no particular advantage to coming to Charlotte," said Prof. Connaughton, who does a quarterly regional economic forecast. "You can run a bank out of a backroom anywhere."
At risk for Charlotte, and many other U.S. cities that have lost banks during the crisis, is all that comes with being home to a major bank - the high-paying jobs, the buzz of real estate activity, the lawyers, the accountants, the nice restaurants, the swollen tax base and the corporate-sponsored museums and sports venues.
And for the past decade, Charlotte enjoyed all of that, transforming itself from a regional economic centre into a booming metropolis in the heart of the thinly populated, gently rolling hills of North Carolina's piedmont region.
"I rode the wave," said Jodi Bales MacCargar, 39, a native of Charlotte who lost her job this week after three years as an independent contractor in Wachovia's mortgage division.
"There was growth and excitement and energy in the air. It was fun to be here. Everyone was building new homes or renovating."
Fifty and 60-storey office towers and luxury condos, with neo-gothic touches reminiscent of New York or Chicago's venerable skyscrapers, sprung up in and around Tryon St., creating an impressive skyline for a metropolitan area of just 1.6 million people.
South of the city, farm fields were parcelled into gated golf course communities of 5,000-square-foot custom-built mansions and high-end shopping malls to serve the incoming bank executives and the legions of others who catered to their needs. They came to live in communities such as Ballantyne Country Club, Providence Downs, on streets named Black Gold Crescent.
"There was a little bit of arrogance," agreed Suzanne Moorfield, a real estate agent with Allen Tate Realtors who for nine years has helped dozens of bankers buy in, and buy up. "It seemed like we would do nothing but boom and boom."
And then last fall, it all came to abrupt halt, like a golf ball landing in a sand trap.
Now, Ms. Moorfield is helping some of those same bankers downsize. She's also helping banks rid themselves of repossessed mansions.
Where buyers once lined up to buy $1-million (U.S.) and $2-million homes, many are now in over their heads, living in homes that are now worth less than what they owe. This year, nearly a quarter of the 35 homes Ms. Moorfield sold were bank-owned.
She points to lavish custom-built homes located on a rise on the edge of the lush and manicured Ballantyne golf course. Built for more than $1-million, Ms. Moorefield has listed the home at a fire-sale price of $709,000.
"We have a long way to go to figure out what the real values are," acknowledged Pat Riley, president of Charlotte-based Allen Tate, the largest real estate broker in the area. "We're still in that figuring-out place."
Downtown, or "Uptown" as the locals call it, the condo and office markets are hurting. Several of the more recent projects have stalled or now sit largely empty. Developers recently pulled the plug on the 400-unit, 50-storey Epicentre condo, capping it after completing the lower-floor retail section. Steel bars still jut out of the roof.
The unofficial office vacancy rate has shot up to nearly 16 per cent from less than 1 per cent as the recession coincided with a wave of new construction.
Wachovia was due to move into its would-be 50-storey trophy tower, complete with a state-of-the-art three-storey trading desk, in the next few months.
Instead, Duke Energy Corp., also headquartered in Charlotte, is putting its name on the building and will occupy some of Wachovia's space.
The name change is actually a cause for optimism, according to Mr. Morgan at the Chamber of Commerce. With the prospect of a nuclear energy revival in the American South, Duke is growing and hiring, as are many energy-related manufacturers in the region.
The city, Mr. Morgan explained, "allowed the perception to be created" that its economy was just about banking when it's actually far more diversified.
"This is a painful reminder that economic diversity is just as important to a community as it is to an individual's retirement portfolio," he added.
Ms. Bales MacCargar, the former Wachovia worker, is also thinking about diversification. For the first time, the mother of one said she's looking for a job outside the mortgage and banking industry, where her husband still works.
"I'm tired of the ups and downs," she said.

'Mr. Calgary' forges template for oil patch success

Author: Pitts, Gordon

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/mr-calgary-forges-template-oil-patch-success/docview/382600892/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: So I borrowed someone's typewriter, and pecked out two written applications. I picked Shell Oil because they had a garage in the small town near where I grew up, and Superior Oil because it sounded kind of romantic. I'll be darned if I didn't get a wire from Superior's chief geologist [in Calgary]. Then the president flew to Michigan to interview me, and he offered me a job.

Full text: gpitts@globeandmail.com
Harley Hotchkiss is, quite simply, Mr. Calgary - a local hero who built oil companies, saved the Calgary Flames (and possibly the NHL), and is spearheading the financing of a brain research institute at University of Calgary. Mr. Hotchkiss is a self-effacing type who prefers to lead by example than by noisy chest-thumping. At 82, he explains how the son of a Tillsonburg, Ont., tobacco-dairy farmer ended up as a legendary Alberta business leader.
What do you say to young people who want careers like yours?
Hard work is one answer. I've never found shortcuts, and usually when you take them, they backfire on you. Probably at times I've overloaded the boat a bit, but hard work is essential - and do your homework, which goes hand in hand with that. Another important thing is to be fair. You can do a lot of good things in this world without cutting corners.
Try to find things you like doing. I've always liked to go to work. My wife tells me I liked it sometimes too much but, seriously, I enjoy what I do. There are days when I don't enjoy it, but just the idea of doing interesting and productive work is an important part of life.
You and fellow oilman Clay Riddell have been honoured by the Order of Canada. Don't you both represent the end of an era in the oil patch - an entrepreneurial era, rather than today's financial and corporate age?
I know what you are saying and I think you are right. Clay and I are both geologists and we put a lot of emphasis on exploration and risks involved with that - the challenge of drilling wells and the heartache of dry holes, and there were a lot of them. There is the feeling when you drill a good one and you think, "Man, I did that." It may have been something no one else could have done that way.
So what has changed?
There are more people without a geology or exploration background. That's okay, it may be a natural evolution. But I remember in those early days when I was a working geologist, and later when I left Bank of Commerce's oil department in 1959 to start and run a new company. It was exciting, it was hard, and I was doing everything - sitting on the wells putting the plays together and writing letters of agreement. It was an amazing, unique entrepreneurial environment.
Now you are getting more people with legal and accounting backgrounds, and there have always been quite a few engineers. As a geologist, I am biased, but I still think that background, that education, in basic exploration are pretty important.
But isn't the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin past its peak?
I came here not long after the Leduc strike and I thought the oil business was just about finding fields like Wizard Lake, Pembina [major discoveries] and all the way down the list. But now there is something else - gas reserves in these shale beds. It may be a little too early to fully judge that. And people are also going into old fields, and using technology like horizontal, multi-frac drilling, to get reserves that otherwise we weren't going to get.
Sometimes I wish I were 25 again, but that is kind of foolish. The oil and gas is here, and it is meaningful. How meaningful? We will have to get a little more history to see. But with technology, and some of that entrepreneurial spirit, things are happening that you wouldn't have dreamed of 10 years ago.
What was your first job?
I was a geologist for Canadian Superior Oil of California. They actually hired me when I was in university, as I was headed for a career in the mining business. It was 1951 and I had accepted a fellowship at Michigan State University to do my masters. I was kind of scrimping along financially.
So I borrowed someone's typewriter, and pecked out two written applications. I picked Shell Oil because they had a garage in the small town near where I grew up, and Superior Oil because it sounded kind of romantic. I'll be darned if I didn't get a wire from Superior's chief geologist [in Calgary]. Then the president flew to Michigan to interview me, and he offered me a job.
After thinking about it overnight, I said 'I'm coming to work for you.' I changed directions 180 degrees. It was so fortunate, because I came to the West at the optimal time, although I didn't know it then.
So it is good to take a risk?
Oh, I believe in that, but do your homework. After you've taken the risk, don't look back and think, "I should have thought of that." There will always be something that slips by, but make sure you've been thorough.
And have the courage to act. A lot of people will do the work but they won't be able to pull the trigger. You've got to be learn to do that, knowing that you're not going to be right all the time.
When you came to Calgary in 1951, did you think you could make a difference?
I was occupied with my job and raising my family right away. But even in those early years, I coached kids' hockey, helped flood rinks, tied skates and wiped noses. I didn't have any money but I did have some time. Just giving money isn't always the answer or even the best answer. Your own time and experience can be pretty important.
It also gives you balance in your life. Jobs are important too, but don't wait until you have everything else looked after before you volunteer. You really miss something when you do that. Do it when it takes a little extra effort and maybe you have to stretch to find that time.
On the philanthropic side, will younger people carry on your work in Calgary?
I think about that a lot and it's a challenge. We've all suffered from this economic downturn but a lot of people in Calgary have done very, very well. You hear criticisms that they haven't picked up the torch.
I'm careful about that, because philanthropy and community service are private things. I'm reluctant to be critical because I don't know everything that is going on. But what I can do is set a leadership example and work with our own family - we have five children. Becky and I have set up the Hotchkiss Family Foundation and we are using it to support other community causes. I'm in the process of seeing that the governance of the organization is passed to my children.
You must feel good about the Flames?
It's been a real source of enjoyment, but also a source of stress and strain - to the point there was some doubt whether we could survive. I'm talking about 1994 to 2004, until we had that one-year lockout and an agreement. That wasn't much fun. We had some partners who said we were nuts and would never make it here. We bought them out and that's behind us now.
Two or three things kept me believing: There was a basic love of hockey since I was a little boy cheering for the Toronto Maple Leafs out on the farm. It was the integrity of the Seaman brothers [B.J. and the late Doc Seaman, also Flames owners], and a belief that if we could get our act together, Calgary would support us. I don't think I ever lost the belief we could make it work.Where are you on the climate-change debate?
There has been so much pressure built up through the media, the public, and in Al Gore's work, that it has become almost a landslide that all these things are there and they are true. But there is another side, from some knowledgeable respected scientists.
So you don't think the debate is over with Copenhagen?
You're so afraid to stick your head up here because you get so quickly identified as a denier. As a geologist, I know about the cold and warm periods in relatively short-term history. But in the longer term, I think it's pretty clear we're in an interglacial period. The reality is that 10,000-plus or minus years ago, we were covered with ice. That's happened a number of times in history.
I just wish someone had taken the responsibility of creating a forum where the scientists on both sides could put it all out on the table, and have an open and rational discussion. I don't know what the outcome would be, but I would have the comfort of knowing that both sides were heard.

Abstract: "For us, Leslieville is home sweet home," says Ms. Purcell. "The kids are embedded in their schools and their community programs. They now have all the amenities that I thought we had to move to find. Leslieville has become its own drawing point, as far as I'm concerned. I feel that I may never have to move."

Ric Randmaa and JoAnne Purcell had a growing family and designer dreams, so they bought a big High Park house. But even before the ink was dry, they had second thoughts
dkelly@globeandmail.com
Sometimes what you're looking for is right in front of you.
Or in the case of JoAnn Purcell and Ric Randmaa, right beneath their feet.
That's what the Toronto couple discovered after they went looking for a dream house to accommodate their growing family of three young girls - two of them twins.
They thought they wanted big.
But in the end, they opted for small, bucking nearly every real-estate trend in the book.
Their story is about home being where the heart is. And it starts in a cramped Victorian semi in Leslieville, an up-and-coming Toronto neighbourhood straddling Queen Street and running east of the Don River and west of Woodbine Avenue, where Ms. Purcell and Mr. Randmaa have lived since 1997.
When they first moved to the area, childless, and very much in love, Leslieville was on the cusp of change. Moving from dingy to the very definition of urban chic, the couple found it instantly attractive.
Espresso bars were fast replacing soup kitchens while clothing and home-decor boutiques were swapping places with five-and-dimes.
Now, Leslieville was home to an expanding community of artists and creative types and the couple fit right in, she being a print-maker on faculty at Seneca College and he a videographer working as an executive producer at Acme Pictures, located around the corner from their new home.
Leslieville, to them, had been the perfect place to start a marriage. But to raise kids?
A shortage of parks, daycares and doubt about the quality of the local schools had Ms. Purcell, once she became a mother a decade ago, thinking twice.
"I started to want a 'family home,'" she says, adding that an explosion of high chairs, playpens, cribs and squeeze toys had convinced her that their 1,500-square-foot semi-detached house lacked the flexibility to develop along with her family.
Moving house just made sense to her.
"I grew up in a family of five and every time a baby came along, we used to change houses. That's what you do. You look for something bigger," says Ms. Purcell.
While her husband agreed that their house had grown too small for the five of them, he was reluctant to make a change: "I never moved when I was growing up," he says. "You always made do with the house you were given."
Armed with that philosophy (not to mention a good tool kit and extended family members who know their way around a stud finder), Mr. Randmaa had already taken measures to enhance the Leslieville property.
An upstairs attic, for instance, he had converted into a master bedroom retreat, complete with an ensuite: "An oasis for ourselves," as he describes it.
He had also finished and raised the ceiling on the basement by cleverly redesigning bulkheads and duct work instead of digging. And he had introduced a high-efficiency furnace and central air conditioning, in addition to removing existing knob-and-tube wiring. "Basically," he says, "I had customized our own space."
But after stepping on one too many rubber duckies on the way to making a cup of coffee in the morning, Mr. Randmaa finally agreed to his wife contacting a real-estate agent.
Their instructions to the agent were to look for a house that was big, bright and with a large backyard and parking - everything the Leslieville house was not.
That was three years ago, when the Toronto real-estate market was climbing skyward, and bidding wars were the norm.
The couple had set a $1.5-million budget for themselves, and to find what they were looking for focused their search on the Beaches and High Park. "We couldn't afford North Toronto," Ms. Purcell says.
They looked for a year, while their daughters were still small, and then gave up when they found nothing that suited their needs and bank balance.
Slinking back to Leslieville, where the pile of toys had only grown higher in the intervening years, the couple was surprised when their agent called to say she had just seen a property she was certain they'd like.
They piled themselves and their brood into the car, and drove out to High Park, where there it was - a spacious four-bedroom, four-bathroom, Arts and Crafts-style mansion with ravine views and a new rear addition with skylights - a house to die for.
Boasting nearly 5,000 square feet of interior living space, including a high-ceilinged finished basement with a swimming-pool-sized Jacuzzi tub and sauna, it was nearly three times the size of their Leslieville home.
"It was the number of cupboards in the kitchen," says Ms. Purcell, recalling that love-at-first-sight moment when she knew the house had to be hers.
"I think we have four cupboards in Leslieville. And here we had 16 cupboards. It was a no-brainer."
Even Mr. Randmaa could see himself enjoying possession: "The house had a third floor, like at Leslieville, and it had the potential for me to do here what I had done there, create an upper-floor retreat. It felt like my house, only bigger."
They purchased the house at 7 Ridout St. in High Park for $1.375-million.
It was only when they returned to Leslieville and began preparations to put their old house on the market that they began to have second thoughts.
"Here's the epiphany," says Mr. Randmaa. "A 10-by-10 storage shed. We rented this big one, and shoved all the stuff that had been lying on the floor into it, and suddenly there was all this space."
"For me it was when we were preparing the features sheet," interjects Ms. Purcell. "Our agent asked us how many bedrooms and I said four. And then she asked how many bathrooms and I said three, which was almost as many as the High Park house. And that's when it struck me. I already had my dream house. I didn't need to move."
But the wheels were already in motion, so they decided to list the Leslieville house for sale anyway, and see how much they could get. If the price went crazy high, they'd sell. If not, they'd hold on.
They had listed it for $585,000. Then the bids came in, rising at one point to $615,000 - which is when the couple threw in the towel.
"I just couldn't take it," Ms. Purcell explains. "I had fallen back in love with my own house."
Except the timing was all wrong. Having just crested the highs of the market, within weeks Mr. Randmaa and Ms. Purcell - owners of two houses with as many mortgages - stood helplessly by and watched it crash.
They now couldn't sell High Park without losing their shirts, and so they thought to rent it - at least until the market came back. They prayed it would. And their prayers were answered.
Corus Entertainment approached them with an offer to lease the High Park property for use as a temporary filming location. The deal included Corus being allowed to make any cosmetic changes to the property that it felt would enhance the home's small-screen appeal.
This eventually included building a new deck and wooden arbor at the back of the house, new window treatments, paint, custom radiator covers, refacing the living-room fireplace and installing a new security system. Corus used the house as a set for some of the shows on its newly-acquired Cosmopolitan Television network.
"It was like winning the house lottery," Ms. Purcell says.
The lease recently expired and the house is now up for sale at a list price of $1.399-million.
For Ms. Purcell and Mr. Randmaa, the lure of Leslieville has only grown stronger.
"Leslieville has undergone somewhat of a renaissance recently," says Toronto real-estate agent Irene Kaushansky, who specializes in the area.
"It is now a destination with literally dozens of fantastic restaurants, shops, cafes and specialty food shops - a far cry from the bleak strip it used to be. It is now also seen as a viable alternative for families with young children.
"In the past, Leslieville was where you bought a home only if you were young, somewhat carefree and couldn't afford to purchase in Riverdale or the Beach."
"For us, Leslieville is home sweet home," says Ms. Purcell. "The kids are embedded in their schools and their community programs. They now have all the amenities that I thought we had to move to find. Leslieville has become its own drawing point, as far as I'm concerned. I feel that I may never have to move."
Mr. Randmaa seconds that emotion: "Our existing house has become exactly what we were looking for in another house. Except it's located in downtown Toronto. No family should ever feel afraid living there. Because we don't."

Full text: From basic budget trimming to the creation of a community shopping program, these folks know how to tighten purse strings
Watching an investment or savings account swell makes for one heck of an emotional high. But witnessing your money sink or get wiped out can also send you on a harrowing roller-coaster ride.
Toronto financial expert Lee Anne Davies, for one, says even with the current economic tribulations, building a comfortable nest egg can ease some of the pressure.
"It's easy for some of my clients to have reasons not to save," says Ms. Davies, head of retirement strategies at Royal Bank of Canada. "It's really about paying yourself first."
To kick-start saving, Ms. Davies suggests focusing on priorities, "which takes away the emotion that a rough economy can bring," and then developing a "savings habit. As little as $25 a month can help, that's where you get the compound growth."
Compounding is all about the snowballing effect. For example, put just $25 into a savings account or investment and it earns interest. In the second year, you get interest on that original $25 and on the interest you earned the first year, and so on.
RBC gives this hypothetical scenario of twins Catherine and Peter, using an annual compound interest rate of six per cent: Catherine contributes $1,800 a year over nine years to her Registered Retirement Savings Plan, beginning in her 20s. By age 65, she has contributed $16,200, but has $141,493 in her portfolio.
Peter starts saving in his mid-30s, contributing $1,800 a year over 29 years. By age 65, he has put in $52,200 to have $140,505 in his portfolio.
Saving can start at any age. Here's how some money-savvy Canadians do it.
Phillip Poss, 22,
student, London, Ont.
University student Phillip Poss says a healthy lifestyle makes for a healthy savings attitude - and pumped-up savings accounts.
Mr. Poss, a 22-year-old in the kinesiology program at the University of Western Ontario, started saving three years ago. He now socks away $50 to $75 a month in an ING account, and contributes to a special travel fund with his girlfriend, mostly birthday and holiday money and whenever he has a few extra bucks.
What? No starving student syndrome?
"I have found ways to save a bit more each month by finding less expensive ways to do routine things," says Mr. Poss, who works part-time as a subcontractor and does his own home renovation and other work throughout the school year.
"I always buy groceries and prepare home meals instead of eating out at fast-food places or restaurants, because it saves me over $15 a week. ... I try to get to places on my own by either leaving half an hour early and walking, or I hop on my bike. Not only do I get to save $50 to $75 month, I also become more active and healthy."
What got Mr. Poss into the savings habit? "I understand what I can save now will result in a lot less stress for money when I am older."
A little "self-spoiling" helps, he says, adding that he and his girlfriend saved enough to go to Las Vegas last year.
Elaine Soulliere, 37,
nurse, Windsor, Ont.
Cardiac-care nurse Elaine Soulliere has at least 14 reasons for taking stock of her money and socking it away. Fifteen if you count her young daughter, Peyton.
As the youngest of 14 children of Lebanese immigrant parents who worked several jobs just to get by, Ms. Soulliere wants the future secure for herself and her three-year-old. "I started saving at 18 for my education and if I ever wanted a house," says Ms. Soulliere, a 37-year-old single mother born in Windsor, Ont., where she works full time at Hôtel-Dieu Grace Hospital and part time for an oral surgeon.
While a student working at a fast-food eatery, she started out by saving $50 every two weeks, and increased that to $100. After graduating at age 24, she took out a life insurance savings account, with money automatically withdrawn from her bank.
From feeding a high-interest bank account for holiday gift-buying, to contributing to her daughter's Registered Education Savings Plan and her Registered Retirement Savings Plan, Ms. Soulliere finds automatic withdrawals work savings magic.
"I put $100 a paycheque into [the gift account], so that by Christmas, I don't say, 'Shoot, I have to buy gifts and where am I going to get the money?' ''
Thomas Nolte, 47,
businessman, Bedford, N.S.
In the eyes of Nova Scotia businessman Thomas Nolte, it takes a community to raise the savings stake.
Mr. Nolte, his wife Gillian and their two young children left Germany three years ago to settle in the Halifax area. Today, the couple owns three Curves women's fitness franchises. But Mr. Nolte is perhaps most proud of his feverish work to help create Buy Local, Save Local - a loyalty program that gives consumers discounts for shopping at about 60 local businesses.
With the economic downturn of the past year and a half, Mr. Nolte witnessed first-hand the strain on the economy and consumers in the Halifax Regional Municipality. To give back to the community, he created the loyalty program. For $20 a year, consumers present a special card to businesses that have signed on to the program, and they get discounts and special offers that can save hundreds of dollars a year.
For his part, Mr. Nolte says he's no longer a high-risk investor, after making a lot of money years ago speculating on the stock market and then losing it quickly, "all because I didn't want to admit defeat and go down. That's when I got educated about risk management. ... You really need to separate your emotions from your money."
Today, Mr. Nolte has shares only in his fitness businesses and a mortgage on the family home. He and his wife own two used cars, although they carpool as much as possible. They also save by sharing babysitting with other families, sticking with whatever is on their grocery list, using coupons, and trying to eat and drink coffee at home.
"If you want to save money, it really comes down to making a lifestyle choice," he stresses.
Wendy Morton, 69,
insurance investigator,
poet, Otter Point, B.C.
Wendy Morton is a master of powerful prose, a gift that has made her one of Canada's most endearing poets.
But the long-time resident of Otter Point, near Victoria, is also well-versed on matters of the pocketbook.
Long before Ms. Morton put pen to paper for her 2001 breakout book Private Eye - so named because of her long career as an insurance investigator - the writer learned about the wickedness of waste. Born in the Depression era, her resourceful ways have bettered the planet, the people around her and her bottom line.
"I'm in no ways a conservative person, but I'm a very conservative, cautious investor - I'm mortgage free, and most of my money is in places backed by something real, like real estate, or guaranteed," says Ms. Morton, 69.
"I have saved carefully over the years after finding out about this great thing called compounding interest," she adds, noting that she put money left to her as an inheritance into a GIC at a credit union.
Ms. Morton has been an insurance investigator of claimants' bodily injuries for 27 years, and still works part time while getting her government pension. .
On the 3.65-hectare property she owns with her long-time partner, she cultivates a year-round veggie garden from which she culls ingredients for soup and other homemade meals. She also shops at thrift stores, and takes advantage of discounts and special sales.
Ms. Morton resists impulse buying, isn't one to get into the latest gadgets, and discusses major purchases with her partner. She only buys things she has the cash to pay for, and when she does use her credit card, she pays it by the due date to avoid interest fees.
Her prime advice for anyone looking to save is to ask, "In this time of scary climate change staring us in the face, how resourceful can we be with our money?"

Selling China's property to the world

Abstract: Yes, many more. But they are only interested. Many of them haven't actually invested because all the real estate in China is leasehold, and it's not clear what will happen at the end of these leases because you've only been able to invest since 1988. We know by practice in Hong Kong that the government would renew leases without a premium, but in China, we don't know that yet. It is very likely, of course, but people would prefer to know more.

Full text: DTZ Barnicke chairman educates the West about the private Chinese real estate market he helped create
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
C .Y. Leung covers a lot of ground as Asia-Pacific chairman of DTZ Barnicke, but as a key player in the creation of China's private real estate market, he finds the bulk of his time is spent explaining the system to Western investors.
"There are many things that are confusing to people," Mr. Leung says. "The market is only 21 years old" - until the late 1980s, all land was owned by the state - "and foreigners are only now expressing a real interest in learning more about Chinese real estate."
So far this year, about 450,000 deals have taken place, the vast majority of them land sales, good for $33.8-billion (U.S.). Foreign investors were in on only 8 per cent of the deals, although there are no restrictions on ownership.
Mr. Leung sat down to answer questions during a brief stay in Toronto this week after giving a keynote address at the Real Estate Forum where he discussed investment opportunities in Chinese property.
What have Canadians asked you about since you arrived?
Many of the questions, to be honest, have been very basic. That is very much a sign that for both China and Canada to work together, both will have much to learn.
How do you feel about the Chinese economy right now? How about the overall real estate market?
The economy has been doing very well - and real estate markets can't be detached from economic performances. This year, China is looking down the barrel of 8-per-cent growth, which is quite outstanding. Much of this is from the funding of large-scale infrastructure projects, such as roads and railroads, and the real estate market has benefited from that. Property values have stabilized, and in many cases prices have gone up.
How will the economy fare once the government stimulus is pulled back?
We don't know yet. There are reports that there will be a meeting this weekend, so by the end of the weekend we may know better. But there is a difference between what China is doing and what the U.S. is doing in terms of [injecting] public money into the economy. The Chinese government is not bailing out companies. They don't have to buy debt. Most of the trillions of dollars going into the economy are to build infrastructure and take care of the environment. Generally speaking, you can expect this to be more positive than throwing lifelines to ailing businesses.
The housing market has been growing rapidly. Is there any concern about a bubble?
There is some concern, but the difference in China is that there is population growth and also economic growth to support new development; therefore, the underlying demand for occupation purposes has been quite strong.
How affordable is home ownership?
Quite. Nearly all cities in China have a high ownership rate, up to 90 per cent. All units were owned by the state until 1988, but now, 21 years later, it is one of the largest real estate markets in the world. And it's also open to foreigners. The Chinese are generally good savers, and families often help.
Does China face similar issues to Western markets? What are default rates like?
Defaults are very, very low. People pay back mortgages as quickly as they can. In Hong Kong, 50 per cent of the housing stock has no mortgage. That is very different than the U.S. situation, where people take out equity when they see an appreciation in value and then spend the money. In China, [it's] the other way around.
Why?
It must be the culture. Whenever I can't explain something, I say the answer is "culture."
How have commercial real estate markets fared over the past two years?
We're seeing much more activity in the last six months. Volumes have remained relatively stable and in the third quarter there were $17.5-billion in transactions, which is quite a lot. Still, prices are much lower than they are in Canada.
Who is buying?
The buyers are mostly local, though there are starting to be more foreign buyers because there are no restrictions - it's an entirely level playing field.
Are you seeing more foreigners than five years ago?
Yes, many more. But they are only interested. Many of them haven't actually invested because all the real estate in China is leasehold, and it's not clear what will happen at the end of these leases because you've only been able to invest since 1988. We know by practice in Hong Kong that the government would renew leases without a premium, but in China, we don't know that yet. It is very likely, of course, but people would prefer to know more.
How do buyers react to buying leases rather than owning the properties outright?
You know, you sit and you explain to a foreign investor such as a Canadian insurance company - or his Canadian lawyer - and they are most worried that they will have to write off the investment 30 years from now. Large pension funds also wonder about how this will work. These are issues that will come up as world real estate markets globalize - investors are interested in overseas, but they don't understand local issues. They are trying to learn these things very quickly, of course, and are learning that once a property is leased, it can change hands and it is a completely open market.
What do Canadian investors need to know about investing in the Chinese market?
In one sense, it's similar to other places - you need to understand local government policies, land title systems. But a big difference is that because the country is so vast, you need to think in terms of microeconomic conditions. You need to study location more because the national situation is too large. It's much like Canada - Toronto and Vancouver are very different.

Abstract: A walk around the building reveals a UBC Properties Trust-built take on a village green - with a storm drain/waterway that provides visual pleasure and resource recycling, a playground and a grassy, landscaped area surrounded by three other residential developments. Killdeers cry and frolic in the foliage, while a nearby community centre called "the barn" - built on the bones of an original, actual barn - speaks to the rural history of this area.

Full text: A wave of new building is transforming the area around the UBC campus
Compared to urban universities such as McGill or the University of Toronto, Vancouver's UBC is decidedly land rich. At more than four square kilometres, the campus is one of the biggest in Canada, and that's not counting the endowment lands - about 14 square kilometres - half of which is made up of Pacific Spirit Park.
Vast swaths of its forested endowment lands remain preserved for the future, but a recent wave of residential development on campus is rivalling the Olympic village for Vancouver's construction hot spot.
The Chancellor area on the north end of campus was the first to develop, followed by Hawthorn Place. Now, the South Campus neighbourhood is positively booming. In the past two years, a whole new community adjacent to 16th Avenue has been carved out of forest. Eventually the South end's Wesbrook Place will be the largest neighbourhood on UBC's campus, housing more than 5,000 people in a mix of townhouses and apartments.
A recent visit offered a dizzying array of projects: a brand new Save-On-Foods with rental housing above it, a senior's residence under construction, a new Henriquez Partners- designed high-rise project called Sage at the edge of the TRIUMF research centre, and a new high school in the planning stages.
The campus residential areas have been highly planned by the UBC Properties Trust, unlike the public academic buildings, which can seem like a mishmash (especially compared to the more singular vision of the Arthur Erickson-designed Simon Fraser University campus).
And a sense of community is growing, particularly at Wesbrook Place, with mixed-use residential/commercial zoning, market/student housing, attention to infrastructure and sensitivity to and engagement with the natural environment. The area features a network of "green streets" - aesthetically pleasing corridors of unpaved walkways and bicycle trails, as well as increased public transit, all of which adds up to dramatically reduced car use.
"The whole experience of UBC is about entry into forest," says Norm Couttie, an architect and the president of Adera Group - one of the biggest developers of residential property on campus. With several established projects and two new ones almost complete, the firm has demonstrated a West Coast contemporary design vision that embraces its surroundings.
Consider their 2005 project called Legacy in Hawthorn Place. In the midst of a pastiche of styles that range from pseudo arts and crafts to Cape Cod, Legacy offers the comfort of real West Coast cedar, landscaping with native species, and a true indoor/outdoor aesthetic.
"West Coast contemporary architecture," explains Couttie, "pioneered by Arthur Erickson, Ron Thom and others, is what we do best. Why should we try and imitate other styles?"
Why indeed. Across the street from Rhododendron Forest, Legacy echoes the greenery with its cedar elements and landscaping. With the use of a bridged entranceway that straddles a gully below that subtly suggests a creek bed, the eye is drawn inside what feels like a residential extension of the forest opposite. Large balconies offer residents lush views of towering fir trees, while brick offers a textural interplay with the cedar siding and references more traditional academic architecture.
An earlier building down the way, called Journey, reads like a riff on Erickson's Museum of Anthropology. The entranceway - a grand cedar post-and-beam structure with terraced steps - leads up to a lobby featuring an indoor stream. A First Nations killer whale emblem stands guard on a stone wall above it. The course of the water, the sloped site and the extensive glazing at the lobby entrance and exit conspire to create a sense of continual flow. The balconies here are huge - 300 square feet - and take in the considerable view.
A walk around the building reveals a UBC Properties Trust-built take on a village green - with a storm drain/waterway that provides visual pleasure and resource recycling, a playground and a grassy, landscaped area surrounded by three other residential developments. Killdeers cry and frolic in the foliage, while a nearby community centre called "the barn" - built on the bones of an original, actual barn - speaks to the rural history of this area. The UBC teaching farm is nearby, and local legend has it that sheep are often taken to the UBC hospital for ultrasounds. It's that kind of community.
Teaching farm sheep excepted, wildlife abounds here, with local coyotes the scourge of worried cat owners. But if a coyote were to emerge from of the woods that surround the new South Campus neighbourhood, a kilometre from Hawthorn Place, he might well be in for a surprise.
The café at the new Save on Foods has an almost urban, Yaletowny feel to it, and the new medical offices mean that many residents can exist for days without a journey downtown.
And yet, what one notices at Adera's new Pathways development, is its celebration of forest. The glass entranceway acts both as a natural segue between the two buildings it comprises and at the same time as a repository for needles from nearby towering firs, mimicking the forest canopy. A long, cylindrical fountain stretches across the length of the first building, softening its façade and creating both a sense of intimacy and procession as one enters Pathways under the elongated glass canopy.
Once inside the first lobby, a Brent Comber fir bench beckons, flanked by one of his cedar installation pieces on the wall.
The tall fir trees - a few select ones saved for their age and height - that stand on the other side of the building - read like installation pieces themselves. They lead the way down yet another green street that intersects surprisingly chic, terraced storm drain/fountain that vaguely suggests the water elements at Erickson's Robson Square.
Then, after a few lovely feet, the green street ends, simply melting into the surrounding forest.

Currently in its fourth campaign, Dexter 's sophomore season introduced the character of Lila (Jaime Murray) - a recovering drug addict and arsonist who becomes sponsor to nice-guy serial killer Dexter Morgan (Michael C.

A New Beginning
CTV, 8 p.m.
From 2008, this TV-movie takes Lucy Maud Montgomery's character of Anne Shirley into previously uncharted territory. Featuring a plotline not covered in the books, the story concerns a middle-aged Anne (Barbara Hershey) in the years following the Second World War. The death of her physician husband overseas has left her grieving. A long-buried secret has Anne flashing back to her troubled years before she arrived as an orphan at Green Gables.
DOCUMENTARY
Kidnapped for 18 Years: The Jaycee Lee Dugard Story
TLC, 8 p.m.
Chilling and all too real, this special retells a story torn from the headlines. Many viewers will likely be familiar with one of the most infamous kidnapping cases in recent memory. Jaycee Lee Dugard was only 11 years old when abducted by strangers while waiting for her school bus. The child was held by kidnapper Phillip Craig Garrido for 18 years before she was found by police last August. The program relives the young woman's terrible years in captivity.
DOCUMENTARY
Wal-Mart Nation
CBC News Network, 10 p.m.
Like it or not, Wal-Mart has forever changed the way people shop. Carrying almost every consumer product under the sun, the international retailer has carved out its niche with competing retailers, and virtually driven the mom-and-pop stores out of business. And Wal-Mart has not scored any points for good business practices. This series of snapshots visits with Chinese-Canadian union activist Ana Liu on her crusade to unionize Canadian Wal-Mart workers, and politico Al Norman, who successfully prevented the building of a Wal-Mart in his Massachusetts hometown.
MOVIE
White Christmas
AMC, 10:30 p.m.
Along with the Alastair Sim version of A Christmas Carol and It's a Wonderful Life , this 1954 musical ranks among the most beloved holiday films. The story follows song-and-dance men Bob (Bing Crosby) and Phil (Danny Kaye), who hook up with fellow entertainers Betty and Judy (Rosemary Clooney, Vera-Ellen). All four team up to put on a big show at the struggling ski lodge owned by Bob and Phil's old general (Dean Jagger). Crosby and Kaye's rendition of sisters in drag is priceless.
SUNDAY
DECEMBER 6
DESIGN
Decked for the Holidays
HGTV, 7 p.m.
This how-to guide is hosted by home decor expert Karen McAloon, with assistance from designers Erinn Valencich and Frank Fontana. The special covers the application of festive adornments inside and outside the house and includes useful tips for hip home entertaining. Hanging mistletoe is so passé.
HISTORY
The Hangman's Graveyard
History, 8 p.m.
Prepare to feel goose bumps while watching this snapshot of dark Toronto history. In September, 2007, a team of archaeologists headed by Dr. Ron Williamson excavated an old burial site located beneath the city's infamous Don Jail. The team stumbled upon the skeletal remains of 15 unlucky men who perished at the end of a noose at the old jail between 1880 and 1932. This program identifies the victims and the crimes that sent each man to the gallows.
FOOD
Food Detectives
Food, 8:30 p.m.
Former Queer Eye for the Straight Guy fixture Ted Allen is a culinary Columbo in this lively series. In each episode, Allen and his assistants conduct elaborate science experiments to answer burning food questions such as: Does chicken soup really prevent a cold? Tonight's show examines the causes of heartburn and offers up remedies. Allen tells us the most effective cure is sitting right in your kitchen cupboard.
DOCUMENTARY
An Inconvenient Truth
CBC News Network, 10 p.m.
Winner of the 2007 Oscar for best documentary, this film makes the ominous prediction that Earth is only a decade away from catastrophe on an epic scale.

The film indirectly earned Gore the Nobel Peace Prize and restarted his career as the planet's environmental protector.
MONDAY
DECEMBER 7
HISTORY
Pearl Harbor: Who Fired First?
History, 7 p.m.
The unspoken theme of this history documentary appears to be: Who started the fight that launched the U.S. involvement in the Second World War? The program rewinds to events that allegedly took place before the Japanese attack on the U.S. naval base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. According to this report, the duty destroyer USS Ward, on patrol in Hawaiian waters, fired on and sank a midget Japanese submarine. First blood was drawn. Three months later came the day of infamy.
DRAMA
Law & Order: SVU
NBC, 8 and 9 p.m.
The sturdy crime drama airs in back-to-back episodes tonight. First, detectives Stabler (Chris Meloni) and Munch (Richard Belzer) investigate the horrific death of a male teenager set afire. The case somehow connects to a high-school religious sect based on chastity. In the second, singer Hilary Duff plays the young mother of a two-year-old girl who suddenly goes missing.
COMEDY
Denis Leary: Merry F-g Christmas
Comedy, 10 p.m.
Not for the easily offended, this 2005 special is hosted by Denis Leary, who clearly does not enjoy the holiday season. Among other targets, Leary skewers A Charlie Brown Christmas in the animated short titled It's Jihad, Farley Towne . Comedian Charlie Murphy delivers his own unique take on 'Twas the Night Before Christmas (Santa snorts coke in this version). And make sure the kids are out of the room for the soft-core porn parody Nuns with Colds Gone Wild .
FOOD
Restaurant Makeover
Food, 11 p.m.
It's a cruel fact of life that most new restaurants fold within a year of opening. The format of this series challenges two restaurateur top guns to fix a flagging eatery in one week. Tonight's show focuses on Sean and Claudine, owners of Natchos Thai Thai in downtown Toronto. While the restaurant is pulling in a sizable lunch crowd, it's empty at night. Chef David Adjey and designer Meredith Heron roll up their sleeves to overhaul the decor and dinner menu.
TUESDAY
DECEMBER 8
MOVIE
Family Plot
TCM, 5:45 p.m.
Alfred Hitchcock's final film was not his best work, but still worth a look. Attempting to merge black comedy and crime drama, the story involves a wealthy dowager hiring the psychic Blanche (Barbara Harris) and her lowlife boyfriend Lumley (Bruce Dern) to locate her missing nephew. The only heir turns out to be the psychotic Arthur (William Devane) who kidnaps and kills people with help from his girlfriend Fran (Karen Black). In patented, patient Hitchcock fashion, the four characters try to outwit each other, with all eyeing the old bird's money.
KIDS
Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town
CBC, 8 p.m.
Coming from the producers of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer , this holiday chestnut features the identical style of animation, with bigger voice talents. Narrated by a stop-motion version of Fred Astaire as a mailman, the 1970 special tells a rather scattered version of the origins of Santa Claus, voiced by Mickey Rooney. In this account, Santa, aka Kris Kringle, was an abandoned baby raised by toy-makers. He began coming down chimneys once toys were banned in Sombertown. Then he grew a beard. That about covers it.
RETRO
The Cosby Show: A Look Back
TBS, 9 p.m.
The superstation TBS - which airs The Cosby Show daily - fills two more hours of airtime with this retrospective special. First aired in 2002, the film reconsiders the show's prime-time run from 1984 to 1992 and explores how it changed society perceptions of African-American families. Along with countless clips, The Cos himself is interviewed and there are Cosby Show reflections from Oprah Winfrey, P. Diddy and Adam Sandler. Adam Sandler?
REALITY
Teen Mom
MTV, 10 p.m.
Considering the success of the MTV reality series 16 and Pregnant , this sequel was probably inevitable. The new series catches up with four teen girls - Maci, Amber, Catelynn and Farrah - who are now young mothers. The first season follows the moms dealing with various life issues, including marriage, money and the dwindling chance they'll ever resume their education, while taking care of an infant with little or no help from the child's father. They're kids tending kids.
WEDNESDAY
DECEMBER 9
MUSIC
L.A. Holiday Celebration
PBS, 8 p.m.
America's public broadcaster gets into the festive spirit with highlights from the annual L.A. Country Holiday Celebration that takes place at the Los Angeles Music Center each December. The program includes a breakdance version of The Nutcracker , followed by Japanese drummers, hip-hop dancers and a Latin-Klezmer fusion performance. And to all a good night.
DRAMA
Glee
Fox, Global, 9 p.m.
Better sit down, Glee -ophiles. Tonight's episode is the "fall finale," which means no more fresh episodes until the hit musical series returns in the spring. Tonight, the glee club is set to compete in the state sectionals, when Quinn (Dianna Agron) upsets the game plan with a dark secret. Elsewhere, gym coach Sue (Jane Lynch) schemes and Mr. Schuester (Matthew Morrison) decides to follow his heart.
COMEDY
Cougar Town
ABC, CITY-TV, 9:30 p.m.
Still holding its own among new fall arrivals, Cougar Town has found TV life after Friends for Courteney Cox. Tonight, her character of oversexed, fortysomething real-estate agent Jules is deeply flattered when a handsome and wealthy businessman (Scott Foley) feigns interest in an overpriced house. But his motive to meet her turns out to be a little creepy.
CELEBRITY
Barbara Walters Presents: The 10 Most Fascinating People of 2009
ABC, Global, 10 p.m.
Taking a break from The View , Barbara Walters sits down with the past year's biggest newsmakers in her annual interview special. At press time, Walters still had not revealed all 10 names, but confirmed the following participants: American Idol winner Adam Lambert, pop star Lady Gaga, political commentator Glenn Beck, reality-TV mom Kate Gosselin, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin and South Carolina first lady Jenny Sanford, better known as the wife of the governor who briefly ran off to Argentina with another woman.
THURSDAY
DECEMBER 10
MOVIE
Touch of Pink
Bravo!, 4 p.m.
The feature-film debut of writer-director Ian Iqbal Rashid, this 2004 romantic comedy is precocious on all counts. The plotline casts Jimi Mistry as Alim, a gay Ismali-Canadian residing in a trendy London neighbourhood. The young hipster's relationship with boyfriend Giles (Kristen Holden-Reid) is going along swimmingly until the abrupt arrival of Alim's strong-willed mother Nuru (Suleka Mathew), whose plan is to take her son back to Canada where he can marry a nice Muslim girl.
COMEDY
Parks and Recreation
NBC, CITY-TV, 8:30 p.m.
Comedian Louis C.K. makes a guest appearance in tonight's holiday-themed episode of the clever mockumentary sitcom. The veteran stand-up plays a disgraced councilman embroiled in a low-grade sex scandal that has everyone talking in small-town Pawnee, Ind. The witless bureaucrat Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) naturally gets pulled into the muck. Leslie's shiftless superior Ron (Nick Offerman), meanwhile, steps in to cover for her and is shocked to discover she actually does some work every day. Ah, local government.
DRAMA
CSI
CBS, CTV, 9 p.m.
A boy's night out turns into another long night of work for the CSI staffers. The trio of Nick (George Eads), Greg (Eric Szmanda) and Hodges (Wallace Langham) take out the lab tech Henry (Jon Wellner) to celebrate his birthday at a biker bar. Between drinks, they stumble over a double homicide right at their feet. And all signs indicate that the killer is still in the room.
DRAMA
The Mentalist
CBS, CTV, 10 p.m.
Still riding high in the Thursday-night ratings, this sophomore crime drama is holding its audience by keeping it simple. Tonight, psychic-sleuth Patrick Jane (Simon Baker) and his co-workers are attending a dreary black-tie fundraiser for the CBI (California Bureau of Investigation), when a prominent jeweller is robbed and murdered - at the same event. Once again, Jane proves himself to be the smartest person in the room.

More than just a castle in the sand

Abstract: In many ways, Dubai's rulers have been remarkably tolerant of free expression. A year ago, I sat through an evening of presentations by local artists at the University of Dubai. One, a photographer, presented a visual timeline of the construction of one of the stations of Dubai's new metro system. The artist emphasized how jarring the city-state's 13-year transformation has been to citizens. How does one relate to the inanimate objects rising out of the desert sands?

Full text:   Professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund
Global investors are in a giant huff over Dubai's decision to allow its flagship private company, Dubai World, to seek a six-month standstill (implying at least partial default) on payments on $26-billion (U.S.) in debt. What exactly did investors expect when they purchased bonds in companies with names such as Limitless World, one of Dubai World's real-estate subsidiaries? Talk about a bubble mentality.
The idea, I guess, was that the emirate's government would stand behind every loan, no matter how risky. And if Dubai didn't have the money, its oil-rich sister state Abu Dhabi would cough it up.
An absurd expectation, but hardly more improbable than many of the other massive bailouts we have seen recently. What really upset investors, of course, was the realization that, yes, untenable debt guarantees will have to be withdrawn some day. Eventually, an overleveraged world is going to have to find a way to cut debt burdens down to size, and it won't all be pretty.
There are those who revel in what they see as a comeuppance for Dubai's outsized ambitions. I do not share this view. Yes, Dubai, with its hotels, man-made islands and roof-top tennis courts, is a real-world castle in the sand. Yet, it has also shown the rest of the Middle East what entrepreneurial spirit can accomplish.
Its airport has become a global hub of such significance that German regulators recently had to force Emirates Airlines to raise its rates to Frankfurt, lest national champion Lufthansa lose too much business. And with its relatively open goods and capital markets, Dubai has become a trading hub for the entire Middle East, plus parts of Africa and Asia. On the eve of the financial crisis, other Persian Gulf states were looking to it for insight into how they might diversify their economies when the oil runs dry.
Yes, Dubai is an autocratic state where finances are tightly and secretively controlled. Indeed, lack of detailed information on the emirate's finances was a central reason why the Dubai World default came as such a shock.
But in many ways, Dubai's rulers have been remarkably tolerant of free expression. A year ago, I sat through an evening of presentations by local artists at the University of Dubai. One, a photographer, presented a visual timeline of the construction of one of the stations of Dubai's new metro system. The artist emphasized how jarring the city-state's 13-year transformation has been to citizens. How does one relate to the inanimate objects rising out of the desert sands?
Another artist presented a vision of how outside lighting could be used to transform minarets, and help them to stand out in the blur of modern buildings that characterizes the contemporary Middle Eastern city. His visions were magnificent, and apparently somewhat radical. One had to be impressed that such ideas could be expressed openly.
Anyone familiar with Dubai understands that these are but small examples of a much broader embrace of creativity that has allowed the country to court elite foreign professionals in finance and other industries.
Unfortunately, Dubai ultimately proved subject to the laws of financial gravity. This time was not different. Massive speculation and borrowing led to excessive debt burdens and, ultimately, to default.
Is this the end of the road for its epic growth? I doubt it. Throughout history, countries have defaulted on debts and lived to talk about it, even prosper. There is no way around the need for Dubai to restructure before it can resume a more sustainable trajectory, although achieving this will take time.
Will there be contagion to vulnerable countries elsewhere? Not just yet. While the Dubai case is not different, it is special, so the effect on investor confidence should remain contained for now. But investors are learning the hard way that no country's possibilities and resources are limitless.

In Dubai, a blunt refusal amid deeper losses

Author: Martin, Patrick

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/dubai-blunt-refusal-amid-deeper-losses/docview/382606967/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "It is correct that the government owns Dubai World," Abdulrahman Al Saleh, director general of Dubai's Department of Finance, said in an interview with Dubai TV. "But the decision when it was set up was that it should receive financing based on the viability of its projects, not on government guarantees," he said. "The lenders should bear part of the responsibility."

Full text:   An eerie calm engulfed Dubai's financial centre, even as the city-state's two stock exchanges and another down the road in Abu Dhabi took a pounding.
Investors rushed to unload shares of several corporations expected to bear the brunt of a sharp downturn in Dubai's economy, the result of the announcement last week that the powerful holding company Dubai World needs a break from making payments on its $59-billion (U.S.) in debts.
Abu Dhabi's market was down a record 8.3 per cent yesterday, and the Dubai Financial Market fell 7.3 per cent, with several banks, transportation and construction firms at or near the daily allowable loss of 10 per cent. At the Nasdaq Dubai, DP World, a major unit of Dubai World, lost 14.88 per cent of its value, hovering all day just above the exchange's 15-per-cent loss limit per day.
Global markets have been gyrating wildly since Dubai World first announced plans for a debt standstill last Wednesday, just before holidays began. Emerging markets and Asia were hard hit last week, but largely bounced back yesterday as investors hoped Dubai's problems would remain largely contained.
In Dubai, government and private offices had almost all been given a 10-day holiday with the religious festival of Eid al Adha, ending later this week with the celebration of the United Arab Emirates independence day.
Eid al Adha commemorates the sacrifice the patriarch Abraham was about to make of his son Ishmael. This year, however, the holiday might also be said to mark the sacrifice of those holding stocks in vulnerable Dubai companies.
Together, the Dubai and Abu Dhabi markets shed about $10-billion in capitalization yesterday. They would have shed more, but for the exchanges' strict limits. In both cities, there were many orders to sell; almost none to buy.
Arun, for one, chose to buy. The thirtysomething software engineer from India believes many of the companies' shares have been unfairly judged and are at, or near, their low point. Arun, who declined to give his surname, bought stock in Emaar Properties PJSC, a giant real estate and construction company that built the Bourj Dubai, the world's tallest building. Its shares sank 9.86 per cent yesterday.
"It's a fundamentally sound company, with enormous upside," he said.
Al-Fajr Securities analyst Hamam al-Shamaa agrees that many companies have suffered because of the exodus of foreign investors. The trouble, he says, is that the phenomenon isn't over. "We expect to see many foreign portfolios withdrawing from the market," Mr. al-Shamaa said, adding that "their exit obviously terrifies local investors" and pulls share values down.
That prospect doesn't seem to alarm Arun, who is among the handful of people sitting in the leather easy chairs of what passes for the DFM's trading floor, quietly picking up some low-hanging stock. "If the value drops by another 10 per cent tomorrow, I'll just buy more."
"Bottom line," he said: "I am confident that Abu Dhabi won't sit by and see its brothers [in Dubai] fail," he said.
But people here also have been confident that Dubai itself would back Dubai World's debts - after all, they reasoned, the government owns the giant holding company.
Not so fast, said a senior government official yesterday. There's a difference between ownership and being a government entity.
"It is correct that the government owns Dubai World," Abdulrahman Al Saleh, director general of Dubai's Department of Finance, said in an interview with Dubai TV. "But the decision when it was set up was that it should receive financing based on the viability of its projects, not on government guarantees," he said. "The lenders should bear part of the responsibility."
Those holding bonds of Nakheel PJSC, Dubai World's lavish property development subsidiary that has run up the most debt, have "almost no legal leg to stand on" to recover assets from the Dubai government in the event of non-payment of debt, says RBC Dominion Securities Inc.
"The prospectus makes it clear that there is no recourse back to the sovereign's assets," wrote analysts led by Nick Chamie at RBC in Toronto in a research note yesterday. Dubai World yesterday unveiled a restructuring plan that would include its property firms and $26-billion of debt, including $6-billion relating to the Nakheel bonds.
Why are these governments that have enjoyed the success of Dubai, and the prestige it has offered the UAE as a whole, now so reluctant to pony up?
In Dubai's case, analysts here are blunt: Dubai doesn't have the money. Its wealth has been based on borrowing and it would only have to borrow more money to pay Dubai World's loan payments.
When that became painfully clear a few months ago, the Emir, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, took action, though he didn't tell the people. The ruler sacked the chief of the finance department (bringing in Mr. Al Saleh), brought in a chief restructuring officer and, soon after, started to lay off large numbers of staff.
The government statement last Wednesday, announcing its intervention and suggesting a standstill on payments by Dubai World's loans, was just the latest step in distancing itself from the corporation. In effect, it has chosen to blame company management for company extravagance.
It doesn't seem to matter that it was the al Maktoum family that had the dream of taking a small fishing port and turning it into a world class financial centre and trading hub.
It's a harsh reminder, say some, that Dubai is not a democracy, but a monarchy. The ruler of the 1.6 million people is never to blame when things go wrong.
However, the consequences of this situation will be felt by all - as they will be paid by the city-state's reputation. "This is a big blow to Dubai's status," said Charlie Parker, chief analyst for Citywire in London, "and to its goal of becoming a major financial centre."
In the Dubai International Financial Centre, the hub of the financial district, there were few people and little sign of chaos. On the 14th floor, where DIFC management is located, offices were being painted, taking advantage of several days of executives' absences.
The tough decisions now are likely being made elsewhere.
Abu Dhabi has strong incentives not to let Dubai collapse, said a note issued yesterday by Eurasia Group. But any support it gave would come with a price. "Longer term, Abu Dhabi will use this opportunity to establish greater influence over political and economic decision-making in Dubai, and Dubai will consequently adopt a more conservative financial model," the consultancy wrote.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF THE UAE
Dubai World, the state-controlled holding company of Dubai, says it will seek a six-month delay in paying creditors on nearly $60-billion (U.S.) it owes. The debt was racked up during Dubai's real-estate bubble, which popped with the global recession. Here's a look at the firm, the United Arab Emirates, and Dubai.
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
OVERVIEW
* Population about 4.7 million.
* Established in 1971.
* A federal system, with powers divided among the federal government and the seven member emirates. * 25 per cent of gross domestic product comes from oil and gas. * Dubai, with 1.6 million people, is the second-largest of seven member states.
* Dubai World is the state-controlled holding company of Dubai.
Family ties
Six families control the UAE:

Full text:   Developer's vision for St. Joseph site includes restoration of heritage buildings
CITY HALL BUREAU CHIEF
Yonge Street merchant Mark Citron was all set to fight a proposed 45-storey condo that would loom above his family's third-generation clothing store, Cat's Cradle, on a historic stretch of Toronto's main street.
Then he heard what the developer had in mind at Yonge and St. Joseph streets: restoration of 19th-century heritage buildings on the half-acre site, not just retention of the facades as often happens on such projects.
"When I found out how they are restoring the buildings, they kind of got me over," said Mr. Citron, though he's still a little uneasy over the height of the condo.
Yesterday, without debate, city council approved the $100-million project that, despite some resident opposition, has support from others as a hopeful sign for the future regeneration of the city's most important street.
"Toronto is not a world-class city without a world-class Main Street," said Mr. Citron, who with his partners has refurbished his own heritage building and wants the city to do more to protect its architectural history. "This is our Main Street."
The large scale of the project, spread over a half-city block at Yonge and St. Joseph, gave the developer, Diamondcorp, unusual flexibility to assemble key pieces in creative ways that appealed to city officials.
For example, the 45-storey tower is set back from streets on three sides, including 30 metres from Yonge to protect its pedestrian-friendly character.
The restored historic commercial buildings, including the vacant Rawlinson Warehouse most recently used as an after-hours club, will be turned into retail and office space, as well as some live-work units.
In the end, the city gave rezoning approval to put up a tall tower with 412 residential units and 2,800 square metres of commercial/retail space, with occupancy by 2012. The project received unanimous endorsement from the Toronto Preservation Board.
"Their reinvestment in the heritage of Yonge Street is unparalleled for a major developer and the tower makes it possible for that reinvestment to occur," said local Councillor Kyle Rae (Ward 27, Toronto Centre-Rosedale).
But some in the neighbourhood are not happy.
"This is the second shoe to drop," said Paul Farrelly, a member of the Bay Corridor Community Association, whose members unsuccessfully fought a 28-storey condo about a block to the north and appeared at Toronto and East York community council to question an even taller tower.
Mr. Farrelly says there has been too little consultation with area residents, beyond one required community meeting in advance of approval from city hall. "The developer is having it all his own way," he said.
Standing at the corner of Yonge and St. Joseph, developer Stephen Diamond, president of Diamondcorp., describes his plans to refurbish a row of heritage buildings, whose original red brick has been obscured by paint and gaudy modern signage.
"This part of Yonge Street needs a bit of a lift," he said. But he says other projects under way, including a 80-storey tower at Yonge and Bloor and a recently approved 28-storey condo several blocks north off Yonge, should add momentum to renewal of a major artery.
Among those hopeful of what's to come is James Robison, executive director of the Downtown Yonge business improvement area, which represents retail interests south of Mr. Diamond's project.
"It's a critical project and a model development on Yonge Street," he said.
***
Waterfront renewal
Yesterday's announcement of a 36-storey high-rise, the first private real-estate development in the emerging East Bayfront neighbourhood along the waterfront, fuelled hope of a resurgence in the local condo market.
"Six months ago, signs were that a project like this would be put on hold," said Mayor David Miller, after Waterfront Toronto announced the sale of a parcel of land to developer Great Gulf Group of Companies.
The proposed sale of the Parkside development site, near Lake Shore Boulevard and Lower Sherbourne Street, goes to city council for approval today.
Great Gulf president Daniel David Gerofsky said public investments made to date in the vicinity, including transportation and a major new park, "made us feel this is going to be a very important site."
But he declined to give a firm date to complete the project.

The indoor mall as community centre

Full text:   Mid-market malls look for creative ways to connect with clientele in the face of power-centre competition
The scene at the Elgin Mall is a familiar one this time of year: children rush to have their picture taken with Santa Claus, teenagers dart into their favourite stores, moms search for Christmas bargains and seniors line the benches to talk current events.
For shoppers in secondary cities such as St. Thomas, Ont., located 30 kilometres south of London, the Elgin Mall is more than a mid-market retail hub - it's a destination for a tightly knit community that has seen its manufacturing base battered by the recession.
When property manager Julie Cole looks down the mall's climate-controlled corridors, she sees no evidence of the deadmalls.com phenomenon, which chronicles the slow death of once-thriving retail hubs across North America.
At the Elgin, management has been looking for more creative ways to serve this city of 37,000 - an experience that goes beyond shopping, Ms. Cole says.
"We've made it known that we're willing to do things to help the community in the hope that they will continue to recognize us as their preferred mall in the area," she says.
One of her greatest challenges is catering to a diverse clientele. "[Some of our 48 stores] want us to cater to a younger crowd, whereas we also have women's fashion for an older generation and they want us to push people to them," she says.
Over the past decade, many of Canada's enclosed shopping centres built during the retail construction boom of the 1960s and 1970s have fallen on tough times. As property developers built new, unenclosed "power centres," major retailers and shoppers abandoned the local mall.
Managers of mid-market malls across Canada were left asking the same question: How could older, less fashionable properties compete against these powerful new competitors?
The solution at malls such as Elgin - one of the 23 properties across Canada owned and operated by Toronto-based Retrocom Mid-Market REIT - has been to embrace a new community focus.
Mall staff have organized sponsorships for local hockey and soccer teams, sponsored food drives and staged fashion shows - using mall employees and shoppers as models.
In another move to foster community, 153 square metres of storefront has been rededicated as a free, multipurpose customer rest area and meeting space for non-profit organizations.
The result: Elgin Mall retailers have seen an uptick in foot traffic and sales in the three months since the community-building initiatives were deployed.
"We've actually gotten calls from people in the community saying, 'We've forgotten about your mall over the past while, but now that you guys are trying to make yourselves more known in the public, we're happy to be coming back,' " Ms. Cole says.
Retrocom CEO David Fiume says the company's efforts to reinvest in community-based marketing at many of its properties are a reflection of yet another change in customer shopping preferences. In the era of online shopping, many consumers long for the community shopping experience of yesteryear, Retrocom's research has shown.
Retrocom operates malls in Regina, Moose Jaw, Swift Current and Prince Albert in Saskatchewan; Chilliwack in British Columbia; and Orangeville, St. Thomas and Midland in Ontario.
That change in approach to property management was also spurred in large part by a change of management and board composition at Retrocom, which was singled out for poor performance in 2006. Since then the REIT's fortunes have improved thanks to a reorganization of its debt load and the purchase of a controlling stake in the company by Mitchell Goldhar, controlling shareholder of Vaughan, Ont.-based shopping centre developer SmartCentres Inc. - which boasts a property portfolio largely dominated by Retrocom's unenclosed mall competition.
A recent report by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce noted that this new ownership structure could improve Retrocom's ability to acquire key properties and improve its long-term cash flow.
The success or failure of shopping destinations such as Elgin Mall is largely dictated by the acumen of the managers running them, says Alex Avery, a Toronto-based real estate analyst with CIBC World Markets Inc.
"What's happened in a lot of cases is the properties just haven't been managed to reflect the people around them," Mr. Avery explains. "That offers a great opportunity for a firm with the right management skills to reposition [a mall] and give it a lot of value."
Although there has been little enclosed-mall construction since the mid-1990s, Canadian consumers are still interested in the indoor shopping experience, Mr. Avery adds.
The key to injecting new life into these aging buildings, he says, is to understand the demographic mix of the population in the surrounding area, attract retailers that cater to their needs and continue providing affordable staples. The loss of major department store anchor tenants, he adds, may actually provide an opportunity to increase revenue by drawing in a larger number of smaller retailers at higher rents to occupy those vacant spaces.
A renewed focus on community, he adds, is the icing on the marketing cake for these spaces.
In the case of Regina's 41,000-square-metre Southland Mall - another Retrocom property built in the mid-1970s - management has worked hard to develop strong community initiatives to boost foot traffic and sales among its core late-30s female shoppers.
Some of those projects include charity events for the local Children's Help Phone branch, fundraisers for the local Humane Society, continued sponsorship of Regina's Santa Claus Parade and a regular mall-walking program for the many seniors who live nearby.
According to Southland's property manager Karen Kozakavich, those sales-boosting, community-building efforts would be virtually impossible to organize in other environments.
"We have the opportunity to band together and try different things as a group here in the centre with our tenants and come up with some new suggestions," she says. "I think we're at an advantage being in an enclosed mall."
******
WAYS TO REACH OUT
Indoor malls in secondary cities across Canada could offer new experiences in the years to come, Retrocom Mid-Market REIT CEO David Fiume says.
Medical tenants
Doctors, dentists and complementary retailers such as national pharmacies are being sought by local mall managers.
Family attractions
Skateboarding parks for teens, playground areas for children and event space converted from underutilized food courts are some of the changes Retrocom is considering at various properties.
Reading rooms
At Elgin Mall in St. Thomas, Ont., the new community multipurpose space includes a reading room for toddlers. "If we set these things up we realize that they will lead to good sales for our tenants and over time that will lead to a rent that allows us to continue this cycle," Mr. Fiume says.

Soaring debt brings Dubai back to Earth

Don't be taken in: While the central bank of the United Arab Emirates stepped in yesterday to support local banks, the party looks to be over in Dubai.
Interestingly, the people at the Dubai Offshore Sailing Club think that's just fine.
"This recession is exactly what Dubai needed," said Ben Corrigan, one of the survivors of the construction collapse that has plagued this place for a year and led to the news last week that Dubai World, the emirate's development arm, wants to postpone payments on its $59-billion (U.S.) debt for six months.
Some tough economic times "will clean out the cowboys," said Mr. Corrigan, a British interior designer who moved here 12 years ago when things got tough in England.
"Maybe it'll lead to some transparency for a change," said Heather Le Rest, a member of the sailing club, referring to the government's and Dubai World's notorious secrecy. "The people never know what's going on," she said.
Ms. Le Rest's husband, Cedric, manages a marina in Abu Dhabi and commutes 90 minutes daily so the family can live in Dubai. "Life is good here," said Mr. Le Rest, who came from France 10 years ago. "Just let us in on things," said his English wife, who is expecting the couple's third child.
Certainly few people had any inkling of the bombshell the government announced last Wednesday, when it said it was restructuring Dubai World, whose finances have been dragged down by Nakheel, the company's high-flying property development subsidiary. It is Nakheel that is supposed to make a payment of $3.52-billion (U.S.) on Dec. 14.
Typically, the word came at the very end of a statement released late in the day, on the eve of the country's biggest annual holiday.
In the development climate that prevailed in Dubai, accurate information has been a precious commodity.
"It was all a big pyramid scheme," said Chris Waitley, a Canadian surgeon who has been practising here for 10 years. "It had to collapse at some point."
While next-door neighbour Abu Dhabi's wealth rests on oil, and nearby Qatar's on natural gas, Dubai's wealth can be said to be based on hot air.
"Huge new development schemes would just be announced, and they'd take off," said Dr. Waitley, an orthopedic surgeon at a small private hospital. "It got crazy. If you didn't buy some new offering in the morning, it'd be gone in the afternoon. And nothing had even been built," he said.
Mr. Corrigan remembers those days. Over a 12-month period on 2006 and 2007 his design company, Bluehaus, had the contract to outfit Dubai World's corporate offices. "It started out as a contract for four floors of offices," he said. "By the time we finished a year later, the offices had expanded to 10 floors."
The Emir, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, based his vision for Dubai's future on the three principles of real estate: location, location, location. His Dubai, he said, would benefit from being close to the great oil wealth of its federal partner Abu Dhabi, from being a crossroads between East and West, and being in an appealing warm climate.
Arguing that if they built it, people would come, he set about planning the infrastructure and importing the work force to make it run. And he did it all on borrowed money.
It worked, for a time. And it was all based simply on confidence.
But as an editorial Friday in the Abu Dhabi newspaper, The National, observed, "Confidence is a fragile commodity."
We know now that last year's world economic meltdown had a big effect on Dubai. But, true to their practices, Dubai and Dubai World kept up appearances.
On the surface of this sprawling city state, things still look okay today. There are dozens of towering new office buildings, including the world's tallest building, scheduled to open next month; sprawling new hotels, including the world's only seven-star establishment; scores of cranes hovering over projects in progress; grand villas and man-made islands in the shape of palm trees.
The emirate plays host to numerous world-class sporting events. The European Golf Tour's "Road to Dubai" championship was played last weekend on a new Greg Norman-designed course, FIFA's world cup of beach soccer wrapped up the week before.
At the Dubai Mall, the largest of several lavish indoor shopping centres in the city, visitors can skate on an Olympic-sized rink, while hundreds line up to walk through a three-storey aquarium of exotic saltwater fish. (For an additional fee of $200 you can scuba dive through it.)
But look more closely. The half-dozen luxury watch shops in the Dubai Mall are empty, their well-dressed staff looking on sullenly, trying to keep up appearances. Those cranes have remained mostly still for weeks, and the houses around the Greg Norman golf course are mostly empty or unfinished.
An elegant new Metro train rockets through the city, but hardly anyone rides it.
The Dubai Pearl, intended to be the jewel of hotel/office/residential complexes, remains a massive vacant lot long after construction was supposed to have begun.
And Nakheel's most flamboyant project, The World, a cluster of man-made islands that form the map of the world, lies untended four kilometres offshore, its sand islands apparently sliding back into the sea.
At some point in the past decade, Dubai's rulers and Dubai World's executives must have convinced themselves that people will buy anything.
Everything they offered was scooped up within hours, long before it was built.
People bought homes with little or no down payment - why worry, everything's going up in value, lenders must have reasoned. That's when the word "con" became the emphasis in "confident."
When last year's meltdown washed ashore in Dubai, a lot of those over-confident people couldn't make their payments. The value of many properties fell by 50 per cent or more - making them not worth selling, since there was no way the debt could be covered.
In the past year, thousands of these people simply left their debts behind. They walked out of their homes, furniture and all, parked their cars at the airport and flew out of the country, never to return.
In a statement intended to buoy confidence, Sheik Ahmad bin Saeed al Maktoum, the uncle of Dubai's ruler, the chairman of Emirates airline and of Dubai's Supreme Fiscal Committee, said that a decade of growth had laid the foundation for a sustainable economy that looks beyond natural resources.
"The economic fundamentals, such as our highly developed infrastructure, strong transport and communications hub and regional financial centre will ensure Dubai remains an attractive regional market," he said.
Ben Corrigan believes in that vision, as he believes in the dream of the ruler, Sheik Mohammed.
"Sheik Mohammed put Dubai on the map," Mr. Corrigan said.
"I think its future is sound," he added as he pushed the stroller carrying his 14-month old daughter past a line of yachts for sale.

She was half of a formidable acting duo

Author: Martin, Sandra

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/she-was-half-formidable-acting-duo/docview/382608279/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Although both Drainies acted separately, they were formidable as a duo. "There was an almost tangible - which is an odd word for a blind medium like radio - chemistry between them," according to Mr. [John Reeves]. "They drew sparks from each other and were stylistically very apt." They were almost like dancers, intuitively moving in step with each other, with invisible antennae for the other's dramatic intentions.

Full text:   Radio actor, playwright ran a household with six children and remained cheerful and friendly in difficult times
smartin@globeandmail.com
Claire Drainie Taylor had at least three lives and as many husbands in an overflowing life as an actor, writer and homemaker. She flourished in the golden age of radio, from the Second World War to the launch of network television, an era when voice, sound and the spoken word ruled the airways and talented (and sometimes autocratic) drama producers such as Andrew Allan and Esse Ljungh created a national theatre of the air.
Back then, when entertainment choices were limited and the CBC seemed more interested in programming than in chasing ratings and advertising dollars, Canadian talent, including actors such as Ms. Taylor and her husband John Drainie had steady work on school broadcasts, soap operas and original radio dramas produced in the long-running Stage series.
As an actor and a scriptwriter Ms. Taylor, who acted under her first married name, Claire Murray, was mostly self-taught, turning personal experience and an ear for dialogue into radio plays and character parts on stage and in front of the microphone. Among her many roles, she played Ma in Jake and the Kid , Aunt Mary on John and Judy and Ma Parkin on Barney Boomer .
Her best known plays are Santa Had a Black Black Beard and Flow Gently Sweet Limbo , which she co-wrote with Mr. Drainie. The jury is still out on whether her forte was writing or acting.
Writer and performer Don Harron comes down on the writing side, mainly because after half a century he still fondly remembers listening to Santa Had A Black, Black Beard , her play about a Ukrainian watchman who delivers an unusual and unexpected Christmas present. It ran annually on CBC radio for a dozen years beginning in the early 1940s.
Writer and producer John Reeves comes down on the acting side. "She was very good," he said in an interview. When Mr. Reeves was a junior producer learning his trade, back in the early 1950s, he would sit in the control room watching John Drainie as Jake Trumper, Billy Richards as the kid, and Claire Murray as Ma recording episodes of W.O. Mitchell's Jake and the Kid . "They were a wonderful trio."
Although both Drainies acted separately, they were formidable as a duo. "There was an almost tangible - which is an odd word for a blind medium like radio - chemistry between them," according to Mr. Reeves. "They drew sparks from each other and were stylistically very apt." They were almost like dancers, intuitively moving in step with each other, with invisible antennae for the other's dramatic intentions.
Although her range was narrower than her husband's, she was "very appealing" as an actor and when Mr. Reeves began producing his own shows, he cast her often, including as Aunt Edith in his Prix Italia winning play, A Beach of Strangers , in 1959.
Ms. Taylor knew poverty, despair, grief and affluence in a long life, but nothing dimmed her cheerful friendly demeanour, her natural position at the centre of a social gathering, or her essential role as a catalyst in enterprises such as RATS, the radio performers' group, which eventually morphed into ACTRA, and the short-lived Jupiter Theatre, which was founded by Mr. Drainie, Lorne Greene and Len Peterson in 1951. In 1998 she wrote an autobiography, The Surprise of My Life , which was published by the Wilfrid Laurier University Press.
Claire Pearl Wodlinger, the second of Hyman and Rose (nee Epstein) Wodlinger's five children, was born in the middle of the First World War in Swift Current, Saskatchewan. Her father was a lacklustre entrepreneur who always seemed to be on the wrong side on a balanced ledger. In April, 1929, in the flush of precarious buoyancy before the economy fell apart in the Depression, he moved his family to Regina to open a shop called Arctic Fur Salon.
As a teenager, Claire wrote poetry which was occasionally published on the children's page of the Regina Leader Post, and performed on an open mike program on the local radio station.
The crash ruined the fur business in Regina and soon her father, who "had no talent for making money" had decided "there's nothing to keep us here in this godforsaken town any longer." He piled his wife and kids family into his beloved DeSoto, about all he had salvaged from the Arctic Fur Salon, and moved them further west to Vancouver.
No matter how lean the budget, Claire loved to party; fun times swirled around her like a crinoline. Vivacious rather than beautiful, cozy rather than sultry, she never lacked for suitors. When she was 16 she began a romance with Jack Harrison Murray, eleven years her senior, and a friend of her father's younger brother. They eloped on April 14, 1934.
After losing his job stacking wood and bagging coal for a small fuel company, Mr. Murray found work in a logging camp on Vancouver Island. Her first home as a bride was an isolated shack where she fended off bears, learned to hunt, and scraped together a lonely subsistence while her husband worked in the bush to make enough of a stake to take them back to Vancouver. A "stocky, ugly, and darkly grizzled" night watchman named Sam Yagoda befriended her and became the inspiration years later for Santa Had a Black, Black Beard .
Finally back in Vancouver in 1938, the couple was invited to watch a rehearsal of Hotel Universe by Philip Barry at the newly formed Vancouver Community Playhouse. John Drainie was one of the leading men. He rushed in "late, limping and apologetic, in a tweed coat (too long), a fedora hat (too wide)" and changed her life. "He'll be the father of my children," she thought to herself. And so it came to be.
By the time the Murrays were divorced in May, 1940, Claire and John were both working at the VCP, he as business and box office manager and she as an actor, after getting her start as assistant to the backstage manager. Her first leading role was Edith in a production of Claire Boothe Luce's The Women .
There was a dynamism between Ms. Murray and Mr. Drainie that soon mushroomed into a love affair. Mr. Drainie, the "greatest radio actor in the world," according to Orson Welles, had a voice that drew listeners into a visual world of their own imagining in the wonderfully collaborative medium of radio. He desperately wanted her to act with him and spent hours training her voice and teaching her to appreciate music.
"Hauling in his enormous collection of 78s, he would point out phrasing, intervals, tone and rhythm, everything that made up a composer's distinctive voice," according to their eldest daughter, journalist Bronwyn Drainie, in Living the Part: John Drainie and the Dilemma of Canadian Stardom , her biography of her father. "This would all be done with him simultaneously singing and conducting as the tinny strains filled the room."
Before they wed on April 11, 1942, Mr. Drainie laid down one marriage-busting condition: "If you run around with other men, cook inedible meals, turn the house into a pigsty, I don't care. But if you give me children who have your sense of rhythm, I'll divorce you on the spot." Mr. Drainie's tongue was sharp, but his heart was soft and the family eventually encompassed six children.
The Drainies moved from Vancouver to Toronto in 1943 where he worked as an announcer for CBC radio, under Lorne Greene, and she acted in character roles, bit parts and government sponsored soap operas in support of the war effort. That same year the Drainies' Vancouver friend, Andrew Allen, became head of CBC radio drama.
Under this artistic regime, Mr. Drainie quit his tedious job as a staff announcer and flourished as a freelance actor. Besides Jake in Jake and the Kid , he played Stephen Leacock in an adaptation of his Sunshine Sketches and other works, and the Joseph McCarthy-like character in The Investigator , a satire by Reuben Ship, a Montreal-born writer who had been deported from the United States as a suspected Communist.
The Investigator was aired on Stage on May 30, 1954, smack in the middle of the Army-McCarthy hearings, which were being broadcast daily on American television. Quickly circulated in bootleg editions south of the border, it made Mr. Drainie "the most famous of anonymous voices," according to Mavor Moore, the late cultural maven.
Television was not Mr. Drainie's friend mainly because he could not disguise the limp that had dogged him since he had been hit by a car as a boy in Vancouver. Instead of romantic leads he had to play character roles, which he did superbly, including Matthew Cuthbert in Anne of Green Gables , but he was frustrated by a lack of opportunities here and yet unwilling to leave Canada permanently.
Quick to shout, fond of a drink or three, he was not an easy man to love and cherish for better or worse. But his wife gave as good as she got, managing the precarious family finances, maintaining the chaotic household - with six children, somebody was invariably in tears, temper or trouble - and entertaining his pals and their huge circle of actors, writers and producers.
In 1964 he became co-host with Laurier Lapierre of This Hour Has Seven Days , the controversial weekly newsmagazine on CBC television. A year later he had to leave the show because he was dying of cancer. A trooper to the end, he spent two days in late October, 1966, filming an interview in his living room for Telescope , produced by Fletcher Markle and directed by Lister Sinclair. Afterwards actor Barry Morse helped carry him up the stairs to bed. He died just before dawn the next morning, aged 50.
His widow, who was only 49, had young children, heavy debts and a couple of real estate ventures to rent and manage. Trying to make ends meet was a frustrating and exhausting business. Not long after Mr. Drainie died, she met Nathan (Nat) Taylor, a film exhibitor who pioneered the idea of dual and triple cinemas in the same locations and founded Cineplex, including the 18-screen complex in the Toronto Eaton Centre. They married in 1968 and lived happily and easily together until his death in 2004.
CLAIRE DRAINIE TAYLOR
Claire Taylor was born in Swift Current, Saskatchewan on Sept. 11, 1917. She died, aged 92, in Toronto on Nov. 18, 2009 of complications from emphysema. Ms. Taylor leaves six children, seven grandchildren, two siblings and her extended family.

RANCHER REVIVAL

Author: Hadani Ditmars

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/rancher-revival/docview/382607678/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: There is a sense of procession as one walks from the entrance, through the atrium to the master bedroom - by way of a kind of "light bridge" - a narrow walkway covered by a skylight and flanked by fir paned glazing on both sides that literally opens up (shoji style) to Zen landscaping and water features. The master suite itself looks out on the pool and surrounding fir trees and boasts an actual dressing room (an opportune perch for a languid smoke and one of those aforementioned martinis).

Full text:   The classic postwar housing style is experiencing a renaissance, nowhere more so than in a striking modern take in West Vancouver's British Properties
The rancher - that archetypal housing type that came of age in post-Second World War, West Coast America - has enjoyed a mini renaissance of late in one of its early epicentres - Palm Springs, Calif. But the single-storey, open-plan house with an indoor/outdoor aesthetic is on the edge of a comeback in Vancouver.
Ranchers - typically built on large lots - find their natural habitat in Vancouver's semi-rural Southlands, and in the British Properties, the posh enclave in mountainous West Vancouver.
The British Properties, originally owned by the Guinness family, has gone through a sea change since its origins in the 1950s, when covenant clauses excluding Jews, blacks and Asians were the norm, and since the local property owners' newsletter was called the Tallyho.
Residents these days are just as likely to speak farsi or Mandarin as they are to be members of Masonic lodges, and West Vancouver's first ever synagogue - the Har-El - stands proudly opposite the entrance to the British Properties.
But happily, after a bad patch of eighties and nineties monster homes, some traditions - at least architectural ones - are being revisited. For all its Anglo heritage, the British Properties - and West Vancouver in general - were once hotbeds of mid-century modernism, with residential gems by Erickson and Thom abounding. This was partly due to more relaxed planning laws and less restrictive bylaws than in the city of Vancouver (just try and build anything modern in say, tony Shaughnessy, where architects must bow deep at the heritage altar) and it's still true today.
Just off Rabbit Lane, at the edge of the Capilano Golf Club, the rancher has been stylishly revived in a gorgeous Trevor Euley-designed home by Ed Kolic of Eighth Avenue Development. When a lot went on the market two years ago in the flat, former flood plain, rancher-rich area, Kolic (who once worked with Arthur Erickson on a Fairview Slopes residential project) saw an opportunity for a contemporary take on the fifties and sixties classic.
Like that other recently revived retro-hit - the Vancouver Special (essentially a modernist stucco box with a balcony), the ranch house, with its single-level open plan, is an extremely flexible and intrinsically modern space. Kolic likens it to a "penthouse on the ground" and notes that it's a favourite with empty nesters who find condos too soulless but don't want to deal with stairs and enjoy the convenience of one-storey living.
If the house at 389 Moyne Dr. is any indication, the rancher could well enjoy a contemporary comeback to rival that of the Special.
Situated next to and across the street from traditional mid-century ranchers, the Euley-designed home fits right into the neighbourhood. But the 6,500-square-foot new craftsman revival it faces - a cautionary tale about the dangers of heritage literalism - appears boxed into its lot. With the main living area under 3,500 square feet, this rancher has an attractively small footprint.
From the outside, 389 Moyne Dr. is handsome but modest and unassuming, and its long, low rooflines, large windows and stucco exteriors appear typical of the rancher style. But once inside, it's a drop-dead looker. While simplicity and openness are key, the design details and nuances employed by Euley give it depth and sophistication. The overall effect is a 2009 take on what could have been a mid-century model of Better Homes and Gardens-style gracious living. It's easy to imagine a Mad Men executive's wife welcoming you with a dry martini.
The U-shaped design is a study in symmetry, with a main open-plan living area offset by east-facing bedrooms and west-facing utility rooms. A simple palette of warm limestone-colour porcelain tile - repeated on floors and ceilings - sandstone, fir window paning and walnut millwork creates a streamlined and inviting interior.
Nine-foot ceilings at the entrance way and in the two front-facing rooms give way to a dramatic 18-foot atrium at the centre of the house. Everywhere skylights (great for passive solar heating) and extensive low-paned glazing - often only a few inches from the ground - let the outside in.
There is a sense of procession as one walks from the entrance, through the atrium to the master bedroom - by way of a kind of "light bridge" - a narrow walkway covered by a skylight and flanked by fir paned glazing on both sides that literally opens up (shoji style) to Zen landscaping and water features. The master suite itself looks out on the pool and surrounding fir trees and boasts an actual dressing room (an opportune perch for a languid smoke and one of those aforementioned martinis). The master bath is notable for its cylindrical light fixtures (by Systemalux) and its unusual fleur de lys pewter and silver-tinged porcelain wall tiles, a nostalgic seventies reference coolly contemporized (back then it would have been velvet wallpaper.)
When you look back from the master bedroom to the front entrance there is a satisfying sense of a clear horizontal line and an intrinsic indoor/outdoor connection. Similarly the kitchen (designed especially by Young Meyerberg), with its engineered walnut millwork, neat pull-out drawers and sleek Caesar Stone countertops - is all about horizontal lines. Lit by mid-century-inspired hand-crafted Murano glass lights with transparent amber cylindrical shades, the kitchen literally opens - with the help of a five-panel folding door system - onto the pool and patio. In the generous outdoor space, a handsome brick courtyard is offset by an ever-so-West Coast overhead cedar lattice and a dramatic fire pit.
West of the kitchen, a "great room" is anchored by a sandstone hearth, and the adjacent dining area punctuated by a skylight offering illumination and views of towering fir trees. Despite the open plan, to Euley's credit, each area is delineated by thoughtful design details. Fir-trimmed valances offer a sense of depth and texture throughout. And nostalgic flourishes - like the glass sidelight inserts on bedroom doors (actually glass pieces cast on sand, to pick up its irregular grain) are delightfully current.
As smooth as vermouth, this rancher pays homage to its roots, while remaining open to a stylish new future.

Full text:   Teresa is a busy wife and mother but, at every available opportunity, she escapes into a fantasy world. You see, Teresa is a romance writer, and her active imagination is helping her write her third novel.
But Teresa had a real-life problem. She lacked an inspiring place in which she could compose her novels. She spent most of her free time writing in a local coffee shop, but she really wanted a space at home in which she could write as well as gather with fellow writers to work out ideas, celebrate victories and commiserate over rejection letters.
She had an empty living/dining room in her large, suburban home that suited the purpose perfectly, but the cold, blank slate of a room lacked passion - and furniture. So I decided to bring in my team and transform the space into a sophisticated and romantic writing retreat for Teresa.
The space had great bones - high ceilings, Palladian windows, crown mouldings and hardwood floors - but was missing the "wow" factor. To help achieve this, I infused the room with a bit of colour. I put up silvery, floral-patterned wallpaper in most of the space and painted the rest in a serene shade of cream.
Then, because the space was originally fashioned as two rooms and had columns that separated the two areas, I decided to divide the room into two functional spaces - a writer's retreat and a meeting area.
In the writer's retreat, I installed a new desk that blends function and fancy. The piece is a combination desk and bookcase done in a light cream with a beautiful dark wood work surface. I also added a great writer's chair in a soft green that will be the perfect spot for Teresa to create masterpiece after masterpiece.
I worked in a little seating area for Teresa and her friends, which includes an L-shaped sectional in subtle linen and a gorgeous gas fireplace that is surrounded with stone and has a stunning mirror above.
I hung soft, gauzy sheers with gold satin trim that diffuse light through the large windows at the front of the room. I then put the same sheers up to separate the writing space from the meeting space.
In the meeting area, I put in a lovely wooden table where the romance writers can gather (and maybe Teresa's family for the occasional meal) and chairs in a green patterned fabric and velvet. Along the back wall I put in a beautiful hutch that is backed with a mirror, which serves to reflect the windows and detailing in the writer's area.
Lighting is always a really effective way to add ambience to a space. So I put two antique silver and crystal sconces above the fireplace and installed an elegant silver and gold gilded crystal chandelier above the sectional. Above the table in the meeting room I put in another shimmery fixture that acts as a companion piece to the larger chandelier.
After adding some final romantic details - area rugs, vases, pictures and some books (Teresa's of course) - the redesign was complete.
This large, empty space was crying out for a happy ending. So I gave it a dreamy makeover full of traditional details, cool colours and feminine inspirations. Now it's the perfect blend of fantasy and reality - and is definitely No. 1 on this year's "best rooms" list. Now that's divine!

Abstract: "There's nothing built like this in this neighbourhood," says Mr. [Andrew Zimet]. "[People] like the idea that it's a condominium and it's fairly carefree. Yet, you can walk straight in [to your unit] from the street and you don't have to share an elevator or corridor with other people."

Full text:   Annex Loft Houses
Location: Seaton Village
Developers: Dewbourne Developments and Grand
Metropolitan
Size: 697 to 1,677 square feet
Price: $329,000 to $699,000
Sales centre: 483 Dupont St., west of Bathurst Street. Open weekends from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.; or by appointment
Contact: Phone 416-925-9191 or visit www.annexlofthouses.com
The area around Dupont and Bathurst streets is mainly composed of semi-detached houses, which leaves first-time buyers with few housing options within their budgets, says Andrew Zimet, a broker for Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd.
But that will change with the recent debut of the Annex Loft Houses where the average unit will be a 1,371-square-foot townhouse priced for $579,000.
"It's the same price people might pay downtown for a small condo," says Mr. Zimet, who is overseeing sales for the infill project, which was conceived by Paradigm Architecture and Design. "It's a highly unusual opportunity [for first-time buyers]."
Situated close to the Annex, on Dupont Street just west of Bathurst, the glass, brick and concrete building will contain eight two-storey suites and 16 three-storey townhouses with street-level access.
"There's nothing built like this in this neighbourhood," says Mr. Zimet. "[People] like the idea that it's a condominium and it's fairly carefree. Yet, you can walk straight in [to your unit] from the street and you don't have to share an elevator or corridor with other people."
The length of the building will consist of two rows of three-storey townhouses placed back to back. Each unit will have an entrance off a private mews and windows facing either east or west, as well as two balconies and a private rooftop terrace.
"Each floor is 11-feet high so by the time you go from the ground up to the roof, you're up 40 feet," says Mr. Zimet. "You have a good clear view of the city lights of downtown Toronto."
The bulk of these units will be laid out with an open principal room and kitchen on the ground floor; a guest bedroom, bathroom and laundry room on the second level; a third-floor master suite with a private bathroom; and storage on the landing to the rooftop terrace.
The two-storey suites will be located across the width of the building facing Dupont.
Some of these units will be ground-floor studios with upper mezzanines overlooking the principal rooms on the main floor. Meanwhile, the upper level units - accessed from a lobby - will contain an enclosed bedroom, two balconies and a rooftop deck.
Matthew Davis of The Design Agency - one of three principals who also host HGTV's Designer Guys series - will give the interiors a streamlined appearance using European-style kitchens and Fuse wood floors from Floorworks.
"He has a very trendy look, yet, it's very modest and simple," says Mr. Zimet.
For $24,000, buyers can purchase parking in the underground garage. "There are five different ways to get up and down from the garage," adds Mr. Zimet.
However, residents can easily walk to a handful of local restaurants and shops, including a Shoppers Drug Mart and LCBO, in addition to amenities along Bloor Street, such as cafes, movie theatre and subway.
As for monthly fees, they will range from $225 to $299, depending on the model.
Occupancy is slated for May, 2011.

Full text:   News of financial trouble at Dubai World might put Palm Jumeirah - the man-made, palm-shaped-island development - in peril
Levent Hassan knows all about the financial challenges facing Dubai.
Mr. Hassan is a real estate agent who buys and sells properties on Palm Jumeirah, the man-made, palm-tree-shaped island where celebrities like David Beckham and Brad Pitt have bought luxury homes.
When villas on the island first went up for sale in 2002 they were snapped up and prices for some soared well above $10-million (U.S.).
Not any more.
"In some places, prices have been reduced by at least 50 per cent or 60 per cent and in some places more," Mr. Hassan said yesterday from Dubai.
Things had been picking up in the last couple of months, but news of financial problems at Dubai World , which owns the developer of Palm Jumeirah, could put the project in peril.
The developer, called Nakheel, has $3.5-billion worth of debt coming due next month and some analysts question whether it will be able to meet the commitment.
The problems at Nakheel have forced Dubai World, a holding company with dozens of international investments, to seek a standstill agreement from creditors who are owed roughly $60-billion.
For months, analysts have watched as the recession hit Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates.
There have long been fears the glitzy city-state overextended itself with a wave of gigantic projects, many of which have now been stopped in mid-construction.
Perhaps nothing epitomizes Dubai's excess like Palm Jumeirah.
When construction began in 2001, the project was the largest land reclamation venture ever, involving close to 100 million cubic metres of sand and seven million tonnes of rock.
The development was supposed to be finished in 2005 but it is still not done. When it is complete, about two million people will live on the island's 16 palm fronds and along the 11-kilometre surrounding crescent.
Nakheel is working on two other palm-tree-shaped islands nearby and another island project shaped like the globe.
Some villas on Palm Jumeirah include two swimming pools, and penthouse apartments cover up to 14,000 square feet. There are also plans for 220 high-end shops and several luxury hotels, including the five-star Ottoman Palace by Rixos, which will feature the world's largest Turkish bath.
Last year, the island saw the opening of the $1.5-billion Atlantis resort, with 1,500 rooms and a giant shark tank. The opening celebrations cost $20-million.
By early 2009, the project started running into difficulty. After years of soaring house prices and eager buyers, the market cooled.
In February, PowerHouse Properties, a local company that tracks the Dubai real estate market, said prices on Palm Jumeirah had dropped by half or more in six months.
Four bedroom homes that went for $4-million could be had for $1.6-million, the company said.
Prices have fallen further since, and distressed listings have escalated.
The owner of an 1,800-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment recently almost begged for a buyer -"distressed sale, very urgent" - offering the unit for $400,000.
Mr. Hassan hopes the problems at Dubai World won't have an impact on buyers. "People need to sell and people need to rent," he said. Dubai World's problems "are not going to stop that."

Ex-Lightning co-owner subject to probe

Abstract: [Gary Bettman] orchestrated the buyout plan after [Oren Koules] and [Len Barrie] told the commissioner last June their relationship deteriorated so badly it could not be repaired. The commissioner came up with a sort of double-barrelled shotgun buyout that gave Barrie the first shot. He was given until late September to try to buy out Koules. If he failed, Koules was to get until Nov. 23 to complete his own buyout.

Full text:   Canada Revenue Agency looking into handling of finances at Barrie's Victoria development
Len Barrie is still listed in the Tampa Bay Lightning's media guide as a co-owner of the NHL team, but those close to the team say he is out of the picture.
His financial problems with the Bear Mountain golf resort and housing development near Victoria were severe enough to scuttle his attempt to buy out fellow owner Oren Koules in late summer. Now it appears as if the problems will worsen.
In the wake of a damning report by the company's former auditor that accused management at Bear Mountain of misappropriating funds, a source said Canada Revenue Agency is looking into the development's finances.
Barrie, who was accused in the report and by a member of the development's executive committee of improperly financing at least part of his share of the Lightning with Bear Mountain funds, did not respond to a request for comment.
Bear Mountain is limping along with some housing sales, although at least one condominium project was halted and a large financing deal has not materialized. Barrie had said an agreement with Siraj Capital, a company based in Dubai, was to inject $350-million (all currency U.S.) into the development by October, but it has not come to fruition.
Barrie had tried to get Anthony Sansone Jr., a St. Louis real-estate developer, to be his partner in buying out Koules. But that, too, did not pan out and Barrie informed NHL commissioner Gary Bettman he was pulling out of the process.
Sansone has told the local media in Tampa he is still interested in the team. How that will work out with Koules remains to be seen.
Bettman orchestrated the buyout plan after Koules and Barrie told the commissioner last June their relationship deteriorated so badly it could not be repaired. The commissioner came up with a sort of double-barrelled shotgun buyout that gave Barrie the first shot. He was given until late September to try to buy out Koules. If he failed, Koules was to get until Nov. 23 to complete his own buyout.
Koules tried to make a deal with Miami real-estate mogul Jeff Greene, but he declined. Koules has also explored going it alone with the support of the Lightning's former owner, Palace Sports and Entertainment, which has about $100-million in loans tied up in the franchise.
People close to the Lightning think Barrie may resurface looking for some cash if Koules completes a buyout. However, there will be a lineup of creditors, including a large group of current and former NHL players who invested in Bear Mountain, eager to part the cash from Barrie.

Another Coyotes bid. Page 7
All is quiet on the buyout front, although that does not seem to bother Bettman. He told reporters recently that Koules is no longer subject to a deadline and he is satisfied with the team's situation.
On the ice, the Lightning's record is up from last season, but ticket sales are down. However, the team is still bumping along and paying its bills, which keeps it from being one of Bettman's bigger headaches. For now.
"We're seeing our way through the darkest period," said Koules, who moved to Tampa this year to take charge of an operation stripped down to save on expenses. He is running the business operations of the Lightning, serving as governor, president and man in charge of everything outside the purview of general manager Brian Lawton, who looks after the hockey side of things.
Even though the Lightning have stayed in playoff contenion this season, holding eighth place in the Eastern Conference with a 9-5-7 record, attendance is down at St. Pete Times Forum from last season's disastrous campaign in which the Bolts finished second last overall. After nine home games this season, the average crowd is 14,605, down almost 1,900 from last season and 24th among the NHL's 30 teams.
Koules is getting by because the Lightning qualified for a $15-million revenue-sharing payment this year. An NHL source said the team is meeting its obligations and the league has been assured it will continue to do so. But unless ticket sales increase dramatically, he is going to need an investor at some point.
On the plus side, Koules said sponsorship sales are up from last season. He would not give a revenue number but said sales have exceeded last season's totals by 10 per cent.
"It's a different world down here," Koules said, and then invoked his team's next opponent, the Toronto Maple Leafs, who pay a visit tonight. "It's not like you can open the door and you haven't won in 37 years or whatever and still sell out."
On the ice, things are similarly good and bad. Thanks in part to the development of centre Steve Stamkos, the No. 1 overall draft pick from two years ago, who has 15 goals in 21 games, and this year's No. 2 overall pick, defenceman Viktor Hedman, the Lightning are staying in the playoff picture despite the indifferent play of star Vincent Lecavalier. His future with the team remains the subject of speculation.
So does the Lightning's ability to survive without the arrival of a major investor. A source in the banking community said Koules is keeping his bankers satisfied, but if he is using his own money to keep the team going, sooner or later he will need a partner or two.

Abstract: The most significant concern for women was riding out the economy, up nearly 18 points to 59.6 on its 1-to-100 scale (which goes from "not at all concerned" to "very concerned"). Leading "an active and healthy lifestyle" rose 15 points and having "reliable, trustworthy professional advice" jumped 11.2 points.

Full text:   Everyone knows the old cliché about men and women being from different planets, one of the reasons special effects-laden action movies coexist quite happily with romantic comedies at the local multiplex. But what about when it comes to investing: Is it true that men are the macho risk-takers while women tend to play it safe while worrying about their investments and having enough to retire on?
Sadly, the generalizations appear to be true.
"Women define financial success somewhat different than men," said TD Waterhouse senior vice-president Patricia Lovett-Reid. "Women are very practical when it comes to their finances."
The firm's annual investor poll of women, released earlier this month, found that they are more confident financially even in the face of the recession and market downturn, with 62 per cent characterizing themselves as "financially successful," up from 58 per cent the prior year. It was not sports cars or vacation homes they considered symbols of success (just 20 per cent cited those frills) but rather the ability to pay bills on time, to be debt-free and to have enough money for a comfortable retirement.
The survey did not compare the attitudes of men and women, who TD Waterhouse found tend to be sandwiched by the practicalities of raising children and supporting aging parents.
"Men typically will view their portfolio as a stream that can be replenished: 'If I lose money it is okay, I can go and make more,' " explained Ms. Lovett-Reid. It's a strategy that not only can carry more risk, but also eat into overall investment returns. "They tend to be more active in terms of their trading activities and that will compromise their returns just by virtue of the trading costs alone."
In households where spouses direct their own personal portfolios, investment styles could have resulted in very different market performance over the roller-coaster ride investors have taken in the past year or so.
"Certainly the ones who had the more conservative portfolios didn't get hit as hard, but then again some of those more conservative portfolios haven't had the same rebound that some of the more aggressive ones have had," said Wade Walters, a Vancouver-based certified financial planner with W.H. Stuart & Associates who has found the sexes have different risk tolerances. "Men are definitely more willing to take risk, no doubt about that. Women tend to be more conservative."
The Mars-Venus divide certainly exists in the Toronto home of Cam and Larissa. A supervisor in the food industry, Cam says he is making up for lost financial time from years when he ran his own business and did not focus as much on his retirement.
"I have had to be pretty aggressive," he says. His self-directed retirement portfolio is decidedly pugnacious: He is invested only in equities, choosing not to balancing them out with "safe" holdings such as bonds and other fixed-income assets. And he is using leverage - borrowing to make those investments.
The strategy is paying off handsomely so far, mainly because he didn't take the portfolio haircut that most investors did last year and patiently waited for what he thought was the right time to get back in. He converted his investments to cash before the market downturn and jumped back into stocks mainly through index-tracking exchange traded funds (ETFs), real estate income trust (REIT) funds as well as emerging market ETFs this March when he decided that the market had bottomed out.
"I guess I timed things right," said Cam, who is 45 and estimates his equity holdings are up about 30 per cent. "Though I'm shouldering a lot more risk, the rewards are certainly worth it."
His wife is intrigued by the strategy but has yet to follow his lead.
"I think maybe if I had more money to play around with I might be a little more aggressive," said Larissa. "He is showing me how his investments are gaining ground and how he is in control of it rather than having a mutual fund manager doing the work for you and getting paid on top of that."
A government employee, much of her retirement savings are locked up in OMERS, the pension fund for Ontario municipal employees. The 38-year-old also has a pre-marriage mutual fund and co-owns a piece of real estate with a family member that she considers the education fund for the kids. She likens the landholding to how her parents bought Canada savings bonds to pay for her university costs, and she still has a soft spot for the safe but low-yield bonds. "I say, 'Maybe we should put some money in bonds. It's safe,' and Cam always says, 'You don't make much money on them.'
"I'm kind of boring I guess," she concluded when thinking about her investments.
But just in case men start feeling superior about any real or imagined investing prowess, however, Mr. Walters, the B.C. financial planner, has some cold reality to throw on those notions. Men, it seems, have a one-track mind. "Women are more interested in financial planning. Men are more interested in investing," he said.
"[Men] don't want necessarily to go through the process of doing a financial plan or even a retirement plan, they just want to invest," said Mr. Walters. "I guess it goes back to the never-asking-for-directions kind of thing.
"Women definitely will ask for directions. And women tend to follow them better than men as well."

WHAT WOMEN WANT
In a word, security.
While one financial firm found women more financially secure than they were a year ago, another said female users of its online financial calculator are increasingly worried about riding out the current economy and turbulent markets.
The online results from Russell Investments Canada Ltd. for the third quarter of this year do not necessarily contradict TD Waterhouse's more upbeat data, as the women were drawn from different samples.
Russell found that women who used its financial calculator "were more likely to be single, widowed or divorced" than in the prior three months, said Kathleen Wylie, a senior researcher with the firm.
The most significant concern for women was riding out the economy, up nearly 18 points to 59.6 on its 1-to-100 scale (which goes from "not at all concerned" to "very concerned"). Leading "an active and healthy lifestyle" rose 15 points and having "reliable, trustworthy professional advice" jumped 11.2 points.
Men, by contrast, did not change their financial outlooks that much over the past two quarters.
"The biggest difference (between the sexes) is having a tangible financial plan," noted Ms. Wylie. Women scored 69.3 on this measure versus 58 for men, "which is pretty significant," she said.

The litte airline that could

Author: Jang, Brent

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/litte-airline-that-could/docview/382595858/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: [Porter] had just two planes when it launched in October of that year. Critics pointed to the company's oft-empty shuttle bus as evidence that the new flier's strategy made no business sense. Meanwhile, the airline feuded publicly with Toronto Mayor David Miller over the TPA's plan to build a bridge to the island airport. Porter lost, but in 2005 Ottawa paid Mr. Deluce's Regco Holdings Inc. $20-million to settle legal claims.

Full text:   PORTER was supposed to flop. But chief executive officer ROBERT DELUCE has beaten back cutthroat competition, hostile locals and political foes to pose a serious threat to the big airlines in his market niche. Reporter BRENT JANG tells the story of an entrepreneur from Timmins, Ont., who plans to build on his success in Toronto with a move to the West
TRANSPORTATION REPORTER
With a hard hat, safety vest and steel-toed shoes setting off his elegant suit, Robert Deluce surveys the battle scene with satisfaction.
It's only a vast expanse of concrete floor right now, but it will soon be the new terminal of Canada's fastest-growing airport. And it is here, at Toronto City Centre Airport, that Mr. Deluce, the chief executive officer of Porter Airlines Inc., plans to triumph doing exactly what has felled many a small airline - competing head-on with Air Canada.
Although Porter is tiny compared to its rival, Mr. Deluce, 59, has one particularly sharp stone in his sling. He's fighting the dominant player in Canada's skies with a little monopoly of his own, courtesy of the Toronto Port Authority.
The fight will intensify over the next year, both on the tarmac and in court. Air Canada's Halifax-based offshoot, Jazz Air, will likely start flying from the island airport itself in 2010, albeit at Mr. Deluce's indulgence.
Next year is also when a federal court is likely to move on a long-simmering complaint filed by Jazz that it was unilaterally voted off the island by Porter in 2006.
But the stakes are not limited to Toronto for either Air Canada or Porter, a short-haul specialist. In the barely three years since it ran its first flight from Toronto to Ottawa, privately owned Porter has evolved from a local curiosity to a success, adding destinations along the way. It overtook WestJet as the No. 2 carrier in the crucial battleground of the Toronto-Montreal-Ottawa triangle this spring.
In the coming months, it plans to encroach further on the turf of the two biggest Canadian airlines, adding flights between Thunder Bay and Winnipeg, as well as more American destinations. And if that goes well, Porter could eventually push all the way to B.C.
Mr. Deluce has gotten this far by innovating in an embattled sector whose history is littered with the corpses of companies that challenged Air Canada. Now, as the island airport expands and Mr. Deluce plots his moves for the West, he stands to realize his lifelong ambition to be a national player in the skies.
'Little guy from Timmins'
For a man who mingles with the Bay Street elite, Mr. Deluce does an impressive job of playing outsider, the northerner who's challenging an entrenched old-guard colossus.
"He's the little guy from Timmins, Ontario. He's got that folksy Jean Chretien way about him," says Rick Erickson, a Calgary-based aviation consultant.
Mr. Deluce comes from a family with deep roots in aviation and some history with Air Canada. Growing up in Northern Ontario, Mr. Deluce and his six brothers all obtained their pilot's licences as teenagers. Their father, Stanley, who had been a fighter pilot in the Second World War, ran a charter carrier.
The island airport has been on Mr. Deluce's mind since his high-school years, when he was sent to board at St. Michael's College in Toronto. He remembers skipping out of class early some Friday afternoons in 1966 to take flying lessons at the harbour airport. Back then, he recalls, the stately Royal York Hotel, all 28 storeys of it, dominated the Toronto skyline.
Even then, Mr. Deluce recognized the potential in the airport's location - so close to the action of downtown, where a cluster of office skyscrapers was emerging.
Over the years, the Deluce family added regional carriers Austin Airways and Air Ontario to their holdings. The family sold part of their stakes in those carriers to Air Canada in the late 1980s, and unloaded their remaining interests in the early 1990s.
In 1999, Mr. Deluce led a group that unsuccessfully tried to acquire the regional operations of Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International Ltd. While Mr. Deluce's ambition was thwarted, the defeat set him on the long journey to found Porter.
Porter watchers say they aren't fooled by Mr. Deluce's polite manner and outsider act.
"He is deliberately self-deprecating to conceal a sharp mind well-attuned to influencing others," says Douglas Reid, a Queen's University business professor and former port authority director. "He naturally attracts support because he's the northerner, the outsider, the striver - even though he's at core an insider in Corporate Canada."
Porter's board includes Senator Pamela Wallin; David Wilkins, who formerly served as U.S. ambassador to Canada; and Jacques Demers, a high-ranking corporate lawyer who heads up a key investment unit of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, one of the country's largest pension funds.
Porter's shareholders include some of the smartest money on Bay Street: OMERS' Borealis Infrastructure Management Inc. (which holds 21.4 per cent of the shares), EdgeStone Capital Partners (18.3 per cent), GE Asset Management Inc. (14.6 per cent) and Dancap Private Equity Inc. (3.1 per cent).
But the largest block of shares, 42.6 per cent, is held by Regco Capital Corp., the vehicle of a group of investors led by Mr. Deluce, veteran Bay Street money manager Ira Gluskin and Donald Carty, Porter's chairman, with whom Air Canada clashed frequently when he was CEO of American Airlines Inc. and Canadian Pacific Airlines.
Samuel Duboc, founder and president of EdgeStone, was a key convert to the Porter concept. "We were the first investor in," says Mr. Duboc, a frequent flier and Porter director. "The first thing that attracted us was Bob."
Mr. Deluce has a tenacious streak that shouldn't be underestimated, Mr. Duboc adds. Neither a losing battle to construct a bridge to the airport nor the onset of the recession have fazed him. In the fall of 2008, Porter's traffic out of New York collapsed. "Lawyers, business people and accountants quit flying for a while, but Bob Deluce stayed very true to his expansion strategy," Mr. Duboc says.
Porter's backers realized early on that there was an opening in the market after Air Canada emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004. Frequent fliers in Toronto were ready for a spruced-up flying experience, not to mention savings in cab fares: A taxi ride to Pearson International Airport from the heart of Toronto's business district typically costs around $50, compared with $10 to the ferry terminal that serves the island airport.
It was a natural step for Mr. Deluce to tap the frustrations of the corporate crowd. His personal life is interwoven with that of his key customers. His wife, Catherine, founded Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd. in 1990, a leader in the carriage trade in both Toronto and the cottage haven of Muskoka. The couple make the social rounds whenever their schedules permit, and on these occasions, Mr. Deluce is ever the Porter ambassador. Two of the Deluces' sons work at Porter: Michael is executive vice-president and chief commercial officer, while Jason works in IT.
The right connection
Air Canada and Jazz can be forgiven for regarding Mr. Deluce as a pest - Porter's mascot, after all, is a cartoon of a raccoon, a cunning trouble maker in Toronto neighbourhoods, even the tonier ones.
Mr. Deluce knew that to compete against Jazz, he needed to distinguish Porter's customer service. Porter's flight attendants wear pillbox hats, a throwback to the 1960s - part of the carrier's hearkening back to a time when flying meant glamour, not hassle.
Where mainstream carriers around the world have divided customers into business and economy classes, creating a reliance on executive passengers that they've come to regret during the recession, the Porter style is positioned between the two. All customers get the same "premium economy" treatment, including perks such as free sandwiches, beer and wine on flights and access to the lounge at the island airport, with complimentary coffee, biscotti and WiFi access.
Those little frills help Porter stand out in an airline sector that is retrenching and devises new fees that irk consumers. But it is only a small part of the strategy. Mr. Deluce got his other advantage - a preferred position at the Toronto island airport - by discerning how his interests aligned with those of the Toronto Port Authority, a federal agency.
A few years ago, with Toronto's port receiving little shipping traffic, the TPA sought to revive its fortunes and generate revenue by expanding the airport, which was seeing only light use by Jazz.
The fusing of the ambitions of the TPA and Porter inflamed what has long been a sore spot in Toronto. Two generations of left-leaning municipal politicians have tried to protect the island, an idyllic adjunct to the metropolis, from overdevelopment.
For Mr. Deluce, it was essential that Porter overcome that opposition by cozying up to the TPA, since it allocates "slots" - takeoffs and landings - at the island airport. In 2006, the TPA moved to grant the first 120 slots to Porter.
Porter had just two planes when it launched in October of that year. Critics pointed to the company's oft-empty shuttle bus as evidence that the new flier's strategy made no business sense. Meanwhile, the airline feuded publicly with Toronto Mayor David Miller over the TPA's plan to build a bridge to the island airport. Porter lost, but in 2005 Ottawa paid Mr. Deluce's Regco Holdings Inc. $20-million to settle legal claims. (Porter passengers shuttle back and forth on a short ferry ride.)
Thanks to its strategy and downtown monopoly, Porter wooed away customers from Air Canada, Jazz and WestJet Airlines Ltd. The fleet has grown to 17 aircraft, with one more on the way next month and another two by next April. "We would not have ordered 20 aircraft had there not been the availability of those slots," Mr. Deluce says.
Porter's network now has 11 cities - eight in Canada and three in the United States, with Myrtle Beach, S.C., to be added in February. The company's staff has grown to 850, Mr. Miller is leaving as mayor next year, and the bridge fracas is a memory.
The landlord/tenant
With the political ruckus over the airport having subsided, Mr. Deluce is entering the next round of the battle of Toronto Island. This is about business, and Mr. Deluce has an advantage: He's the landlord.
In 2005, he shrewdly cemented his hold over the federally owned island airport by buying the terminal. The following year, he evicted Jazz.
Nowhere else in Canada does a regional airline, as tenant, enjoy the advantage of having the same parent company as the terminal company, the landlord. Mr. Deluce is now investing heavily in it.
The first phase of the construction of the $50-million terminal expansion, privately financed by long-term loans, will be completed in January. Another wing will open in the fall of 2010.
In January, a new ferry will be in service to handle 200 travellers each ride, double the current vessel's capacity and a much-needed boost to handle Porter's growth. Porter estimates its planes will carry a daily average of 2,700 passengers next year. With more planes and destinations on the way, Porter is forecast to transport 4,400 people a day, or 1.6 million annually, in 2011.
That would mark a huge jump from the pre-Porter era, when only 80 Jazz customers a day went through the island airport. But having proved that travellers in Canada's largest city will pay to fly out of a convenient, smaller airport, Mr. Deluce knows that, as landlord, he must now open the island airport's gates to rivals.
To permanently exclude Jazz would not be politically sustainable within Canada. And as Porter prepares to expand to more U.S. cities such as Washington and Philadelphia, it must stay on side with U.S. regulators who are pro-competition. Thus the airport may end up granting access to Continental Airlines Inc., which signed a partnership pact with Air Canada last month.
Those relationships will inevitably be affected by the outcome of Jazz's court case.
Jazz argues that the port authority overstepped its bounds when it effectively handed a monopoly to Porter by giving it control of so many slots. Jazz has sued the authority and the various companies Mr. Deluce is involved with - Porter, City Centre Aviation Ltd. and Regco Holdings - and is asking the Federal Court to let it back in on terms that are not overly restrictive. The defendants have denied any wrongdoing.
In public, Mr. Deluce carefully avoids attacking Air Canada or Jazz. Behind the scenes, he doesn't hide his disdain.
"Knowing what I know about the predatory behaviour of Air Canada, well-established over a long period of time, nothing would surprise me in terms of the lengths that they would go to stop a competitor from actually launching," Mr. Deluce said in a 2006 transcript submitted in the Federal Court case. "It's called scorched earth and it's typical of the way they behaved."
In a 2006 affidavit, Mr. Deluce also fired back, saying Jazz enjoyed its own monopoly at the island airport for 16 years, but vastly scaled back operations, allowing Porter to pounce. "There were a whole stream of Air Canada and Jazz CEOs who could have developed the island airport, but they didn't," Mr. Deluce adds in an interview.
Whatever the outcome of the court case, Jazz will still have to reckon with Mr. Deluce as landlord. Since the port authority gave the first 120 slots at the island airport to Porter, there might be less than 50 slots up for grabs in the fall of 2010 for Porter, Jazz and others to divvy up.
In an interview, Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu declined to comment on the legal fight against Porter and the port authority. But he said he's determined to have Jazz return to the island airport in 2010.
"In one fashion or another, we intend to find a way to have access to the airport," Mr. Rovinescu said. "I can categorically say that our passengers would like us to have access to the island and, therefore, we are going to work very hard to achieve that."
Cost advantages
Porter's ability to restore "dignity" to flying stems from a number of cost advantages it enjoys over its larger rivals.
Robert Kokonis, president of consulting firm AirTrav Inc., says Porter's exclusive reliance on 70-seat Bombardier Q400 turboprops is part the reason why Porter has grown rapidly.
The fuel-efficient Q400s don't need as many passengers as the bigger planes used by Air Canada and WestJet to post an operating profit. Community Air, a residents group opposed to expansion of the island airport, says Porter's load factor - the proportion of seats filled by paying customers - was likely much less than 40 per cent earlier this year, but improving.
The smaller planes allow Porter to offer more flights, luring walk-up traffic and winning over business fliers seeking flexibility in taking earlier or later flights.
During peak travel times and holidays, Porter thrives, even though it tends to charge a slight premium over its rivals. On the Thanksgiving weekend, the island airport terminal was packed with customers.
By the spring of this year, Porter had overtaken WestJet as the No. 2 carrier in the eastern triangle of Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa. Air Canada and Jazz still dominate, with 55 per cent market share, but Porter's piece of the market has surpassed 20 per cent and it's closing the gap.
Another Porter cost advantage is in landing fees, which are sharply lower at the island airport than Pearson, which has the world's highest charges. With a non-union work force, Porter also has lower labour costs.
"Porter has passed the danger zone of the first three years of operation," Mr. Kokonis says. "The next danger phase is the next three years. They must ensure they to not expand too quickly, and that their expansion is based on operating only where they can do so profitably."
Mr. Deluce says Porter has been profitable since mid-2007 on a "fully allocated" basis, though he declines to give accounting details - information that would only become public if the carrier decides to raise equity financing through an initial public offering.
When Porter's board meets next spring to discuss a five-year plan, the agenda will include the possibility of an IPO some time between 2010 and 2015, he says.
The terminal expansion may be Mr. Deluce's biggest and grandest bet yet, but he vows that his aviation career has yet to peak. New destinations being targeted include the Ontario cities of Windsor, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie and his family's former home base of Timmins. Besides Washington and Philadelphia, U.S. destinations on Porter's short list are Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Cleveland and Detroit.
He is also receptive to the idea of signing partnership deals with other carriers, perhaps benefiting from connecting traffic in the United States.
Mr. Deluce's vision calls for expansion into Western Canada, where Porter stands to make inroads in the Regina-Winnipeg route, which was abandoned by WestJet earlier this year. Porter already flies from Toronto to Thunder Bay and is considering a connection from Thunder Bay to Winnipeg by mid-2010. If all goes well, Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon and Vancouver are possibilities.
While industry experts say Porter is in danger of spreading itself too thin, Mr. Deluce counters that there is no growth without risk.
"Being in this business is not for the faint of heart. It does take a bit of determination, and you need to be flexible," he says. "Our focus is still very much on the Toronto area, but the Porter brand itself may be exportable beyond Toronto."

Stronach revives theme park dream

Abstract: He's thinking about building a theme park - again - near Vienna. "Magna's got nothing to do with it," Mr. [Frank Stronach] stressed yesterday when asked about an amusement park called Lost Worlds, adjacent to the Magna Racino, a racetrack and casino he now owns.

Full text:   Frank Stronach has been called a visionary and compared with Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. But when he gets an idea, he doesn't give up on it easily.
In case bidding to buy a car company, helping steer his auto parts giant through a massive industry crisis and watching his racetrack company fall into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection wasn't enough to keep the 77-year-old Mr. Stronach occupied this year, he has revived an idea that landed him in hot water with shareholders a decade ago.
He's thinking about building a theme park - again - near Vienna. "Magna's got nothing to do with it," Mr. Stronach stressed yesterday when asked about an amusement park called Lost Worlds, adjacent to the Magna Racino, a racetrack and casino he now owns.
It's a personal venture, said the 77-year-old entrepreneur, who founded what is now Magna International Inc. in a Toronto garage in 1957 and led it into the top ranks of the world's auto parts makers.
While the idea is reminiscent of the $800-million World of Wonder that Mr. Stronach proposed a decade ago for the site now occupied by Magna Racino, the size and scale of Lost Worlds are dramatically smaller. "No comparison," he said, and so far, it's not a plan, just an idea.
Mr. Stronach's previous vision of a theme park was scrapped in part because Magna shareholders revolted at the prospect of the auto parts company getting involved in such an investment as well as a proposed transatlantic airline for luxury travellers and racetracks.
The theme park and the airline idea disappeared, but Magna purchased a handful of racetracks and later spun them out as Magna Entertainment Corp., which tumbled into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March.
The idea for a smaller theme park is still in its infancy, he insisted.
"We're just exploring," he said. "What could we do with this extra land? At this time, I'm into the thinking stage."
But he has gone far enough down the road to ask the local government in Ebreichsdorf, Austria, to rezone land next to the racetrack.
The proposal calls for one area with 19 rides and attractions aimed at families with children aged 4 to 14. It includes a 12-minute boat ride through jungles and rain forests.
In another area, a narrow-gauge railway will wind through a forest surrounding a building in the style of a medieval windmill where professors from Vienna University will supervise activities showing children how people from the Middle Ages baked bread and made containers.
In the first year of operation, about 168,000 people would be expected to visit the theme park, documents submitted to the local government said. By the fifth year, that number is expected to almost triple to 472,000 people.
The theme park idea has already run into opposition from the Austrian branch of the World Wildlife Fund, which said it will have "a negative impact on a hot spot of Austrian biodiversity."
Magna Racino was one Magna Entertainment asset that was not included in the bankruptcy protection filing. Mr. Stronach purchased the venue and its real estate for EUR6.5-million ($10.3-million) in a deal that was approved by the Delaware bankruptcy court in July.
"I didn't want to see the thing go bankrupt there, so I bought it personally," he said.
He has often argued that racetracks need an attraction beyond the horses to make them a destination for families.

The revitalization of a former ship-building site into an upscale resort-inspired community on Georgian Bay has earned Fram Building Group and Slokker Real Estate Group a major award over other innovative and environmentally sustainable developments on brownfield sites across Canada.
Based on several factors - including inventive resolutions regarding contamination issues and high-quality urban designs and public spaces - the project, known as the Shipyards, was named Best Large-Scale Project at the Canadian Urban Institute's annual Brownie Awards held last month.
"We are thrilled to receive The Shipyards' first Brownie Award in recognition of our commitment to the environment and the Collingwood community," said Fred Serrafero, vice-president of development and construction at Fram.
The developers went to great lengths to clean up and enhance the natural assets of the 40-acre property where the Collingwood Shipyards was founded in 1883.
Located 90 minutes north of Toronto, the master-planned community will house 600 condominium residences, from bungalows to mid-rise buildings, as well as retail and recreational amenities within a pedestrian-friendly setting.
Contaminated soil was reused to form a seven-acre public park, which is nearly completed with an amphitheatre, lookout point, native plantings and trails connecting to the Georgian Trail.
Along the shoreline, there is a nature preserve, man-made fish habitat and a waterfront promenade, in addition to future docks, public square, shops and restaurants on the pier.
"The Brownie Awards are a true reflection of our environmental commitment over the past five years and will add credence to The Shipyards' continued success in the future," states Bruce Kerr, president of Slokker Real Estate Canada.
To date, 150 homes were released and 70 per cent sold. Roughly 40 residences are complete and the balance will be ready later this year through to 2010.
Existing roads from Collingwood's commercial centre are being extended into the project, which will ultimately reconnect the downtown to the waterfront for the first time in more than 100 years.
"It is a revitalization project that is incredible for the local residents and also anyone that's moving into a Shipyards property," says the project's director of sales, Tara Parsons.
Specialty grocers, boutiques and restaurants, such as Café Chartreuse and Tesoro, currently serve the town, which is also undergoing changes, including a new library, wider roads and improved streetscapes.
"If someone's purchasing now and moving in next year, the majority of all the local construction will be finished," says Ms. Parsons.
Year round, outdoor enthusiasts can ski, snowshoe, golf and sail, as well as explore the Scenic Caves or Wasaga Beach nearby.
Arts and culture fans can visit annual music festivals, museums and theatres, along with Le Scandinave Spa.
To give buyers a sense of the lifestyle, they will get a social membership to OslerBrook Golf and Country Club. Valued up to $11,500 with a $5,000 credit for upgrades to other memberships, the package gives owners access to the clubhouse, dining room and golf facilities, among other perks.
"This is truly a unique opportunity that will provide Shipyards residents exclusive access to one of the best golf facilities in the region," says Mr. Kerr. "It speaks to the active lifestyle that we know our owners and prospects have and the four season appeal of the Collingwood region as a whole."
Buyers can select from two types of homes now, starting with the Mackinaw Village Townhomes, which will offer two and three-storey units with two to four bedrooms, up to four-car parking and storage, plus front entrances off park-like mews with benches and views of the water.
Monthly fees will be $248 or $244 depending on the model.
Adjacent to the launch basin, a three-storey building, called Side Launch Building No. 1, will contain 38 suites with one and two bedroom plans, with or without dens, and three-bedroom layouts.
Each will come with parking and a locker, plus a monthly fee of 34 cents per square foot. Visitor parking, ski and bike storage will be available.
Standard finishes will include granite counters, oak hardwood floors and 40-ounce broadloom carpeting, plus stainless-steel appliances and minimum nine-foot ceilings on the main floor.
Units under construction will come with $15,000 to $50,000 in upgrades.

Full text:   When 25,000 kids flocked to their online site within a month of launching, these B.C. entrepreneurs knew they were on to something. Then Disney came calling
The most surreal moment of Lane Merrifield's career came on Oct. 24, 2008, when the young B.C. entrepreneur found himself standing on a stage in the middle of New York's Times Square, surrounded by hundreds of adoring children and crowds of equally enthused parents. It was three years to the day that he and two partners-Lance Priebe and Dave Krysko-had launched Club Penguin, a virtual world where millions of preteens meet, chat and play games via 2-D penguin proxies. The three men had plenty to celebrate.
Tens of thousands of young Club Penguin fans, from 23 countries, had joined the high-profile birthday party via a live Web broadcast that was beaming the Club Penguin name around the world. And along with the penguin moniker, one other name appeared, though more subtly and in much smaller print: Disney. The corporate giant had acquired the start-up the previous year, for an astonishing $350 million (U.S.), with the promise of an additional $350 million (U.S.) if Merrifield and his partners met their profit targets for 2008 and 2009. Now, Disney was putting its impressive marketing muscle behind the new acquisition, sending partygoers straight from the Times Square celebration to a Toys "R" Us across the street, where they could purchase a new line of Club Penguin merchandise.
"That day is imprinted on the memory, for sure," says Merrifield, who remains general manager of the operation. "It was one of those moments that we'll definitely look back on."
Yet, Merrifield-a born storyteller, as his Disney associates approvingly note-keeps groping for a meta-narrative other than the easily saleable one: Small-town small business suddenly hits the jackpot, earning its nice-guy founders the interest of huge companies, a set-for-life paycheque, the chance to help others and the adulation of children and parents massed cinematically in Times Square. Even as he describes the scene in New York City, he reflexively steers the point of the story away from the self-administered pat on the back of so many business anecdotes.
"At some point, I'm going to look back and go, 'Okay, what was I measured by?'" Merrifield says. "Everyone always talks about those kind of deathbed experiences and what are you really going to care about. It's not just about, what do the numbers say and what do the metrics say, and how are our stats?"
There's no doubt the numbers are impressive: When Disney acquired Club Penguin in August, 2007-the first (and, so far, only) time it has publicly disclosed figures-the site had 700,000 paid subscribers out of a total of 12 million registered users (non-paying users can create avatars and participate in basic interactions, such as dancing and chatting and playing games, but can't access activities like exclusive "VIP" parties). According to KZero, a market research firm specializing in virtual worlds, Club Penguin's registered users had leapt to 28 million by last summer-a huge market of curious kids who could potentially be converted into paying subscribers.
But amid all the deal-making and backslapping, Merrifield and his partners say their eyes are focused on more than the money. They're trying to ensure that Club Penguin maintains the integrity and creativity of its snowy virtual playground now that the penguin has been swallowed by a very mighty mouse.
The inspiration for the site, officially known as Disney Club Penguin, came from Priebe, a Web developer who had been working for years on flash games-Internet-based activities that don't require long and memory-clogging software downloads. Priebe had been tinkering with a virtual environment for kids, and after watching an item on Fox News about the lack of safe online communities, he became convinced he was on to something. "It was the whole MySpace thing," he says. "Everybody was paranoid, saying kids shouldn't be online. It basically made me sit down and go, 'Okay, so how do you make it so they can be safe?'"
Priebe's solution was to focus on security protocols, such as filters that screen out inappropriate words and vocabulary that might compromise a player's anonymity, which he incorporated into his virtual world. When he showed the results to Merrifield, his colleague at Kelowna, B.C.-based New Horizon Productions, the young sales and marketing executive was so excited by the game's potential that he and Priebe buttonholed their boss, Krysko, and proposed the creation of a new company in which the three men would be equal partners.
To Merrifield and Krysko, two things stood out about the Club Penguin prototype-the fact that multiple users could be simultaneously represented on the screen (the term "virtual world" may be commonplace now, but five years ago, most Web environments were single-user experiences) and the safety measures that Priebe was building into it. "I was blown away with the thoughtfulness he'd put toward that," says Merrifield.
The partnership worked from the start, not only because the three men had a clear business vision but because they shared strong religious beliefs. Merrifield had attended a Christian college in Edmonton before moving to California to pursue a career in marketing. One of the reasons he'd joined New Horizon was his deep connection with Krysko, who, in accordance with his Christian beliefs, steadfastly committed 10% of the company's profits to charity each year. Priebe also came from a Christian family and wholeheartedly supported his employer's charitable policy. The trio wanted their values to be integrated into their new business. So, when they established their roles in the partnership-Krysko would cover expenses and work on the business plan with Merrifield, while Priebe would develop the product-they also agreed to donate 10% of their profits to charity. (Collectively, the partners have largely supported projects that help needy kids and families in Canada and abroad.)
Priebe spent nine months developing the nascent Club Penguin; Merrifield and Krysko perfected the business model. There would be no advertising, and no charge to access the basic site, but users who wanted to buy extras like clothes for their penguin avatars or accessories for their igloos would pay a monthly fee of $5.95, or $57.95 a year. Merrifield acknowledges their monetization scheme was inherently risky: Few companies have been able to persuade consumers to pay for online content (statistics are hard to come by, but one industry observer suggests that, typically, fewer than 5% of consumers are willing to pay extra for "premium" services). But Merrifield says advertising wasn't an option they wanted to pursue. "As a parent, I'll pay five bucks for a cup of coffee. Five bucks for a month's safe environment for my kid online isn't that excessive."
Beta-testing began in September, 2005, with about 5,000 kids who frequented Priebe's flash games site. The number of users swelled to 25,000 within the month. "That was when we knew we had something," Krysko says. With the site's official launch on Oct. 24, 2005, they "started to run," he says, "and once it launched, we didn't stop running."
Soon, the momentum of the growth took over, Merrifield says, "and it wasn't, 'How are we going to make this happen?' it was, 'How are we going to keep this running? How are we going to deal with the traffic?'"
Despite relying entirely on word of mouth for its marketing, and on users' ability to arm-twist their parents for its sales, Club Penguin hit profitability within three months. The site cost "far less than a million" to build, says Merrifield-and enough parents opted to pay the yearly subscription to cover the partners' costs.
As traffic grew, Merrifield handled the phone support himself, and wrote a blog apprising users of new additions to the site, most of which were directly based on participants' feedback. Priebe, meanwhile, struggled to keep the servers up.
None of the partners were workaholics by nature. But, says Merrifield, they knew they had a site with unique features, and they were determined to see how big it could become. If they could quickly establish their Club Penguin as the No. 1 choice for kids, they'd beat out competing ventures by mega-companies like Disney and Nickelodeon (both of which were expected to launch imminently). They'd also prove to themselves that it was possible to score big in business while creating a sustainable company that could "take care of its employees, take care of its customers."
By March, 2006, after Club Penguin was featured on the wildly popular British-based flash gaming site Miniclip, the total number of users had reached nearly 1.4 million, according to comScore, an Internet research company. Six months later, more than 2.6 million children were logging on to the site in Canada and the U.S. alone, and, at almost $60 per subscriber, the company was seeing rapid revenue growth-enough to bootstrap the fast-growing operation, add staff (especially moderators and customer service personnel who could respond to the growing volume of e-mails) and upgrade equipment.
Their first office, designed for 10 people, was rapidly pressed to accommodate 35, and as soon as they moved to a new location, they outgrew it. The partners began feeling the strain. "It was terrifying," says Merrifield, "because at the end of the day, we had people who were now depending on us every day to be up, to be online, and they're kids, and they're kids like our kids-neighbours' kids, friends of our kids. The level of responsibility we all felt at that point was daunting, to say the least."
What they needed, they realized, was expertise: advice and resources that could help them meet the surging demand for Club Penguin. On the technical side, they needed programming staff and data centre expertise; on the business side, they needed insight into issues such as customer service expansion and merchandising, and help with the "overwhelming" task of finding and hiring new employees. By 2007-when projections showed Club Penguin was about to hit annual revenues of $65 million (and profit of $35 million)-the trio began contemplating something they'd never considered before: seeking another partner. Possibly a big one.
"Finding a company that had an international infrastructure in place was a huge thing," says Merrifield. "We already had over 40% of our audience coming from outside of North America. So it wasn't an issue of, 'Okay, how do we expand out,' it was way more of, 'How do we just serve the audience that's there? How do we provide the same kind of phone support in Australia that we're able to provide for kids here?'
"Do we go out and start looking at real estate in all these countries to set up offices? We could've-we did, we had to. But it's not what we were passionate about doing. So for us, it was as much about finding a home where we could slot in what we were great at, and then be able to pool the resources that [the partner] had, to be able to take the next big step a lot faster."
The founders won't name the potential partners they talked to, but, in addition to Disney, most industry insiders mention AOL, Sony and NewsCorp. The head of AOL's Kids and Teens division, Malcolm Bird, appeared to corroborate the rumours of his company's interest, telling a reporter in early 2007, "Yes, we're looking at a virtual world. We've got something up our sleeves [but] there's no use going and building another Club Penguin." Any discussions were cut short, however, when AOL decimated the budget for its kids' division and a frustrated Bird left in March. Then, there was Sony, which allegedly bid $450 million to $500 million (U.S.) for Club Penguin in a series of exclusive negotiations. It had much else to offer besides money: Through its PlayStation Portable brand, Sony made video games that connected users to the Internet via WiFi, and the Club Penguin partners were keen on producing spinoff video games that could interface with the site.
Merrifield won't talk about their discussions, but does say that Disney's acceptance of Club Penguin's "non-negotiable" conditions were key to reaching an agreement: The business would be headquartered in Kelowna, where the three men had settled with their families (including school-aged children); the co-founders would maintain operating control of the company; and 10% of profits would continue to go to charity.
The tithing raised eyebrows among some suitors, who "looked at us a little cross-eyed when we'd start talking about that," Merrifield says. "Ten per cent is a significant amount, especially for a company that was doing as well as we were. There were only a few of them, frankly, who encouraged it."
The question of who would run the company was never in doubt, according to Paul Yanover, the Canadian-born executive vice-president of Disney Online. He says Disney wanted the team's expertise in building virtual worlds as much as it wanted their virtual world itself. The entertainment giant was about to launch a Pirates of the Caribbean game, and was developing a fairy-filled environment built around Disney's Tinker Bell character. Club Penguin's chief attributes "make us feel really confident about associating it as a Disney-branded experience: safe, family-friendly, great story, just steeped in imagination," Yanover says.
But some outsiders wondered what life under Disney would really mean for Club Penguin. Despite Disney executives' assurances that the virtual world would remain ad-free, business writer Carleen Hawn posted a piece on GigaOm.com provocatively entitled "Did Club Penguin sell up or sell out?"
Two p.m. outside the Landmark IV office building in Kelowna looks a lot like 2 a.m. outside the city's many nightclubs. A flood of 20-somethings-dressed mostly in black and chatting among themselves with the effervescence of the first-time employed-ebbs homeward at the end of their shift. Replacement personnel are already at their workstations-and they in turn will be met at 10 p.m. by another tide of 20-somethings, ensuring that the fun on Club Penguin remains safe and clean 24/7.
The company moved to this location in January, 2008, and its staff-which has more than doubled since the change of ownership, to about 300-occupies three of the building's six floors. Customer service represents the single biggest contingent in the work force, with two-thirds of employees dedicated to policing the site and answering the 7,500 e-mails it typically receives in a day.
After the deal with Disney, Merrifield says he and his partners were impatient "to move on to chapter 2," beginning with setting up services for overseas users, and they've made this a priority. Club Penguin now has satellite support offices in England, Australia, Brazil and Argentina, as well as Portuguese-, Spanish- and French-language versions. They're also developing a translation application that will allow children chatting through preset menus to see the responses of other users in their own language.
Satellite offices, plush toys, trading cards, video games, maybe even a movie: None of this would be conceivable for the toddler-aged start-up if it hadn't become part of "the Disney family," as both parties cozily put it. Still, both parties also concur that Disney has been careful to not interfere with the Club Penguin product or its operations. "Some people ask us, 'Hey, will we see Mickey Mouse in the dojo doing card-jitsu?'" says Yanover, citing some of Club Penguin's most recognizable games and features. "And the answer is: 'I doubt it, because he's not a penguin and he's not a little kid who's playing a penguin.'
"Integration is around back-office-type things that are very important, like integrating customer care. But integration is not going to be done to the extent that we would blur the integrity or the story conceit of what makes products work."
Still, the true meaning in any story comes from the confrontation of challenges, and the second chapter of Club Penguin is still being written. "User churn" -in which more users start dipping out of a site than are dipping in-is a chronic problem for online sites, and Nielsen Online data has already registered occasional drops in monthly use (May, 2008, numbers were down 7%, for instance, compared with April figures). Merrifield insists, however, that user churn doesn't pose the threat to Club Penguin that it does to many virtual worlds. "Yes, we have kids who grow up and grow out of it, and that's fine. Thankfully, we're privileged and fortunate to have kids who are wanting to get into it or exploring it for the first time."
The downward trend in users, for now, appears to have been successfully reversed: Nielsen Online data showed Club Penguin had 6.8 million unique visitors during the peak holiday season of December, 2008, and 6.1 million last February, its highest numbers yet. Even so, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Disney this past May revealed that the company had missed its profit targets for 2008, denying Merrifield, Priebe and Krysko an additional $175 million (U.S.). Merrifield's voice takes on a slightly defensive edge as he discusses the unpaid earnout. "The good news is, we're seeing the growth that we wanted; in the process, though, of growing, we underestimated how long it would take to build out studios in other parts of the world. The other tough thing is, in this economy, all bets are off."
Then there's the question of "ad creep" : Some parents and online commentators have pointed to the ads for plush toys and video games on Club Penguin's gateway site as a sign that the partners have succumbed to consumerism. Merrifield defends the practice, saying the use of ads remains restricted to venues outside of the virtual.
But in the end, the partners maintain that the site won't change as a result of the Disney deal-and neither will their lives. Krysko has added a swimming pool to his house, and Merrifield has bought a nicer car, but all three say the money they've earned hasn't altered who they are. "I don't even think the people at my local Starbucks where I go every day know who I am, or even care," says Merrifield, whose own children still don't realize their father is a multimillionaire or that he runs the site to which so many of their peers have devoted a significant chunk of their young lives.
Krysko puts it another way: "Our values have remained the same," he says. "A good example is, we used to be able to support a child in Ethiopia or Kenya."
"We had 10 kids at one point," adds Merrifield.
"And now each of us can adopt villages. So it's the same values. It's just on another scale."

Trying to learn how to dance with a huge suitor who has scads of cash?
In the midst of time-consuming negotiations with a sophisticated buyer, you need to keep your company running smoothly while you angle to get fair value for your business. Here's how:
Understand the buyer's strategic intentions
If a large firm is on a campaign to hoover up a series of smaller rivals, make sure you aren't last in the queue-you'll be crushed before realizing any value. In some cases, such as the Club Penguin deal, the buyer may want existing management to stay on. But the entrepreneur has to decide whether he or she can make the difficult transition from fleet-footed boss in his own shop to division head in a large bureaucracy. "There's an old expression: You can be rich or you can be king, but you can't be both," says Becky Reuber, a professor of entrepreneurship at University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.
Weigh the structure of the payout
Cash is ideal, says Robert Orr, of PricewaterhouseCoopers. But some buyers may also offer stock or an earnout, meaning part of the payment is delivered up front and the balance is paid out if the acquired company hits certain targets. These decisions hinge on the scope of the owner-operator's new role and where the control lies. Orr says that vendors "have to make sure they have the ability to influence the direction of the company to make those milestones."
Control the flow of information during the due diligence process
Non-disclosure agreements are standard during acquisitions, and some vendors may even seek non-compete or non-solicit clauses. But Neil Sheehy, a securities lawyer at Goodmans LLP, points out that no business can prevent buyers from learning strategic details as they kick the tires. He recommends a two-stage release: Following the submission of a letter of intent, provide corporate information, organizational structure, trademarks, some financial data, and anything that could be unearthed with routine corporate searches. After the formal offer to buy, release specific sales data, pricing, recipes, manufacturing process details. Some businesses don't disclose their ultra-sensitive information (such as names of major customers) until closing day. -John Lorinc

Guide to ... Buying a business

Abstract: [Richard Parker] divides business acquisitions into "dovetails" (the new company simply slips into your business) and "bolt-ons" (the operation adds new capability to your company). In either case, he argues, buyers should be prepared to pay a premium if the deal works strategically.

Full text:   Downtimes are good times to expand your business by snapping up a rival or complementary operation. During economic slumps, business valuations drop and thereafter lag the recovery, says Greg Kells, president of Ottawa-based Sunbelt Business Brokers. "Doing an acquisition during a downtime lets you go through the integration while you're in the recession," he says. "When the economy comes back, you're raring to go," propelled by an influx of customers, a network of suppliers, trained employees and cash flow.
First, however, you must determine what the prospective business is worth. Most sellers have no clue, says Kells. "They read that a competitor sold for nine times revenue, so they figure that's what they should get." It's far from that simple. "Most businesses are overpriced when they're first put up for sale," says Richard Parker, author of the book series How to Buy a Good Business at a Great Price . Business valuation, he says, "is more an art than a science." Your accountants will guide you through the fundamentals: reviewing profit-and-loss statements and sales and operating ratios for the past three to five years, and crunching the numbers through standard valuation methods. But there are many intangibles that only deft questions will reveal. "Every business has secrets," says Parker. Here's where the important ones lie.
Client and employee loyalty
Relationships with clients are critical, says Kells, and that won't show up in the ledgers. A high customer turnover suggests something is driving people away, and means it may cost you a lot to fix the problem. A dedicated work force is also a highly prized asset-though not if employee loyalty is tied to the current owner, and leaves with him. ASK: Is a customer list or database included in the purchase, and is it expanding? Is there a concentration of a few clients on the accounts receivable schedule? Are key workers under employment contracts, especially top salespeople who have long-term relationships with stalwart clients?
Industry health
Valuing a business should go far beyond the company financials, advises Parker, and get into the landscape where that business operates. Look at the industry trends, zoning changes, competition, local socioeconomic conditions. ASK: How was the business doing prior to the economic downturn vis-à-vis its competitors, and how does it compare now? If it's a store in a destination locale, how are the core retailers-the ones that drive the traffic-doing? How are the business's customers doing? If it's a distribution business, how are its suppliers doing?
Systems and processes
Solid accounting and reporting systems are a significant, if hidden, asset in a business because they make managing the company much easier. "A lot of people forget the integration process," says Kells. "It requires almost a re-education in the corporate values, and that takes time and money" -as much as six months of a company's revenue, he estimates. Jason Martin, president of Toronto-based systems integrator Navantis Inc., experienced this situation firsthand when his company did an equity swap with Legend Corp. this spring. The smaller Ottawa operation used very different accounting methods in tracking customers and recognizing revenue. "We'd suddenly find out there was a whole cache of customers we could count," says Martin. ASK: How is the inventory counted and organized (for example, finished goods, work in progress, raw materials)? How are accrued liabilities, such as payroll taxes and severance pay, accounted for?
Performance guarantees
The business you're looking to buy has seen revenues declining, which the owner blames on the economy. But is that really the issue? Unlike real estate, says Parker, "if you buy the wrong business and it goes bankrupt, there's nothing left." Rather than settling on a firm price, buyers are increasingly turning to performance-based guarantees, whereby they agree to pay a ceiling price if sales or profits reach certain levels, but also set a floor price that applies if targets aren't met. ASK: What was the company's revenue trajectory prior to the downturn? How do more recent sales volumes compare with those of your direct rivals'?
Goodwill
Goodwill is the value of intangibles, such as reputation, location, customer lists and supplier arrangements. But, really, it's the purchase price minus the value of hard assets, and is notoriously hard to peg. Parker calls it the "oh-boy clause" : "Goodwill is completely subjective on any balance sheet or in any valuation," he says. "Totally arbitrary." Sellers often try to raise the value of goodwill by adding the potential they see for future business. Don't fall for it: That's only a factor in deciding whether to buy the business at all. ASK: What does research tell you about the company's reputation among suppliers and customers? If location is an important asset (as with retail), does the company have a long-term lease that you can take over?
Strategic fit
Parker divides business acquisitions into "dovetails" (the new company simply slips into your business) and "bolt-ons" (the operation adds new capability to your company). In either case, he argues, buyers should be prepared to pay a premium if the deal works strategically. Buy based on the return on investment, not the price, he says. "Focus on what life is going to look like after you buy rather than trying to stick to a legacy valuation" -as in, X type of business is worth a Y multiple of revenue or net profit. These formulas are useful for building your case for a particular price, but true value is more subtle and unpredictable. "Accept that your business will change, not just add on to your existing business," says Martin. ASK: How much can the two businesses save by combining their operations? What opportunities can they pursue that they couldn't individually, and how much will that add to revenues?

strapped for cash? Hang in there
Since the recession began, Greg Kells's Sunbelt Business Brokers has seen numerous deals fall apart as banks withdrew backing in a rush away from risk. "That means 90% of deals that would have been okay three years ago won't work now," says Kells. While it's harder than it's been in decades to get bank financing for an acquisition, there are still some doors open. Here are four:
1. Buy a piece of the business rather than the whole thing, and do a share swap. "The necessity isn't there to acquire 100%," says Richard Parker. In a market decline, business owners who had hoped to divest find themselves forced to continue working, and may be open to a merger with a majority partner. You could acquire 70% of the business and keep the owner/operator on salary until he or she is ready to sell the remaining shares. But the Canada-Ontario Business Service Centre cautions that if you buy shares (instead of assets), check for liabilities such as debts or lawsuits. Also, the assets on the books may have been fully depreciated to zero, leaving no further depreciation allowance available for tax purposes. On the other hand, if the company has previous tax losses, they can be used against future profits.
2. Have the seller finance the sale. In transactions involving smaller businesses (under $5 million), seller financing has gone "through the roof," says Parker. "In a $1-million seller-financed deal, I might give you a cheque for $300,000 and owe you the rest, which I pay over time from profits on the business." Such arrangements, he says, are especially popular when the seller is planning to retire and does not need to be paid the cash up-front.
3. Look to private equity. While venture capitalists have retreated in recent years, private equity groups are still active, but less so. Traditionally, the latter wouldn't look at companies under $1.5 million in EBITDA, says Parker, but recently they've been taking smaller positions. While their funding isn't cheap, private equity firms will invest, in the hope of acquiring other like businesses and using your business as a platform. And they tend to keep management on board. Says Parker, "Private equity firms bet as much on the jockey as on the horse."
4. Approach your bank. Yes, it's a hard sell, but remember: Since you are combining two businesses, you now have two banking relationships to tap, each with a track record, immediately improving your odds. "Be able to demonstrate that, between these two entities, the combination will fall to the bottom line through savings alone," says Parker. He cautions, however, that "you have to be incredibly prudent and factual. You can't sell blue sky." Focus on showing immediate additional cash flow that will service any debt. And know that banks generally will not finance the portion of the purchase pertaining to goodwill.

Do you need a business broker?
Business brokers-intermediaries who charge commissions or fixed fees to assist buyers and sellers of small businesses with valuations, sale advertising, negotiations and due diligence-are involved in only one of every 10 acquisitions.
There are many reasons to use a broker, but here are the key pros and cons.
YES
- Ego and emotion play big roles in deals between entrepreneurs, who may distrust each other's motives. "The guys hear what they want to hear," says Greg Kells, a business broker. An impartial intermediary can assess and "interpret" each party's interests, preventing competitors from becoming enemies. Owners' lawyers often protect their clients by pushing for complex clauses that can cripple negotiations. Intermediaries focus on getting to yes.
- Brokers assess businesses that approach them about a sale to ensure they can attract a transaction, listing as few as half. As a result, they know of many businesses that aren't advertised while steering clients to only those worth their while.
- Brokers, especially those who specialize in particular industries, can assist buyers or sellers in business valuations and alert them to problems (cultural differences, divergent corporate objectives) before a transaction gets too advanced.
NO
- As with real estate transactions, the great majority of business brokers represent listings, meaning they work for the seller, not the buyer.
- Intermediaries often fail to follow up with interested buyers they deem inappropriate. "One of the biggest complaints I hear [from potential buyers] is that you cannot even get a reply to your inquiries," says author Richard Parker. "In all fairness, they are besieged with buyers, so when you contact them, be compelling."
- When two entrepreneurs know and trust each other, involving a broker can just slow things down, says entrepreneur Jason Martin. In the case of his company's acquisition merger, "we wanted to do it quickly and quietly."

Abstract: [Mario Livich] walks out to the street and glances over at BC Place. It is sunny, but the air has turned cold. Vancouver 2010 is nigh. "If you're anybody in this town, you're going to want to entertain people during the Olympics," Livich says. "To do that, you're going to need tickets." And like it or not, you're probably going to need to know Mario Livich.

Full text:   Mario Livich's company ShowTime has managed to turn scalping into a respectable business. Now to fend off a little problem called Ticketmaster
THE punch came hard and fast. It was 23 years ago, but Mario Livich still remembers the sting.
The fist dropped him to the pavement. As he lay on the ground, stunned, the Vancouver teenager who had taught himself how to hustle tickets had a single thought running through his head: Please don't take the money.
It was Expo 86. The city was teeming with tourists and ticket scalpers outside venues. And stuffed inside Mario Livich's jeans was $20,000 in cash.
They never got the money. They never even looked for it. The guy who sent Livich to the concrete had only come to deliver a message. This stretch of sidewalk belonged to serious scalpers-and Livich was a nobody. If he kept up the brisk business he was doing, they were going to break his legs.
As he skulked away, Livich made a decision. He wasn't going to back down. After all, he was good at this job. He knew the business inside and out: buying up tickets on the cheap, then flipping them at a healthy profit whenever demand outpaced supply. This, he vowed, would be his career. "The next day, I show up, my mouth is swollen, but I'm there," Livich says. "They realized I wasn't going to leave and they were probably going to have to kill me if they wanted me gone."
Two decades later, that business on the street has evolved into ShowTime Tickets, the largest ticket broker in Canada, with about $5 million a year in sales, 19 staff and one of the busiest ticket resale websites in North America. Livich's competitors in the ticket "aftermarket" rank among the biggest names in business, from StubHub, which is owned by eBay Inc., to TicketsNow, the resale site run by Ticketmaster Inc., North America's dominant player in live entertainment.
The aftermarket falls into the grey areas of legality. Most provinces and states frown on reselling tickets, but the laws lack teeth. The job doesn't win Livich any popularity contests with the average fan just trying to land a pair of decent seats to a concert or game at face value. But to his best customers-in particular, corporate clients who can spend up to $100,000 a year wining and dining VIP clients with front-row seats and corporate boxes-the service is worth a premium and they're happy to pay accordingly. Michael Jagger, president of Provident Security, a Vancouver home-security firm that uses ShowTime about 10 times a year, buys tickets for clients or to reward staff. "We had an employee we knew was a big Peter Gabriel fan and he happened to be coming to town," Jagger says. "Well, you don't just call up Ticketmaster and get the first five rows. With [a broker], you're paying for the ticket, but you're also paying for the dirty work of someone sourcing the ticket for you."
ShowTime claims there is not a ticket in the world it can't get its hands on, either through its own aggressive strategies for buying tickets directly or by tapping its vast network of contacts, which range from season ticket holders shedding unwanted seats, to the odd concert promoter willing to quietly slip the company a few rows on the side. As long as the customer is able to pay what the market demands, Livich explains, "We are never sold out."
But the ticket reselling business will go into overdrive in the next few months. Livich's boast of never being sold out will be put to the test when the Olympics come to town in February. Tens of thousands of fans will flood into the city, many arriving without tickets. They will be met by a host of ticket resellers. Livich, 44, calls this the "travelling circus," a hotbed of brokers that springs up at major events around the continent like the Super Bowl or the World Series. Several hundred resellers are expected to parachute into town, ranging from the big players like StubHub, which plans to open a temporary office during the Games, to independent brokers working feverishly out of hotel rooms. For Livich and company, the competition to secure seats and time the market for maximum profit will be as heated as the athletic events themselves.
To no one's surprise, the gold medal hockey final is the hot ticket in the early going. Livich, a clean-cut, professional-looking man who wears dark suits and pastel shirts to the office, compares the match to the biggest diamond ring in a jewellery store. "People may not be buying, but everybody wants to know how much it costs," he says.
Livich and his staff have been working the phones since summer, trying to secure as many tickets to the final game as possible. His sources are diverse: ShowTime first tries to buy the seats itself, logging on to the Olympic website as any fan might, hoping to be picked in the lottery that organizers have set up to distribute seats as fairly as possible. After that stream is exhausted, ShowTime taps its carefully nurtured network of contacts, including fans and other professional brokers that have secured the rights to buy tickets through the lottery system. For every ticket sold on his site-even the ones for which he's only acting as middleman broker-Livich collects a commission of at least 20%.
It doesn't matter that the tickets haven't been produced yet. On its website, ShowTime is already selling tickets to the game, which have a face value of between $350 and $775, for between $3,275 and $4,875 per seat. Olympic organizers wanted to prevent this sort of inflation-but the free market prevails, Livich says. The aftermarket prices are dictated by demand, plain and simple.
When asked how many gold-medal hockey seats ShowTime has accumulated so far, Livich is coy. "We have zero right now, because they haven't been issued yet," he says with a smile. "How many do we have the rights to? That's a different story. Thousands."
ShowTime's offices are located in the shadow of BC Place, where the opening and closing Olympic ceremonies will be held, and not far from General Motors Place, where hockey fans will congregate on a nightly basis throughout the Games. The offices are clean, bright and friendly, not dissimilar to a real estate office designed to sell you a home. By February, the streets outside Livich's window will be closed to vehicles, but throngs of tourists will shuffle past ShowTime's storefront on a daily basis. If location is everything, this is the kind of spot most companies would die for during the Games.
Livich staked his claim on this location long before the idea of the Vancouver Olympics was even aired. The notion of getting into reselling first occurred to him as a teenager when he saw $40 concert tickets being sold for $100 outside a venue. But it was Expo that made him into a professional. Instead of buying a few tickets here and there and flipping them for a higher price, Livich used Expo to begin speculating, buying up bigger blocks of tickets to sell, with an eye to heftier returns. In particular, Livich figured there was ample money to be made by purchasing the last few unused days of a seven-day Expo 86 weekly pass from patrons who were leaving the grounds. He then walked those passes over to the entrance gate and flipped them to tourists who only wanted a day pass. He bought at a steep discount, sold at a slight discount and pocketed the difference.
The Expo cash stuffed in his jeans allowed him to branch out. Livich began buying up swaths of seats to concerts and hockey games. He got to know employees of concert promoters-a key source of bulk tickets if the right relationships are forged. He also networked in the scalping community, in order to swap seats and manage inventory.
It was important to milk every possible source, since demand for a given event can surge without warning. Season ticket holders have Livich on speed dial so they can unload games they can't attend; likewise, Livich has a contact list of those who will sell prime seats (centre ice at most NHL rinks, for example) if the price is right. Though few people admit it, everybody is a seller, he says. "A lot of season ticket holders, they invest in season's tickets, they may or may not claim that as a business expense. Then they sell them and get some cash back in their pocket," Livich says. "What people do with their tax returns isn't my business."
Even the teams are sellers. "I've dealt personally with team owners, where I'm sitting in a hotel room with a suitcase full of cash and they're selling tickets," Livich says. "I'm not going to go into further details, but everyone likes cash. So I've cultivated those relationships."
To be a ticket speculator, you have to have guts. On any given day, ShowTime will have millions of dollars of tickets on its site. Their liquidity-Livich's ability to move them at a profit-relies heavily on mercurial influences on value: the ability of a team to keep winning, of a star athlete to stay healthy, or of a song to stay popular. "I have a tremendously high tolerance for risk," Livich says.
He nearly lost everything in the early days, betting too big on certain concerts and being stuck with a fistful of tickets he could barely give away for free. A particular R.E.M. concert in the mid-1990s left a bitter taste in his mouth. He overestimated demand for the show, and secured a bulk deal for tickets from the promoter. As the date approached, Livich realized he had too much merchandise and was forced to dump the tickets for next to nothing to fans outside the stadium. "It was horrid," he says.
His big break came in 1994, after years of grinding out meagre returns. That year, the Vancouver Canucks entered the NHL playoffs with modest expectations on their shoulders, and the local fan base was accordingly lukewarm on tickets. But Livich realized that if he loaded up on Canucks playoff tickets through Ticketmaster, his exposure would be minimal but the upside was huge. If the Canucks lost to the Calgary Flames in the opening round, as expected, he wouldn't have to pay for the scheduled games after that -they would never be played. But if the team advanced, the prices he could fetch for subsequent rounds would only increase, in tandem with fan excitement. So Livich begged and borrowed for as much cash as he could get, going to friends, family and eventually loan sharks to build up capital.
The wager could not have worked out better. The Canucks upset the Flames and marched through to the Stanley Cup finals that year, going all the way but losing to the New York Rangers in seven games.
In addition to profits-estimated in the hundreds of thousands-the coup brought in a flood of calls from brokers across the United States who wanted tickets. With this contact list, ShowTime branched out internationally.
Still, Livich craved one thing-legitimacy. He wanted out of the street game and into something cleaner. "My mother has always said to me, 'When are you going to get a real job?' " he says.
Livich's parents came to Canada from Croatia when he was 4. Seeing his parents toil to make a living-his mother putting in long hours scrubbing toilets in hotel bars and restaurants-was a powerful motivator. He wanted to control his own destiny. With money from the Canucks playoff run, he went in search of a proper place to build a company from scratch, landing the small space across the street from BC Place in 1995.
Forty-eight hours later, having built a front counter himself, Livich opened for business, with one employee. Today, behind the counter are tech staff, salespeople, ticket buyers and marketers. They field orders from all around the world over the phone and through ShowTime's website, as well as from walk-up customers. "I think it took my parents 15 years to accept that I was a legitimate businessperson. Just recently, they realized: I have a job, I do have a business," he says with a laugh.
Some people, however, don't hold the business in much esteem. Though ShowTime has a loyal customer base of people who are willing to pay for the convenience and reliability of the service rather than queue up for tickets, many fans despise the aftermarket as opportunistic.
But disgruntled fans aren't the only problem any more. The rise of resellers like ShowTime and StubHub on the Internet is a disruptive force in the ticket industry, not just a nuisance on the street corner. Their success has provoked an unholy war in the business. Ticketmaster, the goliath primary seller of tickets, enjoys a near monopoly that threatens to shut people like Livich down. And the way Ticketmaster sees things, it would be doing fans a favour.
Miley Cyrus is not only a squeaky-clean teen star; she may also be the future of the ticket industry. Cyrus's concert tour this year employed a Ticketmaster innovation that it is pushing to venues across North America as the new industry standard: tickets without actual tickets.
In this paperless model, fans buy a ticket with a credit card (or, in the case of Cyrus fans, their parents' credit card), then swipe that card at the door instead of having their ticket punched, ripped or scanned. As with an airline ticket, the seat to a Miley Cyrus show is not transferable, so it's difficult to resell if you don't have the credit card used to pay for it.
"The brokers hate paperless ticketing because they know what it does," says Joe Freeman, senior vice-president at Ticketmaster Inc. "It gets tickets directly from the artist and the event provider into fans' hands at the price the event provider wants fans to pay. It's a pretty potent tool." MTS Centre in Winnipeg and Copps Coliseum in Hamilton were among the first venues in Canada to use Ticketmaster's paperless ticket system, introduced last year for tours by Metallica and Tom Waits.
The National Association of Ticket Brokers, a U.S.-based lobby group representing companies like ShowTime, has lashed out at the idea, calling it anti-competitive. The association wants the paperless ticket model to be scrutinized as part of investigations that have already been undertaken by competition regulators in Canada and the U.S. Those probes concern Ticketmaster's proposed merger with event promoter Live Nation, which would give the company an even greater hold over the market. To make their argument, both sides-Ticketmaster and the resellers-are holding themselves up as defenders of the fans.
"If there's a broker in California, he's going to think long and hard before buying a paperless ticket to an event in Ontario," Freeman says, since the reseller would have to be on site with his credit card for the buyer to get into the show. Were the system in place for the Olympics, gold-medal hockey tickets might be easier to come by at face value for the average fan. At events where the paperless system has been used, "We're already seeing the public is getting enhanced access to tickets," Freeman says.
Resellers such as Livich and StubHub say the system will simply line Ticketmaster's pockets, while doing more to harm than help customers, since it will make it hard for fans to hand over tickets to friends when they can't attend an event themselves. It also poses an obstacle to fans who want to use the aftermarket to buy a ticket to a sold-out show.
"When one company with market power tells fans they can't deal with competitive marketplaces, then we suspect fans are not being served," says Lance Lanciault, StubHub's director of legal affairs. "More importantly [if there is an online resale market], consumers know what market prices are, so they're less likely to be tempted to pay above-market prices to a seller on the street who doesn't offer any consumer protections."
While both sides rush to the defence of the helpless consumer, a bigger game is afoot. The brokers and resellers fear Ticketmaster is trying to corner the market for itself. Despite its protests, Ticketmaster has its own resale site, TicketsNow: The company is both a primary seller and an aftermarket player. If the company can shut out ticket resellers and have TicketsNow act as a transfer site for paperless tickets, it will have the market to itself, allowing seats to be exchanged with the press of a button.
Ticketmaster has already found itself in hot water over its ownership of TicketsNow. Fans in New Jersey complained this year that they were being automatically directed to the resale site to buy Bruce Springsteen tickets at inflated prices mere seconds after the concert went on sale.
Lawmakers have yet to rule on the inherent conflict of interest for companies that play both markets. In the meantime, primary ticket sellers are increasingly being lured to join the game-including Olympic organizers in Vancouver, who have mulled over the idea, and professional sports teams that have set up resale sites of their own, taking a commission on each sale.
Freeman says Ticketmaster is working on finding a way for fans to transfer tickets in the paperless model-and it will collect a fee on the transaction, even if the parties aren't exchanging money themselves. Freeman is unapologetic about the charge, comparing it to a service charge at a bank machine. "We know we're not the most beloved company," he says. "But it takes time and resources to build out the capability. It's only right that we charge for it."
Livich admits it will be hard to circumvent paperless tickets. "There's the hassle factor. Say you buy two tickets, maybe you could go walk somebody in with you, so you burn one ticket and sell the other. Or you can give somebody your credit card to use. There's always ways to work around the system," Livich says. "But there's not a scalable solution, no."
As a fan attending events, the paperless ticket idea is a potential problem for Jagger. "What if I want to buy the tickets as a gift? And if I can't go to a hockey game, usually I'll end up giving the tickets to my brother. What do I do then?"
FOR every jackpot like the Canucks' 1994 playoff run, Livich has another story about losing his shirt betting the wrong way. Brokers will often fill orders in advance at a certain price, then set out to procure those tickets for less, aiming to profit from the spread. Livich has tried to forget about the 2006 Super Bowl, when a ShowTime employee took a large order of tickets from a corporate buyer in the U.S. and locked in at a specific price, only to see the market spike a few weeks later when the Seattle Seahawks unexpectedly made it to the final against the Pittsburgh Steelers. With demand for tickets soaring by the hour, ShowTime was forced to honour the order at a loss-buying the tickets it needed at much higher prices to supply the client. The fiasco cost the company $120,000.
"The general perception is, 'Look how much money these guys are making, they're criminals,' " Livich says. "But it can be a skinny business." ShowTime might make a margin of 20% to 25% on sales, but that number is cut in half by overhead. Then factor in a slumping economy, when corporate expense accounts are curtailed, and the business gets lean in a hurry.
Last year ShowTime lost money in the down economy. "It's been challenging, absolutely. You end up sitting on a million dollars of inventory, such as hockey tickets. But when the economy turns, that turns into a tremendous liability," Livich says. "It's perishable product."
For the Olympics, ShowTime has rights to tickets locked up for every event, from luge to biathlon, in order to capitalize on medal matches, but also on the inevitable media sensations that seem to erupt from nowhere and draw big crowds. Think Eddie the Eagle, the ski jumper who stole the show at the Calgary Olympics in 1988. On the other hand, a Slovakia-Finland final in hockey would be devastating.
To Livich, reselling tickets is like speculating on pork bellies and corn futures, but far more interesting. "Any time the stakes are high, you can blow your brains out. Absolutely," he admits. The Olympics will be a crucial moment for Livich's company: If demand isn't there, ShowTime will lose out on commissions from stacks of tickets it can't sell. If demand is strong, the company will be perfectly positioned. In its pursuit of profit, ShowTime has also waded into brokering the rights to hotel rooms in Vancouver during the Games, a market that works on the same supply-and-demand principles as tickets do.
Livich walks out to the street and glances over at BC Place. It is sunny, but the air has turned cold. Vancouver 2010 is nigh. "If you're anybody in this town, you're going to want to entertain people during the Olympics," Livich says. "To do that, you're going to need tickets." And like it or not, you're probably going to need to know Mario Livich.

Gary Bettman was in Phoenix the other day, spinning a few tales about the impending sale of the Coyotes.
Well, impending may be stretching things a tad, as the NHL commissioner is now saying he expects the sale to be completed by the end of the hockey season. And local fans shouldn't worry about that Dec. 31 deadline the league established to give priority to buyers who will keep the team in its suburban Glendale arena. As Bettman told the Arizona Republic, "I'm not concerned about Dec. 31 or Jan. 1."
Besides, the commish said, he has six potential buyers on the line. But as anyone selling real estate knows, a potential buyer is anyone who stops in front of your For Sale sign.
A day in search of the elusive six produced little concrete information. There is one obvious suitor, Ice Edge Holdings LLC, a group of Canadian and U.S. businessmen that has declared its intention to pay $150-million (all currency U.S.) and keep the team in Glendale. After that, the field thins out quickly.
The mayors of Quebec City and Winnipeg could be counted, since they have made their desires to get back in the NHL public and Bettman has made encouraging noises. Neither city should get excited, since it's only prudent for Bettman to encourage them in hopes of spooking someone else into buying his handyman's special.
There are also the owners of the Toronto Argonauts, Howard Sokolowski and David Cynamon. They have been kicking tires around the league for a while now, but if they can't hack the losses in the CFL, how are they going to make this work even if their ultimate dream is to put the Coyotes in suburban Toronto?
Finally, Jerry Reinsdorf's name just won't go away. But those who are familiar with the jockeying with Glendale say the owner of the Chicago White Sox is not keen to buy the team, just willing to listen if a deal he thinks might work is presented to him.
As anyone who followed the team's bankruptcy court case knows, papers inadvertently filed with the court revealed the only thing Reinsdorf thinks will work is a subsidy of $23-million a year from Glendale. That, city officials were quick to say, is not going to happen.
John Kaites, a lawyer and former Republican politician, has been Reinsdorf's front man on the Coyotes. He has a long relationship with Glendale city manager Ed Beasley and it is said Kaites is still poking around about a new arena lease with the city in hopes of coming up with something that will intrigue Reinsdorf.
What Bettman would really like is someone to plunk down at least $140-million for the Coyotes, the price the NHL agreed to pay for them when it "won" the auction conducted by the bankruptcy court, by early December. Then he could go to the annual board of governors' meetings on Dec. 15 in Pebble Beach, Calif., and tell them he managed to flip the team quickly so they are no longer on the hook for the massive losses.
If he can't sell the team by the end of the season, Bettman will have to tell the governors the total tab for rescuing the Coyotes from Canadian suitor Jim Balsillie could hit $200-million. Bettman already took a shot across the bow this week from Kevin Compton, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and co-owner of the San Jose Sharks. Compton told the Sports Business Daily the whole Coyotes saga was "a joke" and the league needs Balsillie as an owner.
"Jim loves hockey," Compton said. "Jim's got a lot of money. Jim's got a lot of passion." Compton also said he is certain Balsillie will become an NHL owner some day. When it was pointed out the league is keeping Balsillie out, Compton shot back that "owners aren't."

Full text: Al Purdy opened his house to a generation of writers. Now they're gathering to help save a home that became a literary legend, John Barber writes
Poetic myths can be hard to sustain in a prosy age, but every versifier in Canada will tell you something uncanny happened 50 years ago on a bush lot in the country south of Belleville, Ont., where local couple Al and Eurithe Purdy had retreated after the former's failure to thrive as a writer in the big city of Montreal, where they built a cramped "A-frame" shack to live in and survived on such delicacies as wild asparagus and roadkill.
"It's well known that when Purdy began his career as a poet he was quite a terrible writer," says Paul Vermeersch, editor of a new book, The Al Purdy A-Frame Anthology , that celebrates the magical transformation of a literally starving hack into the breakthrough voice of modern Canadian English.
"I don't want to paint any supernatural picture or anything," Vermeersch adds. "But moving to Ameliasburgh was the missing piece in the puzzle.
As Atwood has said, it's the moment when Purdy's poetry suddenly shifts from being terrible to being remarkable. It was when he began writing there that it happened."
Poet after poet extols the majesty of that "it" in the pages of the A-Frame Anthology : Michael Ondaatje, Dennis Lee, George Bowering, Margaret Atwood and a host of lesser known belletrists, all of whom hovered like bugs around the shining light of Ameliasburgh from the 1960s until Purdy's death in 2000. Many of them are gathering again tonight at Toronto's Harbourfront Centre, both to launch the book and to make a plea for the preservation of the humble landmark.
The Toronto gathering is one of four organized this fall and winter to raise funds to buy the old house from Eurithe, 85, restore it to habitable condition and operate it as a retreat for future generations of Canadian writers. Last week, an event was held in Waterloo, Ont. and the others will take place in late November and December in Halifax and Victoria.
"It's not just a shack in the woods," says Jean Baird, the Vancouver editor who is leading the preservation effort. "It has been a pilgrimage place for decades for young writers - for all writers." Acolytes who never knew Purdy or drank his wild-grape wine out of old whisky bottles still leave totems on his nearby grave, according to Baird. "If the e-mails I get are any indication, the back roads of Prince Edward County are full of lost poets, looking for the A-frame."
There's nothing else like it in the country, she adds. The boyhood home of Pierre Berton in Dawson City operates today as a writers' retreat, but that late author never wrote there and wouldn't recognize it if he were alive today, according to Baird. Purdy not only hand-built and lived in the A-frame, he made it and its landscape the focus of some of his finest poems. "Berton House doesn't have the clout of this place," Baird says. "On a heritage meter, this one's off the charts."
Not only a place of pilgrimage for such young, unpublished writers as Michael Ondaatje, the Purdy A-frame also appears to have functioned as the drunken boat of Canadian literature. Blackouts, broken legs and furious arguments mark the anthologized reminiscences.
Atwood contributed a cartoon in which a petite young ingenue sipping homemade wine experiences "a sudden attack of bladder cancer." A spectacular portrait by photographer John Reeves summarizes the prevailing mood. "Several years later, Al would say, 'No, I've never met John Reeves,' " Baird says.
Organizers of the Al Purdy A-Frame Trust hope to raise $1-million to repair the house and create an endowment that will enable young writers to use it. "The place will come down if we don't succeed," Baird says. In the eyes of the 21st-century real-estate market, the shack is no more than a blight on a desirable lakefront lot.
"But I and many others think it's the most important literary house in the country," she adds. "We really need Canadians to step up. This is not the time for people to be saying, 'Somebody else will do it' - because it won't happen."
The Al Purdy A-Frame Anthology launch is at Harbourfront Centre's Lakeside Terrace, tonight at 7:30. For more information, see www.alpurdy.ca .

The A-list on Al's A-frame
Michael Ondaatje Al and Eurithe simply invited us in. And why? Because we were poets! Not well-known writers or newspaper celebrities. Did Kipling ever do that? Did D.H. Lawrence? Malcolm Lowry had done that for "Al-something or other" in Dollarton, years earlier. These visits became essential to our lives. George Bowering In 1967 the Purdys' house was nearly alone on that big pond, and with old wheelbarrow and upside-down rowboat and empty stubbies in the unshorn grass out front, it all seemed to this innocent westerner a kind of dilapidated eastern elegance, a kind of dogpatch resort, something nicer than I would ever have in my unairconditioned big city apartments. Paul Vermeersch He kept repeating the invitation: "If you're ever down my way, drop in and say hello." "I will Al, one of these days. I swear." ... The day Al's ashes were buried in Ameliasburgh, Dennis Lee and his wife Susan Perly were kind enough to offer me a ride in their car. By mid-morning I was there: the A-frame. Finally, I was paying my promised visit and at the same time paying my final respects

IN HAMILTON, THE SHOW GOES ON

Author: Krashinsky, Susan

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/hamilton-show-goes-on/docview/382598615/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "We're up over 70 hours a week of local news. Maybe people don't understand what 70 hours means. It's a lot," says Mike Katrycz, CHCH's news director. The output amounts to 10 times the local programming that the station's CRTC licence requires. "There's not another local station or conventional broadcaster that does anywhere near that."

Full text: When Channel Zero paid $6 in June to acquire CHCH from CanWest, it saved the station from going dark. Now, months later, the new owners say they couldn't be happier. And many in the community echo the sentiments of CHCH employees
LOCAL SCENES FROM A NATIONAL DEBATE / As the talk, and the spin, rages on from both sides of the argument, an important question lingers. Do Canadians care about local television? As tales from two cities show, the answer depends on the locale
******
This mansion cost six dollars.
For less than the price of a movie ticket, the new owners got a stately 150-year-old house, complete with creaking floors, warmly-lit foyer, hand-carved doors - and the TV station housed inside.
In the deal five months ago, the most valuable thing to change hands wasn't the real estate; it was CHCH Hamilton, the town's only over-the-air television station.
"We're very grateful for CanWest not knowing what they were selling," says Cal Millar, whose company Channel Zero bought CHCH from CanWest Global Communications Corp. in June. "It was a real hidden gem."
For Hamilton, losing the station would have been "devastating," says Donna Skelly, an anchor who led a campaign to save CHCH. "Many of us have lived here forever; some of us were born here. We just didn't want to see it go black."
With her immaculately hair-sprayed coif and talkative nature, Ms. Skelly is every inch a TV personality - and she worked that cachet to drum up support. City councillors got on board; the staff talked about buying the station; the community held a rally. There were speeches. People made signs. They brought their dogs.
And then a bidder stepped in: nine-year-old Channel Zero, which owns a few specialty channels, including Movieola and Silver Screen Classics, but the CHCH deal marked its first foray into over-the-air stations.
For CanWest, the sale - whose bill came to $12 with CJNT in Montreal included - was part of an effort jettison money-losing operations. The real price tag of the deal was Channel Zero's agreement to assume an undisclosed amount of debt and ongoing financial losses at the two stations.
But the purchase also gives the company an opportunity to move up in the broadcasting leagues with a daring programming strategy.
Mr. Millar believes the model he has put in place has the potential to change the TV industry: all-news during the day, old movies at night.
"We're up over 70 hours a week of local news. Maybe people don't understand what 70 hours means. It's a lot," says Mike Katrycz, CHCH's news director. The output amounts to 10 times the local programming that the station's CRTC licence requires. "There's not another local station or conventional broadcaster that does anywhere near that."
What's more, Mr. Katrycz and the staff were given just six weeks to prepare to go live 14 hours a day - a feat one manager likened to asking a sprinter to run a marathon.
"It was bedlam," Mr. Millar admits. But he says the change is working, and the station has the ratings numbers to prove it. "All of a sudden during the day, when the channel was doing a lot of goose eggs previously, we now have viewers."
The numbers are small compared to what American prime-time shows rake in. But for daytime hours, 10,000-20,000 viewers is good, Mr. Millar says.
Mr. Katrycz argues the response is a sign there's money to be made with news. "There seems to be this pervasive wisdom that says local news is not the thing to be doing and it costs too much money. Hopefully we can prove that we are the exception, if not the rule."
After only two months on the air, the new format hasn't proven anything yet. Mr. Millar expects to lose about $3-million by the end of the first year, but says the station is on track to break even on a month-to-month basis by next spring.
That is an ambitious forecast. Indeed, Canada's larger broadcasters have argued the traditional, advertising-dependent model of conventional broadcasting is no longer viable.
Mr. Millar insists the model still works close to the ground. About half the spots sold at CHCH are for local businesses, which either can't afford to advertise on bigger Toronto stations or find that the stations don't reach their customers sufficiently.
As for CHCH, "It deals with the region we're in," says Dan Cowan, a sales representative at Haldimand Motors Ltd. in Cayuga, about 30 kilometres south of Hamilton. The used car dealership runs a half-dozen ads on the station, mostly during the day. "Their viewing audience is the one we sell to."
The station's reach actually goes well past the Golden Horseshoe. Seven transmitters - including a 1,000-foot tower perched on the Niagara Escarpment in Hamilton's east end - beam the signal to four million homes across the province. It's also picked up by cable and satellite services from St. John's to Vancouver - a potential audience of up to 20 million, though most of those viewers would tune in for the movies, not Hamilton news.
But local news is really the core of CHCH's strategy.
"This is really a model of what is going to work, not just in Hamilton," Donna Skelly says. "It's much more cost-effective to produce local programming than it is to purchase American programming. ... We are what keeps people watching television."
"For the individuals that live here that can't afford cable - and there's a lot of them - you can watch and get the news," says Patty Fraser, a local resident who likes watching CHCH's personalities, including tanned and square-jawed "weathercaster" Matt Hayes, a "constant Hamilton man."
Hamilton audiences aren't served by bigger stations up the road in Toronto, city councillor Terry Whitehead says.
"Most media tend to focus on the larger centres," Mr. Whitehead says. "That really does disenfranchise [other] communities."
"Ultimately, we survive or fail on whether this is a business," says Mr. Katrycz, "as does every other journalistic endeavour, with the exception, perhaps, of the CBC. If we can prove there's revenue to be made, yes, this all may grow bigger. That's what I look forward to."

The delicate state of the deli

Author: Richler, Jacob

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/delicate-state-deli/docview/382598064/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Or not. For the writing is a problem and it is clear from the outset that Sax's editors were asleep at the switch. Example: In the book's first sentence, Sax writes that his deli-loving grandfather "Poppa" Sam Sax died two years before he was born. In only the next paragraph, Sax volunteers: "I never met: 'Poppa' Sam." Go figure.

Full text: The first and worst blow to the local emporium was the advent of the supermarket
SAVE THE DELI In Search of Perfect Pastrami, Crusty Rye, and the Heart of Jewish Delicatessen
By David Sax McClelland &Stewart, 314 pages, $32.99
Some years ago when my son Max was only 7 or 8, a friend returned from Montreal bearing a brisket from Schwartz's and we promptly steamed it for lunch. My son did not remember having eaten the stuff before and finished his sandwich in a flash, then he looked at me wide-eyed and - addressing my career for the first time - asked: "You write about food, right? Why don't you write about this?"
I did not explain at the time that I had done so already, but I can certainly tell him now that there is no pressing need to do so again. For the subject that was then already well covered has now - with the publication of Save the Deli , by David Sax - been all but put to rest.
Sax is a New York-based food writer who lives in New York, hails from Toronto and developed his obsessive interest in the Jewish delicatessen during his university days in Montreal. Appreciation for the food led to a concern that the deli, as we now know and love it, was a phenomenon on its way out, a dying breed - or, as he puts it, "Jewish delicatessens are disappearing faster than chicken fingers at a bar mitzvah buffet."
His quest to find out why begins naturally enough in New York, which in the 1930s was home to something close to 2,000 delis, but is today serviced by only a few dozen.
The first and worst blow to the local deli was the advent of the supermarket, which by the 1950s was already cutting into their business with jars of Manischewitz gefilte fish and pre-sliced preserved meats. Meanwhile, an upwardly mobile Jewish class had begun quitting the old boroughs for the suburbs, and in the process, were abandoning their old delis to an environment of alarming economic decline. Those that survived until the turnaround in the 1990s were rewarded with unmanageable, soaring rents; or, in the case of the deli owners who owned their buildings, real-estate values too elevated to justify the businesses they housed. Intermarriage meant a shrinking clientele. The supersized sandwich shrank profit margins still further. And so on.
The most interesting and entertaining part of the Sax investigation is not this collection of expected truths, but rather the people he talks to in his quest to uncover them. For Sax is a tireless interviewer; he will talk deli with just about anyone. In New York, that meant every deli owner present and past who is still gabbing, from Fred Austin at Katz's to Ronnie Dragoon at Ben's in Long Island. And in between, his list extended to nearly anyone of interest who had ever been to a deli and liked it: Ruth Reichl, Alan Dershowitz, Ed Koch and on and on.
By the time he is done with his trek from New York, through Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Kansas City, San Francisco, you name it, he has had a chat on the state of the deli with everyone from Hy Diamond, who owns Schwartz's in Montreal, to 94-year-old Al Langer (and his accompanying oxygen tank) at Langer's in L.A. And his eagerness to connect with deli enthusiasts has run the gamut from Mel Brooks (born Melvin Kaminsky) to Mr. T, who rather surprisingly provides one of the best quotes in the book: "Anyone who says deli is bad for you: I pity the fool. That's a bunch of junk."
This enthusiasm for the subject is fantastic; but at the same time, the book has problems aplenty. The biggest is that as each chapter goes by it becomes increasingly difficult to share his appetite for another Reuben or bowl of matzo ball soup. The first few pages drove me to such hunger for smoked meat that I seriously considered hopping a flight to Montreal for lunch at Abie's, but a few chapters later, I was beginning to feel ill, and wishing he would just write a quick line or two about a refreshing salad.
Or not. For the writing is a problem and it is clear from the outset that Sax's editors were asleep at the switch. Example: In the book's first sentence, Sax writes that his deli-loving grandfather "Poppa" Sam Sax died two years before he was born. In only the next paragraph, Sax volunteers: "I never met: 'Poppa' Sam." Go figure. (On which note, M & S editors, please take note: The most successful hockey team in history is not actually called the "Montreal Canadians," but rather the Montreal Canadiens).
Alas, it is when Sax writes about food that things get really strange. For example, at the 2nd Avenue Deli in New York he finds that the bowls of chicken soup "are so densely packed with the fatty essence of the poultry that they glowed," and he does not cower or run - he likes it.
On Coney Island, Sax recommends a hot dog that is "light pink and incredibly juicy, tasting of caramel without the repercussion of saltiness." What is that supposed to mean? And if you know, is it good?
An occasional critical capacity would be welcome too, for a book that is ostensibly about the demise of the delicatessen instead gives the impression that they are everywhere, and largely of impeccable quality. Dish after dish is the best he has ever sampled. He even has this to say of the deli in his former hometown: "The spices in Toronto pastrami tickle the taste buds without overwhelming them." Translation: It's bland.
The book ends on a happy note, for Sax concludes that the deli will live on, and maybe even improve itself in the fight. And this book is a good guide for anyone who ever worried that this was not the case.
Jacob Richler is a Toronto-based food writer.

THIS WEEK / HIGHLIGHTS

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/this-week-highlights/docview/382601170/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The consensus among most TV reviewers is that the second campaign of this mockumentary-style sitcom is far improved from the first. The show's creators have pulled back from focusing on Amy Poehler's portrayal of deluded bureaucrat Leslie Knope and allotted more screen time to her talented co-stars, in particular Nick Offerman, who is a delight as Leslie's shiftless boss, [Ron James]. Tonight, Ron is aghast when Leslie invites herself along on his annual hunting excursion.

DRAMA
Flashpoint
CTV, 10 p.m.
Still pulling in an audience nearing two million viewers each Friday night, the Canadian crime drama delivers a nail-biter episode: The Strategic Response Unit is called to a bar where two known drug dealers have been soundly thrashed. A quick investigation reveals the beating was administered by Robert Cooper (Alex Carter, CSI ), head of a local neighbourhood-watch group.

REALITY
Battle of the Wedding
Planners
TLC, 10 p.m.
Let's get ready to rumble! Launching tonight, this new series follows three high-end wedding planners competing to put on a couple's nuptials.

SATURDAY
NOVEMBER 14
SPORTS
30 for 30
TSN, 7 p.m.
This ESPN documentary series adds new perspective to the greatest sports stories ever told. Tonight's film recalls the heady era of the upstart United States Football League, which took on the mighty NFL. The USFL launched in 1983 with a spring schedule and gained early buzz and healthy TV ratings. According to this report, the beginning of the end came next season when the New Jersey Generals franchise was bought by real estate mogul Donald Trump, whose vision of the USFL's future differed greatly from the league's founders.
MOVIE
Saboteur
TCM, 8 p.m.
One of the rarely celebrated entries in Alfred Hitchcock's film canon, this 1942 thriller played to the commonly held perception that spies were everywhere in wartime America. The story casts the reliable Robert Cummings as Barry Kane, a munitions worker wrongly accused of industrial sabotage. While on the run from the police, Kane uncovers a fascist organization known as the Fifth Column, and decides to turn double agent. The story benefits from sharp dialogue (Dorothy Parker co-wrote the script) and visually stunning scenarios. The chase scene atop the Statue of Liberty is a Hitchcock classic.
AWARDS
The Gemini Awards
Global, Showcase, 9 p.m.
Although sure to be steamrolled in the ratings by Hockey Night in Canada -and virtually everything else in its timeslot - the Geminis honour the best in Canadian television. Tonight's show takes place at the BMO Centre in Calgary and is hosted by Ron James. The gala hoedown will hand out trophies in the primary comedy and drama categories and the lineup of confirmed presenters includes Flashpoint 's Hugh Dillon, Rick Mercer and Melrose Place 's Jessica Lucas. Wait a minute. Is Melrose Place a Canadian show?
COMEDY
Saturday Night Live
NBC, Global, 11:30 p.m.
Hosting tonight's show is the lovely and talented January Jones. Better known as the complex Betty Draper on the popular AMC drama Mad Men . Jones is on SNL because she also has a supporting role in the feature Pirate Radio (see review page 8). And while everybody knows Jones can play icy, but comedy is another matter altogether. Regardless, expect a Mad Men parody and a musical performance from the Black Eyed Peas.
SUNDAY
NOVEMBER 15
CHILDREN
Santa Claus Parade
Global, 4 p.m.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. Broadcast from its traditional route in downtown Toronto, the annual Santa Claus Parade is the unofficial kickoff of the festive season for many people. Coverage of the 105th edition is hosted by Leslie Roberts and Rosey Edeh. This year's parade will include the popular floats of Mother Goose and Santa's workshop, along with several new floats.DESIGN
Extreme Makeover: Home Edition
ABC, CITY-TV, 8 p.m.
Actor David Duchovny signs up as a celebrity volunteer on this week's edition of the merciful makeover series. Duchovny and host Ty Pennington journey to Lena, Ill., the hometown of real-life married people Joey and Philip, and their three kids. Joey has bounced back from a near-fatal bout of cancer, but the wiring in the couple's farmhouse presents a deadly fire hazard. Working on a seven-day deadline, Duchovny and the Makeover team rewires the ancient structure from top to bottom.
COMEDY
Family Guy
Fox, Global, 9 p.m.
Still the animated series of choice among high-schoolers and mildly subversive adults, Family Guy has expanded its profile immeasurably since landing in second-run syndication. For better or worse, the show still takes regular runs at dim American culture. Tonight, baby Stewie meets and becomes good friends with Hannah Montana. DRAMA
Cold Case
CBS, CTV, 10 p.m.
Detective Lilly Rush (Kathryn Morris) and team reopen the 1991 murder of a teenaged girl who once held promise as a gifted rap artist. After several fruitless leads, the investigation points towards the involvement of the victim's foster parents. The episode guest stars eighties TV-mainstay Kadeem Hardison ( A Different World ) as a hip-hop record producer.
MONDAY
NOVEMBER 16
HISTORY
Battlefield Mysteries
History, 6 p.m.
Host Norm Christie tells the unknown stories behind history's fabled battles and soldiers in this fine series. Tonight's show focuses on the former SS tank ace Michael Wittmann. Better known as the Black Baron, Wittmann had notched over 138 kills before he was finally killed in battle near Cintheaux, France, in 1944. The question of who actually dispatched the Black Baron has been debated for six decades. This program sets the record straight.
DRAMA
House
Fox, Global, 8 p.m.
Dr. House is back, baby. Tonight finds the irascible medical genius finally reclaiming his licence and his position of head of diagnostics at the Princeton-Plainsboro teaching hospital. House's first order of business is to diagnose a male porno star admitted with severe eye pain. At the same time, the earnest Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) learns the hard way that inter-office relationships almost never work out as planned.
FOOD
Top Chef
Food, 9 p.m.
Filmed against a glitzy Las Vegas backdrop, this series is a fave among true food aficionados. Unlike Hell's Kitchen , all the competing chefs are seasoned kitchen professionals, which puts everyone on an equal playing field. Tonight, the remaining cheftestants are instructed to create an impromptu breakfast-in-bed service. Does it make it any easier that one of the customers is celebrity chef Nigella Lawson? Quite the contrary.
DRAMA
Castle
ABC, A, 10 p.m.
Holding its own Monday night against The Jay Leno Show and CSI: Miami , this sophomore drama benefits from the laidback performance of Edmontonian Nathan Filion as crime novelist turned sleuth. In tonight's show, a prominent district attorney is murdered and Castle and real-life cop Beckett (Stana Katic) are thrown into the world of violent ex-cons and ladies of the evening.
TUESDAY
NOVEMBER 17
MOVIE
Meet John Doe
TCM, 5:45 p.m.
One of director Frank Capra's more serious films, this 1941 feature is a sharp indictment of media manipulation. Set in a hard-time era, the story casts Gary Cooper as Long John Willoughby, a down-on-his-luck baseball player conscripted by a pushy reporter, played by Barbara Stanwyck, to pose as the apocryphal everyman John Doe in a series of newspaper articles. Scheming publisher D.B Norton (Edward Arnold) sees the potential and founds the John Doe Movement, with the duped Long John going along for the ride - up to a point.
CHILDREN
Merry Madagascar
NBC, 8 p.m.
In the vein of last year's Shrek the Halls , this special places the characters from the animated film hit Madagascar into a feel-good holiday setting. (For newcomers, the original film was about four Central Park Zoo critters transported back to the island of Madagascar.) In this special, Santa (voiced by Carl Reiner) crash-lands on the island and suffers amnesia, leaving the global gift distribution up to lion Alex (Ben Stiller), zebra Marty (Chris Rock), giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer) and hippo Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith). The best news is the participation of the Penguins of Madagascar.
COMEDY
Super Dave's Spike-Tacular
Spike, 9 p.m.
He's back. Comic actor Bob Einstein, seen most recently in a recurring role on HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm , reprises his TV persona of Super Dave Osborne, the self-proclaimed stunt daredevil who takes a licking but keeps on ticking. As with the eighties version, each episode in the four-part series will feature Super Dave attempting some ridiculously dangerous stunt and failing miserably. Guest stars in the coming weeks will include Curb 's Larry David, boxer Sugar Ray Leonard and baseballer Jose Canseco.
REALITY
Table for 12
TLC, 11 p.m.
You think eight kids is tough? Try 10. This TLC series follows the daily existence of Eric and Betty Hayes, who are raising two sets of twins and one sextuplet six-pack. Launched last spring, the series grew in ratings over the summer, possibly because of growing viewer distaste for the Jon and Kate Gosselin imbroglio. And these parents seem like real people - Eric is a New Jersey cop, Betty a stay-at-home mom - with most shows depicting blissful suburban normalcy. The high point in tonight's double-episode run: The family celebrates the sextuplets' preschool graduation.
WEDNESDAY
NOVEMBER 18
MUSIC
Glenn Gould: Hereafter
Bravo!, 4 p.m.
Written and directed by Bruno Monsaingeon - a former confidante of the late pianist - this 2006 film is touching and unique. The program blends archival footage from various TV specials and interviews with people whose lives were changed by Gould's contributions to classical music. There are also several interviews with the great man himself, who, though eccentric, was always extremely well-spoken. The musical performances are, of course, brilliant.
HISTORY
Secrets of Shangri-La
PBS, 8 p.m.
Mountaineer Pete Athans leads an expedition of fellow adventurers on a soul-stirring expedition to the Kingdom of Mustang. Located on a plateau between Nepal and Tibet, Mustang forbade entry to Westerners for more than a half-century. In this special, Athans and his contingent of archeologists, anthropologists and art historians venture into the region's famed caves, which contain wall paintings, sacred texts and ancient human remains.
COMEDY
8 Simple Rules
YTV, 9 p.m.
First broadcast on ABC from 2002 to 2005, this comedy holds up compared to most sitcoms from that era. The show's star was one-time Three's Company regular John Ritter in the role of Paul Hennessey, the wry sports-writer husband of Cate (Katey Sagal) and father of two teen girls and one young son. While the show was never Seinfeld -funny, it was topical and lively, until Ritter died suddenly in 2003. And some episodes steered away from the kids completely: Tonight, Paul fumes when a psychiatrist (Peter Bogdanovich) counsels Cate to restart her singing career.
INTERVIEW
In the Spotlight with Robin Roberts: Janet Jackson
ABC, 10 p.m.
Although Janet Jackson is expected to discuss her late brother Michael in this special, watch instead for the performance of Robin Roberts. TV insiders have already tapped the Good Morning America anchor as the likely replacement for Barbara Walters as ABC's resident celebrity interviewer, should Walters retire in the near future (Babs turned 80 in September). A former college basketball star, Roberts is completely comfortable in front of the camera and, like Walters, knows how to slip in the tough questions between the fluff. Watch her work on Jackson tonight.
THURSDAY
NOVEMBER 19
ART
PhotoXplorers
Bravo!, 7:30 p.m.
The photography field takes on a modernist guerrilla attitude in this low-budget series. The show follows young photographers who sneak behind barricades in order to snap images of abandoned buildings and machinery. Tonight's show visits Luxembourg to capture images of the famed Central Thermique, an imposing facility built in 1951 to produce electricity from the toxic gas of the neighbouring furnaces. The Central Thermique was shut down in 1997, but the enterprising photogs find a way inside.
COMEDY
Parks & Recreation
NBC, CITY-TV, 8:30 p.m.
The consensus among most TV reviewers is that the second campaign of this mockumentary-style sitcom is far improved from the first. The show's creators have pulled back from focusing on Amy Poehler's portrayal of deluded bureaucrat Leslie Knope and allotted more screen time to her talented co-stars, in particular Nick Offerman, who is a delight as Leslie's shiftless boss, Ron. Tonight, Ron is aghast when Leslie invites herself along on his annual hunting excursion.
DRAMA
Grey's Anatomy
ABC, CTV, 9 p.m.
The soapy medical drama jumps the gun with tonight's holiday-themed episode. Set during the festive season, the storyline involves the invasion of meddling fathers: First, Miranda (Chandra Wilson) has to deal with an unexpected visit from her controlling father, then Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) has to rein in her old man from telling the Chief (James Pickens Jr.) how to handle the operating room. Geez, Dad!
PROFILE
Undefeated: The Chuck Ealey Story
WNED, 9 p.m.
A stirring profile of quarterback Chuck Ealey, who spent his entire playing career in the CFL with Hamilton, Winnipeg and Toronto. Born to humble beginnings in Portsmouth, Ohio, Ealey made his name by leading the University of Toledo Rockets to a perfect 35-0 record in the mid-sixties - at a time when there were virtually no African-American quarterbacks in either the college or pro football ranks. The program includes interviews with Ealey and his former teammates.

Full text: The slow gentrification of the heritage neighbourhood is speeding up as design and architecture aficionados latch on
At the corner of Abbott and Cordova streets in Vancouver stands a furniture boutique with the hushed and rarefied atmosphere of a sacred temple. Bulthaup, the city's first outlet of the prestigious German kitchen outfitters, was brought into Gastown by Inform Interiors, the area's long-standing mother ship of retail design. An impossibly well-equipped kitchen-tool cabinet is "focused on practical requirements," according to Bulthaup's lush monograph/catalogue - although to anyone who can ingest the $18,000 price tag, practicality might not be the primary criterion.
To market watchers, the emergence of what might be called extreme design is a harbinger of revitalization for the rest of the 'hood. "Everyone keeps on saying that I'm crazy to do this," says Inform head Niels Bendtsen. "But when I do it and it works, they say, 'Oh, how wonderful!' "
For players such as Inform, who have made the area their professional homes as well as the home of their retail outlets, it also brands their core design business, and enhances their property investment. Inform principal Niels Bendtsen convinced the Bulthaup reps to locate in Gastown rather than pursuing their original preference for the glittery, high-traffic, higher-priced Robson-Thurlow area. It made sense for both their businesses, says Bendtsen.
"It still takes guts to start something here, even today," says Bendtsen. But he's unflappable - and he's doing all right. He reports that, among other products, Bulthaup has sold six full kitchens since it opened in May. That doesn't sound like a bonanza until you take into account that the kitchens run around $150,000.
Bounded by the CPR tracks, Hastings, Columbia and Cambie streets, Gastown is Vancouver's original downtown. Founded in 1867 when steamboat captain (Gassy) Jack Deighton opened the Lower Mainland's first saloon there, it had foundered in recent decades as restrictive zoning and an infusion of tacky tourist shops rendered it an unfashionable backwater. But Gastown has been gentrifying for several years now, as residential zoning has become more flexible, enabling a renovation of its century-old brick office buildings and warehouses.
But just in the last year, the area has assumed the enhanced role of archi-town: both a go-to enclave for architects and designers looking to source products; and a place for them to set up shop. Retailers like Koolhaas, Nood and p + a furniture have moved into the neighbourhood, joining the handful of homesteader design firms that include Propeller and Solus, which had originally moved there for the cheap rent.
"Gastown has become the design epicentre of the city," says Robert Fung, of the Salient Group, one of the main developers in the district. "There's a growing attitude that this area is where all the talent and creative energy of the city lies."
And where creative talents go, higher property values soon follow. While much of Vancouver's condo market has yet to recover from last year's meltdown, Gastown condos have jumped to an average of $440,000 per unit in 2009 - a swift recovery from $380,000 last year, and a notch above the previous high of $439,000 in 2007, according to the Greater Vancouver Real Estate Board.
"Gastown, 10 or 15 years ago - there wasn't much product," says realtor Ed Gramauskas of loftsvancouver.com, who specializes in the neighbourhood. Now, with the Taylor Building, Greenshields, Koret and Woodward's properties on stream, the younger, artsier crowd is moving in.
"The majority of loft buyers aren't shopping at Inform," says Gramauskas, because Inform's price points are usually out of their league. Still, this is the sort of crowd that's attracted to the mere presence of design studios and boutiques. "It's got that cachet of cool now," says Gramauskas.
"The people who are moving into this area have a design aesthetic," adds Royal Lepage realtor Sebastian Albrecht, who is now focusing on selling units from the new Woodward's tower at Abbott and Cordova. "They aren't going to be moving into the West End, for example."
And that other edgy loft-lovers' mecca, Yaletown, has already renovated or built out its existing stock, notes Albrecht. Plus, Yaletown - for better or worse, depending on your perspective - is homogenizing into a polished enclave of well-groomed metrosexuals, much of its erstwhile industrial grime polished away.
Gastown, by contrast, is still overtly gritty - which appeals to both edge seekers and to those who figure they're getting in on the ground floor. "There are two camps," notes Albrecht, "some who like the grit, and others who hope it's going to go away."
"I don't think it's gentrification in the negative sense," says Fung. "It's more about finding the balance." Not only is the neighbourhood maintaining housing stock for a diversity of income groups, he notes, it's also maintaining a "homegrown" design initiative, driven by locally based designers such as shoe designer John Fluevog, who opened his new flagship store across the street from Inform; and renowned interior designer Shelley Penner, who recently opened a studio-cum-retail outlet - p + a furniture - on the area's southwestern periphery.
Earlier this year, Penner made the leap from a home office to a prominent setting in the restored Flack Block at Hastings and Cambie streets, prompted by the growing influx of other design outlets in the area. "Gastown has become a real furniture hub for the city," notes Penner. "I opened p + a to offer not just furniture, but also home and personal accessories, with a sustainability theme." Crucially, p + a addresses that lust for sustainable cool at all points of the price spectrum, offering everything from $3,000 eucalyptus king-size headboards to $31 aromatic soy-wax candles.
Inform Projects partner Harvey Rehal adds that Gastown is becoming a design epicentre far beyond the Lower Mainland. "We're not just talking local," says Rehal. "We're talking about Alberta, Quebec, areas of the United States, all coming down here to see what's there.
Now that the A & D community is digging in its heels, says Rehal, it's enhancing the rest of the neighbourhood as well. "The real-estate value is increasing because people are coming out and opening up really good shops. ... It's no longer just us, with a T-shirt shop and a bad coffee shop next door."

Wal-Mart's lopsided global comeback

Full text: Retailer posts profit increase as international sales offset losses and deflation in 'anemic' U.S. market
There's barely a hint of the worst recession since the Second World War in Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s third-quarter results: Profit and revenue are firmly on the rise again.
Scratch a little deeper, however, and the picture is quite different.
The U.S. market is flat, while the rest of the world is in full recovery mood.
Wal-Mart, like other major international retailers, is experiencing a very lopsided global comeback. In the United States, sales are down, it's facing double-digit deflation in food and electronics prices and the holiday season is looking pretty grim.
Elsewhere in the world, it's almost as if the Great Recession never happened.
Wal-Mart's sales fell 0.5 per cent in the United States on a same-store basis, but shot up 12.1 per cent in the rest of the world, including gains in Canada, Britain, Mexico and China (measured in local currency).
Economists say the world is recovering much more quickly than the United States, where the housing collapse helped trigger a global recession.
"The United States looks kind of anemic compared to other places in the world," agreed Bill Cheney, chief economist at MFC Global Investment Management in Boston. "But I think it's going to catch up over the next few quarters."
More than other countries, the United States is facing some tough economic conditions that have put consumers in a frugal mood. During the boom, Americans overindulged on everything from cars to cellphones - much of it on borrowed money. But after the bursting of the stock and real estate markets, credit is hard to get and people are rebuilding their savings.
The key is the job market, according to Mr. Cheney. Unemployment has pushed past 10 per cent and the job market continues to shrink. Until the economy starts creating new jobs, consumers are likely to remain very cautious, he said.
Mr. Cheney expects the economy to begin creating jobs over the next few months, giving a much needed lift to the U.S. economy.
For now, however, gone are the days when shoppers would buy first and ask about the price later. Wal-Mart executives said price deflation is back.
Wal-Mart, often considered a barometer of the U.S. consumer, surprised analysts yesterday by reporting a better-than-expected profit of $3.24-billion (U.S.), or 84 cents a share, in the third quarter, up from $3.14-billion last year. Revenue rose to $99.4-billion from $98.3-billion.
The world's largest retailer isn't alone in experiencing the sharp dichotomy between the United States and the rest of the world.
McDonald's Corp. said earlier this week that its U.S. sales were flat in October (at stores open at least 13 months). Comparable sales in local currencies rose 6.4 per cent in Europe and 4.7 per cent in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
At Wal-Mart, senior executives warned that U.S. sales in the critical fourth quarter could fall by as much as 1 per cent as customers fret about their jobs and their finances.
"We continue to operate in a very difficult economic environment," chief financial officer Tom Schoewe warned.
Particularly challenging for Wal-Mart is the sudden appearance of price deflation, said Eduardo Castro-Wright, vice-chairman and head of the company's U.S. operations. Deflation is the main reason its U.S. sales are down.
"Price deflation ... was well beyond what we had expected across many food categories as well as electronics," Mr. Castro-Wright said on a conference call with reporters and analysts. "Customers are very price focused today."
Wal-Mart said the trend is particularly evident in flat-screen TVs - one of its top-selling items. Wal-Mart sold 25 per cent more of them in the July-to-September quarter, but sales actually declined in single digits, according to Wal-Mart.
The average TV sells for 20 per cent less than it did last year.
It was a similar story in Wal-Mart's grocery aisles, where prices for meat, produce and dairy were all down sharply. Last year at this time, the talk was all about rising food prices.
Wal-Mart executives warned that deflation would likely persist for the next couple of quarters.

China sets plan to let currency move higher

Author: Hoffman, Andy; McKenna, Barrie

Abstract: "The currency issue is a popular thing to talk about," Mr. [Charles Freeman] added. "But as far as the U.S., Canada and the rest of the developed world is concerned, it doesn't matter to us whether the products are assembled in China or Vietnam, we're still going to have a deficit with Asia."

Full text: Under pressure from trading partners, Beijing signals new policy on yuan
China signalled it will allow its currency to appreciate against the U.S. dollar, bowing to international pressure days ahead of a visit from U.S. President Barack Obama.
The move to allow the yuan to rise against the greenback would provide much-needed relief to countries trying to compete against China's mighty export machine and put further downward pressure on an already battered U.S. dollar.
China's latest quarterly monetary policy report said its foreign exchange policy will now consider "capital flows and changes in major currencies," indicating China will carefully expose the yuan's value to fluctuations in global markets.
The statement avoided the government's usual boilerplate language of keeping the yuan "basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level."
China's trading partners have complained the government keeps the yuan at artificially low levels, providing an unfair price advantage for China's goods as they compete for market share around the world. Until now, China has largely ignored calls for greater currency flexibility.
The decision to allow the yuan to climb also points to the maturing of China's rapidly expanding economy, while giving its people and companies more purchasing power for goods and assets produced outside the country.
"China is exporting blood and sweat and importing copper and oil. Is that really good in the long term? You are sacrificing the local people's purchasing power in pursuing export growth," said Na Liu, China analyst at Scotia Capital.
The rise in the yuan is expected to be gradual and is not likely to occur until next year. Still, China is likely to quickly draw increased capital flows into the country as international investors aim to benefit from an eventual rise in the currency and local assets. But that trend brings the risk of potential unsustainable bubbles in its real estate and stock markets.
Other Asian exporting countries such as South Korea, Singapore and Thailand, which should be able to compete better with China as the yuan appreciates, are likely to follow suit and let their currencies appreciate as well.
"A little gradual appreciation in the yuan will not naturally hurt China's exports because other Asian countries will follow," Mr. Liu said.
China's currency has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since July of 2008 in an effort to shield exports from the global recession. But the latest economic data released yesterday suggest a recovery is well under way in China. Industrial production rose 16.1 per cent in October, the most since March of 2008. Exports declined 13.8 per cent, the smallest drop recorded this year.
"It was inevitable," Benjamin Reitzes, an economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns said of China's hint it will shift its foreign exchange policy.
"The reason they can do it now is because they see external demand from the global economy is improving," he added.
Most G20 nations have been unhappy with China pegging the yuan to the U.S. dollar and many have publicly criticized the policy for exaggerating the trade imbalance between China and the United States. China revalued its currency in 2005, allowing the yuan to appreciate 21 per cent against the U.S. dollar before halting the rise in the middle of last year.
The latest Chinese announcement, coming just days before Mr. Obama is due to make his first visit to Beijing, is as much about politics as economics, experts said.
Charles Freeman, a former assistant U.S. trade representative for China, said the Chinese are willing to let the Americans get something to show the U.S. Congress they're working to defuse trade tensions. But "precipitous growth" in the value of the yuan is unlikely, he added.
"We're going back to the slow march that we had before China started really worrying about their own economic recovery," said Mr. Freeman, who now holds the China chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
"It's a cautious, go-slow approach. If their exports slow a lot and domestic demand weakens, the Chinese will slow appreciation of the yuan again."
And any impact on Chinese exports or the U.S. trade deficit with China is likely to be small. Mr. Freeman pointed out that, as the yuan appreciated against the U.S. dollar and other currencies after 2005, China's current account surplus kept growing and the U.S. trade deficit continued to swell.
"The currency issue is a popular thing to talk about," Mr. Freeman added. "But as far as the U.S., Canada and the rest of the developed world is concerned, it doesn't matter to us whether the products are assembled in China or Vietnam, we're still going to have a deficit with Asia."
But others see more sinister motives in the Chinese move. By resuming a yuan peg to a basket of international currencies, the biggest winner is likely to be the euro, not the dollar, said Peter Morici, former chief economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission. "That makes it more difficult for the Americans to complain, and the Europeans less likely to help lobby the Chinese," he said.
Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said China is caught in a "dollar trap." It has as much as $1.6-trillion worth of U.S. dollar reserves and there are few options to diversify into other currencies. More worrying to them than a slightly higher yuan, he said, is the prospect of a more precipitous erosion in the value of the dollar, weighed down by U.S. inflation and swelling budget deficits. A falling dollar means China will take hefty losses on those reserves, Mr. Lardy pointed out.

Love in the time of bloggeria

Full text: The city's First Couple of online confession break up, go silent and then go ballistic
Breakups are difficult when you live together. They're very difficult when you're engaged. And they're next to impossible when thousands of people are monitoring the relationship wreckage on both your blogs and Twitter feeds, through a Facebook profile and a Flickr page. So when the First Couple of the Toronto blog scene, 26-year-old Lauren White of "Raymi the Minx" and 34-year-old photographer "Phil Ogynist," an online handle, broke off their engagement, neither one blogged the details.
Until this week, that is, when Mr. Ogynist's veiled references to the breakup prompted Ms. White to violate her vow of silence with a stream-of-consciousness rant that accused her former fiancé of, among other things, extreme difficulties with real-world connection. "I could no longer tolerate being shut out emotionally," Ms. White wrote. "My spirit had had enough." Aside from changing his Facebook status to "single," Mr. Ogynist still declines to overtly blog about the details. "I don't want to have a fight back and forth, between our blogs," Mr. Ogynist said in an interview. "It's distasteful. To me, it cheapens the relationship we had for five years."
The breakup has created something of a tempest in the local blogging fishbowl because the pair's relationship had, at least from the outside, seemed ideal. Ms. White was already a well-known online diarist when she met her future fiancé five years ago. Her looks, her writing ability and serviceable photography skills generated a following, as did her penchant for compulsive disclosure; she wrote about everything from her suspected mental disorders to postprandial gas cramps. The other component to her notoriety was her perseverance. While others gradually grew disillusioned with their blogs or developed other interests, Ms. White maintained her steady habit, posting once a day - at least - most weeks, and sometimes more. "Her dedication to self-portraiture is what's interesting," says Hal Niedzviecki, Toronto author of The Peep Diaries: How We're Learning to Love Watching Ourselves and Our Neighbors . "She's very much the epitome of the committed, addicted blogger - no real gift to speak of, besides this intense need for attention. And she thrives on it."
Part of the attraction lay in the fact that Ms. White was a bit of a mess - providing scoops on job departures and one-night stands and the insecurities she developed as a result. And then, five years ago, she met Mr. Ogynist, a staffer for a real-estate development company; their parents were mutual friends. Through repeated links on Ms. White's blog, Mr. Ogynist's photo blog gained a following.
Some diehard readers complained that Ms. White's blog had lost the drama that made it interesting. But with her companion also compulsively posting, in part to further his moonlighting pursuit as a concert photographer, the two journals made for fascinating reading. The result was a profoundly addictive portrait of a glamorous, urban couple, read frequently by such well-known fans as the Barenaked Ladies' drummer, Tyler Stewart, and the songwriter Matthew Good. The couple's engagement last February was almost anti-climactic, it was so expected.
But then in recent weeks, Ms. White was posting about a new bedroom and complaining about the disadvantages of having moved to the 'burbs, to a subdivision in Burlington. Readers rightly realized the pair had ended their relationship. That prompted a fascinating debate about the blogger's responsibility toward the readership - and who was to blame for the relationship's conclusion. Some said that Raymi the Minx was a fictional construct, a manifestation Ms. White created and maintained at her discretion. "Don't ever feel like you owe the ... internet anything, explanations or otherwise," said one of Ms. White's online fans calling himself "Josh." "Worry about making yourself happy," he wrote. If the internet doesn't like it, he added, the internet can do something profane with itself.
And then there was the other side - Raymi the Minx was interesting because of Ms. White's honesty. By not posting about an important event, she was diluting the rawness that had created her online following. "Basically, I don't care," said Ms. White, perhaps facetiously, as she sipped from an early afternoon Coors Light in a pub a block from her new home. "What I talk about online is my business."
At least in the short term, the breakup appears to have done Ms. White some good. "My traffic is three times what it was when I was with Phil," she says. Breaking up may be hard to do, but for a blogger, apparently, it's good for business.

Full text:   Threatened by climate change, the Gwitchin of Old Crow reflect on the links between the Olympic flame and their own age-old values
As the migration of the Olympic flame continued north, it landed in a town that knows something about the vagaries of epic journeys.
Old Crow is one of the most remote communities the flame has ever visited. Situated on the banks of the Porcupine River in the northwest corner of the Yukon, it is accessible only by air or, in summer, by boat. The torch arrived here yesterday aboard a 737, the first time a jet has ever landed on the town's gravel runway. It was a big enough deal that residents stood in their backyards snapping pictures as the plane touched down.
Like in much of the Far North, the landscapes here stretch forever. Pine trees stand stick-straight atop snow-covered mountains. It is in this paradise that the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nations have lived off the land for hundreds of years.
It is a lifestyle that is now threatened.
Arctic warming is affecting the migration patterns of the Porcupine caribou. It would be difficult to overstate how big a role the caribou plays in the lives of the people of Old Crow. In their mythology, the Gwitchin derived from a heart shared with a caribou.
The caribou has roamed the northwestern plains for centuries. Scientists have determined it grazed beside mastodons and woolly mammoths. It has provided the Gwitchin with their main source of meat and hide for boots, moccasins and mitts. Every part of the caribou is used for something.
But their numbers are down. The route the caribou herds take each year from their calving grounds in Alaska, south past Old Crow in the fall, have become less predictable. Two years ago, the animals missed Old Crow altogether and inexplicably circled back to Alaska.
As he watched members of his band set up for a community celebration in honour of the torch's arrival, Chief Joe Linklater worried aloud for the future of his people. No one is sure why caribou numbers are down. But traditional feeding grounds have been overtaken by willows and weeds. The flora and fauna that the caribou feast on is growing much further north.
This is why some are now wondering how much longer the Gwitchin can maintain their traditional ways.
"I think it has caused a great deal of stress in the community," said the Chief. "It is especially difficult for the young people. Our identity has always been tied up with the caribou, our heritage, our cultural identity.
"Now there is a real question of whether there will be caribou to hunt and salmon to fish. Salmon numbers are down considerably too."
Chief Linklater is one of the territory's more impressive young native leaders. Since the Gwitchin signed a self-government agreement several years ago, Mr. Linklater has led a management team that has invested the organization's treaty money wisely.
It has a 48.6-per-cent share of Air North, the most successful carrier in the Far North. The Gwitchin also hold extensive real estate holdings in Whitehorse. The chief is passionate about climate change and plans to attend the United Nations conference on the crisis in Copenhagen in December.
But he is also a committed Canadian, one who proudly displayed his excitement about the Olympic flame's arrival. He called it a great honour, a recognition of Old Crow's uniqueness. He thought it would make young people feel good that others appeared to care about their town.
The Gwitchin hosted a torch celebration at the local school. It included a fashion show and musical presentation by a group of fiddlers and guitarists. There was a traditional feast of caribou, salmon and bannock.
The most compelling moment of the afternoon, however, occurred when a young man named Kyikavichik took to the stage to tell the story of his ancestors. He praised them for the hard life they endured. He talked about the fences they erected in -50 degree temperatures to help corral caribou. He told the audience that when anyone enjoyed a particularly bountiful kill, they shared their meat with others.
Kyikavichik's cadence and timing was impeccable. The gym was stone silent as he spoke.
He compared the obstacles and challenges that his ancestors faced, and their sharing nature, with the torch relay. The relay was founded on the notion of sharing, he said, and had its own share of hurdles to confront as well.
"For that reason," he said, "I can't think of a better place for the torch to visit."

Full text:   From Wall Street reform to climate change, Chamber of Commerce increasingly at odds with White House
bmckenna@globeandmail.com
Newsflash: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, bastion of Big Business and free enterprise, drops its staunch opposition to climate change legislation and embraces a carbon tax.
It is, of course, untrue.
But for a brief interlude last month, that's exactly what CNBC, Reuters, The New York Times and other major media organizations were breathlessly reporting.
It was all a hoax perpetrated by the activist satirical group the Yes Men. The group issued a phony press release, gathered reporters at the National Press Club in Washington and then dropped the bombshell: "We at the chamber have tried to keep climate science from interfering with business," a phony spokesman, later identified as Yes Man Andy Bichlbaum, told the assemblage. "But without a stable climate, there will be no business."
It all ended in a farce moments later when an angry - and real - chamber official, tipped off to the stunt, walked in on the skit and declared that it was all a fraud.
It was a low moment in a lousy year for the largest U.S. business organization. The chamber now finds itself at odds with U.S. President Barack Obama and the Democratic-held Congress on virtually every major issue - from climate change and health care to overhauling regulation of Wall Street and economic stimulus.
Everywhere the chamber looks, free enterprise is under assault.
And the chamber is fighting back, spending millions on television ads and lobbying to block Mr. Obama's agenda.
In many respects, the venerable Chamber of Commerce is the face of American business. Its imposing limestone headquarters, with its three-story Corinthian columns, occupies one of the choicest pieces of real estate in Washington, D.C. - directly across Lafayette Park from the White House and a stone's throw from the lobbyists on K Street.
Its three million members, including those who belong via their local chambers of commerce, are the U.S. establishment. They are the local bank manager, the stock broker, the department store owner, the factory boss and the landlord.
They don't like taxes or regulation. They are overwhelmingly Republican. (The chamber routinely backs GOP candidates at election time).
And they don't like the way Mr. Obama is running the country.
The animosity is apparently mutual. More than just a protagonist, the chamber has become a target of the White House.
In recent months, the White House has been actively working to marginalize the chamber, which it sees as a political enemy, as much as policy foe.
Just as George W. Bush liked to speak directly to workers, circumventing organized labour, Mr. Obama is reaching out directly to key chief executives. While shunning the likes of chamber president Thomas Donohue, Mr. Obama has held private chats with the CEOs of IBM, Wal-Mart, Time Warner, Kraft, Eastman Kodak and Coca-Cola.
The White House has openly questioned whether the chamber really represents the business community, as it once did.
"They're very good at this, because that's how business has been done in Washington for a very long time," Mr. Obama said last month of the chamber's efforts to block the creation of a consumer financial regulator. "In fact, over the last 10 years, the chamber alone has spent nearly a half a billion dollars on lobbying - half a billion dollars."
Mr. Obama's divide and conquer strategy has produced some casualties. Under pressure from environmental groups, a handful of large member companies have quit the group this year over its climate change stance, including Apple, PG & E, PNM Resources and Exelon.
A number of other members are disgruntled, but for now are sticking with the chamber because of its lobbying efforts in other areas, such as free trade. Nike resigned from the chamber's board, Duke Energy has slashed contributions and Siemens has demanded to be consulted about future climate change ads.
The chamber is unapologetic and defiant. And it isn't going to be quieted because its Washington neighbour, Mr. Obama, is upset.
"Let's be clear, we haven't raised up the Cain. It came from the other side of the street," Bruce Josten, the chamber's top lobbyist, told Fox News Sunday . "We're not going to take the bait and engage in a name-calling campaign of invectives back and forth. We're going to stay focused."
The war of words isn't just about climate change, Wall Street regulation or health care reform - all of which are facing stiff resistance in Congress.
It's also about who will call the shots after next year's mid-term Congressional elections, and beyond that, 2012, when Mr. Obama seeks a second term.

Full text:   Hundreds turn out to cheer in tough, historic Cumberland - including a 94-year-old who once raced Olympic legend Jesse Owens
This is a hard, old town. Always has been. When visiting basketball teams came to play, local toughs would line up outside their dressing room. If anyone played too well, they risked being beaten up after the game in the darkened parking lot.
When someone from Port Alberni shoved a Cumberland player into the wall one time, the ensuing brawl brought the fire truck and sent half a dozen people to hospital.
Years later, the Vancouver Island community, its history steeped in the coal mines that ran until the 1960s, is on the verge of big changes from a series of pending, real estate developments. But it's still Cumberland.
Just on Saturday, police were called to a Halloween dance at the same 75-year-old rec hall with the horsehair floor where they play basketball, after youths began hurling firecrackers at the folks in charge of security.
So, it was no surprise, really, that the arrival of the Olympic torch here yesterday produced the first protest signs since the flame caravan left Victoria last Friday.
And 82-year-old Bronco Moncrief, who served more than 30 years as mayor of Cumberland and is still on town council, decided he had better things to do than show up.
"I'll be going over to take a look at how the boys are putting in the new water system," Mr. Moncrief said.
There's more to historic Cumberland, of course, than its attitude. This is a tight community with deep roots, plenty of spirit and a big heart. There's a lot of love here. Talk to anyone and they wouldn't live anywhere else in the world.
"My husband bought a house here 22 years ago, thinking he would renovate and flip it," said Marlene Pearce. "Except we never left. It's just so lovely here."
Hundreds lined the road through town to welcome the torch, including retired junior high school principal David Vranjes. This being Cumberland, of course, Mr. Vranjes, 57, shunned any sign of rah-rah red and white. He showed up in virtual full Goth - black T-shirt, black jacket, black jeans and big black boots.
"If there's a funeral, everyone comes, and for something like this, everyone comes," Mr. Vranjes said. "Community spirit has a long tradition here.'
Also along the road was the town's remarkable nonagenarian, John Bannermann, about to turn 95. But being close to the Olympics is old hat for Mr. Bannerman, owner of the local dry goods store for years.
Mr. Bannerman once raced against the legendary Jesse Owens, the black American who famously won four gold medals at the so-called Hitler Summer Olympics in Berlin.
It happened when Mr. Owens came to Cumberland with the Harlem Globetrotters touring basketball team a few years after the 1936 Games. He challenged the athletic Mr. Bannerman and his brother to a race - one end of the basketball court to the other.
They changed into their shorts, got down for the start, and whoosh, there went Mr. Owens. "I got a pretty good view of his rear end," Mr. Bannerman said with a laugh, as he waited for the torch arrival.
"He was a prince of a guy. We were sitting around in the dressing room afterwards, and he offered me a beer. Jesse said: 'It's got a lot of that Vitamin Pee.' "
When the Olympic flame finally showed, Mr. Bannerman clapped as hard as anyone. "That was good, boy. I guess I'll never see another one in Cumberland."
Like so many B.C. communities, Cumberland is fighting for its economic life. But there's a difference here, said Mr. Moncrief, the long-time former mayor.
Development is on the way, and besides, he said, "We're so used to recession, we've been saying for years the only way Cumberland can go is up."
As for the town's legendary toughness? Pshaw, said Mr. Moncrief. "Yes, we might tell you to go to hell, but in such a way, you'll look forward to the trip."

Full text:   Home-grown product not only can beat the offshore competition, but also keep jobs and talent in Canada
gpitts@globeandmail.com
If Canada is to have an economic future, it needs bosses like Geoff Flood, president of the technology services firm T4G Ltd., of Toronto. T4G is a private company with 230 people, but it makes a big imprint selling Canadian skills across North America and providing a chance for knowledge workers to live and work where they want. The New Brunswick-born Mr. Flood is a vocal critic of the current taste for shipping IT work to low-cost offshore sites without giving Canadians an opportunity to do it better.
You are based in Toronto, but you have people in several Atlantic cities and in Vancouver. Why these dispersed locations?
We have a strategy of locating where smart people want to live. All of these cities, Toronto included, fit that bill. There is a limit to the technology resource in the country, and we need to go where bright people want to live and can thrive.
What does your company do?
We're a project-based company that builds technology solutions for enterprise customers across North America. In this business, the typical strategy would be to locate ourselves where the customers are. But because there is a shortage of great technology people, we need to go to where they are, where they want to live, where they are most productive, where they are happiest. We build teams in those cities but have them service customers across North America
For example, our largest customer is in Atlanta and the work is being done in Halifax. It is a good export business; it's good for the talent in Halifax.
Isn't that the opposite of the old Canadian model whereby people move to where the work is - whether Fort McMurray or any mining town? We're in a business where we can live anywhere and work anywhere, and we don't really care where it happens. It's 24/7, it's fast-paced but if you can do it in your kitchen, we don't have a problem. We provide communities that have a great living environment with the chance to add new workers.
In Vancouver's case, haven't you got some contracts, as well?
We don't typically look for the customers in the local city. We think it is better to be in the export business and compete on a larger scale, but it's really nice if you can work at home.
We've been in Vancouver seven years, and our first customer was Tourism British Columbia, for whom we built a system that presents all their operations, properties and tourist attractions globally in many languages. I would argue it's probably the best destination management system in the world.
And the Olympics are a big part of it. Tourism BC is responsible for building and managing accommodations from a technology perspective, and we're the contractor that did the work behind the scenes.
Has the recession affected you?
We didn't make our plan this year but the plan was quite aggressive. We are ahead of last year, and we think the market has turned. We are in the fortunate position of doing hard surgery for customers - the things critical to the success of their business. You can't stop that even in the worst recession. We have a very large customer which cut its IT budget from $1-billion to half a billion dollars. They doubled our allotment.
I think our strategy is working, which is to find the smart people who can write the book on what they do in another location and set them up to recruit like-minded individuals in their town.
You've mentioned Saskatoon as a possible target.
Saskatoon is a perfect example of a town with great talent, highly productive work force, people who love living there, and who are as good as anybody in the world. What we need is the key person or persons around whom we can build a team and build an export professional-services business in North America. That's the top of our list but we would welcome other cities, Lethbridge or whatever, to come and knock on our door.
Shouldn't you be in India, where you can slash costs?
Most people would think there is some sense to doing that. But at this point the pendulum is swinging back. I don't think the cost advantage is there in the way it might have been 10 years ago. Even for low-cost commodity kinds of work, we're on about par. And we want to do the hard stuff, the creative stuff, and you tend to find more of the resources to accomplish that in North America.
I have a nationalist point of view on that: I don't get it. We shouldn't be exporting all of these high-value knowledge jobs to other parts of the world. We will become a nation of fast-food workers, if we're not careful.
A better strategy is to have a near-shore, small-town product where the total customer value is as good or better. But we would retain in North America the lock on creativity and intellectual ability that is still our biggest source of strength.
But India has well-educated, creative people.
They are very good. I am taking nothing away from them, but it is a competitive global economy. We've got to look out for ourselves. We're very good, as well.
We have to be better and so do they. The global competition is wonderful, and it's something we need to be able to work with. But in the area where we work, we have a competitive advantage.
Are you benefiting from the government stimulus packages?
I don't think so. I don't see it directly. It doesn't apply.
But isn't this an opportunity to invest in technology that builds the future, instead of the old roads-and-bridges approach?
I think you're right. Certainly, digital infrastructure is at least as important, if not more important, than the normal infrastructure we think of. There is a whole class of faster return-on-investment solutions that we need to reduce [government] costs and empower the consumer or the citizen to look after their own issues more effectively.
We have to take costs out of government in a very significant way. We all know that. But we haven't come to grips with the fact that all these technologies are proceeding at a rapid pace and enable us to do that.
Customer self-service in government is a no-brainer. Let's do that now and dissolve the large bureaucracies that are really ineffectual in the modern world. Citizen democracy is something that interests me, as well as the ability to accelerate the speed of turnaround, feedback and progress [in government].
So this is another Geoff Flood, a guy driven by causes?
The people in our business may be geeky in some sense, but we do think, naively or not, that we can change the world. As good technology people, we can see the opportunity to make things better, and for us, that opportunity is increasing.
It starts with serving our customers, with the idea that "I can help you succeed better by doing this or that." The same thing applies to society. In our company, it is pretty critical that people really want to make a difference. And they stay here because we believe we have an obligation to do more than just make a profit. We can offer that.
Has your support for causes been affected by the recession?
This year, a little bit. Over the past four to five years, we've raised about $1-million in our small company for organizations we support. We took a step back. The level of involvement has increased, but I think the amount of fundraising is a little slower.
What's the future of T4G?
The idea is to have people say, "I want to work for that company" or "I want to have them work for me." Or "How do they do that? I want to do some of that." It has to do with culture and passion.
After the dot-com collapse, we emerged as a place to go. Now, coming out of this recession, we want to go to other cities, find these people and have them join the team. The [locations] are just real estate and that's the easy thing. The important thing is the high-performing team. There is more to building it than just hiring people.

Full text:   Restoration of heritage structures would be done in two phases, first with city dollars and later with private funds
CITY HALL BUREAU CHIEF
A private developer holds the key to a proposed rescue of the iconic grain silos at the western edge of Toronto's central waterfront.
On Monday, at Mayor David Miller's executive committee, city officials are expected to lay out a plan to restore the former Canadian Malting silos that, a mere two months ago, were at risk of being razed.
What's changed? A fresh plan by the cash-strapped city to invest public and private dollars to preserve heritage structures of a bygone industrial era that could define the future of Toronto's waterfront.
"We think the preservation of these Canadian Malting silos is important and we have to think creatively about how to do that," says the city's chief planner, Gary Wright. If retained, the giant silos on city-owned land would serve as bookends to privately held silos now being integrated into the new East Bayfront neighbourhood at the eastern edge of the central waterfront.
In September, the city abandoned plans for a $100-million history museum at the foot of Bathurst Street near Queens Quay Boulevard, with the city's chief corporate office for facilities and real estate recommending the silos be torn down for $8.4-million, leaving only a "symbolic outline."
Two factors weighed against preserving the iconic structures: the global recession and the emergence of Old City Hall, with its downtown, tourist-friendly location, as a possible venue for the Toronto Museum Project. With the possible relocation of the museum, there was no public investment to jump-start a restoration of the silos. As important, the economic downturn cooled developer interest in a possible waterfront condo and hotel on the 1.4-hectare site at Eireann Quay.
"The combination of the economic pause and the availability of Old City Hall is why we have moved our sights to that site," says Rita Davies, director of cultural services for the city.
The proposal to the executive committee comes with backing from city departments that previously had clashed over whether to destroy the silos. The new plan would be carried out in two phases, first with city dollars and later with private funds.
In the first phase, the city would spend almost $12-million (already in the 2009 operating budget) to demolish smaller, derelict buildings west of the silos built in 1929 and 1944, repair sections of the dock wall and secure safe public access to nearby Ireland Park.
In the second phase, city planners would begin work next year on a "master plan," including Official Plan amendments to permit residential use south of Queens Quay, for a little more housing and a lot more commercial and retail development in the neighbourhood.
A report would go to the new council in 2011, outlining the sale of a portion of the site to a private developer for a small-scale condo/retail project. That land sale could generate a chunk of an estimated $10-million in additional funds the city needs to refurbish the silos and improve public access to the water's edge.
Still, some councillors are skeptical the city can afford to restore the silos.
"It is nice to preserve things but you can't preserve everything," says councillor Doug Holyday (Ward 3, Etobicoke Centre). "This is valuable property we should be doing something about."
Local councillor Adam Vaughan (Ward 20, Trinity-Spadina), disagrees. He held meetings recently to gauge enthusiasm for future private investment that could include a small-scale condo development, new retail and possibly a neighbourhood movie house and swimming pool.
"That sort of development might provide the money required to do the total preservation," Mr. Vaughan says. "We're now trying to figure out the economics and see if that generates the money that is required.
"If it does, we are off to the races," he predicts.

Thinking small in the Okanagan

Author: Hadani Ditmars

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/thinking-small-okanagan/docview/382613368/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The site is laid out in the style of an English village - a very high-end English village in a Mediterranean climate. It begins with a gatehouse that will include a wine and antique shop, and extends to the central residential area designed in "village green" style, where nine homes will be built around a cascading two-level pool and adjacent to a tennis court and croquet area.

Full text:   One developer goes against the prevailing impulse to build big and bigger
The Okanagan, with its ochre hills and abundant blue lakes, has always been a prime location for recreational properties.
But in the past decade, Kelowna, its epicentre, has morphed from sleepy hamlet to development-mad hot spot, where strip malls and highways have replaced small-town charm.
Cheap and not-so-cheap condo developments have sprouted like mushrooms, while a lack of infrastructure to support a growing population means big-city gridlock at rush hour. Some new high-rise projects near the waterfront look promising, but a growing underclass of street people is a sharp reminder of the perils of rapid growth.
Yet only 20 minutes away, the bucolic community of Peachland - a farming community celebrating its 100th anniversary this year - is an altogether different story.
Here, a small population and strict bylaws have preserved the area's community feel and attractive wilderness areas. And here, like the maturing vines that have made the area Canada's hottest new wine country, the Okanagan's recreational property and hotel culture is coming of age.
Trepanier Manor is a new hotel and residential development that seems to have done everything right.
Strict due diligence on everything from environmental impact to native burial sites and dinosaur bones, as well as on-going community consultation, have won the developers respect and admiration from the notoriously finicky community, who guard their turf passionately.
It's also won Trepanier - the only five-star hotel in the area - the privilege of joining the "Small Luxury Hotels of the World" brand.
The 44-suite hotel, with 20 separate residences, combines Old World charm with New World luxury (think English country cottages with deep Kohler tubs and high-pressure shower heads), and manages to do so with a relatively small footprint.
The brainchild of Scott Wilshaw, a British hotelier who ran the Emerson Resort in the Catskills and the Judges Country House hotel in Yorkshire, Trepanier was designed by architect John Sproule as the antithesis of the monster homes (and monster resorts) that sadly have wound their way into the local vernacular.
"Some of the buyers for the Trepanier homes [which average 2,000 square feet]," explains Mr. Sproule, "are rethinking the idea of a 6,000-square-foot residence - both in terms of being green - but also more pragmatically in terms of easier upkeep."
And Mr. Sproule's architectural vision - a modern, North American take on the English country cottage - offers residences that are cozily retro, but spacious-feeling, light-filled and open to the surrounding environment.
Consider the Falcon, one of three prototypes, which comes complete with a guest cottage. Zanzibar antique elm flooring contrasts with wainscoting details at the entrance, while extensive glazing and 14-foot open-beam ceilings offer light and space.
The Old World/New World fusion is done seamlessly, with any sense of jarring dislocation or unfortunate pastiche notably absent.
The Canadian wilderness nature of the site is undeniable. Located on 25 acres of Tabletop Mountain, on a dramatic ridgeline carved by glaciers into steep slopes, the site descends south toward Lake Okanagan, with views of Rattlesnake Island and provincial parkland.
A creek that was shut down by the building of the Coquihalla Highway is being revived, and the site contains extensive forest and a deer corridor. Rather extraordinarily, more than 90 per cent of the site will remain unbuilt, with most of it retained as gardens or vineyards integrated into the natural landscape buffer.
The site is laid out in the style of an English village - a very high-end English village in a Mediterranean climate. It begins with a gatehouse that will include a wine and antique shop, and extends to the central residential area designed in "village green" style, where nine homes will be built around a cascading two-level pool and adjacent to a tennis court and croquet area. As the site descends toward the lake, clusters of homes in twos and threes follow the undulating road, culminating in the hotel and vineyard, built into the ridge. At each juncture there will be an almost theatrical sense of "set piece" that will allow for contemplation of both natural and aesthetic beauty.
In the residences, nods to the outdoor lifestyle of the area are seen in features such as the outdoor courtyards with open-range grills off the more traditional English-style kitchen (complete with an AGA-evocative Bertazzoni stove, and grey brick detailing) and showers in the terraced garden area.
Aesthetically, Mr. Sproule bridges the gap between old and new by using local materials, such as a Kettle Valley stone with a warm, amber undertone, for the hearth.
On a pragmatic level, building materials such as stone, stucco, tile and metal are naturally fire-resistant. And in a neat confluence of aesthetics and practicality, the manor concept - calling for the introduction of roads, Old World-style gardens and character vineyards - also creates "fire breaks" that are so essential in the arid environment.
The scale and massing of the cottages creates a magical interior ambience, while European-style roof tiles are concrete, rather than slate, for longevity and protection from sun and fire.
Extensive glazing brings the outside in, while the multi-paned windows with wood detailing speak to the traditional cottage style.
While the 1,600-square-foot Falcon home is a surprisingly spacious-feeling delight, the romantic choice would be the adjoining 500-square-foot "guest cottage." With its nod to the Small is Beautiful aesthetic, it wins the charm award hands down against any nearby monster home.
While evoking somebody's granny's cottage in Devon with a wood-burning fireplace and retro fixtures, it also offers a luxurious soaker tub, windows that let in light and view, and, of course, central heating! Who says you can't have the best of both worlds?

BUILDER: SigNature Developments
SIZE: 670 to 1,600 square feet
PRICE: $189,000 to over $399,000
SALES CENTRE: 6048 Highway 9, west of Highway 27. Open Monday to Thursday from noon to 6 p.m.; Fridays by appointment; weekends from noon to 5 p.m.

Buyers who missed a small window of opportunity to live mortgage-free for one year in a riverside condominium in Schomberg - a small town 15 minutes north of Vaughan - will get another chance until the end of this month.
SigNature Developments recently extended a promotion at Triumph North where they will pay both the interest and principal up to a limit of $20,000.
Or buyers can make a ten per cent down payment in cash and receive up to $15,000 in a cash back rebate.
"It's been well received," says development manager, Sebastian Mizzi, who estimates that nearly a fifth of 130 units were sold this month alone at the six-storey residence.
"A lot of people are uneasy about their first year of expenses in a new place," Mr. Mizzi adds. "It's a promotion ... that we thought would help ease people's mind, especially in these tough economic times."
The promotion was launched in conjunction with the grand opening of the resort-inspired residence, which is situated on scenic ravine land overlooking the Schomberg River.
"Over 70 per cent of our building has views of the Schomberg River or conservation land behind our building," says Mr. Mizzi.
Remaining units will overlook a landscaped terrace built above the parking garage.
Although the four-acre site benefits from a secluded setting on Church Street, it is only half a mile from boutiques, cafes and restaurants along Main Street.
Locals of the established low-rise community also frequent the farmers' markets, arena and places of worship, as well as festivals, such as the Community Spirit Bonfire and Schomberg Fair.
Without leaving the building, residents will be able to stay active and social by using the indoor pool, gym and hot tub, as well as the bocce courts and barbecue area on the rooftop terrace or a party room with a bar, kitchen and dance floor.
A guest suite will also be available.
"We've been told our amenities in our building are top class," says Mr. Mizzi. "[Plus] there are lush grounds and a lot of walking trails there."
Individual suites will range from one to two-bedroom plus den suites with open kitchens, combined living and dining areas and either a patio or balcony.
Larger plans will have master suites with private bathrooms and walk-in closets.
"Even our smallest [suite] - which is 670-square-feet - is laid out very well," says Mr. Mizzi. "There's not a lot of wasted space."
To polish off the suites, interiors will be dressed with granite kitchen counters, 36-ounce broadloom in the bedrooms and ceramic tile or laminate floors in all other areas.
Each unit will come with five appliances, parking and a locker located down the hall rather than in the basement. "You don't have to run downstairs if you forgot a pot or whatever," says Mr. Mizzi.
The monthly fee will be 37 cents per square foot, plus individually metered utilities.
Optional home furnishing packages by Haustique can be purchased from $6,999.
Move in dates are slated for October, 2011.

Burger chain sizzles in the Far East

Full text:   Vancouver's White Spot focuses on Asia, where its new Triple O's franchises outperform some of their Canadian counterparts
The Pacific Place mall in the centre of a buzzing Hong Kong can boast of having the world's top brands as its residents.
Shoppers can pick up trendsetting fashion from the likes of France's Celine and Chanel or timeless jewels from Italy's Bulgari. And when they're hungry they can indulge themselves a bit more with a Triple O's burger from Canada.
Triple O's? Admittedly, the name may not ring a bell with Canadians living east of Alberta, let alone overseas. But that hasn't stopped this brand from going where other compatriots often fear to tread: abroad.
Since its foreign debut at Pacific Place just six years ago, the B.C.-based burger chain has added five more outlets in Hong Kong, along with one in Thailand and two in South Korea. Not bad for a burger joint that traces its roots back 81 years to a quaint log cabin drive-in that served ice cream and hot dogs in Vancouver.
"When my boss said go east young man, he didn't think it would be the Far East," recalls Warren Erhart, president of Triple O's owner, White Spot Restaurants. "We had thought [to] grow the brand domestically: go to Alberta, then Ontario."
Just a few years ago, domestic, rather than international, growth must have appeared the prudent approach. After all, White Spot has always taken its time when it comes to building its brand. Its aim wasn't to catch up with such food giants as McDonald's or Pizza Hut. Instead, it was a Vancouver institution, attracting a celebrity clientele from crooner Bing Crosby in its early years to such modern day stars as Michael J. Fox and Michael Buble.
The company, named after a white spot on the log cabin's roof, took 10 years to open its first sit-down restaurant in 1938. It waited until the 1960s to refresh the logo at its 10 locations. In 1968, White Spot founder Nat Bailey sold the chain to General Foods.
It changed hands again in 1982, when B.C. native Peter Toigo snapped up the venerable chain. It became part of his Shato Holdings group of businesses, which is now run by his sons.
White Spot's new owner had growth plans. In the 1990s, it expanded into Alberta. Then in 1997, the company launched a new chain, Triple O's, which let it open smaller, less costly locations that sold its popular burgers. Soon Triple O's, which were mostly franchise-operated outlets, could be found on ferries, gas stations, universities and tourist sites such as Science World in Vancouver.
"We thought we had a unique product," says Mr. Erhart, who has spearheaded that expansion since becoming White Spot's president in 1994. "Fresh burgers, fresh fries, hand-scooped shakes."
But the catalyst for the next stage of expansion, going overseas, wasn't Mr. Erhart and the Triple O's team. Instead that idea came from a foreign suitor, the Suen family from Hong Kong, who were real estate investors in Vancouver. They believed their home could be a good fit for the Canadian chain.
Mr. Erhart, a restaurant industry veteran from Nanaimo who grew up eating at White Spot, wasn't convinced it would be a success. At times, he actually tried to talk them out of the venture.
"At first my concern was for the franchisee, making sure do you really understand the potential risk and reward of doing this," Mr. Erhart says. "It was a bit of a shock at first. Then you get your head around it; this is a huge opportunity."
One has to consider, for example, the large number of people who move between Hong Kong and Vancouver, some of whom have obviously been patrons at Triple O's in Canada. Mr. Erhart says he has heard 300,000 ex-patriots from Western Canada live in Hong Kong.
As well, the company's partner-to-be made a solid impression. The Suen family not only knew and liked the White Spot brand, but also brought its in-depth knowledge of Hong Kong's real estate market to the partnership.
"The brand works like any other business: location, location, location," Mr. Erhart says. "We knew we had someone who really knew real estate in that marketplace."
The proof? Today the top revenue-generating outlets in the Triple O's chain are in Hong Kong, led by the location at Pacific Place. White Spot is expected to generate more than $200-million in revenue in the current fiscal year ending in March of 2010. The Triple O's will lead that growth with an estimated 4.5-per-cent increase, while the Canada-only White Spot chain is on track to post a 2.5-per-cent gain.
Further expansion is on the agenda. The company plans to open another four outlets in Asia next year: one in Hong Kong, one in South Korea and two in Taiwan. Canadian ex-patriots could also find themselves in a Triple O's restaurant in Britain one day.
It may seem surprising that Triple O's burgers are a hit in Asia. One would think McDonald's has the burger market cornered, and, well, wouldn't people prefer to eat good Thai or Chinese food?
"They're brand-conscious," Mr. Erhart says. "We've been around for 81 years. They give a lot of credence to organizations or institutions that have been around that many years, that have weathered the cruel test of time."
But John Ries, a professor at the Sauder School of Business in B.C., says Canadians' devotion to their much-beloved brands doesn't always transfer to other countries. "They'll have to succeed based on how good their product is relative to the competition," he says.

HOW WHITE SPOT WENT ABROAD
The restaurants
White Spot went the franchise route with the Suen family. The company, which receives a royalty fee of 6 per cent of sales, felt it was important to have partners who really understood the market rather than trying to figure everything out by themselves. White Spot has two employees in Asia whose job is to support the franchise there, protect the brand and scope out other opportunities.
The food The company ships its beef and chicken from Australia for the Hong Kong market. South Korea and Thailand have more protectionist laws, so White Spot buys beef inside those countries. The company ships relish and pickles from Vancouver, and then works with local bakeries in each country. Triple O's basically has the same items on the menu as in Canada, but can make changes. Salmon, for example, isn't popular in Hong Kong so cod is used instead in the fish burgers.
The locations
Going forward, Mr. Erhart knows that brands shouldn't settle for anything but the best. Sales in South Korea and Thailand are not as strong as those in Hong Kong, which he attributes in part to less attractive locations.

Macquarie makes modest inroad

Author: Willis, Andrew

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/macquarie-makes-modest-inroad/docview/382610542/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "This is the right partner for Blackmont, in terms of what Macquarie delivers for our people and our clients," Mr. [Bruce Kagan] said. The decision to sell to the Australian investment house came after parent CI Financial received offers for Blackmont from four rivals this summer. The overtures came in the wake of consolidation in the sector in July, when GMP Capital Inc. merged its private client division with Richardson Partners Financial.

Full text:   Australia's largest investment bank, Macquarie Group Ltd. , is taking a typically Canadian approach to launching a wealth management business in this country, making a modest $93-million acquisition of 130 stockbrokers from Blackmont Capital.
A powerhouse down under and an emerging global player, Macquarie stepped up yesterday with a deal that established the firm as a full-service domestic brokerage house, 11 years after first opening an office in Canada. Though the acquisition will still leave it many times smaller than the major bank-owned firms, Macquarie's strategy in this country is to build a business that fits local realities.
"We could have spent half a billion or a billion [dollars] to buy a larger dealer and attempt to compete with the domestic banks, but the past experience of global firms would tell you that approach is not likely to be successful," said Earl Evans, former head of Macquarie's Australian brokerage unit and future president of the Canadian firm.
Worldwide, Macquarie looks after $108-billion of assets for 850,000 clients. The Blackmont acquisition adds $7.6-billion to that pool, and offices in 13 Canadian cities.
Macquarie is expanding into a sector that is dominated by the banks, competitors that have beaten back past foreign invasions from the likes of Merrill Lynch. Macquarie executives say they can succeed where other global banks failed by keeping ambitions realistic.
"We know we're not going to beat Royal Bank competing head to head, but we can build a solid business in Canada the reflects the strength of our global platform," said Macquarie Canada chief executive officer Paul Donnelly, a Australian who has been based in Toronto for two years, and has now done three major acquisitions.
Globally, and in Canada, Macquarie focuses on financing and trading the securities of resource companies, along with income-generating sectors such as utilities, real estate, financial services and infrastructure. The Sydney-based firm already acquired Canadian investment banking and research expertise in all these areas - last week alone, Macquarie was involved in eights underwritings. Now Blackmont's stockbrokers are expected to sell the deals that the financiers bring in.
The expansion model is different in other countries, with Macquarie's decentralized structure allowing for a customized expansion plan. In India, for example, the investment bank opted to use a joint venture to get into wealth management, while in a number of Asian nations, Macquire is building a private banking operation that caters to extremely wealthy clients.
In Canada, former Blackmont chief executive officer Bruce Kagan will become CEO of Macquarie Private Wealth, teamed with Mr. Evans and charged with building a sales force of up to 250 stockbrokers over the next three years.
"This is the right partner for Blackmont, in terms of what Macquarie delivers for our people and our clients," Mr. Kagan said. The decision to sell to the Australian investment house came after parent CI Financial received offers for Blackmont from four rivals this summer. The overtures came in the wake of consolidation in the sector in July, when GMP Capital Inc. merged its private client division with Richardson Partners Financial.
CI Financial continues to field one of the largest networks of financial advisers in the country, with more than 800 professionals overseeing $19.5-billion of assets in its Assante Wealth Management division.
"We continue to believe in the distribution business, and we remain totally committed to Assante," said CI Financial CEO William Holland, noting that Assante is the largest player in its sector. He said: "We simply could not get the scale we needed in the brokerage business."
CI Financial purchased Blackmont early in 2007 for $251-million as part of an acquisition that also gave the mutual fund company ownership of institutional money manager KBSH Capital Management. Mr. Holland said with hindsight, it's clear that his firm bought into the sector near the top of a bull market, and that recruiting additional stockbrokers to Blackmont became increasingly difficult, as brokerage houses stepped up retention programs.
There are still 60 capital markets employees working for CI Financial at Blackmont Capital - these bankers, traders and analysts are not going to Macquarie - and Mr. Holland said over time, this team will take a "significant equity interest in the company."
"The capital market business is profitable, so it's not an issue for CI, but the right model for the boutique brokerage business is to have the employees as partners in the firm," Mr. Holland said.
CI Financial is expected to use the $93-million coming from Macquarie to pay down debt, and may increase its common share dividend, said a report yesterday from Credit Suisse analyst Jim Bantis. "We view this partial divestiture of Blackmont positively as it allows CI to focus more on its core strengths." he said.

Full text:   When the Wall fell, artists packed up their paintbrushes and headed for Berlin. Now they're returning for the anniversary celebrations
The images are iconic: Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev engaged in a passionate kiss with East German leader Erich Honecker; a Trabant - a notoriously stinky East German car - busting through the brick and concrete of the feared and hated 155-kilometre Berlin Wall.
Just as the wall dividing East and West Germany stood as a symbol of Communist domination, the murals - painted by artists who converged in Berlin from points around the world - were symbols of freedom. The fall of the Berlin Wall marked the culmination of a year of change: Solidarity had been legalized in Poland, Vaclav Havel was released from a Czech prison, and nearly two million people linked hands across three Baltic states in a stand against the Soviet Union. The murals, though, inspired by the euphoria of reunification, captured the imagination of the world.
And they're about to do so again. As Berlin prepares to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Wall with concerts, light shows and even a two-kilometre domino chain to be toppled by spectators, the East Side Gallery - the stretch of wall on which the murals were painted - will be showcased. In recent months, many of the East Side artists returned to repaint their works on what is now the longest of the very few remaining stretches of what once formed a "river of stone."
Russian artist Dmitry Vrubel, who painted the infamous kiss, said earlier this year that he worries about recreating his painting. "I'm a little bit afraid," he said. "Maybe I can't remember everything, so it won't be exactly the same painting, not 100-per-cent the same."
Such is the power and emotion of the East Side images.
Positioned along two kilometres of the river Spree, the gallery is scenically set between two of Berlin's hippest neighbourhoods: Kreuzberg, in the former "last outpost of the free world," and Friedrichshain, in the former "workers' paradise." The no man's land is now a series of urban beaches covering the range from lowly squat to ultra posh.
This is prime real estate. Project co-ordinator Jörg Weber, a former East German, still can't believe the land was given official monument status - especially since developers weren't alone in their desire to obliterate this "sleeping crocodile" that had killed more than 270 individuals attempting to escape East Germany by climbing, digging, swimming and/or rappelling their way to freedom.
Nor can he believe that after eight years of fighting for funding, and six months of tracking down the artists, the city is regaining what it lost through natural decay and the work of "wall-peckers" - those who physically attacked the wall because they hated what it stood for, or because they wanted a nifty relic.
Artist Margaret Hunter's mural Joint Venture is the only original painting remaining - thanks to the obsessive work of art restoration students. Hunter, who left her native Scotland for Berlin in 1985, is doing a second painting for the anniversary. The 20th anniversary, she says, "is a good time to reflect and look back with clearer eyes."
In contrast, the 15th anniversary revolved more around ostalgia , thanks in part to the popularity of the film Good Bye Lenin! , a tragicomedy in which a son tries to keep the idea of East Germany - Ostdeutschland - alive for his ailing mother. Hunter recalls it as a stage of bereavement.
Today, though, it's more about GPS tours allowing tourists to cycle the path of the Wall, and Facebook being all a-twitter with grassroots anniversary plans for a "mauer mob" with 47,000 participants holding hands along the original route.
The city's squares and museums are filled with Wall-related exhibitions and television channels are broadcasting endless documentaries. On a given night there may be programs about the enforced adoption of children of undesirables in the GDR, how rare plants evolved in the strips of no man's land, or how East Germans enjoyed a superior sex life to their Western neighbours. Maybe ostalgia isn't dead after all.
With the recent re-election of Angela Merkel, the first former East German to become chancellor of a reunited Germany, it's easy to assume that the country has already come far. Resentments, however, remain: Two-thirds of former East Germans don't think of themselves as citizens of a unified Germany, and most former West Germans resent the 5.5 per cent "solidarity tax" they will pay until 2019, when it is hoped that economic balance will be achieved.
Berlin, though, seems to be ahead of the game. With architectural reunification essentially complete, it's often impossible to distinguish between the country's former halves. And for visitors, Berlin comes across as a city united in spirit - as one of the most happening capitals in the EU. The former East Berlin neighbourhood of Mitte, and its square Alexanderplatz with its iconic - and very Ossi - TV tower, now forms the natural geographical centre of the city, complete with affluent residents who appreciate the irony of receiving a 10-per-cent rebate on health care and insurance.
Back at the revitalized East Side Gallery, 20 years on, the only noticeable difference is the website that now appears with each artist's signature. But few of the East Side artists believe new media will help foment revolutions in areas of suppression today. "Human nature is human nature," Hunter says. "It's just a concentration of points that starts with the people and goes upward. It happened here 20 years ago and it might still happen in Tehran. But don't hold your breath."
Weber is more dismissive: "Here the government was weak; there [in Iran] it's still strong."
Only time will tell. Who would have thought that Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds could open in Germany to rave reviews?
On this day, Weber is working with artists from Japan, America and India. "And there's the real story: Before, that would have been forbidden," he says.
"Look at these paintings as a hundred messages to the world. ... And while the Wall used to carry these paintings, now it's up to these paintings to carry the memory of the Wall."

THE HUNGRY TRAVELLER
Berlin's most visible street snack, the currywurst, is turning 60.
This grilled sausage, drowned in a ketchup-like sauce and sprinkled with curry powder, was invented in Berlin in 1949 by Herta Heuwer (though there are Hanoverians and Hamburgers who will contradict this with their own origin stories). So deep is the love for currywurst that more than 800 million are sold in Germany every year, and a new $7.8-million Currywurst Museum was built near Checkpoint Charlie to tell its story (Schützenstrasse 70; www.currywurstmuseum.com).
Berlin restaurant critic Thomas Platt called the currywurst the "the warm meal of the Cold War," partly because distinct versions evolved on each side of the Wall. Because of an intestine shortage, the East developed the "skinless sausage," which they prefer to this day. Both versions, beloved by street sweepers and supermodels alike, continue to be celebrated in song, literature and TV. And you can always befriend a local by baiting him into talking about how the European Union's obsessive health and safety rules are killing the very idea of sausage.
Street versions can be had for less than two euros - with Konnopke's Imbiss, under the Eberswalderstrasse S-Bahn train station, generally getting the highest ratings.
A posher version will set you back $26 - or $50 with a glass of champagne - at Hotel Adlon (www.hotel-adlon.de), with its view of Brandenburg Gate and its history as the place where Michael Jackson dangled his baby over the balcony.

Full text:   The 2010 Games were the final test in the career of a businessman who defied the odds in many ways
smartin@globeandmail.com
They don't come much tougher than Jack Poole, the multimillionaire Vancouver real estate developer. Yet, when his pal, British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell asked him to head up the city's bid for the 2010 Olympics, Mr. Poole agreed to sideline himself in the middle of a hot construction market to work gratis - and pay his own expenses - as chair of the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (VANOC).
"I joke that I gave him his first job and he gave me my last," Mr. Poole said in 2002. "I paid him $2.50 an hour [as a labourer waterproofing basements on a construction project near Smithers, B.C.] and he pays me $1 a year. So who got the best deal?" he asked jokingly of the province and the city he had called home since the early 1960s.
For nearly a decade, nothing deterred Mr. Poole - including devastating treatment for pancreatic cancer. He built the bid team; oversaw the lobbying and marketing effort, which resulted in the IOC choosing Vancouver as the site for the games by a slender three vote margin over Pyeongchang, South Korea; endured a frustrating plebiscite campaign to fulfill a rash campaign promise made by mayoralty candidate Larry Campbell; and navigated the inevitable cost overruns and political turmoil that stuck like mud patties to the construction of the Olympic facilities.
"He's tough," Mr. Campbell said in 2003, in the early days of his solitary term as mayor. "I look at him and think, I don't want to go up an alley with this guy. He's a hockey player. He didn't get that nose from not getting into the corners."
For Mr. Poole, the Olympics were the final test in a career that had as many peaks and plunges as a roller coaster ride. "I've learned with the failures to bear them, and with the successes to savour them. They are the ones that make the failures worth bearing," he confided in an interview in 2003.
A horribly smashed leg from a car accident when he was a teenager ruined his dreams of a hockey career; the recession of the early 1980s toppled his first, precariously leveraged, real estate empire. From these debacles he learned to regroup and to hone his laissez-faire management style.
More of a big picture guy than a details person, his best leadership attribute was his ability to recruit smart, self-motivated and hard working people, such as VANOC CEO John Furlong. He derived his own pleasure from watching them act, grow and succeed.
"That's what I call psychological income," he said earlier this year. "That's what's given me my satisfaction in life, with all of my business experiences."
Even so, taking on the Olympics was a massive undertaking, not only for him and his hand-picked team, but for the province and the country. The process forced all levels of government to work together, a legacy that he felt was even more significant than hosting the Games. "If we can't deliver a win with that, it's not going to look good on my resumé, I can tell you that," he said just before Vancouver won the bid.
As the deadline for the Games approached, the question on everybody's mind was whether Mr. Poole could defy the medical odds in an even bigger struggle against pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal forms of the disease. After diagnosis and radical treatment in 2007, he appeared to have made a miraculous recovery - so much so that earlier this year he was entertaining the possibility of carrying the Olympic torch through his home town of Mortlach, Saskatchewan on its journey from Athens to Vancouver.
"It might be fun, if time allowed, to be there when the torch goes through, but the chances are I'd probably fall down," he said with his typically self-deprecating humour. Nobody is laughing now.
His remission proved merely a respite in a deadly battle when surgeons removed a metastasized tumour in his intestine this summer. Even so, he rallied long enough for the Olympic torch to be ignited in Athens on Thursday. "I called him immediately afterwards to provide a play-by-play description," Mr. Furlong said in a statement, "and truly believe that Jack was then ready to say goodbye."
John (Jack) Wilson Poole was born April 14, 1933, in a house without electricity or plumbing, in a community so tiny that it barely rates a dot on most maps. He was the youngest of three sons of John Vigors Poole and his wife Edith (nee Golen). Mr. Poole worked at the grain elevator after his Massey-Harris farm equipment dealership went broke during the Depression and Mrs. Poole was the local postmistress.
If you looked at lanky Jack Poole carefully, you could find traces of his first nations heritage - five per cent Cree - in his high cheekbones and dark eyes, but he never made much publicly of his aboriginal background until he was awarded the National Aboriginal Achievement Award in the business and commerce category in March, 2007.
His claim came through an 18th century British ancestor, who arrived in Moose Factory on James Bay to work for the Hudson's Bay Company in 1776, and then married a Cree woman. "I think I'm six generations removed from the Cree lady," Mr. Poole said after the awards ceremony, "but I have a Metis card, and by definition, in Canada, I'm an aboriginal person. I've always been very proud of this fact - to have Canadian roots that go that far back."
In a profile for B.C. Business Magazine, Gary Mason wrote that Mr. Poole "idolized his parents, even his alcoholic father who ruined many a Christmas by getting drunk before noon." Aside from his drinking bouts, John Poole was a nurturing father, who "bathed" his son in praise, helping him develop "a high self-esteem not common among children of alcoholics," he wrote.
The elder Poole also imparted two character building lessons: don't be quick to judge others; and live your life with integrity.
Along with his older brothers, Jack spent Grades 1 through 12 in a two room schoolhouse. Outside the classroom he played hockey, aiming to play defence in the NHL one day. That goal was shattered the summer he was 15 and working as crew on a highway paving project outside Lloydminster. One night, as he and some friends walked into town after dark, a car sideswiped them, leaving his best friend dead and him with his lower right leg "mangled and hanging on by the skin." For the rest of his days, he walked with a slight limp.
On the excruciating train journey back to Moose Jaw to have his triple compound fracture repaired, he managed a couple of philosophical insights: life can change in a flash; and it consists of a series of obstacles to be overcome with perseverance, ingenuity and grit.
Life whacked him again when, aged 16, he impregnated his high school girlfriend, Marilyn Pollock. While most kids his age were thinking about jobs and a date for the senior prom, he became a hasty bridegroom and a teenaged father.
Construction provided the tuition so he could enroll in civil engineering at the University of Saskatchewan - all those summers swallowing dust on highway projects had inspired him to acquire the credentials to run job sites. He graduated in 1954, the same year that he won the university's heavyweight wrestling championship.
He immediately began working as a management trainee at Gulf Oil in Calgary. On the side he sold Fuller Brush products to supplement the family income, using a sales routine that he could re-enact half a century later. "You knock on the door, somebody opens, and you shoot that aerosol hand cream in their hands and you say: 'Now, rub it in, then put your hands under the tap. It's like an invisible glove of lanolin.' " Swearing that it really did feel that way, Mr. Poole bragged that "there wasn't anyone who didn't buy that hand cream," in an interview with The Globe's Rod Mickleburgh before Vancouver's final IOC pitch in Prague.
After two years at Gulf Oil, Mr. Poole found his calling: heading up the construction division of Engineered Homes in Edmonton. He did so well that he was transferred to Vancouver to start up a West Coast office in the early 1960s. Just as EH won a contract to build a hundred homes for a mining company in Northern B.C., the head office in Calgary took a financial tumble and recalled him to Edmonton.
He didn't want to go. Instead, he persuaded Graham Dawson, son of the man who had built the Burrard Street Bridge in Vancouver, to buy EH's B.C. assets and form a new company called Daon Development Corporation. Initially, Daon built housing in resource towns from Prince Rupert to Port Alice, but eventually the company burgeoned into one of the largest real estate development empires in North America.
Daon's exponential growth was fuelled by massive debts at spiralling interest rates. When the 1982 recession hit, customers vanished and Daon owned $2.3-billion to 47 banks at double digit interest rates. The company survived, but it took two years, more than $20-million in legal fees and a protection plan that saw a phalanx of banks taking back shares in Daon.
"My personal wealth went from a paper worth of $100-million to a negative worth of $5-million," he admitted later. Amidst the financial chaos, his marriage, which had survived the birth of four daughters and the death of his infant son from the severest form of spina bifida, foundered. When the Pooles divorced in 1983, after more than 30 years of marriage, he had nothing but debts.
Bizarrely, life was both tough and blessed, for it was about this time, as he was crawling back to solvency - Bell Canada Enterprises acquired 68 per cent of Daon's common shares by March, 1985 - that he met Darlene Young. They married on March 21, 1987. Two years later, when he finally resigned from BCE Developments, he reportedly had $20-million in profits in his pocket.
Through a friend, Mr. Poole met David Podmore, a key player on Expo 86 in Vancouver, just as the exhibition was wrapping up and Mr. Podmore was sniffing around for new projects. Together, with a group of people including labour leader Ken Georgetti, they formed Vancouver Land Corporation (VLC) on June 1, 1989, a private/public company capitalized by union pension funds. They engaged in a joint venture to build low cost housing in Vancouver under the encouraging eye of Mr. Poole's pal and fellow Liberal, then mayor Gordon Campbell, himself a former property developer.
VLC moved into market-rate condos when the rental market fell apart and then morphed into Greystone Properties, which eventually became Concert Properties, now one of the largest and most successful construction companies in the province. Mr. Poole's money management and previous construction dealings came under intense scrutiny when Mr. Campbell, by then premier of B.C., appointed his friend to chair VANOC in 2003.
In fact, as Mr. Podmore complained two years before the start of the Games, taking on big civic projects such as chairing VANOC, is bad, rather than good, for business. Certainly that is true in an economic sense, but as Mr. Poole and his board of directors appreciated, community service is the best way to accrue cultural and social capital.
Life walloped Mr. Poole again in 2007, when, nearly 25 years after he had survived prostate cancer, he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Refusing to succumb passively to an almost certain death sentence, he had surgery in Vancouver and then signed up for a $60,000 experimental course of treatment at Virginia Mason Medical Centre in Seattle, Washington. For 40 days he was bombarded with radiation, topped by toxic doses of chemotherapy three times a week.
The brutal regimen left him so gaunt his close friends barely recognized him and even he confessed that the treatment "puts you on your knees," a rare admission from a man, described by Mr. Furlong as, "made of iron."
Although he was declared cancer free early this year, he was back under the surgeon's scalpel at the beginning of July. In a five hour operation, doctors removed a tumour containing pancreatic cancer cells from his intestine, but had to leave another one intact because of its location.
"This is not the way the story was supposed to go," Mr. Poole told Globe columnist Gary Mason in July. "But ... you just deal with what you're handed. You have no choice, do you?"
JACK POOLE, OC, OBC
John (Jack) Poole was born in Mortlach, Saskatchewan on April 13, 1933. He died of complications from pancreatic cancer in hospital in Vancouver early on Oct. 22, 2009. Mr. Poole, who was 76, leaves his second wife Darlene, four daughters, a stepson and his extended family.

Extreme Halloween
HGTV, 7 p.m.
Christmas isn't the only time of year when people dress up the exteriors of their homes.

BIOGRAPHY
Killer Comebacks
TVtropolis, 9 p.m.
The resurgence of eighties movie mainstay Mickey Rourke comes under scrutiny in this unauthorized profile. Following his breakout roles in Body Heat (1981) and Diner (1982), Rourke became a solid leading man who garnered critical praise for his performances in films like Barfly and Year of the Dragon .

HISTORY
Exploring Hitler's Munich
History, 7 p.m.
This program reveals the storied history behind the German city once beloved by Adolf Hitler. According to historians interviewed in the film, the National Socialist Party was first formed in Munich's beer cellars. At the height of the Second World War, Hitler frequently referred to the city as the "capital of the movement." The program also reveals the German leader's secret plans to turn Munich into a sprawling super-city, which thankfully never came to fruition.
FOOD

REALITY
Intervention
A & E, 9 p.m.
In one of the most stark entries in the series, Intervention profiles a young addict named Cristy.

COMEDY
Bless Me, Father
Vision, 8:30 p.m.
This series, which first aired from 1978 to 1981, has lost none of its cheeky charm. The show stars ex- Coronation Street regular Arthur Lowe as irascible Catholic parish priest Father Duddleswell, who tends to his flock while keeping an eye on the bottom line (translation: He's terribly stingy). His crustiness is offset by the young Father Neil (Daniel Abineri). Most storylines are blessedly simple. Tonight, Father Duddleswell steps in when a female war orphan brought up in the local convent falls in love with a rabbi's son. Heaven forbid.
DOCUMENTARY
Age of Terror
PBS, 10 p.m.
This documentary recalls a terrorist event several years before the tragedy of 9/11. In 1994, as an Air France plane was preparing to depart Algiers, four men entered the aircraft. Although they passed themselves off as Algerian officials, there were in fact members of the GIA, an Islamist extremist group. Two days elapsed and three passengers were executed before Algerian authorities allowed the flight to depart for Marseilles; once there, a commando team killed the terrorists and liberated the passengers. This program reveals the GIA's real goal: to crash the plane in the middle of Paris.
DRAMA
the forgotten
ABC, 10 p.m.
Launched last month, this crime drama has already lived up to its name: Most viewers have already forgotten it's on. The concept casts former movie regular Christian Slater as a former cop heading up an ad hoc group of civilian volunteers trying to provide closure to the families of unidentified murder victims. Tonight, the team investigates the death of a John Doe found buried at a popular vacation spot. The only clue is a stray dog standing vigil over the shallow grave.
WEDNESDAY

DESIGN
Design Inc.
HGTV, 8 p.m.
Interior design diva Sarah Richardson shares the workload in this series covering all facets of the home-makeover process.

Tonight, they swarm into the home of Carolyn, a busy mom, wife and physician who wants to make her living room warm and kid-friendly. Go, Team Richardson.
COMEDY
Modern Family
ABC, CITY-TV, 9 p.m.
Yep, it's a hit. Widely conceded to be this fall's funniest new series, this mockumentary-style sitcom has earned solid reviews and healthy ratings for its first five episodes. The modern family in question includes thirtysomething parents Phil and Claire (Ty Burrell, Julie Bowen), her father Jay (Ed O'Neill) and his Latino spitfire second wife Gloria (Sofia Vergara) and Jay's gay son Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and life partner Cameron (Eric Stonestreet). Tonight, Mitchell and Cameron freak when their adopted Asian daughter attends her first day of school, while Jay and Gloria bicker, as always. Just like a real family.
DOCUMENTARY
Ben: Diary of a Heroin Addict
TVO, 10 p.m.
This British documentary chronicles the slow and steady decline of a heroin addict. The film follows the final days of Ben Rogers, hailing from a middle-class family in the village of Alton in Staffordshire, who spent more than a decade battling his addiction to heroin. In diary style, the program follows the young man's stints in and out of rehab, to no avail, and includes brutally graphic footage of Rogers injecting himself in various areas of his body once the veins in his arms give out. A dark and haunting portrait of addiction.
THURSDAY
OCTOBER 29
COMEDY
Overruled!
Family Channel, 8 p.m.
Uniquely weird, this series features high-schoolers settling problems in Teen Court. The central player is the too-cool "Coop" and his cadre of classmates, including Rusty, eccentric Scot Kaleigh and the winsome Tara, who presides as judge at the weekly tribunal. The cases address the usual teen issues - kids cheating on tests and the like - but the court operates like a real court, minus the obnoxious lawyers.
DRAMA
CSI
CBS, 9 p.m.
Despite a shaky start, the original entry in the CSI franchise is slowly climbing back up in U.S. Nielsen ratings. In tonight's new outing, CSI crime-lab boss Langston (Laurence Fishburne) leads the investigation into the brutal murder of a popular college football coach found dead in his own home. With little physical evidence at the crime scene, the entire football team roster falls under suspicion.
REALITY
Street Customs
TLC, 10 p.m.
In the vein of American Chopper , this series follows the endeavours of designer Ryan Friedlinghaus, whose West Coast Customs crew transforms ordinary vehicles into souped-up masterpieces. The series returns tonight with the first of four new episodes, in which Ryan continues to expand his creative horizons: While visiting the Vans footwear company to consult on his new shoe line, Ryan is challenged to restore a 1974 Mercedes Van. What a coincidence!
RENOVATION
Holmes Inspections

Good-hearted contractor Mike Holmes plays a different sort of saviour in his newest HGTV series. This time Holmes comes to the rescue of homeowners victimized by unqualified home inspectors.

Full text: With the old mansion lost to fire, the storied Nokomis estate needs a new vision
967 NORTH SHORE RD., HOWE ISLAND, ONT.
WHAT: A storied estate known as Nokomis, set in 28 acres overlooking the Bateau Channel in the St. Lawrence River. The island property offers more than 3,500 feet of waterfront, a gatehouse, gazebo, refurbished barn, a marina complex and five tiny islets.
ASKING PRICE: $3.750-million
TAXES: $9,848.00 (2009)
AGENT: Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd., Johnston & Daniel Division (Carolyn McIntire Smyth)
The historic estate known as Nokomis is a property in need of a house.
The mansion that once stood on the land was destroyed by fire, rebuilt, and consumed by fire again.
In 1899, the property was purchased by industrialist William Nichols who, with his wife Hannah, built a summer retreat. A kitchen fire sparked the first conflagration in 1914.
The 10,000-square foot house was rebuilt, and that sprawling 14-bedroom lodge also burned down in 2003. Firefighters arrived at the scene after being alerted by an alarm inside the house and found the dwelling engulfed by flames and partly collapsed.
According to reports in the Kingston Whig-Standard, the original house commissioned by Mr. Nichols was of a Tudor-style stucco and timber construction.
When that burned down, Mr. Nichols hired architect Frank T. Lent to create its replacement. The new house had a steep roof and butterfly-shaped layout with a wide veranda overlooking the channel.
Over the years, the property changed hands a few times, with owners who used it variously for a convalescent home, a summer camp and a bed-and-breakfast resort. One prominent former owner was the author Mazo de la Roche, who was born in Ontario in 1879. Ms. de la Roche wrote romance novels and was best known for the family chronicle Whiteoaks of Jalna, which was also the inspiration for a mini-series for Canadian television.
To visit the property today, prospective buyers need to make their way to Howe Island, which is one of the Thousand Islands. (The island is located in the St. Lawrence River, in Frontenac County.)
A few minutes' drive east of Kingston, visitors will find a bucolic landing and two car ferries serving the island.
The ferries don't follow any particular schedule - they just make the short journey across the channel when enough people and their vehicles arrive to make the trip worthwhile.
The gentle Howe Island is about 13 kilometres long and 5 kilometres wide, with about 500 permanent residents.
On a recent tour of the property, real estate agent Carolyn McIntire Smyth pointed out the long shoreline and lingered at the 2,000-foot stone sea wall.
"It makes a beautiful walkway all the way around," says Ms. McIntire Smyth.
The water of the Bateau Channel surrounds the land on three sides. The marina includes three covered boat docks, each 50 feet long.
"Three yachts could be visiting at once," says Ms. McIntire Smyth.
Guests and residents can set their chairs on a 200-foot deep water dock or jump from the high diving board. On land, a rustic shed is used for storing small boats and equipment.
"It's a pretty little boathouse," says the agent.
Children can play on a small sandy beach. Nearby, a footbridge crosses an inlet.
Water lilies float in the bay, and a great blue heron often stands at the water's edge. The perennial gardens and undulating lawns are surrounded by deep stands of trees.
"The combination of some landscaped and some wild is magical," says Ms. McIntire Smyth.
Visitors to the estate will find little remaining of the majestic house, but among the ruins, the fireplace still stands. Large oil-painted panels that once adorned the building are now housed at Queen's University in Kingston.
Rumours among the locals suggest some trespassers held an unsanctioned party and a bonfire at the time of the latest fire, says the agent.
But new owners can still be accommodated: A gatehouse perched next to some woods has 1,800 square feet of living space. It offers a renovated kitchen with stainless steel appliances and a porch overlooking green lawns stretching down to a quiet bay. The large master bedroom upstairs has a cathedral ceiling and views of the water.
Ms. McIntire Smyth suggests that a new owner might use the gatehouse as a residence during construction of another landmark dwelling.
One owner could build a country house of great elegance, says the agent, or the buyer could build a more modest home and sell four other lots. Agreements allowing severance into five parcels are already in place, she says.
A refurbished barn has been used as the setting for large social events and parties. At other times, it provides storage space for wooden boats.
The land also offers rolling hills, wilderness and trails.
"You just keep walking and walking and you're still on the property," says the agent. "It's so expansive. Some is quite wild."
Small stone ruins, such as a former pumphouse, add a picturesque quality to the landscape.
"Imagine being a child and getting to play in this - you have a fort already built for you," says Ms. McIntire Smyth.
Several carved wood sculptures oversee the grounds. Offshore, five tiny islands dotting the St. Lawrence River are included.
"They're just fun to have as part of your estate," says Ms. McIntire Smyth.
The channel is a popular - and at times challenging - route for sailors.
The boat traffic on the channel in front of the cottage is relatively quiet, she says.
"It's lovely to see the odd sailboat pass by."

A blueprint for new homes on a forgotten shore

Full text: Along the Don River, a post-industrial wasteland amid high-speed traffic is set to be reborn
cireland@globeandmail.com
In some ways, it's unfortunate that the cement factory and the train shed were long ago demolished.
David Wex, a developer who will bring housing to the manufacturing wasteland of Toronto's West Don Lands, likely would have found a way to incorporate those industrial remnants into the neighbourhood that will rise up over the next few years.
As it is, the partner at Urban Capital Property Group will have to rely on a busy Don Valley Parkway overpass and the Adelaide Street ramps to provide the urban context for the towers and buildings of glass and metal.
Standing at the windblown apex of the overpass as cars whizzed by on a recent afternoon, Mr. Wex leaned over the railing and pointed out the progress that marks the desolate landscape below.
Behind the blue construction hoardings is the site of River City, which will one day combine lofts, condominium towers and townhouses in an area of parks, stores and cafes on the banks of the Don River.
The way the buildings are designed, he explains, it's almost as if the cars travelling over the ramps will be running through the complex.
"The ramps are both very interesting and also a challenge."
Mr. Wex handed that challenge to Montreal-based architectural firm Saucier + Perrotte and, with his Urban Capital partner Mark Reeve, submitted their design to an international competition run by Waterfront Toronto.
"I think the thing that won it for us is we understand the beauty of industry and nature," he said.
Mr. Wex pointed to a bulldozer crawling over a massive mound of earth. That berm will protect the finished dwellings from the river, should it ever swell beyond its banks. Dodging six lanes of traffic, Mr. Wex reaches the opposite side of the overpass and points out the sites for two more phases.
A park created in the underpass will connect the buildings.
The site where Peter's Taxi Ltd. and a gravel parking lot now stand will eventually become part of the new neighbourhood. The Victorian-era smokestacks of the Distillery District are just down the road.
Cities around the world are grappling with brownfield redevelopment. Mr. Wex points to the remarkable result at Duisburg-Nord Landscape Park in Germany, which has become the prototype for architects and planners who aim to rejuvenate the abandoned yards and rusting factories that exist in many cities.
In Duisburg, architect Peter Latz and his colleagues allowed nature to reclaim the industrial land surrounding a decommissioned metal works.
Visitors now climb Blast Furnace No. 5. for a panoramic view. Cooling tanks, railway tracks and slag heaps have all become part of the landscape.
"It's a gloriously beautiful park," Mr. Wex says. "They didn't take any of the industry down. There's this hard infrastructure and then parkland and prairie."
Some proponents of similar plans in other cities have had trouble selling the schemes to local politicians.
Mr. Wex says the design he presented had to meet the environmental and community goals of Waterfront Toronto. Many of the units will be family-friendly.
Waterfront Toronto chief executive John Campbell says his team was looking for a developer who wouldn't churn out the "same old sausages" for the West Don Lands renewal.
"We're not peddling real estate: We're here to build a community."
He says the Saucier + Perrotte design addressed that vision with units that can accommodate families as well as young singles.
"They really impressed us with the thinking they put into this design."
The development, which will have four phases, will comprise 900 loft-style condominiums, penthouses and townhouses.
In Phase 1, a five-storey building will hold about 100 units. Phase 2 will be a 14-storey building with about 230 units, and a food store below. The second structure will be connected to the first by a three-storey, industrial-looking glass bridge.
Phase 3 will consist of four glass mini-towers that combine to make an 11-storey building sharing a courtyard with Phase 1. Phases 4 and 5 will be towers of 24 and 10 storeys with boutiques and restaurants at their bases.
Work will start next spring, with the first residents able to move their furniture in in 2012 if the current schedule holds.
Mr. Wex says the Saucier + Perrotte design emphasizes the interplay between light and dark with expanses of glass and metal panels.
"They're very much about drama."
At the same time, the industrial aesthetic of the buildings will contrast with the soft land forms and gardens, he says.
The team led by Gilles Saucier and André Perrotte - whose firm was honoured this year for architectural excellence by the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada - has undertaken designs in Nigeria, Japan, China and the Middle East, including Mecca.
The firm has experience with preserving the cultural heritage of cities: Their plan for refurbishing the Port of Montreal and Silo No. 5 is not a break with the past, they explain, but a recognition of the way industrial labour has enriched the area.
At West Don Lands, Mr. Wex is also overseeing the renovation of an old foundry that will hold a model suite. He has no plans to clean up the grimy bricks of the building's exterior.
The developer, who lives in Toronto's Beaconsfield neighbourhood, says this type of infill project is a niche for Urban Capital, which has built condos and lofts in such previously undeveloped areas as Ottawa's Byward Market and Montreal's industrial areas.
River City will help connect disparate neighbourhoods in downtown Toronto.
"This is stitching the city together from really strong areas like Leslieville through to the Distillery and Corktown."
The builder says cities are finding new ways to combine industry with housing and parklands.
"I'm not a fan of sprawl," Mr. Wex says. "The way we develop cities is important for our environment and our economy. We've been bad at it for 30 years."

On the second floor of a brick building in the historic Corktown community, this one-bedroom suite drew multiple offers in a short amount of time, says agent Sandra Pate.
"It's in a small building, and there had not been a sale in there for quite some time," says Ms. Pate. "This one was really popular because it's a low rise, it's rarely available and it's a great location."
Locals and tourists alike flock to the galleries, boutique shops and upscale restaurants in the Distillery District nearby, in addition to furniture shops, cafes and public transit along King Street.
The 800-square-foot unit also has several unusual perks, such as a spacious layout spanning the building's depth. This allows for east-facing windows in the living and dining area and a west-facing balcony off the master suite.
"You get the morning and afternoon sun, which is really nice," says Ms. Pate.
Furthermore, the principal room features a wood-burning fireplace, which is "pretty hard to find anywhere," says Ms. Pate. "Occasionally you find it on a high floor in a more expensive building."
Broadloom carpeting covers most areas, except for the ceramic tile in the kitchen. The latter is stocked with cooking appliances and stacked laundry machines.
A semi-ensuite bathroom completes the unit, which also comes with outdoor parking and a locker.
Part of the monthly fee of $268 pays for the upkeep of common areas, such as a gym and sauna.

Listing agent: Paul Johnston, Right at Home Realty Inc.
The i-Zone Lofts is a unique brick residence in Leslieville with a mix of authentic work/live lofts with custom features and layouts.
But one buyer offered $11,000 on top of the list price of this 2,200-square-foot loft likely based on its size and layout, agent Paul Johnston explains.
"This is the highest price paid for a resale loft on Carlaw, which 10 year ago wasn't really a street of choice for loft seekers," says Mr. Johnston. "This unique urban home provides a rare mix of wide open loft space, with more intimate and tailored individual room."
Or instance, the ground floor loft had up to 20-foot ceilings, so a local architect was brought in three years ago to create a mezzanine with two bedrooms, including a sky-lit master suite with a full bathroom.
"About half of [the lofts] have mezzanines, but they're of various quality in terms of design and construction," says Mr. Johnston. "This mezzanine was bar none the best executed I've seen in the building."
Large south-facing windows and skylights illuminate the combined living and dining area, which has kitchen cabinetry and stainless-steel appliances along one side.
Other open spaces include a study and den with access to a three-piece bathroom with laundry machines.
Stylish finishes consist of polished concrete floors on the main level, and exotic iroko and mahogany upstairs.
The unit comes with parking and a monthly fee of $670, which covers heating costs.
A private outdoor space with up to 500 square feet could be built on top of this loft, though there is a shared rooftop deck.
Beyond the building, there are bike paths, beaches and boardwalk, as well as an increasingly popular collection of gourmet restaurants, grocers, bakeries and indie clothing shops.
Amenities downtown are easily accessible via public transit or the Gardiner Expressway.

Full text: Whittakers, a new project on the Sunshine Coast, seeks to marry contemporary architecture with respect for the site in a spectacular landscape
There is still a pristine quality to parts of the Sunshine Coast, the bucolic 86-kilometre strip of coastline northwest of Vancouver.
But rapid development is at its heels, as the traditional forest and fishery industries (Gibsons, the main town on the Coast, was the local for the CBC's The Beachcombers ) are replaced by tourism and retirement homes for burnt-out city folk.
But the further north you go along the coast, the further you get from the madding crowds. Although in relative terms, a place like Gibsons (pop. 4,000 ) fast becoming a bedroom community of Vancouver, hardly represents the rat race.
A great introduction to the North part of the Sunshine Coast is found in Secret Cove, where the Rockwater Resort offers rustic luxury in the form of "tent houses" nestled into a cliffside forest. The heated, slate floored tents, complete with gas fireplaces and soaker tubs, let you rough it in style, with a small eco-footprint to boot.
Originally conceived as a way to bypass planning restrictions by erecting semi-permanent structures - and thus removing the need for the roads, parking spaces etc. - the tent houses are the ultimate green retreat. Only three trees were cut down on the entire site during construction and a winding wooden footbridge leads visitors to their abodes. A 25-minute seaplane ride from downtown Vancouver, Rockwater has become increasingly popular with those seeking refuge from urban stress.
But now the same partners who introduced the tent houses in 2008 have unveiled a permanent residence for those enamoured of the Secret Cove vibe and the lure of a relatively green lifestyle.
Whittakers - only a 15-minute boat ride or a 30-minute drive from Rockwater Resort - is a boutique development of 25 houses that engages craftsman and West Coast contemporary styles to form a singular aesthetic that embraces the spectacular site. Located in the Pender Harbour area, Whittakers overlooks a protected bay and deepwater marina.
Designed by Drew Rose of Stillpoint Architecture, the development offers seven prototype homes that give buyers the flexibility to incorporate personal choices into the design. At the same time, Whittakers insists on strict standards on colours (a limited palette of earth tone stains for the cedar shingle siding for example) and finishes, so as to avoid the unfortunate excesses (read: bright pink houses) of some nearby, less discerning developments.
Its location along an idyllic stretch of Pender Harbour is both the anchor point and the inspiration for the houses. Seven waterfront properties are designed to integrate organically into the sloping landscape, working carefully around existing trees. Free from the tyranny of a uniform grid, the varied topography of the homes combined with the native firs and pines on site offer the added bonus of increased privacy.
One waterfront home had its bolted cedar beam and glass front porch designed around an arbutus tree, which pokes out and upwards from a circular hole. The result is organic installation art, with the tree, the water and surrounding forest blending into a singular aesthetic.
Seven lots on the upland portion of the site will open into forest and meadow, at the same time as they capitalize on views of neighbouring Farrington Cove.
The seven prototype homes designed exclusively for Whittakers will be repeated several times throughout the site, allowing for a harmonious mirroring effect. Both the arts and crafts style and the more contemporary designs have common roots in the traditional "carpenter" built cottages of the West Coast.
The arts and crafts style homes feature low-sloped roofs with broad wing-like eaves, exposed beam and rafter tails. Cedar shingle siding engages with more durable metal roofing and expansive glazing draws in light and view. The more contemporary style homes feature modern shed and flat roofs with traditional exposed beams and knee-brace brackets.
All homes have two storeys as well as an open kitchen/living/dining area with entry, laundry/utility and pantry on the main floor. Buyers can choose from either a three bedroom or four-bedroom model, with some flexibility on the location of master bedrooms and basements depending on site conditions and preference.
Throughout, the relatively spare square footage (ranging from 1725 to 2350 square feet) of the homes is maximized with clever use of space and design features.
Consider the largest "C" type home. One that faces the waterfront makes judicious use of a step-down entry and staggered levels to great effect. As you walk inside, the open kitchen, living, dining area descends with the sloping site and embraces the harbour view with extensive glazing. Vaulted ceilings, peek-a-boo windows and skylights offer a heightened sense of light and space.
The bolted cedar beams lend a sense of tradition and textures play with the slate flooring bordered by cedar strips, while features like two-person stand up showers, soaker tubs and granite kitchen countertops offer luxurious comfort.
While many buyers intend to use their Whittakers homes as recreational ones, increasingly there is a trend toward year round residence. To sweeten the deal, owners are offered special discounts at the Rockwater Resort on everything from spa services to kayaking to a night in a tent house, as well as a year round "concierge" service which includes maintenance, cleaning and rental management.
Gazing out at the harbour, with a stunning view of Texada Island and a narcotic silence, broken only by the sound of gulls and the occasional kayak, it's hard to believe such a paradise is only a half-hour sea plane ride away from Vancouver.

Full text: Annette Street library is the starting point for exploration of The Junction's secret history
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
Pssst, wanna know a secret? The Toronto Public Library produces some of the best local history books around.
Want another one? Often, they're in disguise: The revised and expanded edition of The Most Attractive Resort in Town: Public Library Service in West Toronto Junction, 1888 - 2009 , for instance, is as much a history of the Junction as it is a history of the impressive library on Annette Street.
Okay, here's one more: If you haven't heard of architect James Augustus Ellis (1856 - 1935), it's high time you took a tour of the neighbourhood, as I did one bright and chilly mid-October day with the book's author, Barbara Myrvold. The occasion, if the book's re-release and a love of good architecture wasn't enough, was the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library, designed by Mr. Ellis and partner William Connery and built with funds obtained via a Carnegie grant.
We met in the library's foyer, upon which Ms. Myrvold took me to the basement level to collect local history expert David Wencer in the offices of the West Toronto Junction Historical Society (a tenant since 1997), and then up to the main reception area to see the gorgeous ceiling, uncovered by architects Henno Sillaste and Hiro Nakashima during a 1979 renovation.
"It really is the highlight of this library," she said.
Standing outside the Beaux-Arts building, she explained that when construction was under way it was determined the pillared entrance would face the front lawn of a private residence across the street; the purchase of an extra piece of property allowed a nudge to the west to line up with Medland Street and the view-corridor north to Dundas Street. She pointed, also, to the former Victoria Royce Presbyterian Church - now undergoing a conversion into condominiums - and told the story of Allan Berlin Rice, a member of the congregation. An occasional reporter for the Toronto Globe and chairman of the Toronto Junction Library Board, Mr. Rice was instrumental in securing the Carnegie grant.
We walked past the Ellis-designed 1909 Masonic Temple next door - Ms. Myrvold noted that most of the "movers and shakers" of the early town were Masons - and began our driving tour.
Surrounded by flaming autumn reds at 204 High Park Ave., is the former home of newspaper owner and real estate agent James T. Jackson, designed by Mr. Ellis and built in 1891. Today, it's home to Holy Cross Anglican Priory. After passing many grand homes along this wide thoroughfare, including one for a Heintzman Piano family member (the factory was located in the Junction), we navigated the gentle curve of Gothic Avenue (named "because it's shaped like a Gothic arch," explained Mr. Wencer) until we came to No. 32.
Atop a hill across from High Park subway station, what is today a seven-unit condominium was once the home of West Toronto Junction's second mayor, George Johnston St. Leger. An Ellis design built in 1889, it sits so close to Bloor Street it reminds us that the boundaries of the original town reached much further south than contemporary Torontonians place them: "I know a lot of people say, 'This isn't the Junction, this is High Park' but historically this is the Junction," explained Ms. Myrvold.
The original Romanesque revival bulk of Humberside Collegiate (formerly Toronto Junction High School, 1894) came to fruition during a brief partnership between Mr. Ellis and William Fingland, and we next stopped to admire the carved creatures flanking the entrance. It's a massive school, but Mr. Ellis displayed a deft hand at commissions of all sizes - office buildings such as Campbell Block on the northwest corner of Keele and Dundas, the Heydon House hotel (St. Clair Avenue West and Old Weston Road), small homes, large mansions, banks and the oldest continually operating synagogue in the city, the 1912 Knesseth Israel Synagogue on Maria Street - due to his early carpentry training by his father.
Born near Meaford, Ont., young James began his architectural career by branching out from carpentry into design and construction. Two years after designing the Meaford Fire Hall in 1887, he joined the Ontario Association of Architects. He relocated to West Toronto Junction in 1890, perhaps due to the commissions he'd already received from the Junction's founder and first mayor, Daniel Webster Clendenan.
We wrapped up the day with a look at a home on Glendonwynne Road and another at 24A Woodside Avenue built for John D. Farquhar in 1892, which, like many Ellis designs, reminds me of an Annex home, except that it's flanked by what are clearly builder's homes from the 1920s and thirties.
But that's the charm of the Junction: Houses, commercial and institutional buildings by a world-class architect rub elbows with those of lesser stock. Once a gritty railroad town, it was annexed by the City of Toronto in 1909 and remained under the real estate radar for nine decades as a place with "a fierce, independent spirit," says Mr. Wencer. Since the late 1990s, however, the secret's been out as artists looking for cheap studio space and bargain-hunting hipster couples discover its rough charm.
And now, thanks to Ms. Myrvold's book, the secret of the Junction's colourful history, characters and architecture is as close as the nearest library.

notes on a scandal

Abstract: Here's a riddle. France is the world's third-largest importer of Sicilian wine, almost all of it in bulk. Ever encounter a bottle of Sicilian vino on your French travels? Didn't think so. I don't want to suggest all or even most of France's many struggling winemakers are so unscrupulous as to goose their juice with richly coloured, high-alcohol stuff from Italy's sunny south.

Full text: We reacted after a high-profile writer sounded off on Canadian wines made with foreign grapes. But, hey, isn't that Sicily I taste in French 'Burgundy'?
Canada has never been particularly good at scandals. And so it was with the great "cellared in Canada" wine fiasco. The squawking was over almost before it started. And, if you ask me, it wasn't much of a scandal in the first place.
Responding to a sudden chorus of consumer complaints, British Columbia and Ontario this month declared war on bottles made with cheap foreign grapes that traditionally were stocked on or near domestic-product shelves. About 40 such brands, typically made with juice from lower-cost regions such as Chile or Australia, are sold by Canadian companies, including Naked Grape from Vincor Canada, French Cross from Andrew Peller Ltd. and Sonora Ranch from Artisan Wine Co.
If you've ever bought one of those brands for a 100-mile dinner, you goofed big time. Ontario law requires that just 30 per cent of the juice in cellared in Canada wines be domestic, while B.C. law requires not a drop of domestic content. You should have bought a wine emblazoned with the Vintners Quality Alliance, or VQA, logo, which guarantees 100-per-cent domestic content and always has.
Lest I appear to be anything but a consumer advocate on this issue, let me say first that I support the initiatives. Clearer labels were necessary and separate store sections are good.
But this has been a tempest in a crystal decanter. Canada has a long history of importing bulk wine and grapes. Governments supported the practice largely to stimulate cash flow for new winery investments, and that's happened. The current "cellared in Canada" designation was endorsed by a broad coalition of growers, winemakers and government officials when it was hammered out in the mid-1990s.
But recently a number of boutique producers have been making noise about the plight of trying to market $50 pinot noirs alongside $8 and $9 bargain wines that appear to come from the same province. Admittedly, not an easy sell.
But few consumers or politicians seemed to care - until Jancis Robinson rode into town. The high-profile British wine writer visited B.C.'s Okanagan Valley this summer.
She followed up with a scathing column on her website under the headline "The Canadian con contd [continued]." Vincor was subsequently lambasted in the B.C. legislature for pasting its Olympic-sponsorship logo on bottles containing foreign juice - inventory that has since been voluntarily pulled.
"I think it is doing a disservice to real Canadian wine and its reputation abroad to continue with this misleading practice," Ms. Robinson wrote. "It is just so difficult to take Canadian producers seriously when they are allowed to mislead the wine-buying public to this extent."
I'll grant her the "disservice" part. But the rest of her complaint strikes me as unfair and, frankly, patronizing. Difficult to take Canadian producers seriously? Really? A Briton need not fly thousands of kilometres to British Columbia to uncover scandal in the wine industry. She need only cross the English Channel.
Here's a riddle. France is the world's third-largest importer of Sicilian wine, almost all of it in bulk. Ever encounter a bottle of Sicilian vino on your French travels? Didn't think so. I don't want to suggest all or even most of France's many struggling winemakers are so unscrupulous as to goose their juice with richly coloured, high-alcohol stuff from Italy's sunny south. But the Sicilian paradox would be interesting to ponder next time you're sipping an unusually rich glass of the house "Burgundy" at a French bistro.
Fact is, winemakers around the world, and especially in sun-deprived northern Europe, have a long history of misleading consumers. It's all supposed to be a thing of the past, of course. But it's clear illegal practices persist. In 2006, Georges Duboeuf, one of the richest and most famous producers in France, credited with turning Beaujolais Nouveau into a worldwide craze, was found guilty of defrauding consumers by mixing wine from lesser appellations into tanks of more expensive stuff. The case involved about 300,000 bottles worth of wine.
Was it an isolated case or rather the tip of an iceberg? I know where I'd place my bet. In 2007, a French consumer group published a report saying that up to a third of wines sold under France's hallowed appellation system could be from a different region than that listed on the label. The group, UFC-Que Choisir, pointed a finger at award panels for the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlee, or AOC, saying they were populated by local industry workers with vested interests. It declared the AOC system was turning into a joke.
I'm not condoning Canadian practices that have misled many consumers. Foreign content should be clearly labelled. But to single out Canada as some kind of cowboy frontier for snake-oil peddlers smacks to me of picking on the little guy.
You want seriously misleading but legal practices? In 2003, when New Zealand faced a harvest shortfall, a few prominent producers pulled a bold stunt. They started blending foreign juice into premium brands that had formerly contained 100-per-cent New Zealand wine. In one case, Montana, a large producer, made its Corbans Sauvignon Blanc with 54-per-cent Chilean grapes. Sacred Hill made two versions of its 2003 Whitecliff Estate Sauvignon Blanc - a 100-per-cent domestic bottling intended for restaurants and high-end retailers and a Chile-New Zealand blend for supermarkets.
It's easy to see conspiracies. But I'm not convinced our provincial retailers here were actively trying to hoodwink shoppers. If anything, stocking cellared in Canada wines next to the VQA offerings, many made by the same parent companies, seems to me a simple matter of merchandising logic and convenience.
And, frankly, there are plenty of Naked Grape and French Cross consumers who don't care where their grapes are grown. They just want wine that tastes good and - something most VQA wines can't boast but which flexible international blends sometimes can - is as consistent as Blue Light or Coors from year to year.
Retailers tend to prefer selling higher-margin brands, after all. In Ontario, the LCBO was already taking steps to literally distance cellared in Canada brands from the VQA shelves. LCBO spokesman Chris Layton says the retailer has been giving marquee treatment to VQA wines through its regular "Go Local" catalogue campaigns and special in-store displays, helping drive VQA sales to double-digit growth over the past year compared with flat sales for imports.
"I think the LCBO has done a good job in making changes to the signage," says Laurie Macdonald, executive director of VQA Ontario, an authority of the provincial government. "They now have signs that say 'VQA - 100 per cent Ontario' and I think it's been a few years since the cellared in Canada wines were shelved under an Ontario banner."
As I said, not exactly world-class scandal material. But I'm kind of amused that at least one esteemed foreign wine writer thinks so.

Abstract: "This was not true, and was an improper instruction to constrain the City's rezoning of the water lot," writes Ms. [Irene Faulkner]. "Thus, the Province appears to have improperly given the developer a 'veto' over City rezoning ... [and it] gives the perception that the province may unduly and improperly favour the developer's proposed marina."

Of all the harbours on the Pacific Coast there may not be any with an ambience as pleasing as Victoria's.
The stately facades of the Fairmont Empress Hotel and the provincial legislature look down on the water where float planes land next to tall ships and sea kayakers paddle past whale-watching boats headed for Juan de Fuca Strait.
The harbour is a focal point for the city - beloved by its citizens and visitors alike - and it is not a place you would expect to find under threat.
But Bob Evans, a developer and Conservative Party fundraiser, and the WAM Development Group, an Edmonton-based company that leases, manages and develops real estate, have made quiet a splash with their harbour proposal.
The Victoria International Marina project, which they want to build in 2010, would see a big piece of water across the harbour from the Empress turned into a home for up to 50 mega-yachts. The vessels would be up to 50 metres long and three storeys high - big enough, in other words, to blot out the views from the sea walk across the water to James Bay and the distant Olympic Mountains.
The development would push sea kayakers out of a protected water lane, forcing them to paddle through the marina, literally under the shadows of the luxury yachts, and the construction dredging would stir up bottom sediments laced with pollutants.
No wonder some 7,000 people signed a petition opposing the development.
And no wonder prominent figures, including former Liberal cabinet minister David Anderson, and former Victoria mayors Alan Lowe and Peter Pollen, have voiced objections.
In a recent op-ed piece in the local paper, Mr. Pollen, who was mayor in the seventies and eighties, described the project as "outlandish" and called for its rejection by government.
"The proposed marina is designed for wealthy owners from around the globe to buy moorage and store giant yachts there year-round," Mr. Pollen wrote.
"How appropriate is it to use seven acres in the middle of our small harbour to store 50 of these giant yachts? Most are tax writeoffs for the very rich, and for those concerned about our environment they represent the ultimate in consumerism and environmental irresponsibility," Mr. Pollen wrote.
"Ten thousand tons of fibreglass stored in our harbour will illustrate Victoria's lack of environmental values to the world!"
Victoria lawyer Irene Faulkner, representing the South Island Sea Kayaking Association, has perhaps mounted the most formidable opposition, outlining in a letter to Environment Minister Jim Prentice the environmental dangers the project poses.
And she raises troubling questions about the possible bias government officials have shown in handling the proposal.
Referring to documents obtained under Access to Information requests, Ms. Faulkner points to a 2007 e-mail in which the lead Transport Canada official on the marina file, Irene Lin, states: "I will champion this project..."
Ms. Faulkner also has a copy of a 2007 letter from Stan Hagen, then a provincial cabinet minister, to an individual (whose name is blanked out) in which Mr. Hagen expresses thanks for a briefing on the company's proposed marina and says: "We support WAM Development Ltd.'s plans to initiate tourism activity in the Victoria harbour..."
And there is a 2005 e-mail from an official in the provincial Land Management Bureau, to the City of Victoria, which states the developer, Mr. Evans, "has an interest" in a Crown water lot on the site, which the city wanted to convert to a park.
"This was not true, and was an improper instruction to constrain the City's rezoning of the water lot," writes Ms. Faulkner. "Thus, the Province appears to have improperly given the developer a 'veto' over City rezoning ... [and it] gives the perception that the province may unduly and improperly favour the developer's proposed marina."
Ms. Faulkner calls on Mr. Prentice to appoint an independent, unbiased review panel to hold public hearings on the environmental threats and into whether the project has been handled fairly by politicians and their officials.
That isn't much to ask when the fate of one of the country's most beautiful harbours is at stake.

Commercial real estate bounces back

Abstract: "This is a statistical sign of a recovery, even if it's not a full-blown recovery," said RealNet president George Carras, adding that sales are still only half of what they were going into the recession. "You can't call a bottom until it's passed, but this data is positive and very factual - it's real, hard evidence, and not anecdotal comments."

Full text: While not a full-blown recovery, sector sees encouraging trends 'across the country' in renewed transactions
Canada's commercial real estate market is on the mend, as an 18-month slump in Toronto has ended and other urban centres are showing signs of renewed activity that suggest the sector has de-coupled from its troubled U.S. counterpart.
After almost two years of flat or declining activity, industry tracker RealNet Canada Inc. said investments in commercial property in the Greater Toronto Area increased by 46 per cent in the third quarter over the second quarter, to $1.31-billion, while the number of transactions increased by 20 per cent.
"This is a statistical sign of a recovery, even if it's not a full-blown recovery," said RealNet president George Carras, adding that sales are still only half of what they were going into the recession. "You can't call a bottom until it's passed, but this data is positive and very factual - it's real, hard evidence, and not anecdotal comments."
More real-estate investors signed deals above the "critical" $10-million threshold. The third quarter saw 27 such deals worth $617-million, nearly double the value in the second quarter, when there were just 17 of those deals worth $313-million, a low point for the recession.
A healthy real-estate sector is considered important because commercial and residential property underpins a significant proportion of the assets of banks, pension funds and other institutions. Troubles in the sector contributed to the demise of some large trust companies in the early 1990s.
CB Richard Ellis vice-chairman John O'Bryan said the Canadian market still faces challenges as corporate tenants negotiate cheaper leases and others abandon warehouses and factories, but the numbers are encouraging as commercial real estate tends to lag the broader economy coming out of a recession. "We're nowhere near the volumes we were seeing in 2007," he said, when the value of deals neared $3-billion a quarter in the GTA. "But before things can get better, they have to stop getting worse and start to firm up - and this is what we are seeing."
While the RealNet data only reflect activity in the GTA, there have been signs of recovery elsewhere and office vacancy rates have stayed below 10 per cent, in contrast to the U.S. where vacancy rates have crept up toward 20 per cent.
"This isn't a local phenomenon - transaction volume is picking up with each passing week across the country," Mr. O'Bryan said. "There has been an exponential jump in inquiries to brokers."
Real estate investment trusts are in a particular position of strength, after raising almost $1-billion in equity in the last year while their main competitors - particularly private buyers - have found capital difficult to obtain. Whiterock REIT, for example, raised about $30-million through bought deals this year and in September took part in an $82-million deal for two office towers in the west end of Toronto.
"We really believe that Canadian commercial real estate is at a good point," Whiterock CEO Jason Underwood said. "The headlines have been so negative because of the problems in the United States, but Canada is so different from a performance standpoint and we believe there are some good opportunities. There's excess capacity in the pipelines and that means you're probably going to see a lot more transactions in the months ahead."
Patrick Lai of Toronto's Redcliff Realty Advisers said it's becoming difficult to justify sitting defensively on cash as quality properties come on the market. Mr. Lai signed a deal in September, buying a Markham, Ont., shopping centre for $32-million. "We all know what's happened this year in terms of the economic crisis, but now we certainly feel this is a good opportunity before everyone else starts to be really interested," he said.

Full text: The Mill: Now We Are Brody
Written by Matthew MacFadzean
Directed by Daryl Cloran
*½
The Mill: The Huron Bride
Written by Hannah Moscovitch
Directed by Christian Barry
***
At the Young Centre in Toronto
Theatrefront, a theatre company run by director Daryl Cloran, is floating a new real-estate metaphor for Canada. The country is not the greatest hotel on Earth, as Yann Martel famously put it, but a haunted sawmill with terrible secrets hidden under the floorboards.
The Mill is a series of four horror comedies that explore the country's history and identity using this compelling metaphor as a starting point. The first two parts premiered in Toronto this week: Now We Are Brody by Matthew MacFadzean, set in 1854; and The Huron Bride by Hannah Moscovitch, set in 1834. I saw the second part first, and the first part second, which was in reverse order but chronologically correct.
The Huron Bride works better on almost every level: The comedy and horror are well balanced; the frightening bits actually send chills down your spine; and the allegory is clear.
It opens in the present day with a thought-provoking lecture delivered by a professor of archeology (Richard Greenblatt), who shows slides from his recent excavation of an Upper Canadian mill, under which he discovered a mass grave. We then flash back to the mill in 1834, where Hazel Sheehan (Michelle Monteith) has been brought over from Liverpool by her cousin James MacGonigal (Ryan Hollyman).
In order to keep Hazel separate from the sex-starved men in this sparsely inhabited town, she is quartered in the mill. Soon she starts to see and hear strange things at night - paranormal activity that only increases after she becomes engaged to James. Is it his first bride, a Huron who died under suspicious circumstances, back to seek revenge on behalf of herself and her ancestors?
Moscovitch keeps you guessing as to when violence will erupt and who will initiate it, while Gillian Gallow's gorgeously atmospheric wooden set is covered with antique tools, all of which seem like murder weapons in waiting.
Director Christian Barry takes a psychological approach to generating suspense and fear. Except for the appearance of a child of the corn named Lyca, who seems to have wandered out of a Tim Burton movie, he succeeds.
Now We Are Brody , on the other hand, relies too much on special effects inexpertly executed by director Daryl Cloran. Because the play is being performed in a small theatre with the audience up close, most of the supposedly scary scenes merely come off as hokey. You can see the wires.
In this chapter, written in an uneven tone by MacFadzean, James MacGonigal's daughter Charlotte (Michelle Monteith, again) is drawn to the now abandoned mill by voices 20 years later.
After too many tedious scenes of her moving in and talking to an electronically distorted voice from beyond the grave, Charlotte is discovered by noble French-Canadian lumberjack Alexandre Martiniques (a hilarious Eric Goulem) and local busybody Rebecca Jessup (Maev Beaty), characters who both appear in the first play as well.
The townspeople want Charlotte to leave, while Lyca - still a child, still not frightening - wants her to stay. After a false ending, the bloodbath begins.
Maybe Now We Are Brody suffered from having been seen second rather than first. I wasn't sure why anyone would want to see two horror allegories in a row - especially since little was done to distinguish the time periods. The shows' mythologies and character psychologies are often at odds with one another as well, a peril of all multiple-author projects.
Despite Theatrefront's stated goal of making Canadian history "less boring," these first two chapters of The Mill seem uninterested in actual history. Instead, they simply lay the mindsets and concerns of today upon historical caricatures, the most amusing being the tourtière-eating Alexandre.
The depiction of aboriginals is more problematic, mainly because they are all dead or undead. (Lyca, played by blond-haired, pale-skinned Holly Lewis, is particularly cringe-worthy when she bursts into a traditional song.) There are much more interesting and complex native Canadian characters, ones who are more than just victims for the white folk to feel guilty about, in boring old actual Canadian history.
The Mill: Now We Are Brody and The Mill: The Huron Bride play until Oct. 24 (www.theatrefront.com).

Full text: Some say demographics doom hockey as the national sport. Others think integration is just a generation away. Erin Anderssen finds a glimmer in a potential NHL star
Hockey magic strikes with 35 seconds left in the first period. Before that, this Ontario Hockey League game between the London Knights and the Plymouth Whalers is clunky and scoreless. Nazem Kadri's father, Sam, mutters with exasperation in his first-level box.
"Come on, Naz," he grimaces each time the Knights' star forward lets the puck get away.
Nazem's mother, Sue, watches quietly but no less intently, fielding bathroom requests from her youngest daughter, Rayanne, 5, and organizing plates of chicken fingers. Sister Yasmine, 20, the eldest of the five, is texting, glancing up once in a while at a play. "Boys," her mom sighs.
For nearly 15 years - from the winter Nazem first donned a hockey jersey at age 4, and promptly helped lead his team to a championship victory, to the day this summer when the Toronto Maple Leafs called his name as a first-round draft pick - hockey has been the Kadris' full-time business.
Sam shines with pride as he recalls the day Nazem was born: As he raced into the hospital parking lot, he heard Tom Cochrane's Big League on the radio. "It just came right on: 'My kid is going to play in the big league,' " he says. "I swear to God."
Today, Sue still sends Nazem to games with spaghetti in Tupperware and frets about injuries and how soon he is likely to leave the basement of their home in the north end of London, Ont. Before his 19th-birthday party earlier this month, she found herself thinking, "This might be my last year putting balloons up."
The extended Kadri family - typically 60 aunts, uncles and cousins at each game - is scattered around the John Labatt Centre. Sam's own, elderly parents - his mother easily spotted in a white hijab among clumps of hockey jerseys - are across the ice, two rows up.
They don't speak much English - Sam's father refers to the penalty box as habis , Arabic for jail - but having arrived almost empty-handed 40 years ago from Lebanon, where they'd never heard of hockey, they understand the feat their grandson has achieved. They don't miss a game.
As the clock runs down on the period, No. 91, dancing on his skates, snatches the puck in a pass up the ice. Enough is enough, Nazem's body language says. He sweeps the puck gracefully around a Whalers defenceman, catches it again on the other side, skates in front of the net and flicks it in above the goalie's outstretched glove.
"Now that was pretty!" says Sam, when the cheering has died down. "That's what I'm talking about."
The next night, on Coach's Corner , a gushing Don Cherry will play a clip of this goal and criticize the Leafs for sending Nazem back to the OHL for experience despite a pre-season run in which he scored three goals and five assists.
But it's more than fancy stick handling that makes him special: He has a fairy-tale story that hockey, more than ever, wants to tell. Nazem Kadri is not the first Muslim to be drafted into the National Hockey League - perhaps his most prominent predecessor was Montreal's Ramzi Abid, a left-winger who played several seasons before heading to Europe in 2007. But none has faced such expectations of stardom.
It comes at a time when both minor and professional hockey are intent on drawing ethnic communities into the game.
Maple Leafs general manager Brian Burke admitted on draft day that it would be good news if Nazem inspired more Muslim youth to take up the sport. "If that increases our player pool in a part of society that we're not touching right now, that's great," he said.
NET LOSS
It's often said that the great Canadian game has become a victim of complacency, watching while Canada aged, faces changed and soccer fields became more common than urban rinks.
"For a long time, the hockey tradition has been that if you open the door to the arena, the rink will fill with kids," observes Scott Oakman, executive director of the Greater Toronto Hockey League (GTHL). "That's simply not the case any more."
Hockey is still trying to build a following across ethnic groups, as basketball and soccer have done. Visible-minority teenagers play the sport at about half the rate of their white peers, according to 2005 Statistics Canada data. A study this summer found that only about one-third of Canadian teens regularly watched NHL games on TV in 2008, down 10 points since 1992.
"Hockey has been pigeonholed as an upper-middle-class, white sport to a large degree," says Glen McCurdie, a spokesman for Hockey Canada. "But it has a very important role to play in bringing newer Canadians into the country and welcoming them."
There are increasing numbers of high-profile players from immigrant families, among them Calgary Flames captain Jarome Iginla, whose dad arrived in Canada from Nigeria at 18. But they still account for a small percentage.
"I don't think our sport truly reflects Canadian society," says former NHL goalie Kevin Weekes, now a CBC hockey commentator, whose parents came from Barbados and eventually gave in to their son's pleas to play a game he first learned on the street.
"From my own experience, your parents immigrate here and they turn the television on, and they don't hear a name that sounds familiar, or a face that looks familiar. In that case, you are losing kids right off the bat."
Unlike soccer, which requires only cleats and an open field, hockey is time-consuming and expensive. And it's harder to start playing at a later age and still catch up on skill levels.
In an effort to help, minor hockey - though cash-strapped itself - is offering more free workshops, and the GTHL passed a new resolution to let teams to opt out of games on religious holidays.
But if hockey has been getting short shrift in Canada's newer ethnic communities, it's not for lack of interest. In Muslim communities across the country, ball hockey - a more accessible alternative - has become a phenomenon, spawning serious tournaments where players are ranked and traded.
And the CBC's broadcast of Hockey Night in Canada in Punjabi, now two years old, has drawn "a huge following," says Sukhpreet Singh, a customs officers in Surrey, B.C., who runs a 3,000-member Facebook group on the show. Young Sikh Canadians often watch the show with their grandparents, he says, and it has raised the profile of promising Sikh hockey players.
Many immigrant families understand the doors hockey can open for their children. Samren Sandhu, now a star forward for the University of Ottawa Gee-Gees, had an Indian-born father who worked hard to put him in hockey - first in the small town of Sparwood, B.C., and then in Calgary - knowing it was key to making friends.
Coming home from long shifts at the local mine, where he worked as a machinist, Bharpinder Sandhu spent hours practising with his young son in the basement and analyzing plays on a whiteboard. Now, hockey fever has struck family-wide - the game's always on at gatherings and many of Samren's cousins have signed up to play.
Such dynamics make Nazem Kadri any team's dream. Young, polite and grounded by a warm, devoted family, he represents the game's future in an increasingly diverse nation. In Arabic, Nazem means "leader": A lot of people count on him living up to his name.
HARDWOOD SLAP SHOTS
No matter where you come from, almost all hockey stories start with a father dreaming of his boy playing in the NHL. The eldest of seven children, Sam Kadri was four years old when he arrived in Canada with his parents, who had left war-torn Lebanon for better prospects in Ontario.
His dad worked two jobs as a janitor to pay the bills, and though Sam grew up playing street hockey and pickup games on frozen ponds and being mesmerized Saturday evenings by Hockey Night in Canada , he never asked his parents to sign him up.
"I couldn't see seven kids, and my father being the only one working, and trying to accommodate me playing hockey," Sam says, sitting at his kitchen table with his wife and daughters. But his own kids would be different.
"We had the stick before he started walking," Sue smiles.
"We had the skates before he came out," Sam says.
"I thought he was crazy sometimes," his wife admits.
"She didn't like him rollerblading on the hardwood floors," Sam says. "We toned it down on the slap shot."
By the time Nazem was 2, Sam was a successful businessmen with a used-car business and two things his father never had - the means and time to put his son in hockey. (His daughters, too, but they preferred watching their brother.)
Like dads across the country, he adopted a winter-morning ritual that would last years: Get up in the dark, grab a coffee, warm the car, lace Nazem's skates up in bed, throw his groggy boy over his shoulder and drive him to the rink.
"I could barely open my eyes," Nazem remembers.
With his dad watching faithfully, Nazem made the London Junior Knights Team at 6, and played at AAA level into his teenage years. His sisters were his personal cheerleaders - Rayanne went to her first game when she was one week old - and at out-of-town tournaments, they made friends and went shopping. ("It always cost me double," Sam sighs.)
They spared no expense on equipment and summer skills camps. At 15, Nazem was drafted by the Kitchener Rangers in the OHL, requiring him to move away to be billeted with a local couple. "When I dropped him off," his dad says, "it felt like my heart was being ripped out."
But it all led to the evening of June 26, when about 100 Kadri relatives and friends filled a section at the Bell Centre in Montreal. When the Leafs' turn came up, the local crowd booed Brian Burke. Then Nazem was called.
His father grabbed him first. "I love you, buddy," he whispered. And as Nazem walked down to the stage to pull the Leafs jersey over his head, his family began chanting. "All you started to hear in the silence of the whole Bell centre was 'Kadri! Kadri!' " Sam says. "It was overwhelming."
KNIFE'S EDGE
Raising three children in the small farming town of Avenmore, Ont., a few kilometres outside Cornwall, Mostafa and Zahra Elgazzar understood immediately that the key to integrating their kids was to put them in hockey skates.
When Mostafa came from Egypt in 1972 (promptly falling on the ice outside Montreal's Dorval airport), his hockey knowledge was limited to a short clip in an information video shown at the embassy where he got his visa.
Once Zahra arrived a couple of years later, they were initiated by their first Canadian friend, who would explain the rules as they watched TV and make them ardent fans of the Canadiens and Guy Lafleur.
"I used to wonder, 'How do they do this?' " Zahra says. "The player is on a knife on ice. We were fascinated."
In Avenmore, they were the only Muslim family, referred to as "the immigrants." But with hockey that soon changed. Their boys, Khalid and Omar, became stars, earning the nicknames Terminator and the Egyptian Magician.
Their daughter, Sarah, soon traded figure skates for hockey, and became a talented pint-sized goalie - at 5 feet and barely 100 pounds, her gear weighed more than she did.
While Mostafa worked as a janitor at night and went to school during the day, Zahra churned out sandwiches for practices, worked in the rink cafeteria and prayed in a high corner of the stands when the team was losing - at the urging of the other parents.
But it wasn't always easy. The boys often found themselves the subject of racial slurs on the ice and off-colour jokes in locker rooms, Khalid recalls. "If we arrived late, they'd say, 'Hey, Omar, did your flying camel not start?' But sometimes it went too far."
In Grade 10, Khalid quit a team after a player insulted his mother in the locker room. It was resolved quickly - after all, Khalid was the team's top scorer.
"In the end, it was a net gain," says Khalid, now a married Ottawa lawyer, expecting his first son and still playing hockey. "We got to know each other better. He learned quite a bit and so did I. He was just a kid who hadn't really been exposed to other cultures."
But Canada's obsession with hockey, Omar suggests, also makes people possessive about it. "It's sacred to them. It's as if they protect it," he says, with Khalid nodding in agreement.
However, he adds, "Nazem Kadri is a household name now in the hockey world. I think that's broken down a barrier. Now it's becoming normal for a Muslim to play hockey and to play it well."
"I joke to my teammates, 'Look at Kadri. It's over - we're coming.' "
In the meantime, some hockey parents have taken their own initiatives. Paul Song, a real-estate agent whose family settled in Canada from Korea when he was 10 and who used to lug his hockey gear on the bus to get to games because his parents were busy working, helped start a Saturday-night hockey program in northern Toronto for Korean youth. This year, 70 kids are lacing up.
"Once the kids get on the ice, they force their parents to bring them," says Mr. Song, whose children now play competitively.
Marion Christensen, a devoted hockey mom in northeast Calgary, which has a large ethnic community, took a similar step after "sitting in cold arenas for eight years wanting to see more diversity in hockey." This past summer, with another mom, she organized a free five-day workshop for immigrant children - with complimentary transportation and gear.
"I guess I had this idea that if you get immigrant kids playing hockey, they are going to feel a part of Canadian culture. They are going to feel included because of what they bring to the team and not necessarily looked at because of the colour of their skin and their accent."
In the end, 24 boys and girls 8 to 15 years old signed up, most of them with parents from Sudan - including Khadiga Elmahdi, who says she would not have known how to get her three boys into hockey without it. She knew when she came here seven years ago how important the sport was to Canada's culture. She has found it hard to meet people, but hockey seems like a social entry point for herself as well as for her three sons.
She is waiting for confirmation of their registration in an organized program, with Ms. Christensen's help. Soon she will be juggling practices between her business studies. "Now I will be a hockey mom."
PAYING PENALTIES Toward the end of the third period, Nazem Kadri draws a careless penalty, slashing the top of a Plymouth player's stick. He skates angrily over to the penalty box to sit out the rest of the game.
His father fumes, "He knows better than that," he says fiercely. "He'll be hearing about that later."
Sue shakes her head, and whispers: "He's really just a big teddy bear."
Nazem is generous with his praise for his parents, and the roles that they played in his success. "For them to bring hockey into my life, when it wasn't their lifestyle so much, was definitely a special thing."
His father understands that his son's career is now a business - he recently earned $4,500 signing his name on 300 hockey cards - and when Nazem went to the bank to deposit his hefty check from the Leafs, Sam made sure that only a few thousand dollars went into Nazem's personal account.
Sue, meanwhile, has been coaxing her son to take a course at university this winter "just to keep his options open." Yet when he collided with a helmet last year and broke his jaw, she was the one who blended up shepherd's pie and pasta so Nazem could suck it through a straw and not lose weight. And when a Windsor fan shouted from the rafters, "Get that terrorist off the ice!" it was Sue who was the angriest.
"That hurt a lot. I mean, he's Canadian, born and raised. I thought, how dare you say that to my kid? Any kid?"
They practise their faith with a Western flexibility. During Ramadan, the Knights set aside a room for the family to pray, but typically they say their prayers at home after the game. Unlike many of her female relatives, Sue does not wear the hijab - "I am not there yet," she says. And while Nazem describes himself as a practising Muslim, he can't fast during hockey season.
On Friday night, one of her daughters points to a young brunette in a yellow jacket sitting across the rink - Nazem's girlfriend, she tells her mom. Sue shrugs: "He hasn't brought anyone home yet. I assume that will happen when it's important."
The cheering builds as the buzzer goes off. The Knights have won 2-1, and the fans have watched their star score a fabulous goal. Nazem skates out of the penalty box, almost sheepishly, not looking up at his dad.
"He'll probably try to come home later, so I'm sleeping," laughs Sam. "It's always easier the next day."
Sue, packing up the girls, just smiles.

Sick Kids' Foundation on the mend

Author: Waldie, Paul

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/sick-kids-foundation-on-mend/docview/382608431/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: According to charity research firm CharityCan, under Mr. O'[Mahoney], Sick Kids' costs jumped 31 per cent annually on average while donations climbed 18 per cent. Mr. O'Mahoney also nearly doubled the size of the foundation's staff and offered hefty salaries to new recruits (last year, 10 employees earned $160,000 Canadian or more).

Full text: Once the envy of many charities, the embattled non-profit is trying to repair its image after CEO's pricey payout
Nadene Milnes is a long-time donor to the Hospital for Sick Children Foundation, but when she found out that the foundation says its former president was paid $2.7-million last year, she started re-thinking how much she gives.
"It's stupid," Ms. Milnes said bluntly from her home in Wasaga Beach, Ont., where she works as a real-estate agent. Ms. Milnes said she still believes in the work of the hospital and will keep giving. But, she added, "I might not donate as much."
For years, Sick Kids Foundation didn't have to worry too much about donors like Ms. Milnes. Thanks to a sterling public image - who wouldn't support a cause that helps make children healthy? - the foundation has become the envy of charities across the country.
It raises nearly $100-million some years and has a network of 300,000 donors and 10,000 volunteers.
It's also a key source of funding for the hospital, providing around $60-million annually toward new equipment and research programs.
But a series of controversies over the last few months has left the foundation's reputation tarnished and officials scrambling to reassure donors.
The problems started in January with the sudden departure of several top executives, including president Michael O'Mahoney.
Then there was a $5-million lawsuit, filled with allegations the foundation botched a fundraising project that could have raised $1.2-million.
Finally, in September, the foundation said it paid Mr. O'Mahoney $2.7-million last year, which included $2.1-million in severance. (Mr. O'Mahoney disputed those figures in a statement but declined to elaborate.)
All of this came as the recession dried up donations and battered the foundation's investments, causing its total assets to fall 13 per cent to $489-million as of March 31, 2009, the first drop in five years.
"For them, I'm sure it's a bit of a nightmare," said Hilary Pearson, chief executive of Philanthropic Foundations Canada, which represents private foundations.
"No charity board wants to be in the position that they are in."
Ms. Pearson, whose organization does not represent public foundations such as Sick Kids, believes the foundation will over come its problems. "I do think they'll get through it, because I do think, at the end of the day, people have tremendous faith in the institution."
But others say it will take some persuading to get them to contribute.
The severance payment "is a concern," said Toronto philanthropist Jim Fleck. "One of the considerations when someone is giving to an institution is what percentage actually goes to doing whatever it is you are supporting and what percentage goes to the administration [toward] getting the money."
Sick Kids is trying to turn things around. It hired Ted Garrard, a well-respected fundraising executive from the University of Western Ontario, as chief executive and announced a major overhaul of its operations. The restructuring included reducing the number of employees, cutting costs and reviewing all fundraising activities to make sure they are cost effective.
"What we had to do was to address some of the legacy matters before we ... [went] forward," Mr. Garrard said. His own salary - $400,000 with up to $100,000 in bonus - will be less than Mr. O'Mahoney's base salary, which was $574,000 (U.S.) last year.
Mr. Garrard, an economist who once worked as a policy adviser to the Ontario Liberal Party, represents a sharp contrast to his predecessor.
Mr. O'Mahoney arrived at Sick Kids in 2003 from Washington, D.C., as something of a fundraising superstar. Charismatic and energetic, he brought an aggressive approach to raising money.
His competitive style put him into conflict with other charities. It didn't help that he organized fundraising drives and door-to-door campaigns outside Toronto, cutting into efforts by local charities. He took aim at workplace contributions to the United Way, encouraging employees to direct their gifts to Sick Kids. When United Way officials complained, Mr. O'Mahoney shot back that the United Way was a rival, not a colleague.
Mr. O'Mahoney defended his relations with the United Way and other charities, saying that he and his staff "worked collaboratively with United Way and their fundraising efforts."
Mr. O'Mahoney also had many successes during his tenure.
He attracted several major gifts, including $30-million from the Labatt family and $3-million from Toronto businessman Mitchell Goldhar. He also tripled the size of the donor base and more than doubled the foundation's annual revenue to $98-million.
"I am very proud of the achievements made during my leadership of the foundation," he said in a statement. "I delivered and surpassed every expectation and measurable objective."
According to charity research firm CharityCan, under Mr. O'Mahoney, Sick Kids' costs jumped 31 per cent annually on average while donations climbed 18 per cent. Mr. O'Mahoney also nearly doubled the size of the foundation's staff and offered hefty salaries to new recruits (last year, 10 employees earned $160,000 Canadian or more). He also launched an expensive advertising campaign called "Believe," which featured television and newspaper ads promoting the foundation and the hospital.
One of the maverick fundraiser's more unusual ventures was a planned soccer tournament featuring top European teams such as Juventus, AC Milan and Glasgow Rangers FC. The idea was to hold games in cities across Canada with proceeds going to the foundation.
Sick Kids officials started working on the project last year with Toronto businesswoman Angela Nowacin, who had European soccer connections. The foundation agreed to pay her up to $40,000 a month and cover some of the costs for two trips to Europe, according to court filings.
But just before Mr. O'Mahoney left, the foundation abruptly cancelled the tournament and a related sponsorship deal. It paid Ms. Nowacin $80,000, according to court filings. She launched a $5-million lawsuit in February for breach of contract and alleges the foundation missed out on what could have been a $1.2-million opportunity. In a statement of defence, the foundation alleges there was no formal contract and that Ms. Nowacin's work was unsuccessful.
Mr. O'Mahoney questioned the severance package quoted by the foundation, saying in a statement, "the amount cited [Sept. 30] does not tally with the numbers in the severance package offered to me. It represents a sum that is far greater than the one I was offered." He did not provide details.
Foundation chair Patsy Anderson said the board had no regrets about the hiring. "Mr. O'Mahoney was a very energetic and innovative leader," she said, adding that he raised $489-million in total. "He was very, very unique, a great leader in a high-growth market."
Mr. Garrard, 51, plans a new approach to fundraising at the foundation. He wants to put more emphasis on attracting larger gifts instead of relying on costly fundraising activities such as lotteries and door-to-door drives. Currently about one-third of the foundation's annual gifts are $10,000 or more. Mr. Garrard said that figure needs to double to two-thirds of the total.
He has also set an ambitious goal of raising $750-million over the next five years, about 53 per cent more than Sick Kids raised during the last five years. "There's never been a fundraising goal that I haven't felt capable of taking on," he said.
Donations have started picking up, he added, and the foundation's investments have regained much of their losses in recent months as the stock market recovers. Total assets are back above $500-million.
Sydney Birrell is one of those ready to give the foundation another chance.
He and his family have raised $3.5-million for the foundation in the name of their son James, who died in 2001 at the age of 8 after being diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a cancer affecting the central nervous system.
"I was pretty perturbed by stuff that has been going on," he said from his home in Peterborough, Ont. "But it's history. They have made major changes and they are going in a new direction. I am persuaded that they are doing things very well now."

Agent Anna Michaelidis knew this one-bedroom suite would sell quickly with no other properties to available within the high rise, which is part of a condominium complex on the former Molson Brewery site by Fort York.
However, she still took extra steps to stage the vacant fourth-floor unit with everything from furniture to pillows.
"We had about 75 showings in the course of four or five days," says Ms. Michaelidis. "Being the only one [for sale] and showing ... like a model suite really helped us secure the highest price in the building to date."
It's also important that the unit features wall-to-wall and full height windows and private outdoor space facing east. "From the balcony, you get a beautiful view of the CN Tower and all the beautiful buildings," says Ms. Michaelidis. "A lot of [other units] face the highway."
In other aspects, the unit is fairly average with a breakfast bar between the open kitchen and living and dining area.
Other essentials include a full bathroom, ensuite laundry facilities and underground parking.
A monthly fee of $263 covers heating costs and upkeep of fitness facilities, such as the pool, hot tub and gym. Residents can also socialize at the theatre and rooftop garden.
"The building is quite nice," adds Ms. Michaelidis.
Local amenities include parks, Waterfront Trail and yacht clubs, plus public transit and the QEW.

Full text: RIVERHOUSE AT THE OLD MILL
LOCATION: Kingsway
BUILDER/DEVELOPER: Lanterra Developments
SIZE: 868 to 2,125 square feet PRICE: $500,000's to $2-million
CONTACT: To register, phone 416-766-7343 or visit www.riverhousecondos.ca
In the prestigious Kingsway area, the Old Mill Inn and Spa is a popular destination where hotel and spa guests are pampered amid panoramic views of the Humber River valley.
Across the street, on the banks of the Humber, this new condominium projects aims to give homeowners a similar experience with spacious luxury suites, fashionable amenities spaces and unobstructed vistas of the surrounding landscape.
Lanterra Developments is now giving registered buyers a preview of the 10-storey residence - named the Riverhouse at the Old Mill - that will rise from what is now a parking lot at the historic hotel northwest of Bloor and Jane streets.
"I have never, ever worked on a nicer piece of land," says Lanterra chairman Mark Mandelbaum. "The river wraps around the project, so almost every single unit has a commanding view of the river, even on the south side."
Though the scenic setting will appeal to buyers across the city, the upscale development caters to locals downsizing from large, stately homes.
"We think that the people who are going to buy here are people in the area that are very discerning in their tastes," says Mr. Mandelbaum. "I don't think there are any condo options of that calibre [in the area]."
Many residents want to stay in the established community for its small-town ambience, tree-lined streets and outdoor attractions, from parks to walking trails.
The site is within a short walk to the Old Mill Tennis Club and countless shops and restaurants in the Kingsway Village and Bloor West Village.
"One of the other things that [the project] has - which is absolutely unique - is that it's about a 30-second walk to the Bloor subway stop," says Mr. Mandelbaum.
"That's not something you can normally find in a project where there's so much scenery and greenery around it."
Further engaging the visual senses, Page + Steele / IBI Group Architects designed the elegant façade with brick, limestone, precast stone and glass.
Munge Leung Design Associates will oversee all interior spaces, starting with a lobby with rich wood finishes, decorative columns and stone tile floors.
Residents will be able to use an indoor pool and hot tub with an outdoor terrace, a steam room and a gym.
Meanwhile, social gatherings could be held in a party room with a caterer's kitchen, a library featuring a fireplace, and an adjacent room overlooking the Humber River.
Lavish appointments will continue in the suites, with coffered entry foyers, engineered hardwood floors in the principal rooms and smooth, nine-foot ceilings. Units on the top two floors will be a foot taller.
The kitchens will have designer cabinetry, granite countertops and glass tile or marble backsplashes with Miele fridges, cook-tops, wall ovens and dishwashers.
Ensuite bathrooms will be finished with marble floors and vanities, soaker tubs and glass shower stalls.
There will be more than 80 suites available between 868 and 2,125 square feet, though units can be combined.
"There are a couple of units that have open kitchens," says Mr. Mandelbaum. "But generally speaking, the unit designs tend towards the more classic design with formal rooms and very significant entry foyers."
Units will come with laundry machines, parking and a monthly fee of 56 cents per square foot.
As a preview bonus, purchasers of suites larger than 1,893 square feet will receive a gas fireplace and locker.
Move-in dates are set for spring 2013.

Abstract: For example, the company's records show that a financial adviser for Pete Estler, a Colorado-based entrepreneur and chief executive officer of an upscale vacation company, e-mailed Newport to say that an offshore corporation had purchased a $300,000 painting that Mr. Estler had hung in his home. The offshore corporation should arrange insurance, the e-mail says, because "it may bring up questions if Pete insures it." One former Newport employee says Mr.

Full text: With Ottawa vowing to crack down on corporate crime, Greg McArthur examines the bizarre case of Michael Ritter, the high-profile Alberta 'wealth manager' who served just 18 months of a 10-year sentence after stealing millions of his clients' dollars
High above the silt-stained North Saskatchewan River, the mansions hover like a prairie oasis. In this exclusive enclave just down the street from one of Edmonton's more prestigious golf courses, Michael Ritter is busy reconnecting with his toys.
He spends his time playing host to friends in his Celtic-themed basement modelled on a local pub, splashing around his hot tub and walking Monte, his skittish and spoiled little Havanese. At 52, he has discovered Facebook, where he recently announced: "Michael Ritter finally got his Jaguar running again after not driving it for over three years!"
The Jag had been idle because Mr. Ritter, once a prominent wealth manager and former chief parliamentary counsel to the Alberta Legislature, was behind bars, convicted of theft and fraud involving what the judge described as a "staggering" amount of money. He admitted to stealing $10.5-million (U.S.) from one client and helping another to revive a $270-million Ponzi scheme that had been shut down south of the border.
Released last year, Mr. Ritter walked out of jail to find the world about to change.
The financial collapse has exposed a dark side to the global economy with the prosecution of such white-collar criminals as Bernie Madoff and "Sir" Allen Stanford. Vilified for perpetrating the biggest fraud in U.S. history, Mr. Madoff seems destined to die behind bars, and Mr. Stanford, the Texas financier accused of bilking investors of $7-billion (U.S.), faces 250 years in jail. Meanwhile, their assets - the villas, yachts, cars and condos - are under attack from creditors and prosecutors.
Closer to home, authorities are scrambling to respond to the collapse of empires built by financial advisers such as Montrealer Earl Jones and two Albertans recently accused of mishandling hundreds of millions of investment dollars.
Talking tough on fraud, securities regulation and offshore tax evasion is all the rage in Ottawa, and last month the government announced that it will increase mandatory minimum sentences for those convicted of fraud.
"Canadians lose faith in the criminal justice system when they feel that the punishment does not fit the crime," Justice Minister Rob Nicholson said. "The legislation we plan to introduce will send the message that committing fraud will have serious consequences."
Given the outrage, it seems like a good time to ask what the consequences are for white-collar crime in Canada. Mr. Ritter is a case study.
Although given the maximum sentence of 10 years when he was convicted in October, 2006, he served just 18 months in a minimum-security prison. He also failed to recover the millions of dollars he was asked, as part of his plea bargain, to track down as restitution for his victims.
Back in his three-storey refuge, with its home theatre and cherrywood humidor, he's not keen to look back. "I don't want to speak with the media," he says through the intercom.
Such reticence is something new for the high-flying Mr. Ritter, but professionally he was very skilled at keeping a low profile. He went to jail for taking people's cash, but his real specialty - as revealed by a 369-page catalogue of records seized by the police and obtained by The Globe and Mail - was helping them hide it.
It's how he helped to turn Edmonton into a magnet for dirty money.
THE IMAGE
When it comes to Michael Peter Ritter, only a few facts are undisputed: He was born on March 16, 1957. He has a severe peanut allergy, a warm, cherubic face and the gift of gab.
The son of a principal at a Catholic high school, he's brainy and fancies himself a social progressive. In interviews, he has acknowledged that he struggled as a young man to come to terms with the fact that he's gay.
In academe, though, he was a picture of confidence. He attended the University of Alberta, where he caught the attention of law and politics professor Leslie Green, who says, "I found him both as a student and as a friend a charming person."
He left for England to pursue a law degree, and came back telling people that he had begun his studies at the University of London and finished them at the London School of Economics. He also said he had been admitted to Gray's Inn, one of four professional associations for English barristers - a membership that entitled him to dine and study in a building straight out of Harry Potter . As well, he'd interned in the House of Lords legal division, attended the Université de Genève and advised the Swiss Bankers Association.
The boy from the oil patch had gone cosmopolitan. And what better place to apply his new skills than in the legislature of his home province?
In 1988, Progressive Conservative MLA David Carter, then speaker of Alberta's Legislative Assembly, hired Mr. Ritter as chief parliamentary counsel; he was to advise lawmakers on everything from conflict-of-interest guidelines to the constitutionality of proposed bills.
"Parliamentary procedure works better than NyQuil, but he had this personality that was able to make this topic come alive," says Howard Yeung, a former employee who was still in high school when he met Mr. Ritter during Alberta's annual model legislature for students.
He could quote obscure rules of procedure, and seemed fascinated with laws of jurisdiction - specifically how someone could do something in one place that's not condoned elsewhere.
For example, one day in 1992, when questioned by a television reporter about his expenses, Mr. Carter grabbed a cameraman and slammed him into the wall. There was an uproar, and Mr. Ritter was called in to quell the throng. He calmly told reporters that, in the confines of the legislature, the Speaker could do whatever he wanted as long as he had the approval of the House. "There are no other outside authorities that can review the matter," he declared.
Stuart Serediuk, the cameraman on the receiving end of the attack, recalls thinking: "That cannot be right. That cannot be right."
Still, he felt obliged to follow Mr. Ritter's edict, and he wasn't alone. Even now, two decades later, senior Edmonton lawyers still seethe at the memory of a warning from Mr. Ritter that, if they tried to serve a politician with legal papers in the legislature, they would be arrested.
Even they deferred to him, however, although there were nagging doubts. Why, for example, had he never joined the Law Society of Alberta? When asked, Mr. Ritter simply said that, as a legislative counsel, he was independent and not required to join.
It would be more than a decade before the skeptics learned that his credentials were almost completely made up. He had never graduated in London, and Gray's Inn, the Université de Genève and the Swiss Bankers Association had no record of him.
In 1993, Mr. Carter retired, and Mr. Ritter left with him. In an exit interview with the Edmonton Journal, he mused about starting a gift-card business, saying, "I don't think I'm cut out to be a good bureaucrat - I'm surprised I actually pulled it off for six years."
He made the leap with pizzazz, throwing a huge party on the 18th floor of Edmonton's highest tower, with ice sculptures, caviar and a raft of local luminaries, to launch his new venture. But he wasn't selling gift cards; Canadian Offshore Financial was to specialize in protecting people's assets.
Mr. Ritter had concocted a surefire formula for concealing fortunes from prying eyes. Pay a $25,000 start-up fee, and he and his staff would create a corporation or trust in Central America or on some South Pacific island, and then ensconce your money in a foreign account, usually Swiss.
There is nothing wrong with having such an account, as long as you disclose its contents and any income earned to the Canada Revenue Agency. The problem is that the secrecy laws for Swiss accounts are so strict that, unless such disclosure is made, authorities don't know an account exists.
"These laws protect offshore investors from ... both private and governmental authorities," the company advertised.
Later renamed Newport Pacific Financial, the business caught on, sparking heady times for its cadre of young employees, most of them just out of the University of Alberta law school. Their boss was a dizzying personality. One minute, he would be dashing out the door to catch a flight to Switzerland and the next announcing that he had ordered in sushi for everyone. Monte was always reserved a spot on the boardroom table, and ate off his own plate. And the parties Mr. Ritter threw were legendary. One night, he rented sumo-wrestler suits and guests took turns bouncing off each other in a boozy haze.
More significant is the fact that he managed almost overnight - and operating in a regulatory vacuum because the service he offered required no official oversight - to turn Edmonton into a hub for international wealth. Teams from foreign institutions such as Credit Suisse and AIG Private Bank, until recently a Swiss affiliate of the insurance giant central to Wall Street's collapse, descended on the snow-banked streets, eager for a piece of the action.
THE CLIENTELE
Newport offered one-stop offshore shopping for "people of means." But who exactly were these "people"? A former lawyer for Newport, and a friend of Mr. Ritter, declines to speak on the record, but offers this description of the clientele: "Some people don't trust governments and so they've got assets in different places."
Even so, the ex-staffer contends, Mr. Ritter "was the most vigilant person in terms of making sure we knew who the clients were, that we weren't handling any money that was inappropriate."
However, a summary of the computer files and thousands of pages of documents the RCMP eventually seized from Newport, as well as interviews with former associates and law-enforcement officials, suggests that Mr. Ritter's radar wasn't foolproof.
Newport employees vividly recall the summer day in 2002 when a man with a heavy accent and dressed in black walked into the office. He was Bogdan Petrescu, and a former staffer says, "Mike told me Bogdan controlled tobacco imports into Romania."
Mr. Petrescu came to be one of Newport's bigger clients, and sometimes allowed Mr. Ritter to use his villa on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. He also was featured in State Mafia , a book published the same year by two Romanian journalists, and the Romanian Ministry of the Interior has confirmed that it investigated allegations of smuggling, but no charges were ever laid.
Another international client was James Sheret Jr., a convicted stock-market manipulator from California who had a beachfront home in Malibu and a Newport-created bank account in Switzerland. He made more than $1-million by sending a barrage of phony e-mail endorsements for nearly worthless penny stocks, which he sold when the price spiked.
The documents show that he was one of several tech-savvy rogues who streamed into Newport's offices as governments around the world were struggling to tame the Wild Wild West of the Internet.
Brian McDaid, a high-profile spammer who was shut down and fined by U.S. authorities in 2007 for claiming his medical products reversed the aging process, secreted hundreds of thousands of dollars in Switzerland through Newport.
The company also assisted Gamma Entertainment, a Montreal online pornography service that in 2004 paid two teenagers to distribute its pop-up ads to unsuspecting Internet users. One teen went to prison for hacking into a network of 400,000 computers.
When authorities tried to trace someone's money, the trail would reach Newport and go cold. "There were often judgments coming for clients, where [investigators] were trying to track the assets," says Patrick Mitchell, a former pilot and personal assistant to Mr. Ritter, "but Mike knew how to protect them. There was nothing they could do."
The seized records also help to explain a bizarre photograph that emerged during the investigation. Taken in 2001, it shows Mr. Ritter and Mr. Carter, the former legislative speaker, posing with enough $20 bills to fill a kitchen sink. Five years later, one of his ex-employees testified in court that for three years in a row Mr. Ritter personally delivered millions in cash to AIG Private Bank in Zurich. One year, the money arrived at Newport in a gift-wrapped box.
The identity of the client was never made public. But the Newport material seized by the Mounties shows that an offshore corporation created for "Fred Carpenter - a.k.a. 'The Fruit Man' " had $220,000 in cash being held somewhere in a box marked "Jelly Beans," and former staffers confirm that Mr. Carpenter was the client in question. At the time, he owned of a wholesale fruit business in Calgary that has since declared bankruptcy, with dozens of creditors trying to recover more than $830,000 they are owed.
The trustee overseeing the distribution of the company's assets recently filed a court document declaring that, shortly before Fred's Fruit Company filed for bankruptcy, it made a "fraudulent" payment of $400,000 to a numbered company controlled by Mr. Carpenter (who did not respond to numerous interview requests).
Mr. Carter, who is also an ordained Anglican priest, says he helped Mr. Ritter carry the money to Switzerland, but didn't think there was anything suspicious about the trip: "Wasn't my business."
Asked how he would react if he found out the goal was to evade taxes, Mr. Carter replies: "Hey ... that's been going on for decades."
UNTRACEABLE PLASTIC
Many of Newport's clients appear to have been perfectly ordinary - doctors, dentists and diplomats pop up repeatedly in the documents taken from its office. But one name will be familiar to many Canadians, that of Olympic ice dancer Isabelle Duchesnay.
Ms. Duchesnay, a Canadian who won a silver medal while representing France at the 1992 Games in Albertville, insists that she was not a client of Newport or Mr. Ritter. "I never spoke to him really," she says. "I didn't know a thing."
But she also declines to explain why Newport records include a series of transactions involving her, including $3,000 wired to her on Jan. 2, 2002. The money had come from a Swiss account with the code name "Tango."
"Everything's been taken care of because everything is in compliance with everything," says Ms. Duchesnay, who lives in Aylmer, Que. "I'm as free as a bird."
But former Newport officials confirm that she was a long-time client, and one of them recalls an angry phone call he received from her family when a credit card issued by a Swiss bank did not cover the purchase of a pair of earrings. "My sympathies were particularly low that day," the ex-employee says, "but we made sure the card was working again."
Offshore credit cards permitted clients to gain access to their funds as though they were using a debit card. The foreign bank would simply debit their accounts to pay the bill, and account statements were always mailed to Newport, not the card holder.
In fact, keeping a distance between transactions and the people making them was a Newport priority.
For example, the company's records show that a financial adviser for Pete Estler, a Colorado-based entrepreneur and chief executive officer of an upscale vacation company, e-mailed Newport to say that an offshore corporation had purchased a $300,000 painting that Mr. Estler had hung in his home. The offshore corporation should arrange insurance, the e-mail says, because "it may bring up questions if Pete insures it." One former Newport employee says Mr. Ritter reminded clients of their legal obligation to report their earnings to authorities, but says there was a nudge-nudge, wink-wink undertone to the warning. "His moral was, 'Look, people buy fancy sports cars all the time, and if they're driving too fast, they get arrested or they get a speeding ticket.' Same with these [accounts]."
But even when Newport was hitting its stride - at its peak, employees estimate, it was overseeing between $100-million and $200-million - it appears that most outsiders didn't have a clue what it was doing. The people who usually ask hard questions, the media, were still too busy soliciting Mr. Ritter's opinion about legislative issues. Besides, the silver-haired scholar appeared to have the official seal of approval. He helped law students taking part in an international debate competition known as the Jessup Moots and hung out with some of Edmonton's leading lawyers. In 1998, the federal government of Jean Chretien invited the company on its "Team Canada" trade mission to Latin America.
Perhaps the last of the accolades heaped upon Mr. Ritter came from no less than the Chief Justice of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench, Allan Wachowich. On Dec. 5, 2002, during a ceremony held to call a U of A law graduate to the bar, the judge told her how fortunate she was to have been under Mr. Ritter's tutelage.
(The Chief Justice now concedes that he knew next to nothing about Mr. Ritter. "Everybody believed he was a lawyer. He held a job where you were required to be a lawyer," he said in an interview.)
A week later, the Mounties arrived at Newport's doors with a search warrant.
TIPPING POINT
In 2001, Dan Gordon, a young stock trader, had a problem most people will never encounter. After you steal tens of millions from your employer, what do you do with it?
When the 25-year-old graduate of Yale University stumbled onto Newport's website, he figured he had the answer. Mr. Gordon, then the head of Merrill Lynch's energy trading unit, had persuaded the investment bank to free up $43-million for a complicated hedging contract. But rather than enter into such a contract, he enlisted Newport to move the cash to a Swiss account.
Then the 6-foot, 4-inch whiz kid started spending the money. Lots of it. He pulled out so much - $32.5-million - that the Swiss bankers alerted Newport. When large sums of money move around, authorities tend to notice.
Mr. Ritter chastised his young client. But he also was able to freeze the remaining $10.5-million and then, after nearly a decade of helping people protect their money, he started helping himself to it.
He gave $4-million to a friend in California named Larry Osaki, whose investors believed he was importing latex gloves from China and selling them at huge profit. In reality they, much like Bernie Madoff's victims, were buying into a massive Ponzi scheme. There were no gloves, and money from new investors was being used to pay off old ones.
The fraud had reached a staggering $270-million when it was shut down by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. But not for long.
Rather than accept his loss, Mr. Ritter helped Mr. Osaki keep the scheme alive. They gave it a new name, Village Capital Trust, and registered it in Belize, but the phone lines led to Newport's boardroom where a crew of young women took the calls.
Unaware of what had happened, U.S. customers trying to find out where their money was were puzzled. "We got a phone number once for a Canadian office, and there were people answering: 'Hello, Village Capital,' " recalls Dane Ryan of Santa Cruz, Calif., whose family lost hundreds of thousands of dollars. "I don't know if they had a staff that didn't know what was going on, or what."
After Mr. Ritter got involved, investors put $7-million more into Village Capital, which promised a remarkable return of 20 per cent every quarter - a profit margin that would raise eyebrows among experienced investors.
Duane Roylance, a Utah fence installer, gave $48,000 to Village Capital, and now says: "I'm 72 and still running my company instead of retired."
Before long, the receiver appointed by a U.S. court to track down Mr. Osaki's assets caught wind of Village Capital, and Newport employees started asking why the U.S. callers were so upset. Eventually, staffers such as Howard Yeung, went to the authorities.
Meanwhile, Dan Gordon's energy unit in New York was sold, and the buyer had some tough questions about $43-million that appeared to have vanished into thin air.
PUNISHMENT
On Oct. 27, 2006, Michael Peter Ritter stood before an Edmonton judge and declared himself to be "guilty."
For four years, he had tried to avoid this moment of truth, launching court challenges and burning through several defence lawyers. When judgment day began to look inevitable, he discreetly obtained a Belizean passport as Adam Michael Philipp D'Orleans, but assistant Patrick Mitchell handed it to the authorities.
In the end, Mr. Ritter pleaded guilty and, in return, the United States agreed to drop the extradition proceedings it had launched. Mr. Osaki remains in jail in California, not due for release until 2021.
The Canadian prosecution team - which was essentially two people, a Mountie and an assistant Crown attorney - was eager to sift through the computer files and thousands of pages seized from Mr. Ritter's office and see who was using his services. But then they realized that, no matter how many charges were added, Mr. Ritter would never get more than 10 years, the maximum sentence.
"I honestly think there was a real lost opportunity there because I think it was a real treasure trove," says Greg Lepp, who prosecuted Mr. Ritter and is now an assistant deputy minister in Alberta's Justice Department.
"It becomes sort of a practical thing too. Because the cops are pretty short-staffed. They're up to their wazoo just with easy stuff. ... So, yeah, they're sitting on this huge server that's got all this international money laundering, but where do you start? It's overwhelming."
Auditors from Canada Revenue also were itching to comb through the records, but even now, almost seven years after the raid, they have yet to get their hands on them because of a torrent of legal challenges from Newport and Mr. Ritter.
Recovering any of the money has been equally frustrating.
As part of his guilty plea, Mr. Ritter was supposed to help the Mounties track down what remained of the Merrill Lynch millions and to return what he could to the victims of Village Capital. He dutifully complied, but the police traced about $2.7-million to accounts in Vienna only to confirm what they had suspected.
"It was already spent," Sergeant Marjorie Maier says. "A lot of it went to legal fees."
Mr. Ritter also agreed to retrieve $1-million he had used as a down payment on a condominium in Italy, but the receiver in California concluded that Italian legal costs would far outstrip anything investors were likely to get back.
In the end, all that was recovered from the stolen $10-million was $391,957.63 - from the sale of aircraft and real estate that Newport owned.
Mr. Ritter still enjoys the Jaguar and the home on 53rd Street, but authorities say they no longer belong to him. The car is registered to someone else, and a few months before he pleaded guilty, a numbered company that held title to the house transferred ownership, perhaps in lieu of payment, to the last of his defence lawyers, Robbie Davidson. (Mr. Davidson was unavailable for comment.)
Back in Santa Cruz, Dane Ryan is trying to save the house his mother-in-law remortgaged so she could invest more than $300,000 in those rubber gloves. "She's in her 80s and she's got $1,000 a month coming in," the retired high-tech worker says.
"It got to the point where she couldn't make her mortgage payments any more, so we're just struggling."
THE ROAD AHEAD
When Mr. Ritter's 10-year sentence was announced, it was seen as a huge victory for the Crown - one of the longest jail terms for white-collar crime ever obtained in Canada. But 18 months later, the National Parole Board adhered to the standard policy of releasing non-violent offenders who have served one-sixth of their time, and he left the minimum-security prison at Grande Cache, Alta., for a halfway house.
Now, during the day, he can be found back in the house on 53rd Street, using the computer to alert his friends about his pursuit of "another" postgraduate degree. He also has been spotted taking in a play or cruising Edmonton in the Jag with Monte by his side.
Just before the end of the year, he will be eligible for full parole. Is there more he could do to help people like Mr. Ryan's mother-in-law or Mr. Roylance, the senior citizen still installing fences in Utah? The subject has been addressed in public only once - by his lawyer, while speaking to the media after his client's sentencing in 2006.
"He's made amends," Mr. Davidson said, "as best he can."

Abstract: These days, one can hardly see anything behind the dirty Plexiglas that replaced the original glazing more than 30 years ago. Until recently, the deteriorating façade wasn't as noticeable, Mr. [Ian Watts] says, because the surrounding vicinity was also rather derelict-looking.

Full text:   BC Hydro's foot-dragging on refurbishing the Dal Grauer Substation is a drag on the neighbourhood, say critics. 'In any other major city, they'd be forced to do it.'
On a prime stretch of downtown Vancouver real estate stands a low-rise building sheathed in peeling tiles and pitted Plexiglas. Known as the Dal Grauer Substation, it's an infrastructure workhorse, supplying electricity to downtown and the west end since 1953. It's also a once-revered architectural icon, whose fate - be it full restoration or continued degradation - could well affect the value and appeal of local real estate in the years to come.
As the strip of Burrard Street between Nelson and Smithe develops into a superblock of gleaming condos, real-estate agents and community leaders are joining the cries of heritage advocates demanding the substation façade's restoration. The enhancement to property values would be indirect, downtown specialist agent Ian Watts says, but enduring.
"I can't say property values would immediately rise $50 a square foot if they restored it," says Mr. Watts, who has sold many units in the condos that flank the substation. "But it would be a much more appealing street to walk down." Adds downtown agent Nic Blachette: "A restoration would turn the substation into an admired public amenity that would draw tourists and locals alike, in turn generating business for the smart cafes in the vicinity."
The substation was built from 1952 to 1953, a time when corporate titans were seen as partners walking in lockstep with community values. It is named after legendary BC Hydro chairman Albert Edward (Dal) Grauer, renowned in his day as a populist with cultural sensitivity. Mr. Grauer was a friend of prominent west coast architect Ned Pratt, whom he commissioned to design the substation (and then, a few years later, the adjacent corporate headquarters, which was eventually converted into the Electra condo tower.) British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority, then known as British Columbia Power Corporation, was so proud of this marvel of beauty and technology that it showcased the substation on the cover of its 1953 annual report.
The transparency of the façade suggested openness and integration with the community. West coast artist B.C. Binning designed a vivid interior colour arrangement behind its glazing, effectively creating a large three-dimensional Mondrien-like tableau of public art. Shortly before his death in August, the well-known retired architecture professor Abraham Rogatnick recalled the substation as "a piece of public art."
"When we'd drive on Burrard Street, we used to slow down to see it, especially at night, when all those beautiful colours showed through the glass. It was like a beacon of light beckoning you downtown."
These days, one can hardly see anything behind the dirty Plexiglas that replaced the original glazing more than 30 years ago. Until recently, the deteriorating façade wasn't as noticeable, Mr. Watts says, because the surrounding vicinity was also rather derelict-looking. But in the past decade, the empty lot on the north side of the Dal Grauer has filled up with the giant condo-and-cinema complex known as Electric Avenue; and on the south side is the restored Electra condo tower. Across the street, the 42-storey luxury Patina condo tower is under construction and the 1940s-era YMCA building is being restored. In contrast, Mr. Watts notes, the aging Dal Grauer façade stands out as "junky-looking" in this strip of new and restored architecture. "Why leave just this one eyesore?" he asks.
BC Hydro officials respond that they are just being cautious about how they spend Crown money. "We do value the historic, cultural and architectural importance of the Dal Grauer Substation," spokeswoman Susan Danard says. "That is why we are keeping open the option of restoring the building when it makes good financial sense."
Restoring the Dal Grauer would cost roughly $2-million, Ms. Danard says, and so is not a priority during a time when consumers are concerned about rate hikes. "We need to keep our customers' costs down during these difficult economic times. Keeping Dal Grauer in excellent working order and providing a reliable supply of electricity to downtown Vancouver is the priority. Aesthetic improvements are also important, but unfortunately they will have to wait until better economic times. Right now our customers are tightening their belts, and so are we."
Restoration advocates note that a $2-million expenditure would barely register with such a mammoth company. (BC Hydro's profit for the three months ending June 30 clocked in at $74-million; its capital-expenditure plan for fiscal 2010 stands at $1.6-billion.)
A restored Dal Grauer would help return Burrard Street to its earlier role as a ceremonial promenade and gateway to downtown, says Don Luxton of the Vancouver Heritage Association, to the benefit of property owners and passersby alike. "These grand gestures always add to the public realm and make for a more desirable neighbourhood," Mr. Luxton says.
BC Hydro has brought the substation to the brink of restoration at least three times, engaging architects Peter Busby and Robert Lemon for the task. In 2007, BC Hydro negotiated a density-transfer agreement with the City of Vancouver and promised to restore the substation as heritage and public art, but the project collapsed when the City abruptly halted its density-transfer program later that year. In December, 2008, the restoration was once again shelved indefinitely.
The repeated stalling of the restoration has angered condo marketer Bob Rennie, who purchased and is restoring the historic Wing Sang building in Chinatown, not for profit, he says, but as a project for both personal and community benefit.
"Everything you do to an area enhances that area, but not every decision is a financial one," Mr. Rennie says. "Heritage rises above the immediate dollar value: you're preserving the future .This is our little jewel box in downtown Vancouver. [BC Hydro] should lead by example - whether it's energy conservation or architectural conservation. In any other major city, they'd be forced to do it."
Adds Mr. Watts: "It would be such good PR for Hydro if they restored it - it would show they cared about the community. If you have to have a substation there, why not make it a work of art?"
Previously commissioned heritage architect Mr. Lemon is hopeful that BC Hydro will resurrect their restoration plans, but cautions that the longer the delay, the greater it will eventually cost. "It would be just phenomenal to have that façade restored to its original transparency," he says. "If they want to come back to us, we're open."

If not for the GO Train line running behind this detached brick house, its spacious floor plan and pleasant setting on a winding crescent would have fetched it a higher sale price in less time, says agent Bill Thom.
"It's unique because this is a 2.5-storey house, but it doesn't look like it," he says. "[As well] it's a very quiet, middle/upper-class residential area."
Four- and five-bedroom properties are the norm, but this roughly 3,200-square-foot house contains six bedrooms and three bathrooms.
In the last few years, thousands were spent on upgrades like Brazilian cherry-wood floors, granite kitchen counters and vinyl windows. "It has a lot of features," adds Mr. Thom.
The house can be entered from the enclosed front porch and double garage, as well as from the eat-in kitchen and fireside family room, which both have rear walkouts off the deck and patio.
A combined living and dining room completes the main level.
On the second floor, there are four bedrooms, including one with a walk-in closet and a master suite built with his-and-her closets and an updated five-piece bathroom.
A skylight illuminates one of two bedrooms on the top level. "It was like a little hideaway," says Mr. Thom. "Little kids may want to play with their friends up there."
The basement was professionally finished with a sauna, gym and recreation room with a wet bar and brick wood-burning fireplace.
Local attractions include reputable schools and highways, including the Don Valley Parkway and 401.

Abstract: After the fall of the Wall, "the city had found no way to deal with this history," says Dietmar Arnold, a city planner who has written a history of Berlin's underground. To change this, he founded Berlin Underworlds, a non-profit association that preserves the city's bunkers, subway stations and tunnels and makes them accessible to the public. In the first year of operation, the Underworlds had 2,000 visitors; last year, 150,000 people took one of their tours.

Full text:   In Berlin's sandy soil, Nazi bunkers and Cold War fallout shelters are getting some new life. Twenty years after the fall of the Wall, Naomi Buck goes through the steel doors to see a contemporary art gallery and tour underground fortresses
When Berlin became capital of the united Germany in the nineties, the city had to confront many ghosts of its architectural past: the Berlin Wall - now running through prime real estate - and Nazi-era municipal buildings, some of which became home to government ministries.
But nobody wanted to acknowledge the history embedded in the city's sandy soil. Unlike other European capitals, which have turned their underground infrastructure into tourist attractions (think of the Paris catacombs), Berlin wasn't quick to celebrate its network of Nazi air raid bunkers and nuclear fallout shelters. But now those military monoliths are finding new life as historical attractions, and in one case as an edgy contemporary art gallery.
After the fall of the Wall, "the city had found no way to deal with this history," says Dietmar Arnold, a city planner who has written a history of Berlin's underground. To change this, he founded Berlin Underworlds, a non-profit association that preserves the city's bunkers, subway stations and tunnels and makes them accessible to the public. In the first year of operation, the Underworlds had 2,000 visitors; last year, 150,000 people took one of their tours.
Berlin Underworlds offers thematic tours of Second World War bunkers and atomic shelters, along with subway stations and sewers - many of these systems are interconnected. The main entrance to the Underworlds is at the north Berlin subway station of Gesundbrunnen, right under a Flakturm ("flak tower") built in 1940 to house anti-aircraft guns. BERLIN 7
After the war, the Allies demolished most of this monstrous bunker, but the northern wall, 42 metres high, was left standing, for fear that its blasting would ruin the rail tracks beneath it. One of the Underworlds tours takes visitors through the overgrown ruins of this forbidding structure and down into a seven-storey bunker.
Another tour visits the atomic fallout shelter at the subway station Pankstrasse, which is still fully equipped to house 3,346 people for several weeks. And the most popular tour shows visitors three successful and seven unsuccessful escape tunnels that were built from East to West Berlin, as well as some Geisterbahnhöfe - ghost train stations, located where West Berlin subway lines passed through East Berlin and which were heavily guarded to prevent defections.
For those who prefer to leave their heels on and stay above ground, there is a very civilized way to tour a Berlin bunker - thanks to Christian Boros, a public-
relations magnate and art collector who last year converted one of Berlin's largest bunkers into a home for his art collection.
The Boros Collection, with roughly 500 works by the likes of Damian Hirst, Olafur Eliasson, Wolfgang Tillmans and Daniel Richter, is one of Berlin's most exciting collections of contemporary art.
As interesting as the art is the bunker in which it resides - its designer, Hitler's star architect, Albert Speer, considered it a work of art in its own right.
Located in the heart of Mitte, the Reichsbahnbunker Friedrichstrasse was built in 1942 as Allied bombing escalated. It was built to house 2,000 people - travellers through the nearby Friedrichstrasse train station, as well as visitors to the Deutsche Theater next door and local residents.
Designed to exude the Nazis' confidence of victory, the bunker featured marble cladding and magnificent spiral staircases.
After capitulation, the bunker was used by the Red Army as a jail. In East Germany, it became a storage facility for tropical fruits - with its two-metre-thick outer walls and sophisticated ventilation system, the "Banana Bunker," as East Berliners called it, served as a city block-sized fridge.
After the fall of the Wall, the bunker was claimed by Berlin's techno and fetish scene and enjoyed a reputation as home to Germany's "hardest" parties, which reached a pinnacle in 1995 with an event called Sexperimenta.
Boros spent five years restoring the place. A protected monument, this original structure, with its five storeys, hardened concrete walls, and Speerian flourishes, had to be maintained.
Many of the art pieces were commissioned for the spaces they occupy, such as Kris Martin's For Whom - a massive bell that swings silently over the visitors' entrance. Or Scandinavian artists Elmgreen and Dragset's hyper-realistic rubber figure of a man lying in a hospital bed, looking out one of the bunker's few windows, and giving guests to the hotel opposite a bit of a scare.
French writer Stendhal is said to have pondered in Berlin, "What could have possessed people to found a city in the middle of all this sand?"
Whatever possessed Berliners then seems to possess them still, with their determination to dig around and retrieve the history that is buried under and behind the city's formidable surfaces. Endorsed by the city's senate or not, Berlin's underworlds have been discovered and are eminently worth a visit.

The damp side of the moon

Abstract: The 12.6-metre-long rocket will hit the moon first, blasting an estimated 350 tons of lunar material skyward. LCROSS, following closely behind, will gather images and data and relay them immediately to Earth. Within minutes, LCROSS will pass through the expanding debris plume before it also crashes into the moon.

Full text:   With plan to crash a rocket into a lunar crater, NASA hopes to get evidence that water lies frozen on the moon's south pole
The moon was once thought to be a waterless world.
Now, however, many scientists believe vast stores of the precious resource lie frozen in polar craters where the sun never shines.
On Friday, they will get a chance to see if their hunch is correct.
A U.S. rocket will be deliberately crashed into a 98-kilometre-wide crater, named Cabeus, near the south pole of the moon. The impact is expected to throw up a huge cloud of debris, rising six kilometres above the lunar surface. Telescopes - in space and on Earth - will be focused on that material, analyzing it with special instruments for evidence of water.
And there's even a possibility some amateur sky watchers in western North America will be able to witness the celestial dust-up with their backyard telescopes.
Finding lunar water would be welcome news to those who have their hearts set on establishing permanent human bases on the moon and beyond. (The United States is currently reviewing its long-term space plans.)
"It could be an incredibly valuable resource," said Anthony Colaprete, the lead scientist overseeing the mission for the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
The cost of shipping a pound of water to the moon is roughly $50,000 (U.S.) A lot of money could be saved if future moon colonists can use local water for drinking and growing crops. Or, it could be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen to produce rocket fuel for deep-space missions.
Previous moon missions have already provided tantalizing hints of water. Last month, scientists, using data from India's Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft and other lunar orbiters, revealed that trace amounts of water appear to be bound up in rocks and soil across much of the surface.
But other scientists hope to find substantially higher concentrations at the poles, where the sun doesn't rise much above the horizon. Some crater bottoms are in perpetual darkness and the temperature dips to a bone-chilling - 238 C, potentially preserving ice from comets and asteroids that has rained down on the moon over billions of years.
"There are about 14,000 square kilometres of shadowed real estate at the two poles," said Dr. Colaprete.
If the top few metres are made up of just 1 per cent water-ice, the craters could hold as much as 1.3 trillion gallons of water, he speculated. "That's quite a bit."
For an accurate assessment, however, scientists must excavate a big hole in a polar crater. And that's precisely what they hope to do by sending a probe on a collision course with the moon.
The probe is called the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS for short. It's currently attached to the upper stage Centaur rocket that boosted it into space in June.
(The same rocket also launched another probe, called the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter - or LRO - which is mapping the moon.)
About 10 hours before the planned impacts, LCROSS will separate from the Centaur rocket, which will then lead the way in the final plunge to the lunar surface.
The 12.6-metre-long rocket will hit the moon first, blasting an estimated 350 tons of lunar material skyward. LCROSS, following closely behind, will gather images and data and relay them immediately to Earth. Within minutes, LCROSS will pass through the expanding debris plume before it also crashes into the moon.
The impacts are timed to occur when it is the middle of the night in Hawaii, the home of numerous internationally funded observatories - including the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope - which sit on mountaintops.
"It is nice to have a lot of telescopes at the same place," said Christian Veillet, executive director of the CFHT. "But if the weather is bad, it's going to be bad for all of us" and obstruct the view.
As a backup, major observatories in the western United States will be also focused on the moon, and amateur astronomers are being urged to take pictures and share them with NASA. The Hubble Space Telescope and LRO in lunar orbit will be watching, too.
"We would like to have as many eyes and instruments watching these impacts as possible because this is the way we will get the most data," said Jennifer Heldmann, who is leading the LCROSS observation campaign.
*******
See it live on the Web
The death dive of a U.S. rocket into the moon is set for 7:30 a.m. ET on Friday. But that timing isn't great for amateur sky watchers in eastern North America. Morning sunlight will drown any chance of seeing the faint debris cloud rising from the moon's surface when the rocket wallops into it.
Observers in the western part of North America, where it will still be dark, have better viewing odds. However, they will need a decent-sized telescope - one with a light-gathering mirror at least 25 centimetres in diameter. Even with the proper equipment, it will be a challenge spotting the proposed crash site. One small crater looks much like another to an untrained eye.
But don't fret about missing the show. Possibly the best seat will be in front of a computer. On one of its Internet sites (www.nasa.gov/ntv), the U.S. space agency will be streaming live images from the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), providing a bird's-eye view of the main rocket body plunging toward the moon.
"It will look like a ring, or doughnut, rising up out of the crater and expanding outwards," said the lead mission scientist Anthony Colaprete, describing the anticipated plume from the impact. Paul Taylor

GETTING THERE
The Atlas rocket blasted off on June 18, 2009.
Five days later, LCROSS made a slingshot pass around the moon to get it into an orbit that would allow it to strike the moonís south pole.
IMPACT
Ten hours before impact, LCROSS and upper stage will separate.
IMPACT TIME : 7:30 a.m. EDT, Friday, Oct.9.
LCROSS will monitor the explosion and debris plume from the upper stageís impact into the moonís south pole and four minutes later will impact into the surface itself.
The debris cloud will allow LCROSS and ground-based observers to measure its properties in a bid to locate water on the moon.

Full text:   A name change is part of Canaccord's plan to grow beyond its brokerage roots into the lucrative wealth management sector
CAPITAL MARKETS REPORTER
Canaccord Capital Inc. is hoping a little rebranding goes a long way, as the country's largest independent brokerage tries to signal it's serious about moving up the food chain in the financial services industry.
On Dec. 1, the parent company's name will change from Canaccord Capital to Canaccord Financial to reflect an attempt to avoid being pigeonholed as just a securities firm and highlight a new, broader focus on money management.
The division of the company that looks after money for individual clients will also be renamed, becoming Canaccord Wealth Management, shedding the old moniker of Canaccord Private Client.
The company's top executives acknowledge that the changes are subtle, more evolutionary than revolutionary. Yet they have grand ambitions for what the new names herald - a Canaccord that wants to compete more directly with bank-owned brokerages, offering a wider range of services such as insurance from a vastly larger network of offices across the country.
"The industry needs to know that there's a new Canaccord arriving," said John Rothwell, who joined the firm last year from rival Wellington West to direct the revamp of wealth management business. "As much as the rebranding might be symbolic, it will be a springboard for us to be able to grow."
The change comes as Canaccord comes off a tough couple of years, marked by becoming tangled in the asset-backed commercial paper fiasco (almost all of Canaccord's clients got all their money back) and a general downturn in the financial services business that's been particularly tough on smaller firms.
The move creates a natural tension with Canaccord's roots as a small, scrappy shop that was home to brokers who were known more for buying and selling small-capitalization stocks that the company's investment bankers focused on.
The company doesn't want to leave the best of those brokers and clients behind, but Mr. Rothwell acknowledges that the changes are about adding top performers to the company's complement of investment advisers.
Already, some of the company's broker force has been culled, taking the number of adviser teams down to 335 at the end of the most recent quarter from 354 a year earlier.
At the same time, Canaccord can't stray too far from its heritage and become too much like the banks it wants to compete with, lest it lose what makes the firm attractive to clients and advisers who don't like dealing with big institutions.
Recruiting top advisers is the key to the wealth management business. There's only so much head office can do with logos and advertising. The real job of bringing in clients with lots of money to manage falls to the individual brokers, who depend on the strength of their relationships and the depth of their networks to rope in assets.
As a result, many of the changes at Canaccord are designed to "better service our existing advisers and clients, and also to get in a better state of preparedness to better serve the people who aren't even here yet," Mr. Rothwell said.
That means simplifying everything about the way Canaccord markets investment products, making them attractive to brokers because they're easy to sell and to clients because they're easy to understand.
Examples include simplifying the names of different types of products to eschew the fancy branding that other firms use to signify that some types of accounts are aimed at higher rollers.
"If you have some wealth, your greatest luxury is time," said Mr. Rothwell, stressing that the changes "attract attention from a different type of client and potentially the kinds of advisers that you want to know."
Canaccord is also counting on something that clients will never see to spark growth in its wealth management business. The firm is shifting to a new model of paying many brokers, trying to make it more attractive to work for the firm.
The idea, pioneered by competitor Raymond James, is to give the brokers more control and a shot at bigger paydays, in return for assuming more of the risk.
In many ways, it's like the difference between a franchised fast-food restaurant and a company-owned store.
Most brokers operate in the equivalent of a company store, where the rent and all the expenses are paid by head office. In a franchise, the local manager owns the real estate and pays many of the costs, but has a chance to earn more money. For the client, there's little difference; for Canaccord, the payoff comes in lower costs.
With this model, Canaccord is betting it could potentially have four times as many offices as it currently has.
"There are 100 cities in Canada that deserve to have a Canaccord branch in them," Mr. Rothwell said.
Canaccord hired two top executives from Raymond James, who were pioneers of the idea, to implement the plan.
That's when "we realized that the Canaccord brand is starting to resonate," he said.
"It's testimony to how Canaccord in many ways has already arrived. Many of the right people already know there's a new Canaccord. Those who just see it on the horizon need to be reminded. Branding does that."

What investors should know
SHARE PRICE
Canaccord Capital shares have come a long way in the past year, recovering from a beating they took while the company was fighting through the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) affair and a slump in the securities industry. The recent rally has taken the stock past the $10.67 average price target of analysts, according to Bloomberg.
REVENUE/PROFIT
Revenue took a hit as companies cut back on financing, and as a plunge in markets cut fees on trading. That, plus costs related to ABCP, led to a loss for Canaccord in the previous fiscal year. Analysts expect the company rebounded to a profit in the most recent quarter.
ASSETS UNDER ADMINISTRATION
The markets' crash took a major toll on the value of assets that clients hold at Canaccord. The totals are on the rebound and - if Canaccord can bring in big-name advisers - should keep climbing.

Full text:   The saga of the failed Phoenix Coyotes sale started over dinner in a New York restaurant in September of 2008. Almost immediately there was tension, and it eventually permeated the entire affair
Jeff Shumway felt uneasy as he sat down for dinner with Richard Rodier in a New York restaurant.
It was September of 2008, and Shumway, the chief executive officer of the Phoenix Coyotes, was in New York for another meeting with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman to discuss the Coyotes' sorry finances.
Shumway knew Rodier represented Canadian billionaire Jim Balsillie and that they had been trying for years to buy an NHL club and move it to Hamilton, enraging NHL brass. Shumway was no fan of Bettman, but he wasn't impressed by Rodier's approach. During dinner he offered some advice.
"I believe my exact words were that they had to learn to play nice in the sandbox," he recalled in a deposition filed in court. "Running around to every team that may or may not be in financial trouble and trying to strike a back-door deal didn't seem to me the way to handle it."
Shumway's words proved prophetic. Over the next year, Rodier and Balsillie kept up their pursuit of the Coyotes in the face of fierce resistance from Bettman. They finally conceded defeat this week after Arizona bankruptcy court judge Redfield T. Baum threw out their bid and essentially handed the Coyotes to the league. Balsillie said he won't appeal and Rodier has backed away, heading off for a holiday in Montreal and declining to comment. Everyone else involved in the saga also declined to comment or was unavailable.
But the details of how Balsillie's deal came together are outlined in hundreds of pages of court filings. They portray a behind the scenes struggle filled with mistrust, betrayal and secret deals.
The story begins long before Balsillie offered to buy the Coyotes. It starts in September of 2006 with a feud.
Jerry Moyes knew nothing about hockey when he invested in Steve Ellman's real estate venture in 2002. Ellman planned to build a $1-billion (all currency U.S.) office, shopping and entertainment complex in Glendale Ariz., a Phoenix suburb. He'd just acquired the Coyotes, along with Wayne Gretzky, and the complex included a new arena for the team, financed by the city.
The partnership didn't last long. Moyes disagreed with Ellman's plans and in September of 2006 they split. Moyes took the team plus a payment from Ellman.
Moyes went to few games, rarely visited the Coyotes' office and put Shumway in charge even though his real job was managing Moyes's investments.
Gretzky technically worked for Moyes, not the Coyotes, even though he was the team's coach. Gretzky's employment arrangement, which included earning up to $8-million annually, was governed by a "deal memo" he signed with Moyes in 2006. Shumway spent years trying to negotiate an employment contract between Gretzky and the Coyotes, but Gretzky never signed it.
Moyes did not want to hang on to the Coyotes. In late 2007, he asked his lawyer, Earl Scudder, to find a buyer. Scudder tried a dozen people. None made an offer.
Then there was Rodier. He'd been calling for weeks during the summer of 2008, proposing Moyes sell the Coyotes to Balsillie through bankruptcy and sending the Hamilton Bulldogs of the American Hockey League to Phoenix as compensation.
One potential buyer finally surfaced, Jerry Reinsdorf. He owned baseball's Chicago White Sox and the NBA Bulls and had a house in Phoenix. Glendale had just built a spring training complex for the White Sox and officials asked Reinsdorf to help the Coyotes. Reinsdorf met Shumway in August but said he wasn't interested.
Shumway knew the club couldn't survive. The Coyotes were losing more than $30-million annually and had already tapped the NHL for financial assistance.
On Jan. 23, 2009, Shumway went back to managing Moyes's money. Moyes told Scudder to keep looking for buyers. It wasn't long before Rodier called.
Balsillie, co-chief executive of Research In Motion Ltd., was such a hockey fanatic he named RIM's boardrooms after hockey legends. "I have been convinced for several years that one of the most important contributions I can make to my country and my community is to bring a seventh NHL franchise to [Hamilton]," he said in a filing.
Rodier had worked with Balsillie for four years and developed a strategy of using the bankruptcy court to get around the league's rules on relocation. He'd been following the Coyotes' fortunes since his dinner with Shumway in New York. With Shumway gone, Rodier moved in.
He called Scudder on April 1, offering $190-million, but only if Moyes filed for protection in Canada and Arizona. Scudder mentioned the pitch to Bettman a couple of days later and got an ear full. Bettman told him to stop talking to Rodier, stressing that moving the club was a league responsibility. He reminded Scudder that the NHL had voting control over the club, not Moyes.
Bettman was having his own problems finding a buyer. He'd been talking to Reinsdorf, but in an e-mail to deputy commissioner Bill Daly on April 4, he said "this is looking more and more difficult since no one seems to be excited about a team losing 40mm."
Scudder and Moyes were fed up with the NHL and kept talking to Rodier. But Moyes wasn't keen on bankruptcy and he was skeptical about Rodier's strategy. A brief meeting with Balsillie in Dallas smoothed things over, but by late April, no deal was in sight.
Everything changed on May 1. Bettman called Scudder and told him the NHL had a potential offer from Reinsdorf.
Moyes was spooked. He was convinced Bettman had cut a secret deal and was going to leave him with nothing. Negotiations with Rodier ramped up. Moyes dropped his reluctance to file for Chapter 11 and Rodier agreed to pursue a filing only in Arizona. But mistrust was building.
Rodier infuriated Scudder by making a direct pitch to Moyes. "I don't need your permission to talk to your client or anyone else," Rodier said in an e-mail to Scudder. "Nor do I care that, at your meeting with [Balsillie] in Dallas, you were crying to him that I was abrasive. I've been working with him for 4 years. He knows. He likes it. You haven't seen abrasive from me yet, and I hope you don't." Scudder shot back, questioning Rodier's credibility while another lawyer for Moyes called Rodier unethical.
Rodier felt Moyes was getting cold feet and he warned him that Balsillie could go elsewhere.
The deal finally came together just before the meeting with Bettman. Moyes put the Coyotes in Chapter 11 and announced Balsillie's bid to buy the club for $212.5-million and move it to Hamilton.
Bettman arrived at Moyes's office and handed him a letter announcing the NHL had taken control of the Coyotes.
Over the next four months, the battle raged in court. Bettman attacked Moyes, alleging he ran the team into the ground and lined his own pockets. He accused Balsillie of being a liar and pulled together a 21-page internal memo on why he shouldn't be an owner. Moyes, Balsillie and Rodier fought back, alleging the NHL was an "illegal cartel" and claiming the league undermined the sale process.
It's not clear what will happen to the Coyotes. The NHL hopes to find a local buyer but most observers doubt that will happen, meaning the league will either relocate or kill the franchise. Meanwhile, Moyes remains the majority owner, the NHL funds daily operations and fan support plummets.

Full text:   cireland@globeandmail.com
Since 1840, the road that climbs from the Dundas Valley to the Niagara Escarpment above has curved past the genteel gates of Springhill.
In all of those years, few passersby have had more than a glimpse beyond the stone walls of the storied estate in Flamborough, Ont.
The family that has lived at Springhill for the past 70 years has always maintained a veil of privacy around the house that dates to circa 1830. Even the home's tower has remained partly obscured by the surrounding 200-year-old trees.
So the neighbours may be surprised to learn that - had they ventured down the lengthy drive - they might have glimpsed international film star Jacqueline Bisset strolling across the lawns. Hollywood actors such as Shirley MacLaine, Geena Davis and Christian Slater have all filmed scenes on the grounds of Springhill. Film and television production companies love to use the house and outbuildings because so little change has taken place in the past 100 years or so.
Fred Simpson has been very deliberate in his restraint on progress since he took over as the owner and guiding spirit of Springhill in 1963. The former banker first arrived as a boy after his mother bought the house at auction in 1938. His family is only the third to reside there, and Mr. Simpson remains mindful of that legacy.
The Simpson clan has always preferred family gatherings to grand parties and they cherished the seclusion afforded by the stone walls, tall trees and the property's perch on the mountaintop above Dundas, Ont.
The property has shrunk considerably over the years: 140 acres have been whittled down to 15 today. But those acres still include a fruit orchard, perennial gardens and majestic stands of maples and oak trees.
The original barn, circa 1830, still stands. In the main house, fine woodwork, pedestal sinks and stained glass windows imported from England have all been preserved. Fresh air comes from the breeze blowing across the top of the Niagara Escarpment.
"You don't have air conditioning in a 150-year-old house," Mr. Simpson says. "You sort of have to learn the old style."
The house was originally built as a 11/2-storey cottage by James Hamilton and Ann Hatt. Dr. Hamilton, who was born in Scotland in 1797, immigrated to the area and delivered most of the babies in Dundas for many years. The house was set on the mountaintop just west of Spencer Creek ravine.
Inspired by the many springs that flowed from the mountain's face, Dr. Hamilton named the house Springhill, according to the Dundas Historical Society Museum.
The illustrious Dr. Hamilton also served in the militia at the time of the Upper Canada Rebellion and, in one of his more notorious ventures, was convicted for the tarring and feathering of a local man whom the doctor and his cohorts accused of adultery.
After Dr. Hamilton's death, Springhill was sold to John and Catherine Fisher in the 1870s. Mr. Fisher, the prosperous owner of a local paper mill and other holdings, began to revamp the house in about 1880 by building a stone addition at the rear.
A few years later, the Fishers had a 3½-storey tower constructed in the Romanesque Revival style. The tower's mansard style roof is crowned with iron railings.
In 1938, the Fisher family put the house up for sale. The catalogue of auctioneers Ward Price Ltd. describes the house as a pioneer homestead "brought up to the luxury of the present day living standards of the country gentleman. ...
"One may gaze from the lawns of Springhill over the beautiful Dundas Valley and, on a clear day, see ships passing through the cantilever span at Burlington Beach," the auction house said.
Mr. Simpson's mother triumphed at the auction and soon took her father for a drive to see the property. "He told her she was crazy," Mr. Simpson relates.
Despite the patriarch's reservations about the Depression-era economy, the Simpson family moved there in 1938.
"She knew what she was doing," says Mr. Simpson, who brought his own wife and three daughters back to the house in 1963.
As a boy, Mr. Simpson remembers roaming pastures, streams and trails that zigzagged down the escarpment.
Four gardeners were employed at the time to work on the grounds and in a greenhouse on the property. About 50 acres were dedicated to farming, Mr. Simpson says, and his mother kept horses, cattle and a milking herd of eight Guernsey cows.
The property stretched right to the tiered waterfalls that are today part of the Spencer Gorge and Webster's Falls Conservation Area.
"I can remember swimming in the pool at the bottom of Webster's Falls," Mr. Simpson says.
Eventually much of the property was appropriated by the government for parkland. Mr. Simpson's parents also divided off some parcels for his three siblings.
With so many family members close by, Mr. Simpson's three daughters grew up surrounded by cousins.
And Mr. Simpson says he has taken on the roles of chauffeur, gardener, handyman and stable boy for the past four decades.
He describes the previous owners, Dr. Hamilton and Mr. Fisher, as fanatics for maintaining the trees. When his daughter reminds him that he has been no less vigilant in trimming and tending, he allows that, "I guess I'm a bit of a tree buff."
Mr. Simpson currently has the house listed for sale with Lesley Cumming of Sotheby's Realty, with an asking price of $3.599-million.
The property includes a stone guest house, a refurbished carriage house and the original barn.
These days, Flamborough is home to many hobby farmers and commuters in the Golden Horseshoe.
Mr. Simpson has found the house popular with film directors in recent years.
Anne of Green Gables: A New Beginning was filmed there by Sullivan Entertainment.
Mr. Simpson walked into the den one day to find Ms. MacLaine eating pizza.
"We got to know her pretty well," he says.
Ms. Davis filmed The Long Kiss Goodnight at Springhill. And the producers of Murdoch Mysteries often use the house as a backdrop.
Mr. Simpson says he enjoys the movie shoots and has never moved out of the house to accommodate them. The production companies make some changes, but little has to be done because the woodwork is unpainted and the fixtures are appropriate to the period.
The cash, he says, allows him to invest in keeping the landmark and its aged plaster, stone and wood in top form. The grounds are manicured and nothing is allowed to deteriorate.
"Everybody thinks you make lots of money, but 90 per cent I put back in."

For many buyers who visited this two-storey house, it pleased them that it appears the same as when it was built about 90 years ago, says agent Anita Merlo.
"It was a traditional Canadian Arts and Crafts home, so it had naturally high ceilings, lots of wood trims and leaded glass," she says. "The character was intact."
Adding to the ambience, most rooms have hardwood floors, including a living room with a wood-burning fireplace, an adjacent dining room and a central family room with a bay window.
Three years ago, modern elements were incorporated, such as porcelain heated floors, granite counters and mahogany cabinetry in the kitchen.
The latter also has sliding doors to a deck and secluded backyard facing northeast. "The way the property was situated ... you basically had all day sunshine in this house, which was very nice," adds Ms. Merlo.
All four bedrooms and a four-piece bathroom are upstairs.
Down in the basement, which has a separate entrance, there is a powder room and a recreation room with a walkout.
Three-car parking is available, including a detached garage.
Local amenities include parks, schools and shops, as well as a hospital, GO Train station and highway 400 series.

Full text:   When I heard Peter Mansbridge giddily announce on The National that Saskatchewan is experiencing a population boom, I just about fell off my $300 Brick leather sofa.
Saskatchewan last witnessed a crush of newcomers in 1952-53, when they drilled for oil at Climax. It was also a bumper period for crops.
This recent wave of optimistic newcomers has me pining for the good old days of thrift and economic stagnation, those listless autumn evenings squandered monitoring the Prince Albert CTV affiliate for my favourite pre-winter ad.
It was produced by a family clothing retailer desperately trying to drum up regional business: "Now's a good time to put a small deposit down on your children's winter boots," intones the announcer without a hint of irony.
Now that's the humble, layaway-plan kind of Saskatchewan that I've come to love. Now that we're a choice economic destination, I miss the tattered old Saskatchewan. In the past year, we've gained 16,509 new residents.
For grumpy upstarts like me, this is bad news. I prefer a new neighbour to be the kind whose cars break down, who lines up an underpaid job at the local bar or recycling centre then stays on due to inertia, not for economic gain.
I curse Premier Brad Wall and his uppity Saskatchewan Party. I miss our backward socialist NDP premier Lorne Calvert. He knew how to "gate-keep" prosperity and keep us sparsely populated and down-at-the-heel.
If I craved prosperity and overcrowding, I could have stayed in Alberta. If I want to maintain my downward mobility, I may have to relocate back to Calgary. Who knew?
My sodbuster partner Grant and I came here from the oil patch in 2004. He promised me cheap real estate, wide-open spaces, underpaved roads and the occasional shack-wacky farmer who confronted you with a surly thousand-yard stare at the Co-op.
Now with all of the fancy new residents in our midst, I may have to upgrade my wardrobe from my moth-eaten curling sweater and rubber boots. If I don't, I'll face taunts from the young moms at the post office with their Calgary-inspired hairstreaks and shiny new minivans.
I remember fondly when Saskatchewanians used to boast the country's oldest insured vehicles. It's as if Flint, Mich., morphed into Boca Raton, Fla.
Like all decent Prairie people, I hate change and I'm an underachiever. I told a Prairie books editor recently that I was congenitally incapable of making money and he replied: "You're hired."
I also prefer to dwell in the past. When I'm not listening to Neil Young's weepy Prairie Wind CD, I'm busy wrestling my younger brother Tim for our favourite family heirloom: a silver-plated and autographed Saskatchewan Roughriders serving platter, circa 1963. Tim was a 1964 Grey Cup baby, born while my sportswriter father was absent covering the game, so he feels justifiably entitled to this Prairie prize.
While I'm on the topic of football, I also yearn for the good old days when cash-strapped farmers showed their Rider Pride by trading wheat for game tickets. With all of these arrivistes in our midst, how will I know if that man in the pumpkin helmet seated next to me is a bandwagon jumper or a real sodbuster with roots dating back to pre-Riel Rebellion Saskatchewan, like Grant's family?
Pardon me if I sound just like an Antebellum Age Southerner waxing eloquently about how life was grand before the Civil War. I'm just going to have to get used to our new residents, the money in our midst and all of the social pressures that accompany prosperity.
But there's a glimmer of down-market hope on the horizon.
I visited the Interlake region of Manitoba recently and discovered a few untainted outposts where our family could resettle. But I'm not sure how long that social disparity will endure now that NDP premier Gary Doer has been dispatched to Washington.

Full text:   Accolade
Location: North York
Builder/developer: Tridel
Size: 679 to 2,050 square feet
Price: $270,000 to $1,035,000
Sales centre: 181 Wynford Dr., north of Eglinton Avenue. Open Monday to Thursday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Saturday, Sunday and holidays from noon to 6 p.m.
Contact: Phone (416) 385-0305 or visit www.tridel.com/accolade)
Purchasing a new condominium often requires buyers to wait years between the time they select their floor plans and the moment they pick up their keys.
Tridel can speed up that process to as little as 90 days at Accolade - a newly completed high-rise at Eglinton Avenue and Wynford Drive - where homeowners began moving in last week.
"Some people don't like to go through the whole pre-sale process and prefer to be able to walk into the building, see all the amenities and look out the windows," says Jim Ritchie, senior vice-president of sales and marketing.
"If someone was to visit with us now ... not only would they be able to see a finished model suite, but they will see completed recreational facilities and the lobby."
Buyers interested in the 34-storey residence can tour the guest suite, fitness centre and a fireside-party room with a bar, kitchen and access to a billiards lounge, dining room and media lounge.
Tridel also made arrangements with the Crowne Plaza hotel next door to allow residents to utilize its facilities, such as a restaurant, yoga room, indoor pool and spa treatment rooms.
Housekeeping and room service are available on a pay-per-use basis.
"It's somewhat unique in that respect," Mr. Ritchie says. "Who wouldn't want hotel services on occasion?"
The 327-unit tower is surrounded by local attractions and essentials including supermarkets, the new Shops at Don Mills, golf courses and popular Edwards Gardens.
"This was a location that appealed to a number of people," Mr. Ritchie says.
Units facing north and south overlook Don Valley parklands and the Don Valley Parkway, which can take commuters downtown within 15 minutes. "We are just east of the Don Valley Parkway and it's certainly accessible to transportation," Mr. Ritchie says.
Though 85 per cent of the suites are sold, there is a wide range of one-bedroom-plus-dens to three-bedrooms available. "There is diversity in suite sizes," Mr. Ritchie says.
Designs typically incorporate master bedrooms with private bathrooms and open kitchens, and principal areas with balcony access.
On the upper levels, the Signature and Penthouse suites will offer kitchens with breakfast areas, master suites with walk-in closets and second bedrooms with en suites in some cases.
These units will be ready for occupancy at the beginning of next year and finished with upscale materials, such as engineered wood floors and 50-ounce broadloom carpeting.
Elsewhere, units will be dressed with laminate floors and 35-ounce broadloom.
The building will incorporate several green initiatives, from low-E, argon-filled, double-glazed windows throughout to Energy Star appliances within individual units.
Last of all, each unit comes with parking and a monthly maintenance fee of 38 cents per square foot.

No. 117
Asking price: $344,900
Selling price: $330,000
Previous selling price: not available
Taxes: not yet assessed
Days on the market: 27
Listing agent: Christopher Bibby, Sutton Group-Associates Realty Inc.
This ground-level suite has the benefit of a one-of-a-kind layout and location in an eco-friendly building in Roncesvalles Village, says agent Christopher Bibby.
Each unit in the newly built residence, called High Park Lofts, is entered from an interior corridor, yet this 900-square-foot space is one of three with a second street-level entrance.
"It was zoned work/live, so the good thing with [the seller's] unit is that someone could have bought it and used it as an art gallery or office," Mr. Bibby explains.
"People in this specific neighbourhood don't mind being on the street because it's a very inviting neighbourhood."
Local residents enjoy frequenting local shops, restaurants and places of worship. Commuting to other parts of the city is convenient via the subway and Go Train station on Bloor Street.
To personalize the 900-square-foot space, the seller - and original owner - asked to modify the builder's two-bedroom and two-bathroom plan for one with one bedroom and one bathroom.
Loft style features include 12-foot ceilings, large windows along the front den and an open living and dining area with a gas fireplace.
Hardwood floors flow throughout, even in the kitchen where there are stainless-steel kitchen appliances, including a gas stove. "This unit showed quite well," adds Mr. Bibby.
Other perks include ensuite laundry machines, an exterior locker and parking.
A monthly fee of $531 covers the cost of heating, which is fuelled by capturing energy below the Earth's surface. "It's the first condominium in the city with geothermal heating," says Mr. Bibby. "Down the road, there will be long-term savings."
For extra space, owners can use a recreation room and rooftop garden. "It has a spectacular view of the city and you can see the entire downtown core and CN Tower," adds Mr. Bibby.

Full text:   Two Gladstone
Location: Queen West
Builder/developer: Streetcar Developments
Size: 527 to 1,064 square feet
Price: $229,900 to $509,900
Contact: To register phone 416-362-2988 or visit www.twogladstone.com
Streetcar Developments has built a solid reputation for creating boutique loft condominiums in the city's lower east side, from the Queen City Vinegar Co. Lofts to the Corktown District.
For the first time, the builder's latest venture is destined for another hot neighbourhood clear across town.
This weekend, registered buyers will be invited to the grand opening of Two Gladstone, named after its address at the northwest corner of Queen Street West and Gladstone Avenue, across from the Gladstone Hotel.
The eight-storey residence will contain only 54 suites.
"That would set us apart from most developers in the neighbourhood," says Alie Warren, the builder's vice-president of sales and marketing.
New projects planned for the area are typically high-rises packed with 300 to 400 units, says Shakeel Walji, creative director at the Walsh Group, which is the team helping to market Two Gladstone.
"In terms of height, it's the same size as the Gladstone [Hotel], so it matches really well with the context of the neighbourhood," Mr. Walji says. "It's not one of these tall towers that screams out gentrification."
In fact, the strong collection of local attractions - including trendy restaurants, galleries and designer shops - is the reason why recreational facilities will not be added within the building.
"We have this saying, 'Get to know your neighbour and get to know your neighbourhood,' " Ms. Warren says. "So you're really moving into the fabric of the neighbourhood itself versus just being part of a high-rise development."
The builders also picked up the site for its proximity to public transit. However, bus routes on Gladstone Avenue will be rerouted once construction is done on a tunnel connecting the north and south sections of Dufferin Street nearby.
"Gladstone Avenue will become more of a quiet, residential street," Ms. Warren adds.
By 2011, purchasers can move into the sleek building.
"It is contemporary - as all of our buildings are - however, we always take a nod to the neighbourhood ... and try to complement the surroundings," Ms. Warren says.
"We have the beautiful, historic Gladstone Hotel right across the street from us, so we tried to tie that into some of the brick colouring and design."
Suites will range from one- to two-bedroom-plus-den units with 527 to 1,064 square feet.
"We do have a lot of large outdoor spaces for a lot of the units," Ms. Warren adds. She also notes that they will feature natural gas outlets.
For the most part, floor plans will be open concept with nine-foot ceilings, sliding bedroom doors and kitchen cabinetry along one wall.
Interior decor will include hardwood floors, porcelain tile surfaces, and stone counters in the kitchens. "Everything is basically upgraded as it is," Mr. Walji says.
To reduce energy consumption, units will be outfitted with Energy Star appliances, dual-flush toilets, and heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems.
There will also be bicycle storage on site. "A lot of people in that neighbourhood do like to ride their bikes, so that would be very handy for a lot of buyers," Ms. Warren says.
Parking can be purchased for $27,000, and lockers from $2,500.
Monthly maintenance fees will be 47 cents per square foot, including gas and water costs.

Abstract: The arrival of the salary cap spelled the end of the conventional dynasty, but the Penguins have a good chance to become the first team since the Detroit Red Wings of the late 1990s to win two consecutive Stanley Cups. Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin (above) are two of the best three forwards in the league and they are still developing. Goaltender Marc-André Fleury showed in last spring's playoffs he is among the league's elite.

Full text:   NEW JERSEY DEVILS
The last couple of years have not been kind to the Devils. The move to a new arena in Newark, N.J., has not produced a financial bonanza and the exodus of free agents continued last off-season with Brian Gionta and John
Madden saying goodbye, along with head coach Brent Sutter. Also, goaltender Martin Brodeur is not getting any younger. But Jacques Lemaire has returned to coaching duties and his defensive philosophies usually produce success with nondescript lineups. And Brodeur (above) may be 37 but he's still good enough to push the Devils through the playoffs. The problem is, they probably won't get there.
NEW YORK ISLANDER
Only the Phoenix Coyotes keep this from being the worst organization in the league to play for but, unlike the Coyotes, the Islanders have shown signs of life. They signed goaltenders Martin Biron and Dwayne Roloson for some decent insurance on the perennially injured Rick DiPietro and his lifetime contract. There is also No. 1 draft pick John Tavares (above) to provide hope for future scoring and underrated defenceman Mark Streit. Unfortunately, things drop off precipitously after that. Owner Charles Wang will not spend more than the minimum on payroll until or unless local politicians approve his real-estate development plans that include a refurbished arena. Who knows when that will be?
NEW YORK RANGERS
John Tortorella may not make a lot of friends but the guy can coach. He showed that last season by propelling the problem-ridden Rangers into the playoffs. This season, he has Marian Gaborik (above), Ales Kotalik and Vinny Prospal to provide enough offence that, along with the goaltending of Henrik Lundqvist, may make up for the team's many deficiencies on defence. Not to mention in the front office as well, although general manager Glen Sather managed not to match his huge pratfall of 2008 when he signed faded defenceman Wade Redden to a long, expensive contract. The playoffs are probable but holes at centre and defence rule out a long run.
PHILADELPHIA FLYERS
There are a lot of ifs with this team, but if a few things fall into place the Flyers could be one of the top four teams in the Eastern Conference. The ifs start in goal, where general manager Paul Holmgren issued a parole from Russia to Ray Emery. But he has to prove he is no longer the handful the Ottawa Senators finally tired of and has the discipline to match his talent. The Flyers lost some scoring with the departures of Mike Knuble and Joffrey Lupul but the arrival of defenceman Chris Pronger is a huge step forward. If the Flyers can stay healthy, scoring stars Mike Richards, Simon Gagné and Jeff Carter (above) could take them a long way.
PITTSBURGH PENGUINS
The arrival of the salary cap spelled the end of the conventional dynasty, but the Penguins have a good chance to become the first team since the Detroit Red Wings of the late 1990s to win two consecutive Stanley Cups. Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin (above) are two of the best three forwards in the league and they are still developing. Goaltender Marc-André Fleury showed in last spring's playoffs he is among the league's elite. Losing Rob Scuderi hurt the defence, but if Jay McKee should more than fill the gap if he stays healthy. Crosby will have a full season with wingers Bill Guerin and Chris Kunitz, which should shake any Cup hangover.

Agent Joanne Bolte says she rarely comes across small properties that make a big style statement, such as this freehold townhouse in a relatively new subdivision in Ajax.
Less than five years ago, this three-bedroom residence was constructed with open concept spaces and upgraded finishes, including broadloom carpeting, granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, and Italian light fixtures and kitchen taps.
"The way it was laid out and presented inside was extremely nice," says Ms. Bolte, who received more than a dozen offers in less than two weeks. "It's wonderful for a first-time buyer."
On the main floor, there is an open living room, rear dining room and a kitchen with sliding doors to the south-facing backyard.
Around the front, there is a covered balcony off the fireside family room, which is on the second floor along with the bedrooms.
"When you walk up the stairs it splits: You go one way to the family room and you go the other way to the bedrooms," Ms. Bolte says. "It was so cute, I couldn't believe it."
The master suite has direct access to one of three bathrooms. Another large bedroom contains a walk-in closet.
Even the exterior was dressed up with decorative accents, from intricate brickwork above the garage to tall columns flanking the front porch. "It had double front doors with a tinted stained glass," the agent says. "I couldn't even believe the doors that were on it."
The basement was left unfinished.
Local amenities include schools, shopping centres and waterfront parks, trails and beaches. Commuting is easy using public transit or Highway 401.

Design that invests in a better world

Abstract: Mr. [Stephen Burks]'s strategy came into focus in early 2005, when he visited South Africa for the first time. In a Cape Town township, he found an artisan whom he describes as "a side-of-the road, wire and bead souvenir gift-item producer." Working with this man's interest in wire-frame construction, Mr. Burks designed a collection of furniture that could be made by someone with few high-tech skills.

Full text: 'Conscious consumers ... are looking for more authentic products that tell a story,' says Stephen Burks
jmays@globeandmail.com
If your taste in home furnishings runs to the unusual and up-market, you might already have something by the hot young American designer Stephen Burks.
It could be a papier-mâché table made from shredded magazines by South African crafts folk, and marketed by Cappellini. Or it might be a silk duvet cover fashioned by artisans in India. Or a table and chairs crafted in nylon and zinc tubing, distributed by the Italian manufacturer Moroso, that Mr. Burks did in collaboration with traditional weavers in Senegal.
What you may not know is that, in buying a Burks piece, you invested in a contemporary industrial design practice that is more like community organizing than the standard model of an isolated genius slaving away in an atelier.
To find out more about this talented designer's approach, you can catch Mr. Burks's keynote address this afternoon at the IIDEX/NeoCon Canada design fair in Toronto. Or just read on: I talked with him last week by phone from his home town of New York.
"Design is a powerful force in business in the first world, so why can't it be acknowledged as a potentially powerful business force in the developing world?" Mr. Burks said. "Look at how postwar Italy developed out of ruin to become this powerhouse of design in only 60 years! I like to use that as an analogy for what can happen in the developing world, if we use design appropriately, if we work with existing cultures. ...
"We're trying to build a bridge from the developing world to the first world through product development and through distribution."
Mr. Burks's strategy came into focus in early 2005, when he visited South Africa for the first time. In a Cape Town township, he found an artisan whom he describes as "a side-of-the road, wire and bead souvenir gift-item producer." Working with this man's interest in wire-frame construction, Mr. Burks designed a collection of furniture that could be made by someone with few high-tech skills. At first, the artisan had only a handful of collaborators from his township, but the operation soon grew to employ 50 local workers. The Tatu collection is now marketed worldwide by Artecnica.
Since the breakthrough Capetown experiment, Mr. Burks has similarly joined forces with artisans across Asia, Africa and South America. His scheme depends on the interest of "conscious consumers" in the developed world who, he says, "already have the fancy sofa, the fancy lounge chair and lamp and so on, and are looking for more authentic products that tell a story, products that come from a place. I think everything we experience today is so mediated through technology, we have very little authentic experience, and our products can begin to speak to that, and really connect us all through the culture that we share."
But can a model that seems to be working well for Mr. Burks in the developing world function effectively in the developed world? No problem, the designer said.
"Considering that unemployment is at its highest rate in decades in many cities around the world, it's totally viable that people can begin to make a living using their hands. ... We don't try to get everything made by hand in these products, but we try to use the hand for the things that the machine can't do. It's a matter of moving certain crafts traditions into the future through their combination with industrially produced components."
What Mr. Burks brings to the table, in addition to advanced design intelligence, is insider contact with some of the most prominent names in the luxury-goods industry. Since founding his studio, Readymade Projects, in Brooklyn in 1997, he has done packaging for such clients as Estee Lauder, Missoni, Karl Lagerfeld, Calvin Klein and Clinique, and he continues to create home furnishings for an array of Italian manufacturers.
"It's not just about transforming the American home as the site for social change, but about offering the consumer a product that has social change integrated into the production process. Social change is part of the deal."
Stephen Burks's keynote address begins at 4 p.m. today at the
IIDEX/NeoCon Canada design
fair at the Direct Energy Centre
in Toronto.

30-SECOND SPOT / DISPATCHES FROM THE WORLD OF MEDIA AND ADVERTISING

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/30-second-spot-dispatches-world-media-advertising/docview/382611777/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Have you heard from your friendly neighbourhood Nigerian scammer lately? Maybe he's too busy playing with his Sony PS3. In an ad for the popular console, a gamer asks the company about (true) rumours they've dropped the price to $299 (U.S.). "You can't believe everything you read on the Internet," replies a company spokesman, "otherwise I'd be a Nigerian millionaire by now." Uh oh: The government of Nigeria caught wind of the ad and asked for compensation.

Full text: 1 Does the bumpy economy have you reaching for the Pepto-Bismol? You're not the only one: Despite a price point about 60 per cent higher than generic brands, the liquid form of Procter & Gamble's magical pink stomach-soothing potion has added 0.7 points in market share over the last year; its tablet form has added 2.5 points. P & G credits in part a comical campaign featuring a flatulent donkey. The other secret of their success? A willingness to keep spending last year even as the recession took hold. That takes guts. And if there's anything the makers of Pepto-Bismol know about, it's guts.
2 Is fashion advertising bad for your health? Concerned that airbrushed models are projecting a too-perfect image that could prompt impressionable young women to develop eating disorders, 50 members of the French parliament are calling for a warning to be slapped on all retouched photographs, whether they be in ads, on packaging, or as part of a political campaign. Touting the law, French parliamentarian Valerie Boyer said in a statement this week: "These images can make people believe in a reality that often does not exist." Like, say, all advertising?
3 Has Don Draper quit smoking? A cigarette held suavely in his right hand is as much a part of the ad man's identity as a highball and a leer. But in Canadian transit ads for AMC's Mad Men , Draper's smoke has been cut out of the iconic silhouette, the victim of local anti-tobacco laws. "Smoking is a big part of the show," said Jan Diedrichsen of Rainbow Network Sales, which reps the network's shows abroad. "But it's much more important for us to get promotion for the show than to stick to our guns and have cigarettes on there."
4 Have you heard from your friendly neighbourhood Nigerian scammer lately? Maybe he's too busy playing with his Sony PS3. In an ad for the popular console, a gamer asks the company about (true) rumours they've dropped the price to $299 (U.S.). "You can't believe everything you read on the Internet," replies a company spokesman, "otherwise I'd be a Nigerian millionaire by now." Uh oh: The government of Nigeria caught wind of the ad and asked for compensation. If we were Sony, we'd totally offer cash, as soon as Nigeria sends a bank account number where we can wire the money.
5 Actually, maybe Nigeria should just wire the money to our favourite magazine editors; they could use the help. If you pick up the October issues of U.S. consumer monthlies, they'll likely seem lighter than usual, and it's not just because you've been working out. Ad pages are down 20.1 per cent compared to a year ago, according to Media Industry Newsletter. In the wake of the real estate bubble collapse, the biggest losers include Architectural Digest (down 49.4 per cent), Veranda (47.4 per cent) and Dwell (45 per cent). Still, we're betting there would be readers for anyone who wants to start up Apocalyptic Survivalist's Fancy.

Listing agents: Douglas and Trevor Freeman, Freeman Real Estate Ltd.
Within two days of advertising the sale of this one-bedroom plus den suite in Little Italy, a handful of buyers submitted competing offers to agents Douglas and Trevor Freeman.
"A lot of people want to live in that area, but the majority of the houses are much more than $300,000 or $350,000," Trevor Freeman says. "So there's really only a couple of buildings in the area."
Completed on the fifth floor of a fairly new mid-rise, the 700-square-foot suite was finished with hardwood floors, stainless steel kitchen appliances and floor-to-ceiling windows facing south.
"It shows very well, and it had a nice view of the city," Mr. Freeman says.
There is an open kitchen with a granite-topped peninsula and extended breakfast bar that separates a living and dining area with glass doors to a Juliet balcony.
The den contains a built-in desk and shelving, including a hideaway Murphy bed. "It acted well as a second bedroom," the agent says.
The master is the only enclosed space with a walk-in closet and a second Juliet balcony.
The unit also comes with a full bathroom and stacked laundry machines, plus a locker and underground parking, "which is key, especially in that area," Mr. Freeman says.
The monthly fee of $396 covers the cost of heating and upkeep of common facilities, such as the gym, party room and recreation room.
Residents can also find a variety of social events at local restaurants, lounges and cafes along College Street.

Full text: bmckenna@globeandmail.com
When Ben Bernanke gathers today with his Federal Reserve colleagues around the central bank's massive oak-and-glass boardroom table, it's a safe bet they'll discuss the fate of U.S. consumers.
Mr. Bernanke has acknowledged the recession is almost certainly over.
The larger concern now is what will power the recovery.
For decades now, the consumer has been the country's economic engine, accounting for 70 per cent of activity.
But there are signs this is changing. We may be witnessing a new age of frugality, not unlike what occurred after the Depression of the 1930s.
The Great Recession has had a powerful effect on Americans. Their net worth has fallen to $50.4-trillion (U.S.) from $62.6-trillion since the slump began at the end of 2007. Roughly $5-trillion in housing wealth and $6-trillion in stock wealth has vanished, and will likely take years to rebuild.
The response has been predictable. Americans are rapidly paying down debt, spending less and saving more. Personal spending has tumbled in four of the past six quarters - the first time that's occurred since the U.S. government started tracking it in 1947. Consumer spending fell in 2008 for the first time since 1980, and it will likely be lower again this year.
After years of piling on debt, Americans are now rapidly shedding it - by nearly $170-billion so far. Measured as a percentage of disposable income, household debt has fallen to 129 per cent from a peak of 136 per cent.
That's still high by historic standards, which suggests the belt-tightening may still have a way to go. The average debt-to-income ratio of the past 30 years in 93 per cent. The ratio was 100 per cent at the start of this decade, and to get it back to that level would mean getting rid of another $3.2-trillion of debt, economists Julian Jessop and Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics estimated in a recent report. And that could take another 3½ years, they figure.
Less debt means less credit for many other things, and a new normal.
Fewer and smaller cars. Less extravagant homes. A lot fewer gadgets, fixtures and furnishings in those homes. And a more modest travel and dining budget.
Lower spending will also take a bite out of state and local tax receipts, and by extension the services governments provide.
On the other hand, it is possible that Americans will merely go back to their spendthrift ways, as they did after each of the previous post-Second World War recessions.
But there's reason to believe this cycle is different. The Baby Boom generation lost a large chunk of its retirement savings in the stock and real estate crash. With so many of them nearing retirement, they'll need to quickly rebuild their savings while they're still in their prime income-earning years.
Something has to give. A recent study by AlixPartners LLP concluded that spending will eventually recover, but at a significantly lower level - roughly 86 per cent of pre-recession levels.
If that scenario plays out, it will have a profound effect on the economies of countries such as Canada, which depend so heavily on exports to the U.S.
Imagine for a moment the impact on Canada if the new normal means Americans buy smaller homes, more austere furnishings and fewer cars. That would mean less demand for Canadian lumber, steel, oil, cars, auto parts, construction materials and the like.
"Consumers are no longer in a position to power the U.S. economy, let alone the global economy as they have done for most of the past quarter century," Moody's Economy.com chief economist Mark Zandi argued in a recent report. "With incomes under pressure, debt loads overwhelming and nest eggs diminished, it will be difficult for consumers to simply do their part in contributing to economic growth."
More troubling still, the United States has yet to tackle one of its greatest long-term challenges - adequately funding its generous social security and Medicare regimes. Both programs are running out of cash, and Americans will eventually have to pay vastly higher taxes or get a lot less when they retire.
It isn't the way most Baby Boomers imagined they'd be walking into the sunset.

Full text: Still under construction, Festival Tower plays to its audience
jmays@globeandmail.com
Hogtown is home to numerous movie fêtes, but none with more sheer star power and widespread local loyalty than the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). The one important thing TIFF hasn't had until now, however, is a single address from which to run its various activities. (In addition to the big festival held each September, TIFF operates Cinematheque Ontario, a large movie library and a host of other year-round programs.) But that will be remedied next spring or summer, when festival director Piers Handling and his staff decamp from their offices scattered across downtown Toronto and set up shop in the new 42-level Festival Tower, now nearing completion at the junction of King Street West and John Street.
Designed by the well-known Toronto firm of Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg, this mixed-use high-rise is composed of two parts. The portion at street level and up to the height of a 10-storey building, to be called the Bell Lightbox, will include TIFF's staff headquarters, library and theatres, restaurants, an art gallery and a gala exterior flight of steps modelled on one that graces a modernist villa in Capri.
This stairway rising above King Street West could be viewed, I suppose, as a rather extravagant architectural gesture in a time of economic austerity. But what would a votive shrine to cinema be without an exotic stair? Think of the final scenes of Gone With the Wind , and the descent of mad silent-screen star Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard . Festival Tower's exterior stair, along with one planned for the ground-floor lobby, are touches of fantasy that should be allowed even in - or especially in - hard times.
As I found during a hard-hat walkabout last week, TIFF's digs in the new structure promise to be generally deluxe: roomy for the staff who work behind the scenes of the festival, well-provided with natural light streaming into the space through tall windows and welcoming to the movie-going public.
Five theatres, with seating for 550, 350, 250, 150 and 80 people respectively, will accommodate TIFF's vigorous festival and year-round lineup of film screenings. Allowance has been made in the design of all these theatres for both digital and 35-millimetre projection, and four feature stages for performances, panel discussions, lectures and other non-film events. (I tried to find out if TIFF will be lending out its technologically cutting-edge theatres to outside groups, but, perhaps due to the crush of the festival now under way, the press people didn't return my call.) Turning from the Bell Lightbox to the tower's second element, the 37-level condominium stack, one finds less to be excited about. It's conventional high-end Toronto condo housing: expensive ($800 a square foot), and a bit too finely diced: Units range from just 487 square feet in area (in a studio apartment), up to only about 2,300 square feet in the largest penthouse suite.
But there are compensations available to anyone who chooses to live in the relatively modest spaces of Festival Tower. One is the view from the lower storeys (which, in many parts of town, is tiresome). It's attractively hard and urban, with tall buildings round about that are already built or on the way. Not all these neighbouring structures are interesting - the Holiday Inn next door is an aesthetic calamity - but the total ensemble of structures visible from the tower has a tough, tight look that I, for one, wouldn't mind waking up to.
Another recompense is, of course, TIFF - though the busy comings and goings of movie stars, moguls, fans and paparazzi around the tower each September might become trying. But residents will be able to avoid some of the hubbub - not all will want to, I suspect - by entering the condominium block through its private entrance, off John Street.
And while new condo complexes occasionally have screening rooms, few I've seen are as plush as the one planned for Festival Tower. It's a 60-seat theatre outfitted to the same high-tech levels as the spaces dedicated to TIFF's activities.
So far, I haven't said anything much about Festival Tower's exterior. That's because I don't know what to make of it. Judging the King Street façade is surely premature: The trim's not on yet, and a few splashes of gleaming metal or sparkling light could abruptly modify its appearance. As things stand now, however, there seems to be an awful lot of glass muscling its way toward the street - a 10-storey, block-long cascade of it, a Niagara of glass.
But be that as it may, Toronto has something to look forward to, once Festival Tower gets up and running: a fresh focus for this town's ongoing fascination with the movies.

Emerald Dr., off Summerlyn Trail, north of Highway 88 (Holland Street). Open
Monday to Thursday from
1 p.m. to 8 p.m.; weekends and holidays from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
CONTACT: Phone 905-775-3461 or visit greatgulfhomes.com With the bulk of 180 homes sold in the first phase of a low-rise community in Bradford, Great Gulf Homes will release a new collection of semi-detached and detached houses this weekend.
The grand opening of the second phase of the project - called Summerlyn Village - begins tomorrow. Colleen Rusholme, 97.3 FM EZ Rock's Morning Show co-host, will be on location for a barbecue held the next day from noon to 4 p.m.
"The site's done very well from a sales standpoint," says Sandra Frasson, vice-president of sales and marketing. "It's gone from a construction site to an actual neighbourhood where people are living."
Located just 30 minutes north of Toronto, the 340-acre site will grow to encompass 1,000 families, as well as recreational and public facilities off Holland Street West (Highway 88) just west of Professor Day Drive.
"We wanted to develop a master-planned community where someone could live and play," says Ms. Frasson.
For instance, there will be a new school, library, recreation centre, and town centre.
A pond, creek, wildlife corridor and natural wetlands will offer a scenic backdrop, along with native plantings throughout and 60-acres of protected woodland home to century-old oaks and maples. Also in the works are new parks, including one to open this fall, and an extensive trail system. A ten metre tall berm will act as a natural buffer along the site's western boundary and contain trail with signage outlining exercise routines.
"People are becoming much more active," says Ms. Frasson. "They can take their kids biking and they can take a walk. And when they're walking its actually something interesting as opposed to just walking around the block."
Buyers in the second phase can move into homes next fall, and immediately make use of established schools, GO Train station and shops in the small town. More stores are also being developed nearby along Holland Street.
"It's nicely located in Bradford with a lot of commercial services already in place," says Ms. Frasson. "Usually, it's the other way around: homes are moving in and people have to wait for retail to follow."
Taking cues from local neighbourhoods, the site embraces heritage streetscapes, from old-world English-style lampposts to brick facades with trimmed peaked gables, accent windows, shutters and front porches.
Four model homes are on display, including the 2,020-square foot Chicory and 2,235-square-foot Primrose design on 36-foot lots, and the Birch and Maple layouts - 2,435 and 3,160 square-feet respectively - on 40-foot lots.
"People like what they see and gravitate to those plans," adds Ms. Frasson.
Most designs will be two-storeys with single or double garages, main floor laundry rooms, dining rooms and eat-in kitchens. In some cases, there are dens and second floor family rooms.
"There are lots of open spaces and new fresh ideas on kitchen layouts," says Ms. Frasson. "They're really family-friendly plans."
Interiors will feature fireplaces, decorative columns, broadloom and natural oak railings and pickets.

Full text: Actor Brian Bedford has spent decades on an earnest attempt to rehabilitate his 1880s Stratford cottage
For Brian Bedford the stage is his home, where he has spent the better part of his life performing as a classically trained actor.
But enter his sun-dappled residence in Stratford, Ont., located on a tree-lined street within walking distance to the theatre where he currently stars in his own directed version of The Importance of Being Earnest , and the feeling is that the reverse is also true: The home is his stage.
The 1880s, pale brick Ontario cottage where he has lived since 1985, sharing it with fellow Stratford Shakespeare Festival actor Tim MacDonald, is filled with artifacts reflecting more than 50 years honing a career devoted to live performance. From the framed series of 17th century theatre designs given him by his old friend Peter Glenville, director of the 1964 historic film, Becket , to the piles of books by and about Oscar Wilde, the Irish wit whom Mr. Bedford just finished playing tribute to in his one-man play, Ever Yours, Oscar , his immaculately kept one-storey is a thespian's showcase.
Every object in it tells a story - mainly the actor's own.
"It certainly isn't interior design," says Mr. Bedford, fastidiously dressed in shirt and tie even on a Saturday morning.
His voice is soft and accented with the plummy cadences of his native England, patrician-sounding, despite the actor's working-class origins as the son of a West Yorkshire soldier.
He continues, resting his slim frame against an upholstered chair in his archetypically English living room, describing how he came to buy the house that he loved at first sight because it was old but original - "built for those far more higher level members of the railway" that toward the end of the 1800s was one of Stratford's main industries.
The house came with a cherry orchard - "a thing of great beauty," as Mr. Bedford describes it - as well as a back garden planted with Japanese maples, wisteria and a weeping willow.
Two years ago, and following an earlier renovation that saw the addition of a new wing to accommodate a large bedroom with a mirrored ensuite for Mr. MacDonald, Mr. Bedford added a pergola over a back deck, accessible through two large French doors.
"I love this garden," he says. "It's very natural, and I suppose compared to what was - a mud field that looked straight out of Vietnam - it has become a lovely space, and very tranquil, thanks in large part to my gardener, David Scott."
The yard's unfettered beauty stands in contrast to the house's interior that has been thoroughly overhauled and re-crafted - much like one of his meticulously researched plays.
There, artifice rules in the form of polished surfaces like honed marble, cut glass and gleaming antique wood furniture, some of it locally sourced from Johnny's Antiques, located just outside the Stratford town limits.
Framed oil portraits of English gentlemen and fishing scenes inspired by his native Yorkshire line the walls, while copies of Trollope fill the pine bookcases.
In the adjoining study, in addition to a David Hockney painting given him for his birthday by the painter himself, is a Constable-esque wall mural of what appears to be the English countryside. Mr. Bedford commissioned it from local artist Mark Fletcher, a resident of nearby St. Mary's.
The overall feeling is of an English drawing room in Covent Garden, gilt pineapples and bone china and all.
"It's all radically changed from what it was originally, when I first saw it and fell in love with it," Mr. Bedford says, in describing the renovation he initiated three years ago.
The house had previously belonged to Polly Bohdanetsky, a Stratford costume designer, and it was composed on the main floor of three small rooms that Mr. Bedford found dim and confining.
He tore down interior walls to open the house up and make it more light-filled, refitting it with new high windows and wide plank pine flooring. he also completely eliminated a second floor, replacing it with a soaring 12-foot ceiling that makes the house seem elegantly spacious, despite having only about 1,200 square feet of living space.
Says Mr. Bedford, "I wanted a place where I could have my own lamps, and stuff."
Mr. Bedford attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and had as classmates Albert Finney and Peter O'Toole esteemed English actors who were part of the modernizing movement that transformed British theatre in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He remembers especially his friendship with the late actor Alan Bates.
"He was my great friend," says Mr. Bedford, relishing the memory. "And I miss him terribly. It was thanks to Alan that I was cast in The Young and the Beautiful [Mr. Bedford's London debut]. Peter Brook, [the innovative British stage and film director], saw The Young and the Beautiful and asked me to be in [Arthur Miller's] A View From the Bridge , and that took me to Stratford-upon-Avon where Sir John Gielgud was Prospero in The Tempest and I was Ariel, at the age of 21."
The rest, as they say, is history.
Mr. Gielgud ended up playing real-life mentor to Mr. Bedford, and today a large framed picture of his likeness hangs inside his home's foyer, immediately grabbing the attention of anyone entering through Mr. Bedford's green frame front door.
This pictorial tribute is in acknowledgment of Mr. Gielgud being responsible for first bringing Mr. Bedford to North America after having cast him in his 1959 production of Peter Shaffer's Five Finger Exercise.
The play toured several major cities in the U.S., eventually leading to Mr. Bedford coming to Stratford where, after 27 seasons, he remains one of the leading lights of the town's annual theatre festival.
The actors' friendship was such that upon his death, Mr. Gielgud bequeathed Mr. Bedford several of his own prized possessions, among them two hand-drawn costume sketches, dated 1949, and signed by the costume designer.
Detailing armour and weaponry for characters in Much Ado About Nothing , the Shakespeare play in which Mr. Gielgud had performed, they now take pride of place inside Mr. Bedford's English-inspired living room, sharing space with an extensive collection of painted Staffordshire porcelain and hand-knotted carpets imported from Morocco, where Mr. Bedford also has had homes, often using them to memorize the lines he eventually performs in Stratford:
"I've done an awful lot of preparing for parts in Morocco and a couple of years ago, in a tiny village right in the souk overlooking that gardens, I was learning King Lear and shouting, How! How! The poor people. They had no idea of the things I do, and I could just imagine them, calling me the mad Englishman. Which I might be, exactly."

Full text: tbelford@globeandmail.com
The chunk of downtown Toronto many call the best address in Canada - 1 Bloor - got a new owner this week as Bazis International handed the deed over to Great Gulf Homes. Behind that transaction is a tale of legal stick handling seldom (if ever) seen in Canadian real estate.
The men who brokered the deal and salvaged what they could for Bazis are a pair of real estate legal whizzes from Robins Appleby & Taub LLP: Leor Margulies and Sheldon Goodman. They co-chair the firm's real estate advisory group and have been Bazis' lawyers since the company's first solo project about four years ago.
Last week they walked me through a truly fascinating transaction.
But before getting into details of what happened during the past few years and the demise of what was slated to be Canada's tallest residential tower we should note where things stand.
First, the 490 people who bought suites at 1 Bloor will get their deposits back, plus interest, the lawyers say. The paperwork has been mailed; most buyers have responded and cheques are being cut, they say.
Second, Bazis' other projects are unaffected, say Mr. Margulies and Mr. Goodman. Crystal Blu on nearby Balmuto Street is nearing completion and Emerald Park at Yonge and Finch is 86 per cent sold and waiting for rezoning approval, a process delayed by the recent strike by City of Toronto employees.
While construction loan financing remains tight, the lawyers are confident Bazis will find a lender so it can proceed with Emerald Park.
Yes, Bazis has to swallow a hefty multimillion-dollar loss (some estimate it to be in the $30-million range) but the price paid by Great Gulf (according to the Ontario Land Registry Office it was $53-million, though none of the parties have made that public yet) clears the mortgage on the land plus a bit extra, the lawyers say, adding that Bazis also retains an unspecified participation in whatever Great Gulf builds on the site.
Third, Great Gulf Homes now owns the site and is working on plans for a mixed use condo-commercial project.
And finally the trio of canny real-estate veterans who tried to snap up the site through the back door by buying the $45-million in mortgages on it from Societé General of France are to get a cheque to pay off the loan plus $242,823 in interest arrears. (They asked for $2-million, but a judge dismissed that claim saying it would have represented a 35 per cent interest rate.)
That's the situation now. Here's the story of how the original plan to build an 80-storey condo tower at 1 Bloor came together - and fell apart.
Bazis came to Toronto in the early years of this decade. The Canadian company has three local partners - Michael Gold, who handles financing, his wife Veronika Belovich, director of sales and marketing, whose father owns the parent company in Kazakhstan, and architect Roy Varacalli, who is director of design and construction.
They started with joint-venture projects and then launched Crystal Blu as their first solo enterprise. The parent company had made its name by creating huge signature projects in Eastern Europe and Mr. Gold wanted something of a similar scale here.
He learned that the southeast corner of Bloor and Yonge might be available. It was owned by the Kolter Group and three private investors through a numbered company. Kolter decided to sell off all its commercial properties because chief executive officer Robert Julien had his eye on developing condos in Palm Beach, Fla.
A deal was struck in December, 2006. Kolter bought out its partners and Bazis through a 50-50 partnership with U.S. mega merchant bank Lehman Brothers. It bought that property, plus another one abutting it to the south and owned by Bank of Nova Scotia for a total of $78-million.
Societé Generale of France provided two mortgages totalling $45-million on the land on condition it also got the construction financing. Bazis and Lehman then went on to spend about $20-million more in development costs. Tenants were told to vacate properties on the site in February, 2007 and demolition started early in 2008.
In the meantime, Bazis attracted lineups of would-be buyers, who even slept on the sidewalk for their chance to pick up a condo in the sky.
Then almost exactly a year ago two unforeseen events kicked the props out from under the project. The U.S. mortgage-backed securities industry crumbled and Lehman Brothers was one of the first victims. It lost billions and was forced into bankruptcy.
Bazis could no longer count on its partner to share the financial load; it struggled but was able to keep mortgage payments current, the lawyers say. Then Societé Generale suffered massive reversals of its own. It too suffered huge losses from investments in mortgage-backed securities, and to make matters infinitely worse it discovered a rogue trader on its staff had lost the company $7.9 billion (U.S.).
The head office in France ordered its North American representative to get out of the real-estate market as quickly as he could by selling off investments and loans.
"Bazis could probably have gotten through the loss of Lehman Brothers but it just could not handle the loss of Societé Generale as well," says Mr. Margulies.
"We were able to negotiate an extension of the loan until the end of March and Bazis was able to keep payments current while Michael Gold looked for other sources of construction financing, part of which would pay off the land loan," adds Mr. Goodman.
Then without informing Bazis, Societé Generale sold the loan to a numbered company, owned by the three of Canada's smartest real estate players: Alan Greenberg of Minto Group, Jon Love of KingSett Capital Inc. and mezzanine lending financier Gary Berman of Tricon Capital Group Inc.
The trio then set about acquiring the property by foreclosing on the mortgage when it started to fall into arrears in April. The strategy, however, was one used more in corporate bankruptcies that in real estate transactions, says Mr. Goodman. In real estate a lender who seeks to foreclose on a loan must have a receiver or the court sell the property to an unrelated third party and the proceeds of that sale is applied to the loan and accrued interest.
The trio, however, asked for Ernst & Young to be named receiver and also submitted a bid from a numbered company for $55-million saying that if the receiver could not find a better offer, the property should be sold to the numbered company, which they controlled.
"It was unheard of in a real-estate foreclosure case," says Mr. Goodman.
Then began a series of court hearings, which ran through June and July. Bazis was given until June 26 to find construction financing to pay off the existing land mortgage. Mr. Gold came back with a $195-million commitment from BTA bank in Kazakistan. On June 29 the trio refused to accept it saying that BTA bank was under investigation for alleged fraud.
The parties went back to court July 4 and Bazis was given until July 20 to find a joint venture partner, new financing or a buyer.
"All through the late spring and early summer we were discussing joint ventures with various parties," says Mr. Margulies.
"Great Gulf seemed the most serious so negotiations were started in earnest in July."
When the parties returned to court on July 20, Bazis had a buyer, the court accepted the solution and the paperwork was started to transfer ownership and pay out the three-would be owners.
Are there any hard feelings? Not on the part of the lawyers, says Mr. Margulies. "Goodmans LLP, the trio's lawyers, came up with an innovative strategy to get their clients the land. It was just our job to come up with an even better one to defeat it."

Stunning design, but it still tastes like a Keg

Full text: The chain's lavish new Yaletown outpost is anything but ordinary, with a gorgeous atrium and some of the finest views in the city
agill@globeandmail.com
First, the good news. The new Yaletown Keg Steakhouse & Bar is an absolute stunner. The bad news? Beautiful design doesn't make its plebeian chain-food taste any better.
But you knew that already, didn't you? This is the Keg we're talking about here.
I suppose it is difficult to ascertain what this latest goldfield in the Vancouver-based empire of prime rib and double-baked potato is trying to achieve.
From the street, the restaurant's unassuming brick-and-mortar shell with impenetrably dark glass looks a lot like the three other Kegs in downtown Vancouver. But once you step through its front doors, a soaring atrium anchored by a marble wall of flame (embedded with four stacked fireplaces) radiates upwards in a lustrous gloss of glass railings, textured oil paintings and soft lighting.
This sure ain't no ordinary Sudbury Saturday-night steakhouse.
The gorgeous four-storey, 400-seat restaurant, which was designed by Elaine Thorsell and includes the loveliest rooftop patio to ever grace Vancouver's skyline, is rumoured to have cost about $11-million. (Keg spokesman Jim Croteau wouldn't confirm or deny the figure, but said it was "very close.") That makes it the most lavish Keg in North America - and much more expensive to build than the company's higher-end operations: the Shore Club, Gotham Steakhouse and Ki in Toronto (a Vancouver version of the latter is slated to open in Vancouver's Shangri-La Hotel next spring).
The Keg is obviously a better-known brand. But unlike Toronto, where the flashy Keg outlet on York Street quickly became the go-to destination for young Bay Street brokers, the Yaletown Keg doesn't seem to be searching after the business crowd (it isn't even open for weekday lunch).
As the hostess leads us past the bustling bar and lounge area on the main floor, we quickly realize that the restaurant is more likely to join the local contingent of nighttime meat, er, meet markets.
"Is this your first time here?" she asks, as we huff and puff behind her, climbing a steep set of stairs. "Awesome!" she says sweetly, when we reply in the affirmative.
The view from the second-floor balcony, which looks over the gleaming bar below and staircase leading down to a private room in the basement, is indeed pretty awesome. But there are lots of cozy nooks spread around the corners should you fancy something more intimate.
And if the rooftop isn't closed due to rain and cold weather, as it is the night we visit, there really isn't any better public vantage point from which to enjoy Vancouver's glass-towered urban horizon. The central bar, adorned in silvery granite, teak and platinum-finished plank panelling, is surrounded by a series of step-down verandas, each outfitted with its own stone fireplace.
I'm surprised that the patio isn't better winterized, considering that the restaurant will likely draw some seriously large crowds during the Olympic Games, when all of Yaletown will be designated a late-night party zone. But considering that two-thirds of the area is covered and could potentially be heated, I'm sure that it will still be hopping regardless of how much sleet may be slanting in sideways.
Back in cozier climes, we sink into a high-backed, taupe velour banquette and get to know our rather green yet genial waiter, as he struggles to uncork a bottle of serviceable Côtes du Rhône that we've selected by default from an utterly uninspiring wine list.
A spongy loaf of white bread is served warm in a basket with a distinct waft of stale freezer burn.
I don't want to be too tough on the Keg. It is what it is, and many people love it. I usually seek it out about once a year, whenever I'm the mood for a juicy slab of reasonably priced 28-day aged Canada AAA steak with no frills or huge expectations attached.
I would simply like to suggest you not stray very far from that time-tested formula.
Do not, for instance, be enticed by the foolish idea of tempura snap peas and asparagus ($6.95). Tempura? I doubt it. This dark-brown batter, which looks like it's been plunged into several-days-old oil, is chewier than the shoddiest gyoza you'd find at a Japanese street stall.
Sweet hot calamari ($9.95) consists of lightly battered ringlets tossed in a treacly ginger-garlic sauce. Sweet hot calamari ($9.95) smells fishy - as in not fresh.
That said, the steaks are very good. A top sirloin is served as tender as promised and perfectly medium-rare, as requested. But don't bother splurging on the oven-baked Atlantic lobster tail combination ($37.95). This limp flipper, which seems to have been flopping around in a tank for some time, is watery and tasteless.
And if you're going to order one of the specially sauced steaks, do inquire carefully about what is coming. With the peppercorn New York strip loin ($28.95), I expected a traditionally creamy sauce made with whole peppercorns, shallots and cognac. The slimy ratatouille that I was served, accompanied by a side of crisp zucchini and rubbery black olives, hadn't even entered my generally far-fetched imagination.
Sensing my disappointment, the waiter sends over a manager, who kindly explains that he has encountered similar complaints many times before and promptly deletes the steak from the bill.
Is it a shame that such pedestrian food is being served on such a princely piece of real estate? Well, somebody has to pay for that fabulous view. And the Keg will probably bring in far more customers than the Shore Club ever would.
If I go back - which I'm sure I will, to enjoy the patio - I'll just be sure to stick to my tried-and-true Chicago-charred rib steak or baseball top sirloin with a plain old baked potato.
The Yaletown Keg Steakhouse & Bar: 1011 Mainland St.; 604-633-2534.

Full text: If you want a real taste of Italy today, pass on the museum and head to a winery. You'll sample not only stellar vintages, but decadent cuisine
bcrosariol@globeandmail.com
I had been anticipating the roast pigeon as the bus pulled into Badia a Passignano, a hallowed wine estate in Tuscany that boasts a Michelin-star restaurant on the property. What I didn't expect was the bat.
Pigeon is a signature of Matia Barciulli, the Osteria di Passignano's chef. I'd led two busloads of Globe readers to the restaurant as part of a shore excursion during the recent Globe and Mail Mediterranean Odyssey cruise. We'd already had a week of sybaritic dining on the ship, so we were expecting a certain standard of gluttonous decadence.
Mr. Barciulli did not disappoint. In his hands the nuisance bird of every Italian piazza was a glory of tenderness, delicate and lean the way you expect a bird to be but with a depth of flavour and juiciness closer to sirloin. (Great eating and less piazza clutter - that's killing two birds with one stone if you ask me.) Served with a glass of earthy Tignanello 2006, it drew a chorus of raves.
But then any winged creature not resembling a bat would have been all right with us. We had just finished a tour of the Badia, a fourth-century monastery that sits on land owned by the Antinori family. While the Antinoris have access to the cellars for storage, the castle-like building, where Galileo once lived and taught math, remains in the hands of monks, a few of whom still live inside.
As our group filed into a stone cellar for export manager Stefano Leone's treatise on the influence of French oak on the sangiovese grape, the echolocating insectivore made its appearance, flapping about in the darkness overhead, in the process scaring the bejeezus out of us (okay, me).
To me the pigeon, the bat and the ghost of Galileo were vivid reminders of why it can be magical to visit a winery in Italy. My travel advice: If you want to see Italy's past, by all means line up at a museum, cathedral or ancient ruin; if you want to experience its living, breathing present and participate in its evolving culture, get out into the country and into a winery.
And if you just want to taste great food, stay the heck out of Florence. I remain weak-kneed over the first-course combination of our lunch at the Osteria di Passignano. It was a pecorino flan on balsamic-vinegar reduction paired with Antinori's Cervaro della Sala 2007. The wine is a chardonnay-grechetto blend from Umbria that has all the voluptuous flesh of a big California chardonnay but is usually better tuned than most similarly priced Californians - more lively acidity and less cloying oak and residual sugar. I pretended I was Galileo as I sipped. Fruit is the centre of gravity, I thought, oak is the Earth; oak should revolve around wine, not the other way around.
Two other Tuscan stops on our tours were as different as they were impressive, both located in the coastal zone of Bolgheri. Axel Heinz, the winemaker at Tenuta dell'Ornellaia, the secluded estate known for an eponymous $200 red, showed us his 2006 vintage. Exceptionally concentrated, it offered lots of fruit flavour in a solid, complex frame that suggested a bright future.
Down the road, the little-known estate of Michele Satta was so happy to see foreign visitors that sales manager Fabio Motta let us get up close and personal with the whirring buzz of the merlot crush. Most boutique producers of fine wine in California would have kept us a kilometre away.
Though fine wine can be synonymous with pretentiousness, somebody forgot to tell the people at Murgo, an estate on the lower slopes of Mount Etna in eastern Sicily. Etna is the largest active volcano in Europe, and its hardened-lava soil does wonders for wine grapes. We were invited to taste for ourselves - the incoming grape bunches, that is, not just the wine.
If your experience with grape eating is limited to the table varieties, you will have scant idea what a well-grown bunch of ripened merlot berries taste like. All skin and syrupy, sloppy juice, with very little pulp, it's so intensely sweet that you could almost climb a wall, Spider-Man style, with the thick film of sticky sugar left on your hands. The Murgo Etna Bianco, at about $13 in some provinces, is a dynamite value if you like crisp, minerally whites.
When our ship docked near Naples, I accompanied a small busload into the hills of the Campania region to drop in on what I believe are two of the greatest wineries of southern Italy: Mastroberardino and Feudi di San Gregorio.
Mastroberardino has long been a champion of previously unsung local grapes such as aglianico and fiano, now trendy in bars from New York to Vancouver. Its wines are available sporadically on shelves in this country. The flagship Radici Taurasi 2003 is $54.99 in British Columbia, while the killer crisp white Greco di Tufo is $29.99, available in small quantities. A new, high-end red called Mastroberardino Naturalis Historia Taurasi 2003 is available in Ontario for $65 as an online exclusive through Vintages (www.vintagesshoponline.com).
It's emblematic of Italy's bred-in-the-bone belief that wine should be served only in the company of food that even when you're not formally dining at a winery, you often get antipasti to nibble away at. The affettati , or cold cuts, at Mastroberardino were probably the best pieces of cured pork flesh I'd ever eaten. The meat was sliced gossamer thin and arranged like petals of a giant flower. Origami salami, I thought.
Speaking of things Japanese, we then headed to the nearby town of Sorbo Serpico to a winery called Feudi di San Gregorio.
On the bus I had primed my tour group by mentioning the $25-million Japanese-designed structure that greets visitors with madrigal vocal recordings in what's billed as the longest barrel cellar in Italy. I had even conveyed how an Italian chef at the Art Institute of Chicago recently presented Barack and Michelle Obama with a bottle of falanghina from this very winery when they ate at the institute's celebrated new restaurant. But I had not prepared the group for Feudi's own restaurant.
This one, too, boasts a Michelin star. Chef Paolo Barrale applies "molecular-cuisine" conceits such as foams and gels to his food but in a deft, subtle way that respects the Italian compass and does not stray far from the seasonal imperative of Campania's bounty. Mussels in a cappuccino foam sound wretched, but they were sublime. Veal shank cooked for 19 hours at 70 F was a triumph of tenderness and depth of meaty flavour. Ricotta-stuffed tortelli on a cloud of foamed milk topped with truffle shavings is the plate you'll get when you order comfort food in Heaven.
And the wines? Unbelievable. Just ask the Obamas.

Full text:   Web TV shows and social networking are among beleaguered malls' new tactics at a time when 'flat is the new up.' Marina Strauss reports
Two stylists are enthusing about how budget-conscious consumers can save money by recycling their summer wardrobe for fall.
A long-sleeved white Mexx shirt works underneath a lightweight sleeveless cotton shift, refashioned for an autumn look with tights from Benetton, a purple print Mexx scarf, grey Rudsak booties and gold handbag and bracelet from Liz Claiborne.
"We don't necessarily have to break the bank, and we can reuse pieces we already have," Afiya Francisco advises her audience.
Another reality television show? Not exactly. The three-minute episode, which will go online Friday, is part of a series called Style Agents that the Vaughan Mills Shopping Centre is using to tout its fashion offerings. The Web campaign appears on StyleAgents.ca, Twitter and YouTube feeds and in podcasts and blogs.
"It's a wonderful opportunity to shine when other marketers are pulling back," says Jamie MacLean, marketing director for the mall, a half-hour drive north of Toronto.
"It stimulated a lot of activity. ... We've been up [in sales] pretty consistently even in a time when flat is the new up."
From Web TV to social networking to shop-local initiatives, purveyors of fashion are finding creative ways to court shopping-wary consumers in the economic downturn. On Thursday, 700 stores in the United States and 11 other countries kept their doors open until 11 p.m. for the first "Fashion's Night Out" event, tied to the launch of New York Fashion Week and co-sponsored by Vogue magazine.
While Canada wasn't officially part of the fashionable pep rally, the Bay marked the night by extending its hours at four stores until 10 p.m. and organized designer appearances and other special events at seven of its key outlets.
Tonight in Toronto, meanwhile, Holt Renfrew is doing its own fashion outreach, hosting a Toronto International Film Festival party to screen two two-minute fall-fashion videos before posting them on its website and Facebook page.
There's an urgency to making a splash now. Many retailers are suffering through one of their toughest years in decades, with some notable names, such as Toronto's Hazel, Finishing Touches and Zola Shoes, going under.
In June alone, Canadian clothing retail sales dipped 5 per cent from a year earlier, according to Statistics Canada; in the same month, sales at Canadian malls (excluding department stores) fell almost 4 per cent from the previous year, the International Council of Shopping Centres reports.
"Malls need to do more; all retailers need to do more," says retail-real estate consultant Hermann Kircher of Kircher Research Associates. "In order to excel, you have to come up with something that wasn't done before - something that is memorable."
One Toronto businesswoman has taken a local approach to woo consumers. Lauren Wise, a human-resources expert, was becoming alarmed at the growing number of shops going out of business in her North Toronto neighbourhood. She figured one way to get people into stores again was to offer a financial incentive.
In June, she introduced the "Shop the Block" discount card that, for an annual $65 fee, offers consumers up to 20 per cent off their purchases at participating stores, restaurants and other services. So far, 300 consumers have signed up for the card; 100 merchants are on board, she says.
"It gets me out shopping," says Tara Fingold, a 35-year-old mother of two who figures she has saved $150 in the two months since she got the card. The interior designer has picked up everything from toys at Oink Oink to children's clothing at Gretchen & Co. and a fall wardrobe at Bella.
She recently bought a $235 James Pierce shirt at Bella, getting a 10-per-cent markdown with her card. "I could have bought it at Holt's, but at Holt's it would have been regular price."
"It just helps if it's a little less guilt when something is a little bit cheaper," adds Penny Sherman, a 35-year-old cardholder who is a teacher and mother of two. She and Fingold both say they have scaled back their spending on non-necessities by 20 per cent or more from a year ago, but the card motivates them to head to local shops.
Wise says that she would eventually like to go cross-Canada and plans to expand to other Toronto neighbourhoods by early next year through ShopTheBlock.ca.
A growing number of businesses are turning to the Web. Vaughan Mills launched its first online episode of Style Agents in late May when the mall, while managing to make sales gains in the recession, started to see a dip in its traffic in the unseasonably cool weather. By this week, four segments had got more than 61,000 online views, including 35,000-plus on YouTube, says Mark Campbell, account director at VMG Cinematic, which produced the video.
YouTube is alluring because 48 per cent of its users are female and 34 per cent are "really into" clothing fashions, visiting the site a few days a week, according to data compiled by VMG.
"It's a tactic to support our ultimate strategy to better connect with that market," the mall's MacLean says. "To have access to a platform where we can spread our brand on an international basis is in our best interest."
Calgary-area shopping centre CrossIron Mills set out to spread the word about its opening last month with a virtual campaign aimed at appealing to Albertans' pride in their province, marketing director Aleisha Vermeulen says.
As the first mall to launch since the financial crisis took root last fall - and Alberta's first new enclosed shopping space in 20 years - it needed to raise awareness. Its micro site, BeyondTheOrdinary.ca, created a social-networking opportunity by inviting consumers to post photographs of their personal Alberta moments. It got about 300 responses in its first five weeks, and Vermeulen credits the campaign with helping bring 250,000 people to the centre in its first five days. Even better, stores reported sales exceeding their forecasts.
The online contest also allowed the company to collect information on contestants so it could keep in touch with them. Now, it wants to use the photos in other marketing initiatives. "We kind of tapped into that notion of pride of place, using that as a platform to get people aware of us," Vermeulen says.
But whether online or offline, marketers are often chasing an affluent consumer in a bid to get her to loosen her purse strings. The Shop the Block program sends its e-mails to households with incomes of $150,000 or more, Wise says. Soon she'll (snail) mail promotions to 3,000 North Toronto homes.
At Vaughan Mills, almost 35 per cent of the shoppers have an average household income of around $117,000 and aspire to shop for luxury goods in Yorkville, MacLean says. But they're also frugalistas who appreciate the deals at the mall's outlet stores, which include Lacoste, Hugo Boss and Holt Renfrew Last Call.
Other new initiatives are just plain common sense. Vaughan Mills started a free shuttle service in May from Union Station in downtown Toronto. It has been running at 70 per cent capacity, beating the mall's expectation of operating half-full buses, MacLean says.
And a few are already setting the stage for the crucial holiday selling season. Park Royal shopping centre in tony West Vancouver is already running a feel-good Christmas video on its website under the title "Yule love it."
"It's a tough time for fashion now," marketing director Nancy Small says. "People want to have interesting and light things to look at online."

A new take on suburbia: high density

Abstract: For the West Coast, it's a relatively new housing type. It's advantage, explains Mr. [Bob Worden], is that it's a flexible, surprisingly cost efficient way to maximize space."It was the pre-car, pre-urban sprawl solution to high density living," he notes, and most importantly, in contrast to the typical single family suburban home, "it can build a sense of community."

Full text:   Mosaic's Tatton project in Coquitlam brings the Georgian housing style to an area more accustomed to isolationist tract housing. Hadani Ditmars reports
The Vancouver suburb of Coquitlam has many charms. The Pitt River runs through it, the North Shore Mountains nestle around it and greenery abounds. But edgy urban planning is not yet one of the bucolic community's strong points.
This is still very much a commuter's hub, where the mall is the retail option of choice and single-family housing is the norm. But there are signs of a slow sea change. The neighbourhood around city hall boasts a new café and a fledgling pedestrian area amidst new high rises and shopping centres. And the old Riverview mental hospital that runs along the highway next to the CPR line is poised between new condo development and a return to a residential facility, because let's face it, the suburbs can be calming.
But depending on how well planned they are, they can also pose a challenge to one's mental health. The ugly isolationist model is well represented along a stretch of the Lougheed Highway, where planners have erected a huge concrete barrier in front of cookie cutter suburban tract housing complete with plywood siding and faux hacienda-style tile roofing. Blink and you could be in a kinder, gentler Baghdad.
But hope is on the horizon. There is a better way, and it's cloaked in a Georgian row house exterior. That's right, Georgian row houses have come to Coquitlam, in a project called "Tatton," developed by Mosaic and designed by architect Bob Worden of Ramsay Worden Architects.
For the West Coast, it's a relatively new housing type. It's advantage, explains Mr. Worden, is that it's a flexible, surprisingly cost efficient way to maximize space."It was the pre-car, pre-urban sprawl solution to high density living," he notes, and most importantly, in contrast to the typical single family suburban home, "it can build a sense of community."
The front stoop becomes an important social space, where neighbours can meet and greet, and the close proximity fosters a feeling of collective responsibility for landscaping and upkeep.
Mr. Worden is a keen student of traditional row house forms, having spent years sketching them in both London and in Amsterdam. The Dutch version, he notes, is differentiated by its larger window frames, that "optimize the grey winter light," a feature that he's happily incorporated into the Tatton homes.
"Bob was a natural choice as our architect," says Luciano Zago, chief design manager at Mosaic, a company with a thing for Georgian row houses with similar projects in Vancouver and Surrey.
Modernists may look askance at such a traditional exterior, but before you can say "Prince Charles would love this," consider the contemporary interiors of the Tatton homes. The 13 units, the first of a multi-pronged project, sits opposite a park and elementary school and embraces the slope of Burke Mountain. They may be Georgian on the outside, but inside they are essentially light filled modernist boxes.
What makes the Georgian row house modern, contends Zago, is its simplicity. The understated exterior makes for a flexible and extremely livable space. Like a good suit, he maintains, "you can dress it up or down with different accessories."
The three-story houses are available in two models: a 15-foot wide 3 bedroom one (the dressed down version) and a 20-foot wide 4 bedroom one (the dressed up). Both units feature a ground floor with aflexible front facing space that could be a bedroom or office, a bathroom and a garage at the back with bedrooms on the third floor. The smaller units maximize space on the second floor with a fluid living, dining and kitchen area. From the East facing bay windows to the West facing patio, the light and the nine foot ceilings create an unexpected sense of airy spaciousness one would not anticipate in a 15-foot wide home. But the different spaces are delineated by a framed archway along the wall of the central dining area that offers a stylish transition into the kitchen on one side and living area on the other.
"We walk mayors and city planners through here regularly," explains Mr. Zago, who cites the many by-law challenges in introducing urban design in a suburban area, "and they can't believe it's only 15 feet wide."
Still, Mr. Zago relates that he had to work tirelessly to resolve issues such as density in a single family zone as well as regulations stipulating 2.2 parking units that were needed for each dwelling. This was partly solved by enlightened local plannershow? and by the building of public roads around the project - a considerable cost but one Mr. Zago clearly thinks was worth the price.
"Community building is always a goal at Mosaic," he contends, citing the firm's mantra of "thoughtful, urbane densification."
While it may be some time before Coquitlam becomes "urbane," it's certainly easy to imagine how pedestrian-friendly amenities may soon build up around the Tatton project. Many of the homes have been sold to buyers with home offices who don't commute into the city but plan to live and work locally.
"Just imagine," says Mr. Worden, gesturing to the empty lot across from the 13 newly built units, " in a year from now there'll be kids riding their bikes up and down this street and playing hockey."
Indeed the surrounding forest, creek and park playground would seem to make the site a potentially promising future neighbourhood.
Rather than that slow panic that starts to build when one stays too long in certain suburbs, there is a sense at Tatton that you might want to stay a while, chat with a neighbour on the stoop, before settling down in your calm, light filled living room. And if all goes according to Moasic's optimistic urbanist plan, residents may never have to experience rush hour again.

Listing agent: Michael O'Brien, Bosley Real Estate Ltd.
More buyers would have considered buying this 2½-storey Victorian if not for the misconception many had about the locals residing in the Moss Park community, agent Michael O'Brien says.
"If you're going to live right downtown, you're going to have to share downtown with all kinds of people ... but by and large, they're harmless," says Mr. O'Brien, who lived on that street for 25 years. "Now I live up in prime Cabbagetown and there's barely any difference."
For instance, a wide range of urban amenities are easily accessible, such as the Toronto Eaton Centre, Cabbage
town shops and theatres,
plus streetcar and subway lines.
Location aside, the townhouse has a desirable mix of modern features - including an updated furnace, wiring and air-conditioning system - and heritage details dating back to the 1870s.
"It was a remarkable house," the agent says. "It's in a row of three [houses], which are of solid brick construction, which is rare."
Original trims, mouldings and pine floors, as well as a three-fold dividing door between the living and dining rooms, and a wood-burning fireplace once used to make meals in the eat-in kitchen.
"In all the Victorian houses I've been in in Cabbagetown and downtown, I've only seen that once or twice," Mr. O'Brien says. "I don't think anyone would use it for cooking, but it's still usable as a fireplace."
A gas fireplace is featured in the family room, plus a walkout to a west-facing yard and a gated parking area off the rear lane.
On the second floor, there is a remodelled bathroom and two bedrooms.
The larger one contains a walk-in closet, while the other opens to an 11-by-12-foot deck.
The third bedroom is on the top level.
The lower level is finished with a den and a combined laundry area and bathroom.

Location: Georgetown, Ont.
Builder: Intracorp
Size: 2,000 to 4,615 square feet
Price: $850,000 to $1,205,000
Sales centre: Prince Street/ 20th Sideroad, one block west of 10th Line. Open Monday to Thursday from noon to 6 p.m.; weekends and holidays from noon to 5 p.m.
Contact: Phone (905) 873-6764 or visit www.themeadowsintheglen.ca
Just north of Georgetown in the village of Glen Williams, Intracorp acquired a 100-acre site with upper and lower meadows separated by a wooded area, and a golf course and Credit Valley along its perimeter.
Rather than level the land, the builder worked with Halton Region, the Town of Halton Hills, and Credit Valley Conservation Authority to integrate the project within the natural topography.
Called the Meadows in the Glen, the community of 91 period-style homes will be built following green and sustainable building practices, and designed to minimize disturbance to the landscape. Nearly half the site will be left as green space and preserved woods.
This move to create a low-impact development - the first of its kind in the Credit Valley Watershed - is just one factor that earned it the prestigious Community of the Year Award from the Building Industry and Land Development Association for the Greater Toronto Area (BILD) last year.
"It shows we've given thought not only to the build form, but to the development, environmental sustainability, and the design of the homes and the materials," says Intracorp president and CEO, Bruce Rudichuk. "Its Nirvana if you like suburban estate living."
Major green initiatives will include narrower streets, culverts and trenches, bioswales and permeable paver treatments that allow rainwater to drain away naturally.
Each home will also incorporate Energy Star features as standard, plus prefinished natural oak hardwood floors from sustainable forests, floor joists made from recycled wood and extensive landscaping with native species.
With over 30 per cent of the project sold, construction is underway on two-storey houses and bungalows, which will be ready for occupancy by spring 2011.
Lots average half an acre in size, but no two are the same. Nor will houses be oriented in the same fashion as some will border protected greenbelts, which is highly sought after in real estate.
"Each lot is individual in its size and design, whether it's a pie-shape, reverse pie-shape or key lot," says Mr. Rudichuk. "They're all unique."
Bungalows can be purchased with two or three-bedroom plans measuring 2,000 to 3,855 square feet (including optional lofts) for $850,000 to $1,115,000. Two-storey models with four or five-bedrooms range from 2,615 to 4,615 square feet and are priced from $895,000 to $1,205,000.
The largest design - the Barraclough Victorian Gothic Collection - was awarded Best New Home Design over 4,000 square feet by the BILD last year.
Taking cues from local residences, houses will showcase brick, stucco and stone exteriors with Georgian, French Normandy, Victorian, Tudor, Craftsman or Colonial characteristics.
All four sides will be outfitted with intricate masonry details, accent windows, turrets and sweeping rooflines with dormers and/or trimmed peaked gables, as well as porticos, verandas, balconies and port cochères.
"You don't get a bunch of homes all sitting in a row with garages facing the street," says Intracorp's vice-president of sales and marketing, Tony Whitaker.
Interiors will be more modern with ceramic, marble and granite finishes, plus 10 and nine-foot ceilings on the main and second floor respectively, and vaulted or coffered ceilings in select areas.
Other highlights will include one or two-sided gas fireplaces, two-storey great rooms, master en suites and eat-in kitchens with upgraded Paris Kitchens cabinetry, chef's desks and pantries.
As for local amenities, the site is south of the town's Main Street, close to Williams Mill Visual Arts Centre, restaurants and shops, plus schools with French immersion, parks and the Bruce Trail.
"It's a beautiful little hamlet," adds Mr. Rudichuk.
Neighbouring towns are easily accessible via the GO Train and highways 7, 407 and 401.

Full text:   Conversation about public buildings in Toronto has been timid or downright muzzled for too long
jmays@globeandmail.com
When will Toronto allow itself to have a good, old-fashioned fight about architecture? Judging from the current level of public architectural argument, the answer is never.
Well, almost never. Every so often, a citizens' group gets up in arms about something, usually a tall building proposed for a low-rise part of the city. These little explosions of displeasure generate heat, which is a good thing, but rarely raise the dialogue beyond the local issue at hand, and take us into a discussion about the larger questions of what kind of city we need and want.
Apart from these occasional outbursts and protests, controversy is thin on the ground in Toronto. Why?
One reason is a superstition widespread among local architects.
According to this opinion, members of the Ontario Association of Architects, the legally constituted body that oversees the province's architectural profession, are forbidden to criticize the work of their colleagues in public.
I find nothing in the statute or body of regulations governing the OAA that supports this view. The provincial statute under which the OAA functions does indeed proscribe "conduct or an act relevant to the practice of architecture that, having regard to all of the circumstances, would reasonably be regarded by members of the Association as disgraceful, dishonourable or unprofessional."
This is obviously a good general rule. But it's quite a stretch to assume (as too many architects apparently do) that this law muzzles well-reasoned public argument and criticism, which is essential for determining civic and creative goals in an open society and finding ways to achieve them. We certainly need to be hearing much more criticism of the city and the buildings in it from architects, and there's no basis in law, as far as I can tell, why we shouldn't.
Another reason, more subtle this time, is a certain reticence that seems to go deep, like a bad stain, in our urban fabric.
Occasionally, however, this self-serving mask of timidity falls away, with delightful results.
Some time ago, to take one example, there was a Toronto public forum at which Los Angeles architect Thom Mayne spoke about his first project in the city, called Graduate House, a student residence at the University of Toronto. At the end of Mr. Mayne's address, some local critics and designers were called upon to respond. Surely the most memorable remarks of the afternoon came from Toronto architect A.J. Diamond, who ripped into Graduate House in vivid terms.
Talking with architects and university academics after the event, I found that some thought Mr. Diamond "impolite," "rude," even "uncivil." He had been nothing of the sort. While I didn't agree with half the things he said, Mr. Diamond's unsparing commentary transformed what could have been an insincere love-in for Mr. Mayne - many observers at the time didn't like Graduate House, but were hesitant to speak out or had no arena in which to do so - into a contentious and altogether useful conversation about an important building. If that's incivility, then we need a lot more of it.
But we also need, even more, larger and more numerous public forums in which Toronto architecture's present state and future prospects can be thrashed out.
Here are my nominations of a few people who could make that happen.
Adam Vaughan, city councillor for Trinity-Spadina, is taking an informed interest in what's being built in Toronto; so is councillor Kyle Rae (Toronto Centre-Rosedale). It's time for these architecturally savvy politicians to press the city to open up new spaces for the conversation: Not new buildings - we've certainly got enough venues - but new opportunities for people to gather, talk and, if it comes to that, knock heads over recent and new construction.
Richard Sommer, the new dean of architecture at the University of Toronto, has a role to play in broadening and strengthening the university's engagement with its city. This could be done by sponsoring more frequent and more widely publicized intellectual rodeos meant to inspire controversy: public confrontations, for instance, between developers and architects, citizen activists and urban planners.
Finally, financier Gary Berman and other organizers of the annual Pug Awards should go beyond their after-school programs for students and launch a series of lively adult discussions aimed at educating the public about what's right and wrong with this city's architecture, which is, after all, what the Pug Awards are all about.
Toronto has nothing to fear from such critical discourse and confrontation, and a great deal to learn.

Full text:   THE MUSIC ROOM By William Fiennes Random House Canada, 216 pages, $ 29.95
****
An award-winning author with his first book, The Snow Geese , William Fiennes was privileged in a way few of us ever have been. His family estate was broad-moated medieval Broughton Castle in Oxfordshire, where visitors were shown "through the Great Hall, down the Long Gallery, into the King's Chamber, Council Chamber, Queen Anne's Room, Great Parlour and Chapel."
Its extensive grounds were the setting for guided tours, theatrical presentations, local fairs and film shoots (including Shakespeare in Love and The Scarlet Pimpernel ), and Fiennes conducts us to a shimmering, sensuous past that was Arcadian in its physical enchantment and the various fascinations it afforded William. Spiral staircases, battlements, secret rooms, medieval Spanish armour which his mother conditioned with WD40, various attics, the Great Hall where young William learned to ride a bicycle, the moat where he fished for pike, and areas with swifts, rooks and a majestic heron.
These were only some of the inquisitive boy's interests. There were gardeners, helpers in the kitchens, Father reading Trollope by the fireside, Mother sewing patches into old tweed jackets and refreshing the rush matting in the King's Chamber with a watering can, and scary moments, too, in the Groined Passage, as well as eerie ones in the Barracks, where soldiers had taken refuge during the Civil War.
There were also disruptions, fear and anguish caused by the Fiennes' eldest son Richard, brain-scarred by epilepsy, who would erupt violently, especially if his favourite football team, Leeds United, lost. Then there could be a fork to the father's throat, a scalding hot cast-iron frying pan pressed against the mother's cheek, a berserk smashing of windows with an iron pole. Richard, 11 years older than William, could be affectionate and loving, but his condition led to severe spasms, and even though it is related with restraint, the scene of him lying on the floor, arms stretched rigidly along his sides, his fists clenched and his whole body jerking as he gnashes on a cushion that his father holds between his teeth, is scary.
With exactitude of diction that makes lingering thoughts shine all the brighter, this is a memoir of subtle word music and even subtler patterning of consciousness about an extraordinary childhood challenged by a brother's major dysfunction. Its title fits because the music room is where a very young William Fiennes makes an important discovery about time and pitch as his mother conscientiously practises her viola, and because the last scene is of volatile Richard, Leeds bobble hat on head, pipe in hand, waiting to sing the anthem Lead Me, Lord on Christmas Day as his family watches, holding its breath.
The title is apt in another way, for the memoir is punctuated by sequences of potted medical history about epilepsy, the malady that caused Richard's acute, chronic and often violent distemper. These little sections could easily have become irritating interruptions or academic discourses, but they do not.
An alternative title could be In Custody, because the estate (an ancestral inheritance) "didn't just belong to us: it was part of the country's heritage, the world's, and our task was to care for it as long as we were here. ... 'We're stewards,' Dad told visitors," and every night was marked by the ritual of shutting down the house.
The custodial connotation is continued with the process of memory, including the history of epilepsy and its treatment, and culminating with the portrait of Richard. This memoir tries to take custodial charge of the past in a way that implicitly acknowledges Carl Jung's line: "The beloved dead are our task."
There are omissions, of course: one (brother Thomas, killed at 3 in an accident two years before William's birth) cannot be helped; others (twins Martin and Susannah, a year and a half younger than William) are careless absences. And Richard hardly ever comes into direct interaction with William, who is content to be alone, self-reliant, a passive but lyrical observer.
But what an observer! His evocation of a magic-castle childhood is as sharp as the dark furies of Richard's malady. And he turns his ill-fated brother into an unforgettable victim: first a teenager who can recite an entire poem by Hilaire Belloc though he otherwise seems locked into endless repetition of rude phrases, then a pipe-smoking man-child with a mustache who is unaware of his physical strength, incapable of controlling his irrational urges, wildly aggressive and then either blankly forgetful or terribly remorseful. He could be excited by the sight of a heron or vilely abusive when in a black mood. He can fell trees, use tools and handle boats, but he is an exhausting concern to his parents. (There is a memorable scene of his father leaning alone on a buttress, saying, "I'm asking the house for some of its strength.") Often, Richard is a pitiably lost poet with startling turns of phrase: a small dog "painted my face with kisses"; a female psychologist is "like red roses, shining in a way"; clouds look like footprints in snow." His horrible affliction is "a fizziness ... a clinging on one side ... as if the ground was all sliding on top, I'm shaking to pieces."
William sometimes deliberately puts himself at physical risk by going against his elder brother's warnings, but he also learns as a young man that he has the sort of self-determination and liberation that is denied his unfortunate brother, who is "moated in" to childhood forever. When Richard dies at 41 after a nocturnal seizure, his mother repeats the words: "We are rich in what we have lost." There is a pun, of course, in "rich," a diminutive of "Richard." Grief is a burden but what has been lost physically or emotionally is what her younger writer-son redeems by his clear, bright words that are the real power and glory of this memoir.
Keith Garebian 17th book will be published next April.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/how-climb-out-hole-this-big-2-775-000-red/docview/382608512/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: This new-found pragmatism stems from the rot in the B.C. economy, the deadwood underpinnings that were easily obscured during the province's prolonged expansion. The hard reversal in B.C.'s fortunes is severe and, in some of the worst ways, its woes resemble those of the United States. It's suffering from the after effects of an expansion that was too reliant on a hot real estate market and consumer spending and characterized by soaring imports and weak exports.

Full text:   For most of this decade, British Columbia's economy outpaced the rest of Canada's. But the reversal of fortunes in the province has been severe. The unsettling truth: many of its economic woes resemble those of the U.S. - too much reliance on real estate and construction jobs, not enough strength in exports. But as the province suffers a comedown, there are a few hopeful signs of a new economy taking root - and a serious debate about how to move beyond boom-and-bust cycles
debner@globeandmailcom
Colin Hansen's shoes tell the tale.
All through last autumn, as the global financial system teetered on the precipice of implosion, as the United States sunk deeper in to recession, British Columbia's Finance Minister insisted the province would be able to shake off the anvil taking everyone else down.
Such blithe - and baseless - optimism is now gone. Mr. Hansen, who delivered the province's second budget this week for fiscal 2009-10, chose to wear his oldest pair of black brogues, in the tradition of Canadian finance ministers using footwear to relate the story of their budgets.
It is a stark contrast to the boom years earlier this decade, when incomes, employment and economic output in Canada's westernmost province outpaced the rest of country. In 2005, Mr. Hansen wore a pair of running shoes, a symbol of the province's momentum. The next year, new finance minister Carole Taylor wore a posh pair of Gucci pumps.
B.C. is in trouble. Like elsewhere else, the government deficit has exploded, from $495-million budgeted in February to nearly $3-billion now. Mr. Hansen's sunny disposition has vanished and, while B.C. is expected to recover from recession, the minister was frank that maintaining that growth could be tenuous - a fall back into recession is a "distinct possibility."
This new-found pragmatism stems from the rot in the B.C. economy, the deadwood underpinnings that were easily obscured during the province's prolonged expansion. The hard reversal in B.C.'s fortunes is severe and, in some of the worst ways, its woes resemble those of the United States. It's suffering from the after effects of an expansion that was too reliant on a hot real estate market and consumer spending and characterized by soaring imports and weak exports. Last year, B.C. imported $24-billion more in goods and services from other provinces and countries than it sold to them, the province's biggest-ever trade deficit.
As with the U.S., British Columbia is grappling with soaring numbers of unemployed. B.C. has lost 67,000 jobs since August, 2008 - nearly 2½ times the number lost in Alberta. At its peak, fully 10 per cent of the provincial work force was employed in construction - a proportion that's "off the charts," said economist Douglas Porter at BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc.
The recession brought with it plunging revenue from forestry, natural gas, and personal and corporate income taxes, leaving a $2-billion gouge in the provincial treasury and necessitating Mr. Hansen's red-ink revision this week. "The main theme is fiscal austerity," said Jock Finlayson, executive vice-president of the Business Council of British Columbia. "It'll characterize the next three or four years. We're not going to see a dramatic, sudden turnaround."
Beyond the trade deficit, other key economic fundamentals - from exports to productivity and business investment - do not bode well. The 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and Whistler offer a glimmer of good times, but B.C. is an economy in transition with no clear direction on where it's going to go.
Still, as the province suffers a comedown from an economic high, there are distinct stirrings of the future, a curious blend of old and new - and a serious debate about where it should focus its efforts to move beyond the boom-and-bust cycles of forestry, natural gas and real estate. Most of all, the province desperately wants to avoid a repeat of the 1990s, which is widely remembered as a lost decade for B.C. as the rest of the world boomed.
Life after forestry
Even before the recession, B.C. business leaders were worried. The Business Council of B.C., a pan-industry group, organized a series called Outlook 2020 comprised of four meetings this year and 29 policy papers, all trying to imagine how and where an economy rooted in forestry goes in the 21st century.
For David Emerson, the former federal minister of trade and industry who has also managed forestry company Canfor Corp. and the Vancouver International Airport, the future of B.C.'s economy depends on stronger exports.
The province has to see itself as the bridge between Asia and the U.S., Mr. Emerson said. In Asia, B.C. has to forget about waiting for Ottawa to forge closer ties and make the move itself - more aggressively flogging its resources there, which it has slowly begun to do. And Mr. Emerson wants B.C. to recognize post-secondary certifications from Asia and push for a far greater exchange of professors and scientists, for research and technology partnerships - all with the aim of building stronger trade links.
"You need to cross the cultural divide to stoke trade," Mr. Emerson said. "We ought to be creaming it in Asia and we're really not."
B.C. is not an export power, a fact that belies the province's geography as an obvious gateway to Asia. Politicians certainly like to market the province as an export hub, given the strength of the local Asian community and the size of the Port Metro Vancouver.
But trade as a percentage of the B.C. economy is, in fact, significantly smaller than the rest of Canada, where trade titans such as Alberta and Ontario dominate, according to an Outlook 2020 study by the University of Victoria and led by business professor Jen Baggs. Just 17 per cent of the B.C. economy is merchandise exports, barely half that of Canada (30 per cent) and Ontario (32 per cent) and far behind Alberta (38 per cent). In dollar terms, B.C. exports just $8,000 per citizen, province statistics indicate, less than three-quarters of the Canadian level of $11,300.
Mr. Emerson, like others in the province, sees some of B.C.'s future in the past. B.C. grew as a resources economy and the province's businesses have the opportunity to create technology with resources, much like Finland has done with forestry.
"There's almost unlimited scope to spin technology off our resource base," Mr. Emerson said.
Jonathan Rhone is among a vanguard of executives trying to do exactly that.
New technologies
When he graduated from University of British Columbia in the mid-1980s, with an undergraduate degree in environmental studies, B.C.'s economy was one dominated by forestry, a business essentially unchanged for decades: Cut down trees, put them through a mill, sell the wood to the U.S.
His father was not impressed when Mr. Rhone lost interest in going to law school and demanded the young man get a "real job." So, he packed off for Calgary and found work in the oil business.
Mr. Rhone returned in the early 1990s, and in 2003 co-founded Nexterra Systems Corp., one of 100 or so technology-intensive small firms in the Vancouver region. Together generating about $1-billion in annual revenue, it is the core of a burgeoning clean-power cluster of companies.
Nexterra designs small-scale biomass facilities to generate heat and electricity for customers such as universities. Its technology led to a $30-million partnership this year with General Electric Co. to build an advanced gasification system. The company's systems are built at foundries in smaller centres in the province, places like Kamloops, Kelowna, and 100 Mile House, whose fortunes have for years have ebbed and flowed on forestry.
Fed with wood, the technology uses air, steam and oxygen to convert the fuel, at 900C, into a synthetic gas, which can then be used to produce heat or steam. Working with GE, Nexterra wants to advance the system so that it can be used to power turbines in existing infrastructure that generate electricity. The numbers are still small but the gains have been rapid: Nexterra's revenue has surged to $20-million from less than $1-million two years ago.
The company's first customer was Tolko Industries Ltd., a forestry company that uses the technology on a mill near Kamloops to replace natural gas. But the big opportunity is in exports; Nexterra has made sales of its systems to the University of South Carolina and to Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the largest energy research lab in the United States.
The promise of B.C. as a clean-energy capital is Mr. Rhone's vision for the province's economic future, the envisaged blend of resources and technology. He pictures the sector - which also includes firms like Westport Innovations Inc., which designs technology so diesel engines can run on natural gas, and upstart electricity generators such as Plutonic Power Corp. - as a $5-billion industry within a decade and a crucial part of the province's economy.
"I'd like B.C. to really double down on this sector. If this is truly one of the fastest-growing markets in the world, are we going to be sellers - or are we just going to be buyers?" Mr. Rhone said. He's convinced that the combination of the current small cluster of companies in the business, as well as Vancouver's attributes as a beautiful place to live and the province's natural resources, can be combined to make B.C. a winner in an industry on which other jurisdictions around the world have pinned big hopes.
The Liberal government of Gordon Campbell has made some of the right moves to encourage the development of such emerging businesses. It has slashed taxes businesses pay, as well as personal income taxes. It has simplified a tangle of provincial regulations. The province is the first jurisdiction in Canada to enact a carbon tax. Putting a price on fossil fuels is considered a cornerstone of building a clean-energy economy. And it has set up a $25-million fund specifically for clean energy.
But the dollars are a fraction of what's being spent elsewhere, especially in recession-fighting stimulus packages. According to consultancy New Energy Finance, Canada is pumping $800-million in to clean energy as part of its $40-billion stimulus injection. But U.S. programs aimed at clean energy dwarf Canada's.
Still, several well-known B.C. entrepreneurs have been lured away from traditional industries toward clean energy. One is Ross Beaty, chairman of Pan American Silver Corp., one of the world's top silver producers. Mr. Beaty's day job is chief executive officer of Magma Energy Corp., which had a $110-million initial public offering this summer and wants to become a major geothermal power company.
Don McInnes is another. He was once a mining financier. Today, he is CEO of Plutonic Power, which is building a $660-million power project north of Vancouver with GE. The project uses run-of-river technology, which takes part of the flow of a river into a pipe and runs the water through a turbine to generate power. While controversial in B.C., the Liberal government is staunchly behind such efforts and Plutonic-GE have proposed a much larger $4-billion project
First steps
Attracting companies such as GE to work in B.C. is seen by economists and business leaders as an important step to rebuilding the provincial economy. Mr. McInnes sees B.C.'s abundance of hydro power - and the potential to greatly expand it - as another major strength if exploited, particularly for rural areas of the province.
But there's also the potential - though contentious in B.C. - for power exports, which Mr. McInnes sees as a win for the province, as do some environmentalists like climate scientist Andrew Weaver at the University of Victoria.
Mr. McInnes looks south to Google Inc. in California and its massive appetite for electricity to power the servers that make its online products work. In Kelowna, a local company called RackForce, in a partnership with IBM, has opened part of a large data centre. Competing regions such as Oregon also rely on cheap hydro energy to attract server farms used by Google and others.
"Google has come from nowhere and now Google as a company consumes [the equivalent of] a third of the electricity [used by] of all of British Columbia," Mr. McInnes said. "We have a tremendous opportunity to build on clean energy. It's not just generation of clean electricity. Who wants to consume it - and let's bring them here."
All of this talk about building a new economic base is motivated by a desire to tame the wild ebbs and flows, that have long characterized a resources-based economy.
"I don't think I've ever been to a government meeting where someone doesn't say, 'We have to diversify the economy, we're too vulnerable to resources,'" said Jim Brander, a business professor and international trade specialist at University of British Columbia.
But that doesn't mean it's a universally held view. Instead of running away from historical and current strengths, Mr. Finlayson at the Business Council of B.C. argues resources should remain the primary focus. "If you ask the questions: What do we produce that the world wants to buy? What are we good at? Where do we have competitive advantage? The answer, overwhelmingly, is resources, resource-based goods, and technology connected with that."
Today's troubles in B.C., beyond the battering the economy has taken because of the global recession, are the result of growing pains, according to people like Daniel Muzyka, business dean at UBC. The province is in transition. It's no longer a resources-only economy. But isn't yet something more.
Still, there are modest signs of a new economy taking root. Nexterra may be one. Another is a move by Walt Disney Co.'s Pixar unit, the computer animation pioneer set to open its first studio outside of California in Vancouver's Yaletown neighbourhood. To the south, in Richmond, Microsoft Corp. two years ago opened a software development centre, one that the local political and business leaders hope sparks a spinoff of smaller upstart firms.
"Getting Disney here was terrific. We have to do more of that," Mr. Muzyka said. "But the next five to 10 years are going to be bumpy."

Six companies building B.C.'s economic future
Nexterra Systems Corp.
Industry: Biomass
The six-year-old Vancouver company has seen annual revenue jump to $20-million from less than $1-million in just two years. Nexterra designs biomass systems that generate heat and steam - and soon, electricity - and the company has a $30-million development partnership with General Electric Co.
Copper Mountain Mining Corp.
Industry: Mining
Headed by veteran miner Jim O'Rourke, the company is reopening and expanding a dormant copper mine about 300 kilometres east of Vancouver. The $400-million development, set to open in 2011, will be the second-biggest copper operation in B.C. and third largest in Canada.
EnCana Corp.
Industry: Natural gas
Canada's No. 1 gas and oil producer is headquartered in Calgary but is the largest private sector capital spender in B.C., as it pours money into the province's remote and rugged northeast. Several huge gas
deposits, including Horn River, were discovered by EnCana
earlier this decade.
West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd.
Industry: Forestry
Even though forestry has been crushed by the housing crash in the United States, and swaths of the province's forests have been decimated by the pine beetle, B.C. has some of the world's best sawmills. West Fraser, the leader, forecasts a strong future when recovery finally emerges.
Pixar
Industry: Film animation
The Walt Disney Co.-owned computer animation pioneer, maker of this summer's hit Up , will soon open its first studio outside California in a Vancouver's creative cluster called Yaletown, a neighbourhood full of old brick buildings that once housed light industrial enterprises. Pixar was drawn by a tax break, local talent and proximity to headquarters.
Microsoft Canada Co.
Industry: Software
The world's dominant software maker has development centres in many countries and two years ago opened one in the Vancouver suburb of Richmond. Par Singh, the centre's managing director, sees the hundreds of employees as a spark for the region's tech future: "If I look at an analogy of a mall, I want us to be an anchor tenant."

B.C. SNAPSHOTS
MERCHANDISE EXPORTS
While B.C. sits on the Pacific Ocean, the province itself is not a heavyweight exporter. It ranks far behind provincial rivals and, Canada as a whole, in merchandise exports as a share of 2008 gross domestic product:
B.C.: 17 per cent
Alberta: 38 per cent
Ontario: 32 per cent
Quebec: 24 per cent
Canada: 30 per cent
PRODUCTIVITY
B.C. labour productivity growth, measured by real GDP per hour worked, has grown slowly in the past two decades. It is a tricky measure of the economy, in terms of how to boost it, but it is an important sign of a society's ability to create wealth:
B.C.: 0.7 per cent
Canada: 1.3 per cent
SMALL BUSINESSES
About half the jobs in B.C. are at small businesses, and small businesses contribute a higher percentage to the GDP than anywhere else in Canada. While the entrepreneurial nature of the economy is good, small businesses tend to have less capital spending than large enterprises.
B.C.: 26 per cent
Alberta: 20 per cent
Ontario: 21 per cent
Quebec: 24 per cent
Canada: 22 per cent
NEW GEAR
A driver of productivity is money spent on new machinery and equipment to get more, better work, done faster. This type of spending is often undertaken by large companies on new factories, for example. B.C. ranks behind Canada in terms of such investments as a percentage of GDP.
B.C.: 6.2 per cent
Canada: 7.3 per cent

Abstract: Skip ahead lots of years. [Parker Harrison] has been paroled to a place called Whisper Ridge, a spectacular estate where a woman named Alexandra Sanabria ran a unique program to rehabilitate paroled killers. But Whisper Ridge never really got going because Sanabria and her husband disappeared one night. Twelve years later, Harrison wants [Lincoln Perry] to find out what happened.

Full text:   ALL THE DEAD VOICES
By Declan Hughes, Morrow, 311 pages, $30.50
Fans of the classic hardboiled mystery are a difficult group to satisfy. The style is often copied, but seldom do writers actually manage to combine great character-driven novels with iconic prose styling, terrific dialogue and a stellar sense of place.
Dubliner Declan Hughes delivers all that and more; this series is Raymond Chandler updated and polished to hardboiled perfection. Ed Loy once lived in L.A., but he's returned to his Irish roots. His Dublin is the city of the Celtic dream, with former IRA thugs transformed into pseudo-English gentry, where skinny new mothers huddle outside the maternity hospital sucking on cigarettes, while across town, thin rich wives head up charity drives and their husbands field race horses and ride the property-development roller-coaster.
Ed Loy, kitted out in his handmade linen suits, cashmere coats, Dax lace-ups, French cuffs and sterling links, is literally tailor-made to be the investigator of the hour, at £1,000 a day. He has two cases going. The first is to find the killer of a local soccer star, the brother of an old friend. The boy may have been a drug peddler or worse, but he died on Loy's watch, and Loy considers himself responsible to the family.
Then there's sexy little Anne Fogarty, whose father was murdered 15 years earlier, supposedly by her mother's lover but, Anne claims, really by one of three once-powerful IRA leaders, two of whom are now equally powerful heads of crime families and the third a leader of Dublin society. Old politics and new money make very strange bedfellows in the New Ireland.
Hughes weaves all the history, background and conflict into clear, elegant prose. This isn't a wordy novel with lots of filler, food and bad sex. Every paragraph matters, and the dialogue snaps, as Loy drifts from high Irish to Dublin drawl with wit and charm. This is the fourth novel in this fabulous series, and I've loved them all. You will too.
SKELETON HILL
By Peter Lovesey, Soho Press, 336 pages, $24
Peter Lovesey has more than two dozen great mysteries to his credit, including the excellent Sergeant Cribb series, the Bertie series, featuring King Edward VII, and the Hen Mallin novels. Skeleton Hill , his 10th novel with Inspector Peter Diamond, is absolutely one of this best of the batch. Lovesey's combination of wit, deduction and great characters is on display in a cunning mystery that would make Agatha Christie envious.
Skeleton Hill, just outside Bath, was the location of a small but important battle in the English Civil War. As such, it's the place for a re-enactment of the event. The story begins as two corpses decide to drift off for a quiet beer. After all, it's summer, those Cavalier uniforms (exact copies of the originals) are heavy and hot. Rupert and Dave introduce themselves, and then head off to a copse where Dave has hidden a six-pack of lager. They dig up the treasure, discovering that thieves have taken most of it, and in the process uncover a bone. It appears to be human, but they decide it's old and they rebury it. From this innocent act, a crime is born.
Lovesey's history, and his plots, are always impeccable, so we enjoy the twists of both as Diamond investigates what appears to be a clear case of local vigilantism. In Bath? Heaven forbid! This is a lovely, lively story with marvellous characters and lots of local colour. If you haven't discovered Lovesey and Diamond, this is a perfect place to begin.
VENGEANCE ROAD
By Rick Mofina, Mira, 396 pages, $8.99
Canadian author Rick Mofina started his writing career as a crime reporter. That experience always shows in his novels featuring crime reporters. These pros really research a story and that dash of realism gives his novels real punch. Vengeance Road , another tale of murder and the hunt, is one of Mofina's best yet.
The setting is Buffalo, N.Y., where reporter Jack Gannon is marooned. A few years ago, he almost won a Pulitzer. But now he's just a cog to keep the Buffalo Sentinel from dying. There's talk of layoffs. Times are hard and getting desperate. So Gannon waits by the police scanner hoping for a big story, and his ticket to the big time. When a body is discovered in the local park, Gannon follows the clues, uncovers information about the victim and discovers that the major suspect is a Buffalo cop. The story is red hot - and then it implodes.
Mofina keeps his focus solidly on Gannon, which allows him to keep on the trail as the murder morphs into a kidnapping and another murder. There are both clues and a chase, and it all works beautifully. This is a snappy little weekend novel for those last limpid days at the lake.
THE SILENT HOUR
By Michael Koryta, St. Martin's, 304 pages, $27.95
This is Koryta's fourth novel and the latest instalment in the Lincoln Perry series, for which Koryta received an Edgar nomination. The Silent Hour is every bit as good as Envy the Night and maybe even better.
The story begins with a strange confession of murder. Or is it a confession? In any event, Parker Harrison admits to a crime, enters a plea, has no trial and is sentenced to life in prison with possibility of parole.
Skip ahead lots of years. Harrison has been paroled to a place called Whisper Ridge, a spectacular estate where a woman named Alexandra Sanabria ran a unique program to rehabilitate paroled killers. But Whisper Ridge never really got going because Sanabria and her husband disappeared one night. Twelve years later, Harrison wants Lincoln Perry to find out what happened. Perry distrusts Harrison, but wonders: If Harrison had anything to do with Sanabria's disappearance, why would he want it investigated? So Perry sets aside his misgivings. At least until the bones of Sanabria's husband turn up, buried at Whisper Ridge.
Koryta is definitely one of the best of the new generation of U.S. mystery writers. If you haven't already discovered Lincoln Perry, The Silent Hour is a great place to start.
SWAP
By John McFetridge, ECW, 304 pages, $24.95
If you're interested in learning about the backside of Toronto the Good, Swap is a great place to begin. Drugs, guns, gangs and just plain nastiness hide in the suburbs, just outside the shiny city centre. For Vernard Get, a Detroit homeboy in search of lucrative partnerships, Toronto's biker gangs are a perfect fit. They deliver the dope, he delivers the guns. Of course, he's a bit mystified by bikers who ignore their Harleys in order to drive SUVs, but who cares about appearances?
While Get is planning his get, Toronto detectives Price and McKeon have a pair of dead bodies on their hands. The couple are Mr. and Mrs. Clean, not so much as a traffic ticket. Someone sailed by and shot them as their car headed up a freeway ramp. Who knows what company these nice family folk may have been keeping?
McFetridge has his difficulties keeping the plot moving, and some of the dialogue owes a bit to Quentin Tarantino, but this is a slick little story.

THIS WEEK / HIGHLIGHTS

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/this-week-highlights/docview/382615159/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: HBO's first regular drama and most episodes in the series remain the TV equivalent of a punch in the gut. Set in the confines of the maximum-security unit of a New York state prison, the series drew glowing reviews for its stark storylines that likely discouraged many young viewers from pursuing a criminal career. Tonight's episode comes from the midway point of the show's first season.

FOOD
Eat, Shrink and Be Merry
Food, 7:30 p.m.
Who says that eating healthy has to consist of green salads and tofu? Fun-loving Janet and Greta Podleski, creators of the bestselling Crazy Plates and Looneyspoons cookbooks, put a healthy spin on mealtime favourites such as burgers and lasagna in this lively food series. Tonight, the sisters take part in a small-town community supper where greasy fried chicken is the annual tradition. Always up for a challenge, the pair take on a local caterer with their own faux fried version.
COMEDY
Howie Do It
Showcase, 8 p.m.
Toronto comic and Deal or No Deal host Howie Mandel lets his imagination run wild in this hidden-camera series. First shown on NBC last season, the show takes the same tack as the old Candid Camera show of the fifties: Set up a prank, haul in a sucker, then let hidden cameras record the fun. In tonight's pilot episode, a man in a bunny costume is sent off to deliver a singing telegram - at a funeral. Howie also gets involved by playing a TV director of a mouthwash commercial and a waiter who likes to stick his fingers in the customer's food. Who says the golden age of comedy is dead?
DRAMA
Medium
CBS, CTV, 9 p.m.
Oscar-winner Anjelica Huston ( Prizzi's Honor ) returns to her role of no-nonsense private investigator Cynthia Keener in this chilling episode from last season. In the storyline, soccer-mom-psychic Allison (Patricia Arquette) seeks out the crusty detective when she begins having dreams that a kidnapping victim who Keener once rescued may be connected to the disappearance of a real-estate mogul's wife.
MOVIE
Take Me Home:
The John Denver Story
CMT, 10 p.m.
First broadcast on CBS in 1999, this TV-movie features a standout performance by Chad Lowe as the late folk-rock superstar. The film traces Denver's rocky relationship with his Air Force pilot father (Gerald McRaney) and his early struggles in the music industry. The story also depicts Denver's love for his first wife Annie (Kristin Davis of Sex and the City ), the inspiration of his single Annie's Song , and chronicles his battles with depression and alcohol in the eighties.

SATURDAY
SEPTEMBER 5
DOCUMENTARY
Lost Adventures
of Childhood
CTV, 7 p.m.
One of last season's best Canadian documentaries, this film from Scott Harper confirms the theory that putting children into regimented lockdown is adversely affecting the way kids learn and grow. Today's parents are overtaxing their offspring with far too many activities, whereas generations before were allowed to roam free-range. The stats make one wince: 41 per cent of U.S. kids claim to be stressed all the time; 70 per cent quit their designated sport by age 13, citing "burnout."
REALITY
Jon & Kate Plus 8
TLC, 8 p.m.
The very public lives of Jon and Kate Gosselin continue to fill the tabloids. The TV series that made the Gosselins famous is still running, and the current season was filmed right after the celebu-couple separated last spring. What with eight kids, they split the visiting duties: Kate takes the boys to a dude ranch and dresses them up in little cowboy boots and hats; Jon stays home with the girls for a princess dress-up followed by a scavenger hunt.
MOVIE
World Trade Center
CBC, 10 p.m.
Some critics felt it premature for Oliver Stone to release this film just five years after the events of Sept. 11, 2001, but the director of Platoon and Wall Street has always gone his own way. Stone frames his depiction of that horrible day on the true-life experience of two Port Authority policemen, played by Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena, who went into the World Trade Center following the collapse of the twin towers. Stone switches perspective between the rescuers and their anxious families, with scenes of the occasional survivor being pulled from the rubble.
COMEDY
Saturday Night Live
NBC, Global, 11:30 p.m.
A solid comic performance from film star Anne Hathaway made this one of SNL 's better outings last season. Broadcast before last fall's U.S. presidential election, the show opens with ex- SNL er Tina Fey reprising her portrayal of Sarah Palin. Even funnier is the sketch with Hathaway playing a slightly twisted Mary Poppins.

SUNDAY
SEPTEMBER 6
DOCUMENTARY
Martin Clunes:
A Man and his Dogs
TVO, 7 p.m.
British thespian Martin Clunes - best known for Doc Martin - displays his lifelong love of all things canine in this documentary. Clunes travels to Australia, Africa and the U.S. in search of the ancestors of his own pooches.
MOVIE
The Girl in the Café
TVO, 9 p.m.
The craggy film actor Bill Nighy delivers a masterful performance in this TV-movie first shown in 2005. The star of such films as Love Actually and Still Crazy plays Lawrence, a lonely middle-aged bureaucrat of high rank who happens to meet a much younger woman named Gina (Kelly Macdonald) in a cafe. Instantly smitten, Lawrence then makes the unwise decision to invite Gina to accompany him to the G8 Summit in Reykjavik, where she makes her own political leanings felt in no uncertain terms.
SCIENCE
Mythbusters
Discovery, 10 p.m.
Skip past the repeats for this new episode of the true-or-false reality series hosted by Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage. Tonight's new episode finds the hirsute handymen looking at urban myths regarding prison escapes and jailbreaks. In this show, the science team test the likelihood of cutting through steel cell bars with dental floss and reopen the oft-repeated yarn about a prisoner who put his ball and chain in the prison cannon and fired himself to freedom. A story like that just has to be true, right?
DESIGN
My Big Amazing Renovation
HGTV, 10:30 p.m.
A pleasant alternative in the home-makeover genre, this series focuses on renovations of extreme scope. Tonight's episode focuses on a quaint waterfront home near Miami. Owners John and Alison bought the modest thirties-era domicile to accommodate their growing family, but now they want to make some changes. Their lofty plans include a luxury master suite, overhauling the kitchen and adding a new swimming pool and doc - and money seems to be no object. Let the reno games begin.

MONDAY
SEPTEMBER 7
BIOGRAPHY
Chuck Jones:
Memories of Childhood
TCM, 7:30 p.m.
This short and sweet documentary celebrates the accomplishments of animator Chuck Jones. Most famed for his contribution to Warner Bros. cartoons and his creation of the animated holiday special How the Grinch Stole Christmas , Jones took his creative muse from his own upbringing in Spokane, Wash., and Los Angeles. The program includes one of the last filmed interviews with Jones, who reveals the inspiration behind such animated characters as Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck.
COMEDY
How I Met Your Mother
CBS, 8 p.m.
Some people swear this is the funniest show on network television; others have never seen it. Those in the latter group might want to sample the sitcom about a group of aimless twentysomethings looking for love in all the wrong places. In the first of tonight's two episodes, the hapless single dude Ted (Josh Radnor) gets dizzy for a girl he just met, prompting his more cynical pals Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) and Marshall (Jason Segel) to teach him a cruel lesson via text message. In the second episode, Ted runs into an old flame and tells his future kids (the entire show is a flashback of sorts) about the importance of being in the right place at the right time.
HISTORY
History Detectives
PBS, 9 p.m.
Still airing new episodes, this PBS series has steadily improved over the summer and now rivals the Antiques Roadshow in terms of unique finds and curios. In this evening's first segment, art appraiser Elyse Luray examines a piece of abutment believed to have come from a famed Civil War-era bridge. Next, expert Gwendolyn Wright looks at a penny stamp connected to a landmark civil-rights case from the thirties. And lastly, sociology professor Tukufu Zuberi considers a set of metal sheets that appear to be the printing plates for jazz great Duke Ellington's classic song Take the 'A' Train.
DRAMA
CSI: Miami
CBS, CTV, 10 p.m.
This show might not be the strongest entry in the CSI franchise, but it sure has staying power. Tonight, humourless CSI boss Horatio (David Caruso) leads his team through the grim investigation of a man who was boiled alive. Simultaneously, Horatio has to deal with the emotional unravelling of his erratic ex-wife Julia (Elizabeth Berkley).
******
TUESDAY
SEPTEMBER 8
FOOD
Everyday Exotic
Food Network, 7:30 p.m.
Roger Mooking brings considerable life experience to this popular cooking series. A former musician and a third-generation restaurateur, Mooking took his formal culinary training at George Brown College and later ran the EPIC dining room at Toronto's Royal York Hotel. And unlike Michelin-ranked chef Gordon Ramsay, he's not a beast. Tonight, Chef Mooking prepares lemongrass snapper in yellow tomato sauce, accompanied by broccoli with crispy garlic and mini potatoes dressed in homemade ginger butter. Here's to the good life.
HISTORY
Cities of the Underworld
History, 8 p.m.
The eclectic history series begins its third season tonight, with Don Wildman returning as host. In the season opener, Wildman travels to the gambling mecca of Las Vegas, where he forgoes the blackjack tables in order to descend hundreds of feet under the pavement. Unbeknownst to gamblers and tourists, many casinos have located their surveillance and security operations underground. And from days of Vegas past, there's an endless labyrinth of tunnels dating back to Prohibition.
DRAMA
The Cleaner
A & E, 10 p.m.
The basic premise of this A & E original drama has worn a little thin in the second season - how many ways can "extreme interventionist" William Banks (Benjamin Bratt) deliver the same speech on sobriety? - but the show is still worth watching for the strong performances from its supporting players. Former Battlestar Galactica regular Grace Park, in particular, is most interesting as Banks's teammate, Akani. In tonight's new episode, a former client seeks out the Cleaner's expertise to save his drug-addicted girlfriend.
DRAMA
Oz
HBO Canada, 11 p.m.
Running from 1997 to 2003, Oz was HBO's first regular drama and most episodes in the series remain the TV equivalent of a punch in the gut. Set in the confines of the maximum-security unit of a New York state prison, the series drew glowing reviews for its stark storylines that likely discouraged many young viewers from pursuing a criminal career. Tonight's episode comes from the midway point of the show's first season. Enterprising inmates O'Reilly and Adebisi take advantage of their cafeteria positions to slowly kill the mob boss running the prison drug trade.
******
WEDNESDAY
SEPTEMBER 9
DESIGN
Stager Invasion
TLC, 7:30 p.m.
Since launching last June, this home-makeover series has become a sturdy ratings performer for TLC. Hosted by home stager Lisa Lynch, the series is no-frills TV personified: Find a slow-moving home, dress it up and watch buyers get in line. Lisa and her home-staging team are handed a near-insurmountable mission in tonight's new episode: The owner of a home in a buyer-friendly area is on the brink of foreclosure. The problem: For some reason, the owner applied a jungle theme to the house years before, which has prospective buyers running away.
REALITY
Pitchmen
Discovery, 8 p.m.
Watching this show has become an eerie experience. Filmed earlier this year, the docudrama-style series followed the efforts of TV pitchmen Anthony (Sully) Sullivan and Billy Mays to find new and exciting products to foist upon consumers in late-night infomercials. Mays died last June, presumably from a cocaine overdose, which casts a pall over the series. In any case, tonight the pitchmen meet with the European-born inventor of the Dual Saw - a regular circular saw that cuts in both directions at the same time - but they see more potential in the cleaning product called Shuffles, which is little more than fluffy slippers that double as dust mops. Operators are standing by.
DRAMA
Glee
Fox, Global, 9 p.m.
The next High School Musical has finally landed. Fox debuted Glee with a one-hour pilot last spring and has held off launching the series until tonight. The first show established the primary players: Ex-broadway star Matthew Morrison takes the central role of high-school teacher Mr. Schuester, who makes it a personal mission to resurrect McKinley High's foundering Glee Club. The singers are, of course, a cross-section of American youth - the jock, the cheerleader, the punk rocker et al. In the second episode, the Glee Club performs for the first time - to a mixed response. Expect an extended run for Glee .
DRAMA
Melrose Place
Global, 10 p.m.
There's more kitsch than class in this update of the popular nineties soap, but will viewers even notice? As on the first version, the story focuses on the complex professional and personal lives of an attractive group of twentysomethings in an L.A. apartment complex. In supposed homage, the complex is managed by Melrose original character Sydney Andrews (Laura Leighton). The remainder of the cast look like they came from the casting call for a Gap commercial. Also in keeping with the original, the first episode of the new show opens with a bloody body found floating in the building's pool. Some shows never change.
******
THURSDAY
SEPTEMBER 10
MOVIE
Some Girls
CHCH, 7 p.m.
Nearly two decades before Patrick Dempsey became famous as Dr. McDreamy on Grey's Anatomy , he was your typical male movie heartthrob. Dempsey and Jennifer Connelly are the reasons to watch this 1988 romance flick, plus there's a Canadian connection. Dempsey is in fine, randy form as Michael, a college student who agrees to visit girlfriend Gabriella (Connelly) and her family in Quebec during Christmas. Once there, he's beset by quirky Canucks: Gabriella's father is a writer who wanders around the house in the nude; her grandmother believes Michael is her dead husband and so forth. And the worst news: Gabriella wants to break up. Not the best teen romance, but Dempsey shows early promise (and more than a little of his posterior).
DRAMA
The Vampire Diaries
CTV, 8 p.m.
Launching tonight, this series from The CW, based on the novels by L.J. Smith, will likely find its audience among the same kids who made the movie Twilight one of last year's biggest hits. The pilot opens with the focal character Elena (Nina Dobrev) starting her first day at high school following the death of her parents. In between algebra and gym class, Elena meets the brooding new kid Stefan (Paul Wesley) and makes an immediate connection. What Elena does not know is that Stefan is a vampire who is fighting the urge to drink her blood. As they grow closer, Stefan's nasty brother Damon (Ian Somerhalder) arrives with plans to claim Elena for himself.
DOCUMENTARY
Rise Up: Canadian Pop Music in the Eighties
CBC, 9 p.m.
Where were you in '82? If you were into or part of the Canadian music scene, odds are you had big hair, bigger shoulder pads and knew all the words to The Safety Dance . The second part of CBC's documentary opus covers the era when the music changed dramatically: CDs replaced audio cassettes and synthesized digital music became the order of the day. More importantly, the eighties brought the arrival of the art form known as the music video, which begat the creation of MTV and MuchMusic.
DRAMA
90210
Global, 10 p.m.
OMG. The kids of 90210 are back for a second year. The first campaign of The CW's 90210 remake went largely unnoticed by most; if anything, the show was eclipsed by catty Internet gossip and tabloid reports about Canadian cast member Shenae Grimes. Expect more of the same this fall. In tonight's season opener, Naomi (AnnaLynne McCord) and Silver (Jessica Stroup) meet the son of a famous movie star, and an errant text message sours a relationship for Dixon (Tristan Wilds). Curiously, Grimes appears to have fallen out of the storyline altogether.
