Full text: There has been much discussion about the need for housing supply and increased density in Vancouver. But what that means for the environment has been given short shrift, say those in the housing industry who are concerned about the sustainability of massive redevelopment.
It matters because buildings and their construction are responsible for nearly one-third of total global energy consumption, according to the International Energy Agency.
“Metro Vancouver and Greater Victoria are experiencing an unprecedented explosion in residential home demolitions,” says Glyn Lewis, “and the process to achieve urban density is proving to be unbelievably wasteful.”
The 38-year-old entrepreneur and his company, Renewal Home Development, aim to save existing houses, repurpose and retrofit them to be energy efficient and give them a contemporary facelift.
Mr. Lewis says he is all for more density. He just doesn’t like the wastefulness of getting there.
“This year alone, 2,800 singlefamily homes across Metro Vancouver will end up in local landfills. As a result, over 250,000 old and new growth trees embodied in these homes will be thrown away in the next 12 months,” says Mr. Lewis. “With all the pressures for urban density, this wastefulness will only get worse.”
“We are going through a grand demolition across Metro Vancouver and Greater Victoria and that’s happening because all levels of government are promoting urban densification, because we are trying to address the housing shortage crisis, and to build complete communities, and trying to invest in mass transportation,” he says.
“I agree with the ultimate objective of urban densification.
Having single-family homes a block away from a SkyTrain station makes no sense. But the process to achieve that densification is so wasteful. The conversation needs to happen at all levels of government … to figure out how we divert homes from landfills.”
The first step toward a solution, Mr. Lewis says, should be to relocate good homes, the second to incentivize deconstruction. He cites another young company, Unbuilders, which deconstructs houses in Metro Vancouver so next to nothing goes to the landfill. The company also sells reclaimed wood, much of it old growth timber.
Michael Geller, planner, adjunct professor, former architect, real estate consultant and developer, said demolitions of perfectly fine houses are the result of rezonings, which increase land values. He has developer clients in the Cambie area who’ve benefited. But instead of knocking everything down, there is another option, he says, which is to incentivize infill around the existing homes.
“We used to say the most sustainable building is the existing building,” Mr. Geller says. “But now what’s happening is they are knocking down these relatively new houses and they might be five years old. But they’re knocked down because the land values are so high. It just seems such a waste.”
In Cambie corridor, the houses will continue to come down. To move them, Mr. Lewis and others need help from municipalities to allow access to barge sites and from the utility companies that oversee trolley and power lines.
Mr. Lewis’s current project is to move three large homes from the Cambie Corridor area to properties on a waterfront location. He says he is working with an investor partner who will help purchase the properties outside the Lower Mainland. He’s also partnered with Nickel Bros., the structural moving and heavy transport company that will move the homes.
Last year, he repurposed and updated a home moved to Gibsons, the coastal community accessible only by ferry, which was then retrofitted with solar panels, an electric-vehicle hookup and rainwater catchment. That home sold last fall for around $1.2million.
Mr. Lewis’s ultimate goal is to master plan a community of salvaged houses on the Sunshine Coast or Powell River.
But moving houses is an expensive business. In an urban area, there are charges for moving power lines and trolley lines that are in the way. For his Cambie project, it means it’s more efficient to move all three houses at the same time. The houses are so large they will have to be divided in half in order to be moved. The multimillion-dollar houses are on large lots at 650 and 690 West 29th Ave.
and 5235 Kersland Dr.
They are part of the mass rezoning of the Cambie area that allows for townhouses.
Jeremy Nickel of Nickel Bros.
says he and Mr. Lewis are hoping that government and other agencies involved in the process will help facilitate such moves, as some other jurisdictions in North America do. They would like the creation of designated move-out corridors that would allow easier barge access. Trees and branches would be cleared ahead of time and trolley lines unclipped when the houses needed to pass through intersections, like an express lane for unwanted houses.
Mr. Nickel cites the example of Seattle, which helped him move a historic house through a jumble of trolley lines at one of that city’s busiest intersections so it could be barged to Shaw Island.
Nickel Bros. moves between 200 and 400 buildings a year, but another 8,000 buildings of all types were demolished last year in Metro Vancouver, says Mr. Nickel.
“We are the demo capital of the world,” says Mr. Nickel, a longtime conservationist.
“We are only going to save 5- or 8-per-cent of the buildings from being demolished. And even if we were able to save 5 per cent, there is still a huge percentage of homes that need to be deconstructed.
“I’m hopeful some of these young people [like Glyn] can take over the torch and carry on the fight I’ve been fighting for 30 or 40 years,” Mr. Nickel said.
Mr. Lewis is working with developer Jamie Vaughan on two of the houses. Mr. Vaughan has three projects under way in the Cambie Corridor, totalling 116 townhouses. Mr. Vaughan was biking on West 29th Avenue when he saw the row of assembled houses for sale. Knowing that the area had been prezoned for townhouse density, he ended up purchasing all six of the houses.
The house at 560 West 29th Ave.
was built 10 years ago and had sold for $6-million in 2017, according to Redfin brokerage data.
The other at 590 West 29th was built in the 1990s but had undergone a renovation. The large houses are due for demolition this summer. However, Mr. Vaughan, director of Sightline Properties, would like to save two of the houses, and so he’s working with Mr. Lewis to do so.
The developer previously tried to save another house on King Edward Avenue and relocate it to Vancouver Island, but the process fell apart.
“It’s tough when you see some of these nicer houses come down, but at the same time, the city is in desperate need of townhomes to fill the missing middle and the desire there, so we have gone down this path.”
Mr. Vaughan also has a sixstorey rental project under way at Dunbar and West 41st Avenue. He said it’s key to move trolley or utility lines on a schedule that works for everybody. It’s also tricky.
“It obviously isn’t done for a lot of reasons, and a big part of that is it’s tough to get people on board.
For a developer, timing is everything. If I want to move a house on 29th and it takes me an extra month or six weeks to do it, it becomes really unfeasible, because I have deadlines and obligations to the bank. That six weeks can cost a developer a lot of money.”
But as the city densifies, a lot of houses will continue to go to the landfill, he says.
“To me, everyone should jump on board and make it happen. … What’s the point of putting a nice house into the garbage?” In a written response, Coast Mountain Bus Company and TransLink said they would support a designated corridor “if infrastructure can be managed for repetitive moves on a proposed route.
They added that, “even if a designated route were created, there would be associated costs to the moving company for each move.”
When reached for a comment, the City of Vancouver did not have a response to the idea of a designated move-out route. However, a spokesperson said they’d be willing to discuss options.

Full text: 390 Scottsdale Dr., Guelph, Ont.
GUELPH Asking price: $599,900 (April, 2022) Selling price: $665,000 (April, 2022) Previous selling price: $260,000 (May, 2017) Taxes: $2,685 (2022) Days on the market: Three Listing agents: Rahim Suleman and Cori Endrody, Forest Hill Real Estate Inc.
THE ACTION This two-storey townhouse had roughly 20 visitors over three days, with two bidders emerging, both determined to lock down a deal by the start of the workweek. One raised their initial offer to $65,100 over asking, which the seller accepted.
“The market was just starting to turn, so it was a little unpredictable,” said agent Cori Endrody.
“But there wasn’t a lot of inventory at that price point … so we expected multiple offers. It was someone local that purchased it,” Ms. Endrody said.
“However, because prices in the GTA are so incredibly high for most first-time buyers, we are finding [Toronto buyers] are coming to Guelph or Kitchener to find that price point they can afford.” WHAT THEY GOT The nearly 50year-old townhouse has roughly 1,400 square feet of living space, including a guest bedroom and a recreation room in the lower level.
The front door opens into a foyer between an eat-in kitchen and a living room. Along the back wall is a dining area and a staircase leading up to two bedrooms and one of three bathrooms.
Outdoors, there is a front patio and a surface parking spot.
Monthly condominium fees are $289.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “There are a lot of new builds in Guelph, but this property is older, hence it has such large square footage,” said Ms. Endrody.

Full text: 1009 Mercedes Dr.
MINDEN HILLS , ONT.
Asking Price: $2.85-million Taxes: $5,250 (2022) Lot Size: 500 feet water frontage Listing Agents: Christine Sharp, Century 21 Granite Realty Group Inc.
THE BACKSTORY The second time Lauren Richards went cottage shopping she was ready to be skeptical.
“We had bought on a lake we had been assured was clean and clear,” Ms. Richards said. Instead she and her then-husband found they had “bought into a weed-pit” that was swarmed by bugs. They sold it within a year and it was about seven years later when they were visiting a friend on Drag Lake (near Ontario’s Halliburton cottage country) that they heard of another property for sale on a nearby chain of lakes.
“We came up on the May long weekend … it was cold and miserable and rainy,” Ms. Richards said. When she visited the cottage on Twelve Mile Lake, right away alarm bells went off. “I looked down at the water and saw a dock and I thought, ‘The neighbour is right there, right on top of us.’ Then I saw, of the three docks, all the paths came up to this cottage, which just shocked me.”
There’s a boating dock in deep water, an entertaining dock/deck and one next to a sandy beach in a protected alcove. “And there’s hardly any bugs, we don’t get black flies,” she said.
Ms. Richards was ready to negotiate, a key part of her advertising career. But her husband suggested a softer approach. “In those days, you didn’t have to give more than they wanted,” she said. They offered full asking price (believing the property was undervalued given some unusual interior design choices). And just like that, the deal was done.
She and her husband enjoyed the cottage together with their two daughters for only a short time before her husband died in 2010. As the years passed, the daughters raised their own families and, for Ms. Richards, a new love (a fellow widower) helped create new traditions on the lake.
Now, after weathering much of the pandemic in the family compound, she’s ready to move on.
THE COTTAGE The main cottage is not overly large, with two bedrooms on the main floor with a third in the attic loft. But there was an existing two-bedroom guest suite above the garage, and Ms. Richards added a cabinstyle bunkie next to the lake, “so each daughter could have their own private space,” when they visit.
The main house opens into a small foyer that leads into a central spine hallway that ends in the living space, which has a view of the lake. Directly to the right is the primary bedroom and across the hall is what you might call the spa bathroom as it features no shower but does have a deep red standalone soaker tub.
There’s a sink-basin made from a large hollowed-out stone on a live-edge wood vanity tucked into a corner window.
As you continue down the hall there’s a laundry closet on the left, across from the second bedroom on this level, slightly smaller than the primary. A pocket door leads into a second bathroom, this one with a shower, that also opens to the hallway.
A spiral staircase leads to the secondfloor loft bedroom is the last part of the hallway, before it opens into a large open living space that expands to embrace the lake views with floor-to-ceiling windows and two over-sized sliding doors.
This space is defined by the rich goldencoloured hemlock barnwood flooring Ms. Richards installed, and the rear wall is double the width of the front portion of the house. On the right side of the room the wood-panelled wall is enlivened by two large circular portal windows flanking a tall rectangular one in. The paneling travels across the rear wall to connect to the stone hearth and wood-burning fireplace in the opposite corner.
The kitchen was original to the cottage, and is a triangular workspace with granite counters running along the outside wall, and then wrapping around in a peninsula with bar seating next to the sink. The same circle-rectangle-circle windows repeat on this side of the house, which soars upwards and is open to the upstairs loft with its large skylight.
The garage and lake-side bunkies are paneled in the same light pine, and have their own living rooms but the garage bunkie comes with the added bonus of a threepiece bathroom with a shower stall.
As in most cottages, the great outdoors is what truly sells the space. In addition to the rear deck off the living-dining room there’s a number of amenities on the grounds. “There’s so many places to go and hang out outside,” Ms. Richards said.
There’s a charming two-level play house (done in contemporary panels and angles, complete with a slide) next to a treemounted hammock; there’s a fire pit with Muskoka chairs; the entertainment dock is ringed with benches and shaded by trees on the shore; and there’s a barrel-shaped sauna, too. “My son in law had that put in.
… The guys like to come out of there and run and jump into the lake,” she said.
BEST FEATURE The cottage is on a point of land that bulges into the lake, affording a great deal of privacy. But despite the peace and quiet, it’s far from remote. “I’m not a mountain man who wants to drive for an hour into the closest town. Minden is 15 minutes away and has an emergency hospital,” Ms. Richards said. In town there’s local breweries and restaurants, and there’s even some spots you can get to by boat. “We’re on a three-chain lake, so it’s great for boaters,” she said. Ms. Richards recommends the Heather Lodge for fine dining, and the Red Umbrella Inn which sometimes has live music and is great for brunch or more casual meals: “They have great fish and chips that are locally caught, pickerel usually.”
Suffice it to say, not everyone in the extended family is happy to see the compound go. But Ms. Richards intends to stop splitting time between Toronto and Twelve Mile Lake and move closer to her daughter in Prince Edward County to help out with the grandkids more. And as she has learned, we’re not guaranteed anything in this life so the best thing to do is live to the fullest.

Ontario town to see triplexes built using 3-D printers: The project is coming at a time when skilled labour is scarce and comes at a premium

Full text: Toronto’s Horizon Legacy Group will break ground this summer on what will be Canada’s largest 3-D-printed neighbourhood. The plan is to use industrial-grade 3-D printers to build five 1,400-square-foot triplex houses on a lightly forested two-acre property just north of the St. Lawrence River at Gananoque, Ont.
Advocates say that the 3-D technology underpinning this project and a growing number of others around the world has the potential to reduce the cost and time it takes to build housing.
Some estimates suggest that typical construction costs and times can be cut in half using 3-D printers.
In Gananoque, each of the buildings will have a rentable bachelor, one-bedroom, and twobedroom apartment. Thirty per cent of the units will fall under the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.’s definition of “affordable” – that is, less than 30 per cent of the household’s before-tax income.
The project is the result of a competition sponsored by Horizon that challenged participants to design a multistorey building for $100 per square foot using new technologies. Teams from the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Chile were selected to build the triplexes.
One of those teams will also construct a 12-storey multiresidential 3-D-printed building elsewhere in Ontario.
Horizon CEO Anthony Zwig says the idea for the competition came during a company-wide brainstorming session aimed at finding solutions to the affordable housing crisis in Canada. “The cost of construction, because of the diminishing supply of workers, is just going through the roof, and it’s going to get worse,” he says. “And so, we started to focus in on the fact that there seems to be opportunities to automate the construction process for cost benefits, for time benefits.”
While each of the selected teams has its own unique strategy for achieving those benefits, the basic process behind 3-D-printed construction is the same. Also called additive manufacturing, it begins with digital designs of interior or exterior concrete walls – the typical elements built with this technology – which are then sent to a robotic 3-D printer. A special liquid concrete mix is pumped through the hose of the printer, which goes back and forth, forming the structure of the walls layer by layer.
One of the biggest upsides to the technology is that fewer workers are required compared with traditional building projects. Skilled labour is at a premium for any construction project, if you can even find it, says Horizon VP of development Nhung Nguyen. “Over half of construction costs are in labour, and so we think that with the use of technology we can solve that problem.”
The absence of formwork in a 3-D-printed building can also mean significant savings, says Maria Anna Polak, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Waterloo and an expert in 3-D printing of concrete structures. “Traditional concrete construction requires formwork, because concrete is liquid before it hardens, and usually needs 28 days to harden,” she says. “With 3-D printing, the cost saving is definitely lack of formwork, because you don’t have it.”
In Gananoque, the team from the Netherlands, CyBe Construction, estimates its costs will be less than $82 a square foot. CyBe also says it will print all elements in two to three weeks and assemble them in one week.
That’s good news to Gananoque Mayor Ted Lojko, who says there is a “severe lack” of affordable housing in his community of about 5,000 people. “The other part of the equation is a lot of people from Ottawa, Toronto, and the GTA are moving [here] and inflating the housing market.
And all of a sudden people that have lived in the area have to find alternative housing, and it’s very difficult to do.”
Since 2016, Gananoque’s population has increased 4.3 per cent.
And in that time, the median sale price of a single detached home in the area increased from about $200,000 to just under $540,000.
3-D printing shouldn’t be seen as a panacea to Canada’s affordable housing woes, however, says Ian Comishin. At least not yet. Mr. Comishin is the president of Twente Additive Manufacturing (TAM), whose 3-D printers may be used by some of the teams in Gananoque. “The technology is still brand new and it’s not necessarily going to be readily accepted by all the jurisdictional approving bodies. So even if we can build a lower cost home than conventional building, the permitting process may end up making the building overpriced again.”
The technology itself is also expensive. TAM’s smallest printers start at 100,000 ($135,198) while its larger models start at 920,000 (more than $1.24-million).
The concrete material is pricey as well. That’s because it’s highly refined and some of the components can’t be locally sourced, says Ms. Polak. “Right now, if you go to a cement manufacturer, you might find concrete that is 3-D printable, but it’s very expensive.” But that could soon change, she says, as researchers continue to look at how to produce these concretes from local materials.
Mr. Comishin thinks that within a few years every concrete plant will have its own 3-D mix, because the industry is “moving at a breakneck speed.” When he co-founded his company in 2018, he says there were maybe 10 to 12 companies worldwide who were in the industrial 3-D printing or printer-making business. Now he believes there are more than 200.
Grand View Research expects that the global 3-D printing construction market size will see a compound annual growth rate of 100.7 per cent from 2022 to 2030.
In Canada, a few 3-D-printed construction projects are in the works, including in Leamington, Ont., where the University of Windsor and Habitat for Humanity are using the technology to build four affordable tiny rental homes. In Dubai, the goal is to 3-D print 25 per cent of all buildings by 2030.
Mr. Comishin believes that 3-D printers will soon be on every build site of significance in North America. “Automation of some of these processes is almost essential just to even maintain the current pricing that we’re seeing in housing, never mind the crazy increases in prices as the supply of skilled labourers diminishes.”
Back in Gananoque, Ms. Nguyen agrees. “The 3-D-printing aspect is really not even what we’re interested in here. Maybe it’s a starting point, but really, it’s further using construction technologies and automation in the construction sector. That’s where we think the future lies.”

Full text: Although the brown brick, semi-Brutalist Toronto Fire Station at 441 Bloor St. E.
has existed longer than I have – and I therefore have driven past it thousands of times – it was only last week I learned that children play on its roof as part of the Glen Road Early Learning & Child Care Centre.
And that is only because the University of Toronto’s School of Cities’ Matti Siemiatycki asked me to meet him there on a warm Saturday morning in May. Had it not been for our walk around the building and the peekaboo of playground equipment from Redrocket Lane, I never would have guessed.
“These types of buildings are hidden in plain sight; I think that’s what’s so interesting about them,” says Mr. Siemiatycki, who heads up the Infrastructure Institute and has been conducting some serious research into mixed-use buildings. “And what we’ve been finding is that they’re around, and there are some older examples and other some newer ones, and we’ve never talked about them or celebrated them as a made-in-Toronto approach to city building.”
Because the sun was shining and exurban planner Candice Leung had joined us, we decided to start the celebration ourselves.
The two-storey fire station, it should be noted, has been surrounded by high-rise towers in recent years, and is ripe for redevelopment. And, if redevelopment does happen, says Mr. Siemiatycki, the new building should mix even more uses together. But it’s a complicated site: wide and slightly triangular, it abuts an alleyway to the west, backs onto restored heritage homes, and, on its east side, it’s raised about 10 feet from Glen Road. In fact, one can stand on the fire station’s little patch of lawn and peer down at people entering and exiting the auxiliary entrance to Sherbourne subway station.
While it’s still “early days,” the School of Cities is in talks with the city’s real estate agency, CreateTO, and the fire department, and hopes to bring the TTC to the table as well. The plan is to “reuse the site in a way that we’re going to put the station back in,” Mr. Siemiatycki says.
“And then build housing above, and my preference would be affordable housing, and we’ll see how the economics work; the nice thing is there’s a real interest in seeing how far we can push this.”
But, in addition to the child care centre, what else? A café? A greengrocer? Are there any mixes that are too strange to work with a fire station? Well, a “global scan” turned up plenty with housing (some in other Canadian cities) and one in Washington, with an athletic centre on top. While synergies help – such as church-food bank-women’s shelter – the School of Cities thinks that we’ve been too narrow in what we’ve allowed thus far.
“We didn’t think a school could go in a condo,” says Mr. Siemiatycki, thinking of North Toronto Collegiate, “or we didn’t think you could have a theatre that goes on the main floor [of a condo] because, you know, maybe there’d be too many people around. And it turns out that’s actually an amenity, people want to be where the action is.”
The action in this case is at 345 Carlaw Ave., where Crow’s Nest Theatre partnered with Streetcar Developments to build their permanent home at the base of a 12storey residential tower.
So how can a university think tank leave the ivy-covered tower and help developers or property owners get creative?
“We’ve created an accelerator program and are doing training and ecosystem development,” Mr. Siemiatycki says.
“A lot of this is a matchmaking problem, right? Someone has space, someone has need and they don’t always know how to find each other. … We work with organizations to get them ready to do these types of social purpose real estate projects.”
And once the relatively new School of Cities has helped make more and more matches, the next step would be to streamline the process, perhaps even to design boilerplate documentation or procedures, since too often these architectural marriages come with “drama and heartache.”
There was plenty of drama at our next stop. While today there are nothing but happy moms with strollers going in and out of 21 Carlaw Ave., the rebirth of Red Door Family Shelter after WoodGreen United Church was demolished in 2017 was “forged in fire.”
“There’s a long convoluted story about what happened, but the building actually went into receivership, and the developer bought the building,” Mr. Siemiatycki says. “And so the Red Door was really close to being [kicked] out. And this is when the ‘Save the Red Door’ campaign started, and 50,000 names on a petition, and the local Councillor Paula Fletcher got really deeply involved.”
While too much to recount, the point is that without massive community effort and municipal government involvement, the “pretty seamless” residential-retail-shelter would not have happened, and that’s a shame. Walk around the Harhay Developments building and it’s quite handsome: the southeastern corner incorporates an 1888 façade, big-windowed retail faces Queen Street, and, turn the corner at Booth Avenue and it takes a minute until one spies the entrance to Red Door.
But that’s not because Red Door is a second-class citizen, it’s so eyes are on the alleyway and residents benefit from more quietude: “It’s important the social part isn’t an afterthought, that they are intentionally part of it, and each of them gets the part of the building that works best for them,” Mr. Siemiatycki says.
“It’s not like one is the junior partner to the to the other.”
It turns out these kinds of partnerships have a history. At the St.
Lawrence Neighbourhood – a masterful 1970s community that took the co-operation of all levels of government, urban planners and architects – the three of us admire how well the Downtown Alternative School and St. Michael Catholic School blend into the façade of the red-brick apartment at the southwest corner of The Esplanade and Jarvis Streeet.
Unfortunately, that sort of government co-operation is rare these days. The dozens and dozens of mixed-use buildings the School of Cities have studied are hard-won one-offs.
“We don’t need that,” Mr. Siemiatycki says. “Now that we know this works, we don’t have to do each of them as a one of one … it will exhaust everyone, it will frustrate everyone, and it’ll take too long and we won’t get the results we need.”

Full text: Canadian legal software provider Dye & Durham Ltd. will likely be forced to sell a British company it bought last year after Britain’s competition authority found the takeover would reduce competition and lead to higher prices there.
That is a blow for a company that has specialized in consolidating legal software providers and hiking prices, particularly in Canada. D&D stock fell 11.8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange Wednesday, a much steeper drop than tech stocks as a whole during a bad day across the markets. Its shares had rallied in the previous four sessions after sinking to their lowest level since the weeks after its July, 2020, initial public offering.
Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority, or CMA, stated in a notice of possible remedies Wednesday that it had provisionally found that Toronto-based D&D’s $156-million purchase last July of TM Group (U.K.) Ltd. “has resulted or may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition” for software used by real estate professionals to order property-search reports in England and Wales.
“At this stage, the CMA has identified only one potential structural remedy: the divestiture of TMG,” it stated. CMA has the legal authority to force such an outcome. D&D said in a statement it “disagrees with the CMA’s provisional findings and is evaluating its potential options,” adding it complies with “all laws and regulations in every market in which it operates.”
The CMA began investigating the deal last October and considered a range of evidence, including the two businesses’ strategic documents; a survey of customers; and other information provided by customers, competitors and other industry players.
In a summary of its provisional findings, the CMA said D&D and TM overlapped in the supply of property-search software business and that their combination “eliminates one of the largest” suppliers in the market, creating “a market leader with a very significant share.”
“We need to ensure that fees for search reports are competitive and that we continue to see innovation in digital services to make the process easier and faster,” Richard Feasey, chair of the CMA group that conducted the inquiry, said in a statement. “By reducing competition in an already concentrated market, we have found that Dye & Durham’s purchase of TM Group could increase the costs and reduce quality in these services.”
The CMA also called out the companies for not notifying the authority of the deal in advance, though D&D said it had no obligation to do so under British law.
D&D has faced a backlash in Canada for its strategy of buying up providers of real estate software and then sharply increasing prices, sometimes by hundreds of percentage points. The strategy has prompted dozens of complaints to the Competition Bureau of Canada and a class-action lawsuit, and law firms have had little choice but to pass the costs on to property buyers.
Similar concerns to those raised by the CMA could hamper D&D’s proposed $3.2-billion acquisition of Australia-based Link Administration Holdings, local media reported this month, though D&D chief executive officer Matt Proud said he didn’t expect the deal would be stopped by regulators. Canada’s competition regulator has taken no action on its deals here.
Vass Bednar, executive director of the master of public policy in digital society program at McMaster University in Hamilton and an advocate for changes to Canadian competition laws, said the CMA’s “very swift, significant and necessary” review “once again illustrates the disconnect between evolving citizen/consumer expectations of Canadian competition law and the current reality.
That’s why we need to use these case studies to educate people about how the competition act works and where it does not, and also make connections to a consumer protection issue: price gouging.”
BMO Capital Markets analyst Thanos Moschopoulos called the CMA’s findings a negative but not unexpected development, adding in a research note a forced sale of TM “would likely have a relatively modest impact to the stock’s value,” as the British company represents less than 8 per cent of D&D’s third-quarter net income and under 14 per cent of revenue for the period. He estimated in a “worst-case scenario” that D&D would fetch only $100million for TM in a forced sale.
Mr. Moschopoulos said in an interview he would be “reluctant to draw broader conclusions” about how the CMA’s actions could affect D&D’s strategy. “The question with any mergers and acquisitions story is, ‘Will they run out of things to buy?’ It would seem there’s maybe not much more they can acquire” in Britain.
“But they can acquire in other geographies and adjacent areas.”
In a separate release Wednesday, a private investment vehicle affiliated with Mr. Proud called Plantro Ltd. said it had bought $52.5-million of stock Tuesday, at an average $21.83 a share. That increases Plantro’s D&D stake to 11.5 per cent from 8 per cent.
The purchase was made a year after a management group including the CEO offered to buy out D&D at $50.50 a share – more than twice the stock’s current level. An independent board committee ended a strategic process to look at the proposal last October, concluding D&D would stay the course. The board authorized a large stock award to Mr. Proud instead. Shareholders expressed disapproval at last December’s annual meeting by voting down a resolution to grant 600,000 options to company directors, and two members of the compensation committee drew far fewer votes in support of their re-election than other directors.

Weather disasters require bold investment in watershed security

Full text: Chair of the B.C. Watershed Security Coalition The damage wrought by extreme weather across British Columbia in just the past year is gut-wrenching in its scope. But heading off the worst effects of fire, drought and flooding is still possible if we rebuild the natural protections of our watersheds. Putting in place a Watershed Security Fund, as promised by the provincial government, has never been more urgent.
Healthy watersheds provide natural defences against climate change-fuelled extreme weather.
For example, wetlands act as natural sponges that absorb flood waters and slow down overland flow. They also provide refuge and critical habitat to fish and wildlife during times of drought. Natural stream banks help filter runoff, preventing pollution from reaching waterways, and provide shade to spawning salmon during heat waves. Mature forests hold back snow and rain, providing a natural solution during flood season; this stored water is then released when it’s dry and needed most.
The benefits of strengthening these natural protections from extreme-weather events is reinforced by the massive response and recovery costs of recent damages.
In the fall, a series of atmospheric-river storms – a plume of moisture-laden air, hundreds of kilometres long, that delivers sustained, heavy rainfall – overwhelmed B.C.’s infrastructure. This left farms submerged, homes and businesses destroyed, salmon habitat washed away, and water undrinkable; by the time the floods receded, the cost of recovering from the damage topped $9-billion.
Also last year, more than 1,500 wildfires scorched nearly 870 square kilometres of forestland in B.C., racking up more than $500-million in firefighting costs. Forests were dry as tinder as a result of drought and record-breaking heatwaves, compounded by decades of mismanagement.
These costs are rising rapidly: In B.C.
alone, firefighting costs for three of the past five years (2017, 2018 and 2021) were more than double the 10-year average, together exceeding $1.7-billion.
Drought, fires and floods go hand-inglove. Drought leads to fire, and fires burn the land. Land denuded of life is then subject to erosion, debris flows and slides, which in turn worsen floods.
So we welcome a recent announcement by B.C. Premier John Horgan that outlined $30-million in funding for watershed security. This investment, which follows $27million in 2021 under COVID-19 economic recovery, is a good first step toward the establishment of a permanent Watershed Security Fund. Half of the $30-million will fund watershed projects led or co-led by First Nations. The other half will fund conservation organizations that are restoring wetlands, improving salmon habitat and enhancing community resilience.
But this is still a one-off and less than half of what is needed. It is essential that the B.C. government build on these initial investments by creating a long-term Watershed Security Fund in the next provincial budget. To match the scale of the threat, the BC Watershed Security Coalition has identified that at least $75-million in funding per year is needed.
The benefits of such a bold and pro-active investment far outweigh the costs. It is certainly preferable to expensive disaster-response efforts: B.C. has spent nearly $11-billion recovering from the effects of extreme weather in just the past few years.
And British Columbians already understand the benefits of shoring up our watersheds. According to an October poll by the Real Estate Foundation of BC and the University of Victoria’s POLIS Water Sustainability Project, 78 per cent support major investments in watershed security to protect fresh water in the province.
This is why we need a Watershed Security Fund that is independent, sustainable and at a scale that can make a difference while withstanding political cycles. And such a fund must be delivered in partnership with Indigenous Nations to support real progress on reconciliation.
Once established, the fund should invest in three key areas. First, rebuilding our natural defences: Wetlands, stream banks, forests and coastal marshes provide critical services at a fraction of the cost of built infrastructure. Second, strengthening watershed governance through Crown and Indigenous partnerships that work with local communities to set priorities and make better decisions for their watersheds. Third, bolstering collaborative watershed monitoring through Indigenous knowledge and Western science, so we know if actions are making a difference.
Watersheds underpin our economy, health and well-being by providing clean drinking water, thriving salmon runs, water for growing food and natural protections against climate disasters.
If we take care of our watersheds, they will take care of us.

Dye & Durham fee hikes spark price increases by rivals: ‘If everybody is charging three times more than you, you’re going to increase your price, aren’t you?’ says the CEO of LawyerDoneDeal

Full text: After watching his main competitor, Dye & Durham Ltd., sharply raise its fees twice in the past 18 months, Maurizio Romanin has decided it’s time to hike his prices as well.
Mr. Romanin runs Torontobased LawyerDoneDeal Corp., which, like D&D, offers conveyancing software used by real estate legal professionals to process transactions. On June 1, the amount LDD charges for using its RealtiWeb software will increase to $32 per residential-property purchase transaction from $22, up 45 per cent. It’s the first time LDD has raised prices since 2018, when the fee rose $2 per file.
“If everybody in your market is charging three times more than you, you’re going to increase your price, aren’t you?” Mr. Romanin said in an interview. “We’re focused on doing reasonable and responsible price increases. You’re not going to see 300-per-cent increases from our side.”
In January, 2021, weeks after D&D bought Canada’s dominant conveyancing software provider, DoProcess LP, it told clients in Ontario it would hike the amount it charges to use the software to $129 per deal, from $25.
That caused an uproar, with legal firms saying it would force the higher costs onto homebuyers. D&D later told customers in other provinces it was hiking prices as well. Then, this January, it told clients it would again increase prices, to between $199 and $249 per transaction. That means DoProcess now charges as much as $227 more per file than LawyerDoneDeal; in late 2020, the difference was just $3.
D&D’s price hikes – part of its acquisition and financial growth strategy, which predates the recent spike in inflation – have caused a backlash, including dozens of complaints to the Competition Bureau of Canada and a class-action lawsuit. Concerns over reduced competition and higher fees have prompted Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority to review D&D’s July, 2021, purchase of legal software provider TM Group (U.K.)
Ltd. Similar concerns from Australia’s competition regulator could hamper D&D’s proposed $3.2-billion acquisition of Link Administration Holdings, local media reported this week.
John Robinson, D&D’s chief commercial and people officer, said that despite the hikes his company has “seen a tremendous response from our customers.” The company says the percentage of clients who quit has been in the mid-single digits in key markets in Ontario and B.C.
D&D’s share price has dropped by two-thirds in 2022 amid a broad selloff of tech stocks. But it has continued to generate steady results. On Thursday, D&D reported $122.9-million in revenue and adjusted operating earnings of $66.8-million in the third quarter, both up 78 per cent yearover-year. That beat analyst expectations. CEO Matt Proud said D&D offset the effect of declining real estate deal volumes in April with price increases and stuck to his forecast the company would generate $350-million in operating profits in its fiscal year ending June 30, 2023.
Its price hikes have been a boon for D&D’s smaller rivals.
Mr. Romanin said his business has grown 50 per cent – more than 1,000 clients – since early 2021. Harrison Kelly, CEO of London, Ont.-based startup LawLabs Inc., said its Closer real estate transaction processing software – which costs $60 to $75 per file – has picked up 100-plus clients in Ontario, including many “that jumped over when the second price increase [from D&D] went through” this year.
Mr. Robinson said “dozens” of clients who left D&D for alternative providers this year have returned. “We believe we offer the most advanced and feature-rich conveyancing software in the world and are constantly innovating to make it even better and easier to use.”
D&D connected The Globe and Mail to Kiranjeet Sangha, a Brampton, Ont., lawyer who said her firm had switched back to DoProcess – after using LDD for a while – because it had more advanced features and customer service that made the cost worthwhile.
Meanwhile, three LDD customers who recently switched from DoProcess told The Globe they didn’t mind the impending price increase of the smaller company. “It’s insignificant and a minor increase relatively – 10 bucks,” said Toronto lawyer Avi Charney, who switched to RealtiWeb last year. “I’m totally fine with it.”
Tim Garvey, of Garvey & Garvey LLP in Mississauga, also said the increase “is insignificant” compared with D&D’s hikes.
“Even if it went up $8 a year for the next five years I wouldn’t really care because it’s way lower.”
And Coquitlam, B.C.-based lawyer Michael LeBeau agreed that LDD was “pretty reasonable … and fairly and appropriately priced. I preferred $22 but can deal with $32.”
Spencer Keys, a lawyer in Sechelt, B.C., shared similar views of LDD, but he said a 45-per-cent increase as recently as 2020 wouldn’t have gone over as well.
“I don’t want to put it out there that D&D has moved our tolerances, but that’s obviously the case,” he said. Even though he feels RealtiWeb isn’t as good as D&D’s software, “it is a significantly better value for money … We’ve been annoyed enough with D&D that we’re not going back.”

Full text: To get up the steep mountain slopes in the backcountry near New Denver, B.C., skiers and snowboarders spend strenuous hours using special gear to ski upwards toward the reward of one untouched run down on powdery snow.
For most people, those ridges are out of reach – they are too intense, complex and expensive for most skiers and snowboarders to get to.
But David Harley wants to make it a little easier by developing a backcountry resort in the West Kootenay region that he hopes will also help revitalize sleepy New Denver, an hour north of Nelson. He envisions the resort attracting backcountry enthusiasts with more than beginner skills who are looking for an authentic experience without getting themselves into trouble in dangerous terrain.
“The world doesn’t need another Whistler,” he said.
But while Mr. Harley’s dream of developing Zincton All-Seasons Resort has gotten some reluctant support, it is already attracting opposition from Indigenous groups, environmentalists and some within the existing ski community.
Backcountry skiing has gone from a fringe niche to an aspiration for many people who enjoy winter sports. Avalanche Canada, a non-profit that provides detailed forecasts to backcountry users, said more than 15,000 people took part in backcountry training courses in the 2020-21 winter season, a 50-per-cent increase from four years ago.
Mr. Harley, who is also the founder of regional outdoor sports chain Valhalla Pure Outfitters, notes that roughly 30 per cent of all ski boots and bindings manufactured now are made specifically for the backcountry.
Backcountry skiing is a very different sport from resort skiing.
It takes place on land that is often deep in the wilderness and can be difficult for rescue crews to reach if something goes wrong. Skiers and snowboarders spend hours travelling through complex mountain terrain, many times just for a single, perfect run of untouched powdery snow. And avalanches are a constant deadly threat. The danger and difficulty associated with the sport are part of what has drawn so many people to it.
Search and rescue operations are running constantly to help inexperienced skiers and snowboarders who find themselves out of their depth in the backcountry. The BC Search and Rescue Association said provincial rescue teams were called out 86 times in 2021 for skiers and snowboarders alone.
Mr. Harley’s plan for a resort where 80 per cent of the property is backcountry access only would provide a centralized place for both new and experienced backcountry skiers to familiarize themselves with the sport in a slightly more controlled environment, where guides, local snow information and other resources are readily available.
Twenty per cent of the land would look like a regular ski resort, with multiple chairlifts, marked ski runs and a village with lodging.
The venture would provide an economic jolt to a community that is shrinking even as nearby cities such as Revelstoke and Nelson have experienced a surge of people moving in throughout the pandemic. Mr. Harley points out that he can’t take a guest for dinner, because there isn’t a single sit-down restaurant that is open past afternoon in New Denver.
But by basing his project in the Kootenays, he has stirred a community that is fed up with the amount of Crown land that has been allocated for private use.
Vast expanses of Interior B.C.
public land are under tenure, meaning private companies are allowed to conduct business operations there. Tenures are granted for extraction uses such as forestry, but also for tourism purposes such as guided mountain biking or heli-skiing.
“It makes it an unfavourable place for people to go ski touring,” said Judson Wright, lead guide of Kootenay Backcountry Guides in Nelson. “It becomes a busy place.
When people go ski touring, they’re not looking for an area that’s covered in helicopters or tracks.”
The Zincton resort is being proposed on a piece of land that is one of the last easily accessible backcountry ski areas in the West Kootenay region, which is why many skiers and snowboarders have rallied against the project.
That’s despite a promise from Mr. Harley that the entire resort would be free to access for anyone not using the lifts.
New Denver Mayor Leonard Casley said every time a company applies to have a commercial operation on public land, it’s a concern to his council, even if it’s not necessarily on municipal land.
People in the local community have complained about the way that some tenured operations try to limit access and get into confrontations with backcountry users.
“There’s no regulation. Once they get the tenure they’re basically left alone,” Mr. Casley said.
Another force against Zincton comes from environmental activists.
Nicky Blackshaw, a skier and hiker in Silverton, a small town near New Denver, is part of a local activist group called the Wild Connection. The organization said 2,700 have signed a petition calling on the provincial government to impose a moratorium on further commercial recreation tenures in the valley where the resort is proposed until land-use planning can be updated and take environmental impact into account.
“The biggest concern is this area is getting absolutely overrun with commercial recreation tenures,” Ms. Blackshaw said, adding that the government needs to examine the impact that the operations have on the landscape.
There are already multiple facilities for heli-skiing and cat-skiing – guided tours taking skiers up a mountain on large tractor-like vehicles with special tracks for the snow – right beside where Zincton is being proposed. People in the surrounding towns and Indigenous bands are concerned about the impact that another large operation would have on grizzly bear, caribou and wolverine populations in what is a critical wildlife corridor.
Mr. Harley said concern for the environment is a central part of his plan. He pledged to use 1 per cent of proceeds from the resort to help clean up toxic runoff and open mine shafts that contaminate water and threaten wildlife in an area that was booming in the late 1800s and early 1900s with the extraction of zinc and other metals.
He said the resort, which would also operate in the summer for cycling and hiking, would close off a large portion of land during those months to protect local grizzly bear populations at a time when they’re most active.
Area Indigenous groups are opposed to environmental impact that the resort could have.
Chief Byron Louis of the Okanagan Indian Band, which has claim to the land where Zincton is proposed, said the idea of yet another parcel of land in the valley being designated for commercial use doesn’t sit well.
“We need to start looking at natural capital. Everything has a value, you can’t take these things out without considering what the natural value is, because that directly impacts us,” said Mr. Louis, who added that his community relies on hunting and gathering high-protein foods from areas such as the proposed site.
“People say, ‘Oh, this is just one project,’ but if you start counting up the number of projects in there, then you start moving into what’s described as a cumulative effect.”
He said Zincton would have to prove how it can mitigate the environmental impact of a resort, and that the amount of damage by existing commercial operations has already had a detrimental effect on the well-being of Indigenous peoples in the Kootenays.
He pointed to a recent B.C. Supreme Court ruling that found nearby Blueberry River First Nation had its rights breached from decades of commercial extraction operations. The ruling led to a $65-million funding deal by the B.C. government for land restoration and protection of the Blueberry First Nations’ cultural practices.
“We are no longer in the age of consultation. We’re in the age of damages,” Mr. Louis said.
The B.C. Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development said the proposed resort falls on Sinixt, Ktunaxa, Okanagan and Secwepemc lands, and that the First Nations will be consulted and accommodated where required.
Back in Nelson, Mr. Wright, the backcountry guide, says that even talking about the pros and cons of the resort makes him uneasy because of how intense the debate has become in the community.
He notes that while there are voices on both sides, the voices against the resort are certainly more passionate.
Mr. Harley’s promise that the resort would allow unfettered access to people who aren’t using the lifts is Mr. Wright’s major concern. He points out other resorts and tenured operations have made access difficult in the past, even after promising otherwise.
But he also sees the potential for some sort of destination where people can dip their toes into the inherent danger of avalanche terrain before going on more challenging expeditions of their own.
Austin Hager, a backcountry skier and hiker in Nelson, says his own experience getting into the sport four years ago is why he supports the resort.
“With backcountry skiing, the barrier to entry is so high, there’s such a knowledge gap, and there’s really not a lot of environments that help people get into the sport,” said Mr. Hager, who added that existing avalanche courses in the area are sometimes booked up for the entire winter season.
“Having a space dedicated to backcountry education and safe usage is something we have to do, because with more and more people using the backcountry, there could be more accidents.”
He said any ski resort proposal in the province is likely to face pushback, but Zincton is a better alternative than a traditional resort with a massive network of lifts.
In the community, there is concern about the effect a resort would have on real estate prices after a BC Assessment report found a 23-per-cent increase in the average value of a New Denver home in July, 2021, compared with the year prior.
Mr. Casley, the mayor, says that one way or another, the town needs to find how to grow to avoid the threat of its health resources and schools shutting down.
The provincial government moved to reduce emergencyroom hours at New Denver’s health centre in 2018, and that’s when Mr. Harley said he started thinking about the Zincton resort seriously.
The province has already approved the resort’s expression of interest, which is the first step in the application process. Next, it will rule on the resort’s formal proposal, which was recently submitted. After that, Mr. Harley would have to pass through a master plan review with the government.
In the coming years, the project may depend on whether Mr. Harley’s dream for the community is one that will be shared by others, and whether people will agree that a ski resort can bring prosperity back to the area.
“A lot of small rural communities really shortchange their kids because they don’t have skate parks, a hockey rink, a swimming pool,” Mr. Harley said, adding that the town’s inability to switch from a mining-based economy has led to the community deteriorating.
“We need to stop the slide.”

Full text: 953136 7th Line EHS MONO, ONT.
Asking Price: $2,750,000 Taxes: $1,808.61 (2021) Land Size: 29.3 acres Agent: Carolyn Scime, Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd.
THE BACKSTORY The 100-acre farm on 7th Line in Mono Township was passed down through the generations of one family for more than a century after their ancestors began farming the land and built a house of stone in the 1800s.
The Town of Mono is a rural community that resides within the traditional territory and ancestral lands of the Tionontati, Attawandaron, Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabe peoples.
By the 1960s, descendant James Atkinson was an elderly man with no heirs to take over the traditional family farm. He carved the land into 10-acre parcels and put them up for sale.
At the time, the Honsbergers were a Toronto-based couple raising their three children in York Mills.
Megan Honsberger was a young girl at the time, but she still remembers forays into the countryside as her parents searched for a bucolic retreat for weekends and summer holidays.
“They wanted water and rolling hills,” Ms. Honsberger recalls.
The Honsbergers visited the Atkinson farm, about one hour’s drive from Toronto in the area of Airport Road and Highway 9.
They purchased the piece with the circa 1891 Victorian farmhouse, the crumbling walls of the stone house and a vast century bank barn.
Humber Springs Creek runs through the undulating landscape.
Her father envisioned life as a gentleman farmer, while her mother was inspired by the paintings of Claude Monet and the Impressionist movement to create a farmhouse painted in shades of Provencal blue.
As soon as the deal closed, Mr. Honsberger began to assemble a small herd of cattle when he brought in five pregnant females.
“We had baby cows almost immediately,” Ms. Honsberger recalls.
THE HOUSE TODAY The farm had become rundown when the Honsberger family took over.
The red-brick farmhouse had no indoor plumbing and no central heating. There was an outhouse in the back.
The Honsbergers installed heating and turned one of the bedrooms into a bathroom in their first efforts to make the home more comfortable.
There was an indoor kitchen and a summer kitchen with a Franklin stove, where Ms. Honsberger remembers heating the water for washing dishes.
“That was how we all moved in,” she says.
The remnants of the earlier 1800s farmhouse showed the walls were built of mud and straw on a stone foundation, Ms. Honsberger says.
Her mother immediately declared the old root cellar a hazard and had it filled in with earth.
The kids found a set of stairs that led to a sleeping area upstairs.
“There was a really tiny, steep staircase,” she says. “I used to climb up that but it was deemed unsafe.”
Mr. Honsberger hired a local farmer to look after the land and the cattle during the week while he worked in the city. The two formed a great friendship that lasted for many years, his daughter says.
“Ours was the winter barn,” she says of the large L-shaped building on the property. The cows spent their summers in the pastures of the veteran farmer.
“We would just walk the herd down the road to his property. In the fall, we would walk them all back. We did that for years and years.”
Occasionally the family would take in a donkey, says Ms. Honsberger, and barn cats roamed around the property.
After a year or two, Mr. Honsberger expanded the land to 29 acres by purchasing two additional chunks that Mr. Atkinson had yet to sell.
Ms. Honsberger’s mother was also using her flair for design to improve the old house, which still has some of its original floors, doors and millwork.
“It just had all this lovely character,” Ms. Honsberger says.
Today, the house has four bedrooms and two bathrooms in 2,484 square feet of living space.
Ms. Honsberger, who took over the stewardship of the property after her mother’s death in 2007, says she kept many of the antiques her father bought at local auctions, along with the blue palette of the early days.
The floral wallpaper her mother chose still lines the upstairs hallway.
“There was a time when she did the whole house in Laura Ashley wallpaper – except the dining room.”
The wood fireplace surround in the current family room was rescued from the old stone house and restored by her father, Ms. Honsberger says.
Ms. Honsberger recalls summer picnics at the scenic Forks of the Credit River and winter weekends spent skiing in the Mulmur Hills.
“We’ve had the benefit of the country life that so many people want.”
THE BEST FEATURE In recent years, Ms. Honsberger has enjoyed keeping the property in the family for younger generations to enjoy.
Today the openings for two fireplaces – one for cooking and one for heating – can still be seen in the stone relic of the early farmhouse.
The 29 acres includes a hill dubbed “Old Baldie”, which Ms. Honsberger recalls climbing as a child. There are mature woods and walking trails throughout the property.
Ms. Honsberger says wild turkeys and foxes often amble by. Kids who visit like to search for patches of vegetation flattened by passing deer and their fawns.
“You can tell where the deer have been because they lay down for the night.”

Full text: At Vancouver’s Pidgin restaurant, there was a time when a single sleeve of takeout containers would last for up to a year.
Making food to go just wasn’t what they did: Before the pandemic, Pidgin prided itself on sit-down service with multicourse tasting menus. Early 2020 was the first time, out of necessity, that the owners looked at the contracts for big delivery platforms such as Uber Eats, SkipTheDishes and DoorDash.
That’s when co-owner Brandon Grossutti realized “this was going to be a very tough year indeed,” if Pidgin relied on those apps. “We were seeing 30 per cent of our revenue going out the door. That was not sustainable.”
So Mr. Grossutti decided to create his own alternative. At first, they took orders by phone – both for themselves and for other local restaurants – and asked Pidgin staff to work as drivers while they had no one to serve during lockdowns.
Within weeks, two companies with experience creating logistics and e-commerce platforms approached him, and they created an online ordering and delivery service called FromTo.
The startup is just one example of how restaurant owners have been forced to adapt fast amid soaring demand for takeout and delivery. Digital orders have increased by 155 per cent in the past two years, according to data released last month by research firm the NPD Group.
Customers have gotten used to the convenience of delivery, and options have proliferated. Even as restrictions ease and in-person dining resumes, demand is expected to remain higher than it was before the pandemic.
But many restaurants have struggled to make money on takeout, and the shift has not been financially sustainable. Restaurants already work with slim profit margins and cannot always absorb the high cost of third-party delivery apps, whose commissions can gobble up to 30 per cent of every order. Even when customers pick up orders themselves, many kitchens can’t keep up with serving both in-person diners and those ordering from home.
So restaurants are now taking matters into their own hands. That means controlling the delivery process themselves, or abandoning delivery options altogether. Others are building cost-efficient ghost kitchens, locations that only prepare takeout, to keep costs to a bare minimum.
As the industry looks to the future, restaurant owners are figuring out how to meet customers’ expectations – without tech companies eating their lunch.
SAYING GOODBYE TO TAKEOUT When Jen and Steve Wall opened Supply and Demand in Ottawa nine years ago, they wanted to create a neighbourhood spot that would draw people through the doors – and into seats. Occasionally a regular would call, asking for a favourite dish, such as the squid rigatoni, to go. But takeout was never a focus.
COVID-19 changed that. After staying closed during the first weeks of the pandemic, they began offering fixed menus for pickup: kale salad, Parker House dinner rolls, handmade pasta dishes that changed each week and dessert. They took orders by phone.
Takeout orders provided them some much needed revenue during lockdowns.
But now that restrictions on indoor dining have ended in Ontario, Supply and Demand is taking a break from takeout. A big reason is logistics: The Walls’ 60-seat restaurant is open concept and small. Ms. Wall said there is nowhere to do takeout without altering the vibe in the dining room. And beyond that, the restaurant just doesn’t have enough staff in the kitchen and front-of-house to handle many more orders each night.
“We are putting out a high-end product and we’re also trying to provide a really special experience to the people that are within our four walls,” she said.
This is a common occurrence, said James Rilett, a vice-president at industry group Restaurants Canada. Many restaurants reluctantly offered takeout as a way to connect with customers during the pandemic, but didn’t find it was sustainable in the long term. “It never was a value proposition,” he said. “It was, ‘How do we lose less money?’ ” According to Restaurants Canada’s surveys, only about half of restaurants who started doing takeout during the pandemic are planning to continue.
In Como Taperia’s case, takeout was a tough sell to begin with. Much of the Spanish cuisine at the Vancouver restaurant – such as fried foods and high-quality seafood – would not travel well in a box, and they had never done delivery or to-go
orders in the past.
But last spring, when indoor dining restrictions went into effect, Como’s patio was too small to serve enough people to make ends meet. So they did something completely off-brand: “smash burgers,” pressed patties cooked on a flat-top grill that were perfect for takeaway, and helped keep the restaurant connected to its customers during the restrictions.
“We had lineups for them, because they were very Instagram-popular. I had friends texting me to see if I could save them some,” co-owner Shaun Layton recalls.
There were other takeout experiments too, such as cook-at-home kits that addressed some of the concerns about food not faring well in transit. When the restaurant was allowed limited capacity indoors, the owners removed half of the tables, converting part of the space to a market selling items such as wine, olive oil and imported tinned fish. They also launched an online store where people could order those items for pickup, which is still going.
But Mr. Layton says Como’s main focus is once again on serving people in person, and they are putting takeout on hold: “We’ll never do it unless there’s another lockdown.” But he added that it definitely will be a part of new businesses he launches.
“I still don’t think I’d ever use the big delivery apps, but it’s on my mind for future projects to be able to sell stuff out the back door, as well as have people in the front door,” he said. “Because it is the future, and I understand that things do change.”
ALL IN ON DELIVERY Chef Nuit Regular and her husband, Jeff, have started some of Toronto’s most popular Thai restaurants, including PAI Northern Thai Kitchen. Takeout and delivery had always been a big part of their operation, even before the pandemic.
At the busiest times of day, their restaurants would operate two kitchens: one focused on in-person diners, and the other on takeout. But as demand grew, they were stretched thin. “We are a very, very small operation,” Ms. Regular said.
The solution was to set up a ghost kitchen.
Some ghost kitchens operate out of an existing restaurant – for example, a sushi restaurant that sells dim sum under a different name – while others are separate locations built specifically for delivery.
PAI has launched two ghost kitchens through Kitchen Hub, a Toronto-based start-up that operates facilities it calls “virtual food halls,” a sort of food court for ghost kitchens. The company charges tenants a fixed monthly fee to cover rent, utilities and other costs, and charges a percentage of revenue based on the tenants’ growth.
Kitchen Hub’s first location opened in Etobicoke in west Toronto weeks before the pandemic began. It now has three such food halls, with plans for at least 50 across Canada. The tenants are responsible for paying commissions to the delivery apps. But ghost kitchens can be more cost-effective, because without a dining room the real-estate footprint is much smaller and fewer staff members are needed.
Kitchen Hub’s Etobicoke facility was profitable both for the company and for the kitchen operators within the first year, the founders said.
“The restaurants are profitable quicker than we are,” co-founder Adam Armeland said.
The cost to restaurants of using delivery apps – up to 25 or 30 per cent of every order – became better known to customers during the pandemic.
Winnipeg-based delivery company SkipTheDishes says the number of ghost kitchens on its platform have quintupled in the last two years while order volume serviced by ghost kitchens has soared more than sevenfold. Chief operating officer Howard Migdal said he believes criticism of the apps’ commissions is unfair.
“Delivery, in itself, is just very expensive,” Mr. Migdal said. “You have to pay a driver to get something from point A to B. That’s an extra $6 to $10 in the value chain that needs to come from somewhere.”
Shilpa Arora, Canada general manager for San Francisco-based DoorDash, would not answer questions about the average commission the platform charges to restaurants. But she said she believes that the lower churn – the rate of restaurants leaving the platform – in 2021 compared with the previous two years demonstrates customer satisfaction.
“Over the past couple of years, what we’ve learned about consumers, is that a lot of this convenience, and the immediacy that our platform brings, is here to stay,” Ms. Arora said.
DOING DELIVERY THEIR OWN WAY Weeks into the pandemic, Vesuvio, an Italian restaurant in Toronto’s west end, closed after 63 years in business. A group of employees decided to open their own pizzeria that fall.
For the first few months, Juniors Pizza used delivery apps, including Uber Eats.
At first, it was good for customer acquisition, owner Shane Lemieux said, but they quickly ran into problems. “What we were finding, personally, over time the quality control was a serious issue,” Mr. Lemieux said. He said he’s handed a pizza box to a delivery driver who put it sideways into a bag, or had someone leave the order sitting in their car while taking a break to get food for themselves.
“There’s no accountability,” he said.
“They’re independent contractors. They can essentially do what they want.”
That can be a problem, said Jennifer Scott, president of Gig Workers United.
Her union advocates for drivers to be classified as employees of third-party delivery companies. Such a change, as well as better pay and training, would address many concerns restaurants have about driver quality, Ms. Scott said.
Juniors Pizza switched to doing its own delivery, starting with one driver, and expanding over the past year to five or six.
The operation is old school: Customers call orders in, which are tracked with pieces of paper on a big board.
“Our regulars oftentimes will know the phone operators by name,” Mr. Lemieux said. “‘Hey, I’m going to get my usual’ – small little interaction. But I think that familiarity and that consistency is actually attractive to a lot of people.”
Other restaurants are trying a more tech-savvy approach.
After FromTo built its app to provide an alternative to the big delivery platforms, the founders decided to waive any commissions, aside from credit-card processing fees, during the worst months of the pandemic. Customers paid a delivery fee of $6.50, plus optional tip, which went directly to the drivers. It was only in February that the team introduced an 8.5-percent commission, still much lower than the 20 to 30 per cent most other platforms charge.
FromTo has grown to offering delivery for roughly 70 Vancouver restaurants with 620 drivers. The founders are considering partnerships in other cities or even outside of Canada. They are hoping to raise capital to be able to continue competing with the big guys. In its home market, FromTo counts roughly 15,000 users, who are looking to support local haunts.
Most orders come to the platform from the restaurants’ own websites.
“All these little McDonald’s orders, and bubble tea, and Starbucks – they’re never going to be a partner with us,” Mr. Grossutti said. “We don’t accept people that want to get a coffee delivered to their house in 20 minutes. There are certain things that break the world.”
He argues that high commission fees are not just bad for restaurants; they affect customers in hidden ways. Even when the apps’ delivery charges seem reasonable, he said, restaurants sometimes have to raise prices to make up for some of the profit margin they lose to commissions. For example, a dish Pidgin charges $22 for on FromTo is listed for $31 on other platforms.
Mr. Grossutti recognizes that customers’ expectations have changed over the course of the pandemic. “My concern is that it goes the way of Amazon if we don’t intervene with independent options. … Otherwise we won’t have a choice in a few years, and we’ll be run by ghost kitchens,” he said, referring to the industry in general. “And that whole connection to that individual restaurant is gone.”

Full text: As high as Toronto and Vancouver rents may seem to local tenants, landlords are often losing money on them.
In recent years, many momand-pop real estate investors in the two cities have been quietly paying more in mortgage and other ownership costs than they receive in rent, trusting they’d eventually sell at a profit thanks to rapidly rising home values, experts say.
But as interest rates shoot up and price growth slows, some highly indebted landlords are beginning to feel the squeeze more acutely. That financial pain could eventually push rents even higher, some experts warn.
“It’s all about leverage,” said Ron Butler, a Toronto-based mortgage broker.
His firm, Butler Mortgage, is getting daily calls these days from real estate investors in Ontario who’ve used a home equity line of credit (HELOC) for all or some of the down payment on a second property. HELOCs have variable interest rates that lenders typically adjust up or down following movements in the Bank of Canada’s benchmark interest rate.
Canada’s central bank has lifted its key rate by 0.75 of a percentage point so far this year and analysts expect several more hikes over the next few months.
The rate increases are rapidly pushing up HELOC payments, a headache for some investors who bought expensive properties at the height of the pandemic housing boom.
“If you bought a rental property seven years ago, which was enormously cheaper – you might even have had positive cash flow – you’ve had time to pay down the HELOC,” Mr. Butler said.
But if you’re an investor who bought in the past 18 months at a much higher price using a HELOC for the down payment and with rent not fully covering your monthly costs, “you now have an issue,” Mr. Butler said.
It’s not uncommon for homeowners who’ve seen the value of their first home soar in recent years to borrow against their home equity with a HELOC to fund the down payment on an investment property, Mr. Butler said, speaking about the Ontario market. Borrowers often don’t disclose to their bank they intend to use the HELOC to acquire a second home, he added.
Once they’ve drawn the cash for a down payment from the HELOC, borrowers typically apply for a mortgage to finance the rest of the real estate purchase, Mr. Butler said.
With HELOC rates climbing, many of those highly leveraged investors are now scrambling to convert their line of credit balance into mortgage debt that comes with fixed payments, according to Mr. Butler. The risk is that some may not be able to do so.
That may be because the additional debt they’ve taken on from the investment property means they don’t meet lenders’ requirements. Another obstacle is the fact that climbing interest rates have raised the bar borrowers must clear to pass the federal mortgage stress test, Mr. Butler said. Yet another hitch is that mortgages, unlike HELOCs, require payments of both principal and interest, resulting in bigger monthly outlays for borrowers, he added.
While Mr. Butler said he hasn’t seen this scenario play out in real life yet in the current environment, he did witness highly leveraged investors run into this kind of trouble in 2008 and 2009, when home prices in Canada briefly dipped after the financial crisis.
Most landlords aren’t as vulnerable as those who’ve used HELOCs to finance their down payments, said John Pasalis, president of Realosophy Realty. Many have fixed-rate mortgages that won’t come up for renewal for a few years. And, up to certain thresholds, even many who have variable rates enjoy fixed instalments, with lenders simply applying more of the monthly payments toward interest rather than the principal as rates go up.
But rising interest rates are nonetheless a concern for landlords who already aren’t able to fully cover their carrying costs of ownership with rent, he added.
Data provided by Mr. Pasalis suggest many investors who bought properties in the Greater Toronto Area in 2020 with the intention of renting them out aren’t breaking even.
The average price of condos sold that year that were subsequently leased within 12 months of the owner taking possession was just over $600,000, with an average annual property tax bill of $2,235 and average condo fees of $514 a month, Mr. Pasalis’s numbers show. With a down payment of 20 per cent and what was then a competitive five-year fixed mortgage rate of 2.29 per cent, the average monthly carrying cost of an average-priced property would work out to around $2,800, according to calculations by The Globe and Mail. But the average rent for the group properties tracked by Mr. Pasalis was less than $2,250, yielding a monthly loss of over $550.
It’s an even grimmer picture for investors who rented out homes, who could face an average monthly cash flow shortage of nearly $1,160, according to Mr. Pasalis’s data and Globe and Mail calculations.
In a March, 2021, report, CIBC deputy chief economist Benjamin Tal and Shaun Hildebrand, president of Toronto-based condo research firm Urbanation, found that 37 per cent of GTA condo rental units registered in 2020 had negative cash flow, with the carrying costs of home ownership outstripping rent by an average of $492 a month for that group.
In Vancouver, anecdotal evidence suggests the share of recent landlords who are losing money may be smaller, said Romana King, director of content at real estate marketplace Zolo and author of House Poor No More.
There are “deeper pockets” in the city’s real estate market, with foreign investors often choosing to buy investment property with cash or required by lenders to make large down payments because they have little financial history in Canada, Ms. King said.
Still, negative cash flow for local mom-and-pop investors isn’t rare, she added.
For many real estate investors, the main rationale for sinking hundreds of thousands of dollars into properties they won’t be able to rent out at a profit is the expectation of being able to sell at a much higher price.
In the GTA, “people are investing based on the capital gains,” Mr. Pasalis said. “They don’t mind if they’re cash flow negative each month because they assume the property’s going to be worth $50,000 or $70,000 more by the end of the year.”
For now, cash flow negative landlords can take comfort in the fact that price growth for condos hasn’t softened as much as that of low-rise residential buildings, Mr. Pasalis noted, speaking about the Toronto market.
Another group of investors ready to accept negative cash flow are those who buy properties as a future home for their kids, Mr. Tal said. Fear that the offspring will be permanently shut out of the real estate market is common in Vancouver, Ms. King said.
Still, rising interest rates could lead some cash flow negative landlords to offload their properties and dissuade some prospective condo investors from buying, with repercussions on the broader rental market, Mr. Tal said.
While the resulting uptick in supply and slowdown in demand could put some downward pressure on prices, it could have the opposite effect on rents, according to Mr. Tal.
That’s because a marginally smaller investor presence in the condo market will reduce the supply of units available for rent even as demand from tenants remains very strong, Mr. Tal said.
Canada is set to welcome more than 430,000 new permanent residents in 2022 with even higher targets for 2023 and 2024. International students have also been flocking back to the country, adding to the number of newcomers looking for rental accommodation.
The cooling off of investor demand for condos “is not something that is going to derail the market by any stretch of imagination,” Mr. Tal said. But it will increase the upward pressure on rents, he warned.
Larger mortgage payments could also increase landlords’ motivation to raise rents, he said.
While rent-control regulation limits many landlords’ ability to ask for more from existing tenants, there are ways to work around the rules, he noted. For example, landlords often raise rents after a renovation that requires tenants to move out.
The end result could be rising tensions between real estate investors feeling the financial squeeze and residents.
“There will be this tug of war between tenants and landlords,” Mr. Tal said.

Full text: The Dark Flood BY DEON MEYER, TRANSLATED BY K. L. SEEGERS, GROVE ATLANTIC, 416 PAGES The 14th crime novel by the ubertalented Deon Meyer is absolutely superb. Once again, we have detective investigator Benny Griessel but he’s been demoted from his Cape Town precinct’s elite murder squad, the Hawks. Griessel and his sidekick, Vaughn Cupido, fell afoul of political power in their previous book, The Last Hunt. Their reward for revealing corruption is to be shipped to a static post in a remote small town, but someone is watching out because the demotion and reposting are delayed and the pair end up in Stellenbosch, which also happens to be Meyer’s hometown. There’s still corruption and politics but at least it’s close to the Cape.
Along with the usual batch of very rich and a larger batch of very poor, Stellenbosch has a huge student population and the case that Griessel and Cupido catch is a missing student. Rich, white and solitary and somehow connected to a gang member. What appeared to be a missing kid on a naughty weekend instantly morphs into a possible kidnapping and worse. Then there’s the strange message that Griessel gets telling him that there’s trouble in the Stellenbosch police and to avoid the phones.
If all this sounds like a complicated plot, well, you know you’ve got vintage Deon Meyer. I’ve just touched on the early high points and a lot moves from there.
Meyer also has another plotline of a local real estate agent and a missing development magnate, which is loosely based on a true story from Stellenbosch. Lots of fun and, as always, yards of South African culture and colour and a lot of really slick humour. For those who don’t speak Afrikaans, there’s a glossary at the end to help.
One For Sorrow BY HELEN FIELDS, HARPERCOLLINS, 361 PAGES This is the seventh novel in Fields’s series set in Edinburgh, featuring the detective combo of DCI Ava Turner and DI Luc Callanach, and the first one I’ve read. I finished it in one weekend and then rushed to order the other six. I found this book completely riveting.
The title is from a children’s rhyme: “One for sorrow, two for joy. Three for a girl, four for a boy” and so on. It’s a clue about a terror bomber who seemingly strikes at random, and the police seem always to be behind. Then the clues start coming in. It’s soon clear that the “clues” are also traps for Turner and Callanach. They are the prey and the bomber is using his bombs to target them.
The book unfolds in two sections. One is the terror and the investigation. The second takes the reader into the backdrop and motive. Or that’s what it seems.
Just when I thought I’d figured this story out, it moves sideways and leads in another direction.
Fields is a superb plot master and she keeps the reader engaged right to the last paragraph. I can’t wait to read more in this series.
Darkness in the Light BY DANIEL KALLA, SIMON & SCHUSTER, 297 PAGES Trust Daniel Kalla to come up with the perfect post-COVID thriller. We’ve all read the stories about the psychological after-effects of the pandemic. We’ve also read about the shortage of trained professionals to deal with those after-effects. So Kalla delivers a psychiatrist, himself a recovering depressive, who works out of Anchorage, Alaska, treating patients in fly-in communities through virtual therapy. When one patient, seemingly doing okay, overstays her virtual time, he cuts her off. A few days later, she’s dead. Worse, she tried to take her four-year-old daughter with her.
That’s Kalla’s opening and it grips the reader. Dr. David Spears blames himself.
Weeks after Brianna’s suicide, another patient of Spears’s disappears. Amka Obed was a friend of Brianna’s. Could she have decided to kill herself? There’s no clue and, hoping that she’s alive, Spears heads for the far northern community of Utqiagvik, a place so small and isolated it seems no one could hide for long.
Kalla’s writing has grown over the years and this book, with its well-written descriptions of the far north, is one of his best. He blends social and cultural images into the thriller and keeps the pace running. A storyline, I was convinced was the plot, turns out to be a huge herring. Shows I can still be hornswoggled by a good twisty tale.
Framed In Fire BY IONA WHISHAW, TOUCHWOOD, 483 PAGES I really like a good historical mystery and Iona Whishaw’s books with Inspector Darling and wife, Lane Winslow, offer a delightful peek at old British Columbia.
Framed in Fire is No. 9 in this series, a point where many authors begin to flag but not Whishaw. This tale, which touches on Indigenous cultural issues, is more than a slick little whodunit.
It’s 1948 and Lane is back in New Denver, anxious to meet with her friend Peter Barisoff, but he’s out. She heads for a meadow in search and comes upon Tom, a man in search of his ancestral lands. Lane is intrigued by the quest but things go awry when Peter returns and the pair discover human remains near his garden. Are these recent or ancient? Regardless, Lane is obligated to inform her husband, Inspector Darling, that she’s intruded accidentally into his territory.
Just what happened to the corpse in the garden is only the beginning of this excellent mystery, which incorporates a lot of thought-provoking issues without resorting to boring speechifying. At the same time as the investigation into the body in New Denver, Sgt. Ames, back in Nelson, is investigating arson at the restaurant of the Darlings’ friends, the Vitalis. Then it all leads to an investigation of Darling himself. Definitely one of Whishaw’s best.
The Heights BY LOUISE CANDLISH, ATRIA, 406 PAGES “Kieran Watts has been dead for over two years when I see him standing on the roof of a building in Shad Thames,” begins The Heights. How does the narrator know Kieran Watts is dead? Because she killed him.
How and why and what transpires from this is the rest of this brilliant novel by Candlish. If you haven’t already discovered her, this is the book to start with, and then turn to the more than a dozen others, starting with Our House, soon to be a TV series.
Her plots are complex, her pacing slow and steady, and her settings take you right to the heart of the place. As for character, well if you can resist a narrator whose hate is all consuming and whose thirst for vengeance is as steady as a metronome, you should avoid good crime fiction. I read this book in two afternoons and could hardly stop to sleep. Look for it to end up on some “best of” lists.
Last One Alive BY AMBER COWIE, SIMON & SCHUSTER, 336 PAGES A witch hunt? When I read the blurb on this book I almost put it aside. Witches are not really my thing but I went back and discovered a well-written book with references to some good Golden Age mysteries. Still Amber Cowie is a B.C. author and I wanted to give it a chance and I’m glad I did.
The book begins with a death but an ordinary one. Marianne was a college history professor and writer. She died instantly of a brain aneurysm. Penelope Berkowitz was her best friend and is now her executor.
She is in Marianne’s apartment to clear out her personal items. One item of exceptional interest to Penelope is Marianne’s notebook. The dead woman had been working on a novel in which a publisher was interested. She also had notes for other works.
From there, we move to months later.
Penelope has published a successful novel, made a lot of money and that same editor is asking about a new novel. Penelope is stalling. She doesn’t have one. But she has notes for one. It involves a strange tale of a witch on Stone Point, a remote part of the Pacific Northwest. Penelope is planning a trip to Stone Point to examine the remains of the house where a century ago, the owner was murdered and his wife vanished.
More recently, a young couple bought the property with plans to turn it into an ecolodge for tourists. Work was barely begun when the couple disappeared.
There are some clues that lead to the supposed witch and Penelope sees the possibility of that elusive second novel. Penelope decides to carry out a trip to Stone Point with a group of Marianne’s friends and relations, a trip Marianne planned before her death. From the beginning, the trip seems cursed but then people start to disappear. Is there really a witch cursing Stone Point? I guessed the “secret” Penelope is hiding after the first five pages and you will too but that’s not really the centre of this plot. Just who and why and what is happening to the people who went the Point and who will be the last person standing is as clever a twist as Ms. Christie ever envisioned.

Full text: 489-539 King St. W., Southeast Mountain Penthouse, 18th floor, Toronto KING WEST Asking price: N/A Selling price: $16-million (April, 2020) Taxes: N/A Days on the market: N/A Listing agent: Riz Dhanji, RAD Marketing; Buyers’ agent: Neel Kawale, Haüskey Realty THE ACTION Westbank and Allied Properties collaborated with celebrated Danish architect Bjarke Ingels to develop an innovative, mixed-use building resembling mountain ranges in downtown Toronto. When plans were released, an unnamed local buyer combined two penthouse models into one for $16-million. It is the first penthouse sale for the project, dubbed King Toronto, and holds the record for the city’s highest preconstruction condominium sale in the past two years.
“The King Toronto penthouses are truly one-of-a-kind in the grand scheme of residential real estate not only in Toronto, but in North America, in terms of what they’re offering from a lifestyle and architecture perspective,” said Neel Kawale, co-founder and chief executive officer of Hauskey.
“[My client’s] been an investor in real estate globally and being able to look at a building by Bjarke Ingels was a big thing. He’s one of the top architects in the world, very focused on urban design that’s very unique.” WHAT THEY GOT Construction is under way on the King Street site, just west of Spadina Avenue, where units will cascade upward around a courtyard into four ‘mountain peaks’ each capped by two penthouses.
This custom, two-storey penthouse will have four bedrooms and 41/2 bathrooms, and encompass 5,865 square feet of living space occupying the entire southeast summit. There will be a double-height living room, a brassclad kitchen, a large dining area, a wine room and an indoor pool.
Six terraces will total another 1,200 square feet of outdoor living space, one with a hot tub.
Completion is slated for 2024.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “There are very few architectural or ‘starchitect’driven communities that are being built in Toronto and this really was a once-in-a-generation opportunity that Westbank has put together with their partners and Bjarke Ingels’s team,” Mr. Kawale said.
“It’s really exciting that at this stage of a project like this, an individual – my client – gets to work directly with the architect, developer and their whole team to customize their unit.”

As inflation soars, workers in low-wage jobs push for better pay

Full text: Canada’s high inflation rate is disproportionately affecting low-income workers, prompting some of them to demand higher wages from their employers, even if it means going on strike.
Thousands of janitors in downtown Toronto represented by the Service Employees International Union – most of whom clean some of the largest corporateowned office buildings – will hold a strike vote at the end of this week. They say basic necessities such as groceries and transportation have risen so dramatically in price over the past few months that their present earnings, which hover just above minimum wage, are simply insufficient.
“You have to remember that for low-income workers, you spend a higher proportion of your wages on things like food and housing. So the increases in groceries and fuel costs take a bigger chunk out of the spending of a lower-income person,” said Kaylie Tiessen, an economist and policy analyst at Unifor, Canada’s largest private-sector union.
Renielda Torcende has worked for C&W Services (owned by the commercial real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield) for just over four years, working 40 hours a week on a night shift that usually starts at 10 p.m. and ends at 6 o’clock in the morning. She cleans buildings at Toronto Metropolitan University, formerly known as Ryerson University, and earns $16.20 an hour. If she wasn’t assigned to work nights, she would earn 50 cents less an hour, or $15.70.
Recently, she started working as a nanny or a cleaner in private homes on weekday afternoons and weekends, blaming the rising cost of food and transportation for needing to take on a second and third job. Ms. Torcende is a single mother, and much of her earnings beyond rent, utilities and food go toward her school-aged son.
“I would love to have one job that pays me more so that I do not have to work a second job,” she told The Globe and Mail, adding that an SEIU strike might be financially painful in the short-run, but could mean an increase in hourly wages on par with inflation.
Canada’s inflation rate hit a 31-year high of 6.7 per cent in March, driven by persistent supply chain disruptions and the Russia-Ukraine war, which has pushed up commodity prices.
Approximately two-thirds of items in the Consumer Price Index – including gasoline, shelter and household appliances – experienced annual price gains of more than 3 per cent.
“We know that savings rates are really low for low-income people and they often are the ones to take on debt in a high inflation environment. So, ironically, the medicine to deal with inflation, which is raising interest rates, will again hit the poorest the hardest,” noted Mikal Skuterud, a labour economist at the University of Waterloo.
SEIU Local 2, which represents more than 4,000 cleaners in the Greater Toronto Area, is currently at the bargaining table with 11 different cleaning companies, among them C&W, Amphora Maintenance Services and GDI Integrated Facility Services. The key point of contention is wages – employers are willing to give janitorial staff hourly raises, but not anything close to the current rate of inflation, according to Tom Galivan, secretary-treasurer of SEIU Local 2.
“We are coming into bargaining after many of our members have been on the front lines of the [COVID-19] pandemic. The workers have taken a firm position that they are not going to take wage increases that are less than the rising cost of living,” Mr. Galivan said.
SEIU’s push for higher wages in the wake of severe inflation comes on the heels of a number of other union groups successfully negotiating inflation-level wage increases for their members, particularly those earning minimum wage.
After a week-long strike of 900 workers at a Metro grocery chain warehouse in Etobicoke, Ont., in early April, Unifor secured a 15.8-per-cent increase for its members over the next four and a half years, starting with an hourly increase of roughly 8 per cent in the first year.
Meanwhile, almost 200 warehouse workers at Sobeys in Terrebonne, Que., who are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers union remain on a strike that is now approaching its third month, as they demand better pay and benefits in a climate of high inflation.
According to Ms. Tiessen, unions have started seriously rethinking collective agreements they are locked into that do not have clauses that automatically grant wage increases that match inflation. “Before the 2008 recession, it was common for collective agreements to have cost of living adjustment (COLA) clauses. We are certainly paying more attention to all the different ways we can start negotiating COLA back into agreements,” she said.
Strikes by unions tend to increase either when unemployment rates are low or inflation rates are high, said Prof. Skuterud.
Using data from Statistics Canada, he studied wage changes for unionized and non-unionized workers by income categories over the past two years. His findings indicate that lowincome unionized workers have seen their wages remain relatively unchanged compared to their non-unionized counterparts – factoring in inflation, the latter group has, in fact, seen a slight wage increase.
“Unionized employers are slower to respond to inflation because they have to wait to get to the bargaining table first,” he noted. “I expect we are going to see many difficult negotiations in this era of inflation as unions try to make up for lost wages.”

Full text: Saba Farmand never planned on becoming a tour guide.
A landscape architect and arborist, he can be a little nerdy about urban design and streetscapes.
When he moved to East Vancouver’s Mount Pleasant neighbourhood five years ago, he was fascinated with the community’s boulevard gardens, so he started photographing them. He created an Instagram account, @eastvan_blvd_gardens, to feature the colourful and creative displays.
“I just really like going on walks through the neighbourhood, and I started noticing how many great boulevard gardens there were around here and how they dance with the surrounding streetscape,” Mr. Farmand says.
Boulevard gardens are what some people create in the tiny strips of land crammed between the sidewalk and the street. Ordinary residents, faced with these empty spaces in front of their homes and in commercial areas, take them over to plant flower gardens or grow vegetables.
Some are simple flower beds or neat rows of peas. Others are ornate works of living street art, combining flowers, shrubs and trees. More than a few are homes for gnomes.
In a city like Vancouver, where the cost of land is soaring, the gardens offer a way for everyday citizens to reclaim some ownership and pride over their neighbourhoods, and satisfy the need to tend land.
“Public gardens … often don’t have that same personality that a lot of boulevard gardens do,” Mr. Farmand says.
As his enthusiasm for these tiny gardens grew, so did his followers. Last July, a local environmental non-profit asked him to host a community walking tour. He agreed, as long as any money raised went to the Mount Pleasant Neighbourhood House, a group that supports recent immigrants and refugees.
It was a one-off event, but Mr. Farmand is still doing the tours on his own, advertising them on his Instagram account and donating the proceeds. The tours are becoming a neighbourhood staple, and a regular chance for Mr. Farmand to share his many thoughts on his favourite topic.
“Boulevard gardens help to increase the sustainability of a community,” he says. And he’s not just talking about the environmental benefits, such as providing flowers for pollinators and habitats for birds. He’s referring to the social and economic sustainability of neighbourhoods.
“You’re more likely to run into a neighbour and talk to them if you’re out gardening,” he says, adding that he notices people tend to be friendlier in neighbourhoods with more boulevard gardens.
A fascinating fact about these little gardens, says Mr. Farmand, is that most people assume they’re illegal. Many are surprised that the City of Vancouver actually encourages it, he says, so long as gardeners follow the published guidelines.
Hayden Kremer, the green thumb behind one of Mr. Farmand’s favourite street-side gardens, says when he first started, he figured he was probably breaking the rules. “I was completely in the dark that this was okay.”
Mr. Kremer has come to appreciate the community-building elements of gardens like his. His neighbours plan to start their own boulevard garden next spring.
But not every city allows boulevard gardening. For example, some municipalities in British Columbia’s Lower Mainland are still working to develop their own guidelines to allow it, Mr. Farmand says.
Gardening on public land can also come with challenges. Some have recounted tales of tomatoes mysteriously disappearing, he says. And two years ago – just months into the COVID-19 pandemic – there was a rash of tree and flower thefts from residential gardens in East Vancouver, including one case where the perpetrator was caught on camera ripping a Japanese maple right out of someone’s front garden.
But Megan Reiter, one of the gardeners whose plot is part of Mr. Farmand’s walking tour, says thefts are rare.
“With tulips, for example, if I have particularly exotic ones, sometimes they’ll disappear,” she says.
As the popularity of Mr. Farmand’s tour grows, he hopes to eventually expand beyond East Vancouver.
While he’s focused so far on photographing the gardens themselves, he plans to start a series profiling the gardeners behind them and maybe one day write a book. In the meantime, he’s planning more walking tours over the summer and will continue tending to his blossoming Instagram community.

Developing workplaces close to condos, residential areas prevents ‘warehousing’ people: Intensification and integrated spaces aim to breathe new life into downtown cores

Full text: Intensification is commonly associated with the building of housing at higher densities in neighbourhoods, but intensification of office, industrial and retail space is equally important to combat sprawl, developers say.
“The key to intensification is to move from the single use for a property [such as a mall] toward integrated community building,” says Ken Greenberg, principal at Greenberg Consultants Inc.
The reimagining of downtown Brampton, Ont. – Canada’s ninth-largest city – is just one example of the urban planning trend seen across the country, says Mr. Greenberg, who is a strategic adviser to the city.
The redevelopment includes the replacement of its centrepiece – the 53-year-old Shoppers World Mall – with a mixed-use neighbourhood featuring about 800,000 square feet of commercial space.
“It’s happening in a lot of places – elsewhere in Toronto, Winnipeg, Edmonton and more,” says Benjamin Shinewald, president and chief executive officer of BOMA Canada, an umbrella group for builders, owners and maintenance operators. “There is no lack of ambition to promote [intensification] in Canada’s commercial real estate community.”
The Well, a project now under construction in Toronto that spreads over 7.7 acres in the city’s King Street West neighbourhood (including the site of the former headquarters of The Globe and Mail), is another example. While much attention is being paid to the site’s 1,700 residential units, it also includes more than one million square feet of office space and 420,000 square feet of retail and food services.
According to former Toronto mayor and federal cabinet minister David Crombie, cities are recognizing the importance of finding the right mix of non-residential space – workplaces, recreation and entertainment and parks – in addition to housing.
“If you don’t build the workplaces in the areas where people live, you end up just warehousing people,” he says.
Winnipeg’s True North Square is another massive project designed to breathe life into a downtown core through intensification. Scheduled to be completed next year, the approximately $500-million project is designed as a centrepiece of a downtown entertainment district that includes the home of the National Hockey League’s Winnipeg Jets.
True North will feature four towers, with a total of one million square feet of class A office, retail, hotel and public space as well as affordable housing. The first building, opened in 2017, was the first privately constructed office building built in Winnipeg since 1990.
Edmonton’s Ice District is another hockey team-centred intensification project, in this case a $2.5-billion, 25-acre mixed-use district that includes the home of the Edmonton Oilers. The mixeduse district will also have a 50,000-square-foot public plaza, a climate-controlled winter garden, a hotel, a casino and three new office buildings, with the third one scheduled to be completed in 2025.
Commercial intensification is not a particularly new idea, Mr. Shinewald says, but it’s gaining more positive attention as planners and the public question the economics, efficiency and the lifestyles that come from urban sprawl.
“Everything old is new again.
Not long ago, people lived and worked nearby because of a lack of transportation. So, everything was cheek by jowl,” he explains.
“The automobile enabled distance between work and play, but many in the new generation want density – they want to walk or cycle to work or take an efficient train. They want to meet their friends for lunch or dinner and live a vibrant urban life, 24/7.”
It’s no easy task overcoming many decades of ingrained planning ideas that encouraged sprawling development, Mr. Greenberg says. Cities such as Brampton are re-examining these ideas as their populations explode and their infrastructure struggles to keep up, he explains.
He notes how Brampton, for example, is using the reconstruction of its core mall site to promote a “2040 vision to reimagine a future Brampton that grows not only in population size.”
The vision, which Mr. Greenberg collaborated on with the city, is based on Brampton growing from its current population of 600,000 to a projected one million, with the creation of 185,000 jobs that won’t necessarily require commuting.
Stopping sprawl is becoming a hot political issue in places like Ontario, where a wide coalition of planners, environmentalists, residents groups and others has been urging the provincial government to favour intensification.
So far, Premier Doug Ford has instead proposed a $10-billion highway that will cut across wilderness, wetlands and farms and the Ontario Greenbelt around Toronto.
Yet, intensification is costeffective, says planner Pamela Blais, principal at Metropole Consultants. In early April, she published an analysis of Edmonton that shows that “keeping growth within existing urban boundaries delivers [a] better fiscal outcome compared to business-as-usual sprawl, not to mention quality-of-life benefits too.”
The analysis shows that using Edmonton’s urban land more intensely for development (including commercial properties) would allow the city to keep its property taxes 10 per cent lower by 2065 than if new builds sprawl outside the city’s boundaries, where it can’t levy taxes.
It’s better for quality of life, too, Mr. Greenberg says. Brampton, for example, “will be a neighbourhood including office, residential, a main street with local shopping and a community hub,” he explains.
“It all works together.”

What has become of my old neighbourhood?: A daily walk through my city’s west end reveals staggering changes, most of them for the good

Full text: Every afternoon around 3 I try to get out of my home office and go for a walk. Each time I do, I marvel at how my neighbourhood has changed.
I live in the west end of downtown Toronto, near the intersection of Dundas and Dufferin streets. It is usually known as Little Portugal, though real estate agents have taken to calling my patch Beaconsfield Village. Queen Street West is at the bottom of my street and Dundas Street West at the top. The buzzing Ossington Strip is just a few blocks away. A few steps farther is Trinity Bellwoods Park, where the young gather to sprawl on the grass on summer weekends.
When we moved here in 1989, no one would have called it a fashionable part of town. After I told my father what we had paid for our 16-foot-wide, 100-year-old, semi-detached house he helpfully remarked: “A quarter of a million for a place in a slum?” Our part of Dundas was an uninviting stretch of auto-repair shops, shady karaoke bars and old-fashioned menswear stores that no one ever seemed to shop in.
Queen was known for its greasy spoons and used-appliance stores crammed with beat-up fridges and stoves. The Drake Hotel at 1150 Queen West was a dubious establishment with a bar called the Stardust Lounge.
That is ancient history now. The Drake was renovated and reopened years ago, becoming the beachhead for a hipster invasion that has turned my ‘hood into one of the hottest in Toronto. People come from all over town to visit its drinks bars, coffee bars, clubs, restaurants and boutiques, now stirring back to life as pandemic fears ease. Local house prices have gone from crazy to stupid to obscene. A little twostorey semi on the next street over is on sale for $1.9-million. So there is plenty of change to take in.
I start my walk by heading south to Queen, passing lots of houses under renovation and a few sporting For Sale signs, one of them from Sotheby’s, no less. Then I turn east to head along Queen, passing the Drake, turn north on Ossington and then back west along Dundas. On the way I pass galleries, bistros, nail salons, hair salons, a sourdough bakery, a chocolaterie, a croissanterie, a Cuban-food joint, an Israeli/Palestinian food joint, way too many cannabis shops and several of those carefully curated, minimally stocked clothing shops that bring to mind the Portlandia episode Two Girls, Two Shirts.
Sometimes it all seems a bit much. The local craft brewery offers an IPA, Ghost Orchid, named after “the coveted but endangered flower” and featuring notes of mandarin orange, white grape and pine. A sweets shop makes themed pastries for fans of Harry Potter, Star Wars and other cultural phenomena. “We believe in magic, adventures, and Love is Love is Love,” its website declares.
On the other hand, sweets are good. Fun is good. People are good: they are thronging the once-grey streets again, meeting, shopping, drinking or just promenading.
What is sneeringly referred to as gentrification often brings money and action to rundown parts of old cities. Some locals have cashed out their real estate winnings and moved on. Others, like several of my Portuguese neighbours, have stayed, no doubt shaking their heads at all the change but deciding to live out their old age where they are most comfortable.
Not all of the ‘hood’s old character is lost. We have two thriving Portuguese butchers around the corner from us, along with a hardware store, a car mechanic, a couple of old-style barbers where a haircut doesn’t cost the Earth and a pair of corner stores that carry everything from soft, freshly baked Portuguese buns to mangoes from Asia to charge cords for your phone.
As remarkable as what has disappeared is what hasn’t. Several little travel agencies cling to life, who knows how? Incredibly, a coin laundry survives on Ossington amid the wine bars. So does a cigar manufacturer and two self-storage places, though a big hardware store has now closed. That museum-like menswear place that nobody ever entered is still there on Dundas – and still nobody goes in.
It would be obtuse to suggest there have been no downsides to this great transformation. People of average means have been priced out. My kids say they can’t imagine being able to buy a house like the one where they grew up. The divides between rich and poor are starker, with more obviously wealthy people around and more vulnerable people, too, some of them panhandling on the sidewalks as the scene passes.
But much of the change has been for the good. The area has greater variety now, greater vitality. There are more people around, many of them living in the host of mid-rise condos that have risen on or near the main streets. It feels like a place that is surging forward instead of standing still.
Cities change, neighbourhoods change, times change. I can’t imagine what I’ll see on my daily walk 10 years from now.

Preserving an ‘extreme wood’ retreat: While renovating North Vancouver home, new owners were careful to keep elements of late Henry Yorke Mann’s original design

Full text: 1043 Clements Ave.
NORTH VANCOUVER Asking Price: $2,195,000 Taxes: $6,547.12 (2021) Agents: Jason Choi and Trent Rodney (West Coast Modern Group) THE BACK STORY The late Henry Yorke Mann was born in the mountains of Rossland, B.C. He grew up to become a ski racer, then an iconoclastic architect known for his embrace of “extreme wood.”
His 2015 obituary in The Globe and Mail described Mr. Mann as one of the earliest and most ardent proponents of the heavytimber, handcrafted architecture that would visually symbolize 1960s West Coast bohemianism.
Mr. Mann built his own house of cedar on Clements Avenue in North Vancouver in 1958. The 700-square-foot dwelling was set deep in a stand of trees about one mile from Capilano Canyon.
After Mr. Mann’s tenure, the property changed hands a few times before Peter and Anne Buchanan discovered it for sale in 1990.
Mr. Buchanan, an architect, and Ms. Buchanan, an interior designer, could see right through the double tongue-and-groove cedar walls in places, but they were charmed by the wellplanned interior.
“On the outside, it really did not look like much,” Ms. Buchanan recalls, “but inside it was all wood, which we loved because we’re outdoors adventure people.”
The couple purchased the property and Mr. Buchanan began to think about how he would go about preserving Mr. Mann’s retreat.
“It really wasn’t a building that was going to survive for any length of time,” he says. “Anybody in their right mind would have taken the building down and it would have gone to landfill.”
The couple lived in the house for a few years while they contemplated a new design. As they prepared for the renovation, a man knocked on the door while Ms. Buchanan was at home, surrounded by small children, preparations for Christmas and packing boxes. It was Mr. Mann, who had stopped by to see what had become of his haven.
“He was so happy we were going to do a renovation,” she recalls. “He said, ‘I can see why an architect would want to build on this.’ ” THE HOUSE TODAY The Buchanans began by removing the built-in furniture from the cabin and biowashing the interior.
Mr. Buchanan knew the existing cedar box would not support additional stories, so he worked with a local structural engineer “who supported adventuresome thinking” to devise a plan to build on top of Mr. Mann’s structure.
He created a concrete foundation perimeter around the existing cedar box, then placed a fir exoskeleton on top to support a new second and third floor. Glass gaskets separated the exterior walls of the old and new structures.
“I wanted to do something that was a counterpoint to the existing building and that was adventurous,” he says.
In the early years of his career, Mr. Buchanan had gained experience building boats and an airplane; he used those skills to do much of the work himself in a workshop he built on the property. The home’s slanting roof was inspired by marine architecture.
He also recruited an ambitious young builder named Jason Hart and, following eight months of construction, the Buchanans moved back in.
The roof was still covered by tarps and the interior was unfinished, but the couple worked on the project as they raised their two children, Nevada and Max.
While the children were small, Ms. Buchanan ran a neighbourhood daycare out of the house.
Mr. Buchanan was a principal at the global design firm Stantec, where he was immersed in designing airport terminal buildings, water-filtration plants and other large projects.
After 26 years, the Buchanans moved to Whistler, where their firm North Architecture Studio takes on mainly residential projects.
The next owner to take over the stewardship of Mr. Mann’s hideaway was Melissa Noel, who still owns the house today.
In 2018, Ms. Noel and her partner were recognized with a North Vancouver District Heritage Award for their renovation.
“They were the right buyers,” Mr. Buchanan says of the thoughtful restoration.
Ms. Noel says she started out with plans for a light refurbishment, but the project became more involved. Her first priority was to turn the first floor – Mr. Mann’s original hideaway – into a separate suite that would help to pay the mortgage if necessary.
“Because the house was originally all on one floor, we could almost go back to what it was,” she says.
She reused the kitchen cabinets on the lower level. Upstairs, she installed a new kitchen with a palette of neutral tones and minimalist design that would not compete with the architecture.
Today, the house has three bedrooms and two bathrooms in 1,910 square feet of living space.
The basement suite can be used as a separate unit.
Inside, Ms. Noel preserved the living space as Mr. Buchanan designed it. The fir interior and an open staircase at the centre of the house are intact. Throughout the home, Ms. Noel found grey accents so she carried that through by painting some of the walls and the stair’s metal rail in deep charcoal.
The third-floor primary suite has a new, modern bathroom; pop-up ceilings; and a walkout to a cedar deck in the treetops.
Ms. Noel refinished the home’s cedar decks and railings and added new landscaping. It was important, she says, to leave the trees as untouched as possible to maintain the feeling of serenity.
“Some people would have trimmed the branches, but you’re looking out at the trees and you have that privacy.”
Ms. Noel says the third-floor deck is a relaxing spot for a glass of wine on a summer evening.
“You look up to Grouse Mountain.” The property was listed in early April with an asking price of $2.195-million and sold after seven days for $2.375-million.
THE BEST FEATURE The Buchanans say the project allowed them to experiment with materials and natural light.
They used reclaimed wood and recycled glass wherever they could.
“We were very conscious of our environmental footprint all the way through,” says Mr. Buchanan, who used many of his techniques in subsequent projects.
Ms. Buchanan also used the interior as a canvas, painting and repainting walls and metal elements in various palettes over the years to enhance the wood.
“We loved the honesty of it – the expression of real material and the natural light,” Mr. Buchanan says. “It’s a piece of sculpture.”

Full text: New housing data offer a first-time view of the relationship between immigration and property ownership in cities where real estate prices have climbed highest, Vancouver and Toronto.
The data released last week show the degree of property ownership, as well as values and total family incomes, for every category of immigrant. Out of all immigrants, those who obtained citizenship through the controversial Quebec investor immigrant program have the highest assessed property values, either as a single property or multiple properties. Many have long suspected that the Quebec program has operated as a backdoor for wealthy immigrants who opt to buy properties in Vancouver and Toronto instead of remaining in Quebec, which was the intention of the program.
The Canadian Housing Statistics Program released 2020 data that show investors to the Quebec Immigrant Investor program owned, on average, a single property in Metro Vancouver valued at $1.940-million – the highest property value out of all admission categories. The average family income for that group is $70,000. By comparison, the average income for immigrants who owned a single property in Vancouver was $130,000.
The Quebec investors also had the highest average total assessed value for multiple properties in Vancouver, with an average total assessment of $4.6-million in properties. The average multiple property immigrant owner had a total assessed value of $2.7-million. The average family total income for multiple property owners for Quebec investors was $100,000, compared with the average of $190,000 for all admission categories.
The CHSP, which is part of Statistics Canada, provided the data as a valuable glimpse into the realities of Canada’s housing market. The data also included the finding that 15 per cent of individual owners (as opposed to institutional investors) own 29 per cent of all British Columbia’s housing stock.
The intent behind the Quebec program is that investors, who must have net assets of at least $2-million, among other requirements, intend to settle in Quebec. Critics argue that, while they’re supposed to stay in Quebec, it’s impossible to stop investors from moving elsewhere. It’s a passive investment – requiring $1.2-million injection into the provincial government to be returned interest-free after five years – without having to set up an actual business. (The investment amount had been $800,000 but was increased in 2018). In return for the loan, those high-net-worth individuals are pretty much guaranteed permanent residency in Canada.
It has proven to be a hugely popular program. Immigration lawyer Colin Singer describes it in a video online as the most popular investment visa program in Canada. The program began in 1986 and had been processing 1,900 applications a year before it was put on pause. Quebec, which has its own immigration policy, won’t take new applications until April 1, 2023, pending review.
Critics say the problem with the program is that while Quebec has enjoyed the investment money, other provinces have funded health care and grappled with the flow of foreign capital into their housing markets – particularly B.C. and Ontario.
In Toronto, the Quebec investor multiple property owner had an average assessment value of $2.4-million. Average family income totalled $90,000 for that same group.
There was a parallel federal immigrant investor program, also hugely popular, that ran for 28 years, but that program was cancelled in 2014 amid concerns that investors were not paying their fair share of taxes and there was little economic benefit for Canada. However, the program’s longterm effects show up in the CHSP data as well. The average total assessment value of the federal investor immigrant who owns a single property in Vancouver is $1.580-million, with an average family income of $75,000. The average total assessment value of multiple properties held by a federal investor in Vancouver amounted to $3.8-million. That category of immigrant had an average family income of $110,000.
Approximately 30,000 people purchased property in Vancouver through both investor programs, according to the data.
It is important to note that these investors are not deemed “foreign buyers,” because they are homeowners who hold citizenship, says Andy Yan, director of Simon Fraser University’s city program. The foreign buyer statistics that are routinely cited by the provincial government, for example, do not include this group.
The new data illustrate the importance of considering capital flows from foreign sources and not just the number of foreign buyers. The new temporary ban on foreign buying included in last week’s federal budget, for instance, deals only with foreign buyers, not foreign capital inflows. The ban also exempts foreign students, which has raised eyebrows. Several years ago, student homeowners made headlines for owning some of Vancouver’s most expensive properties. The most controversial example was the UBC student who bought a $31-million house. Students living in Vancouver appeared to be proxies for foreign wealth, and lenders were giving them preferential loan terms.
Dr. David Ley, University of B.C. professor emeritus, has said that all levels of government have courted foreign money for decades. In B.C. in 1988, the province began courting Asian money when the resource-based economy went into decline. He says the reach out to Asia Pacific was illustrated best by the sale of the vast Expo 86 site to a Hong Kong property development consortium in 1988.
“It was a sale that put Vancouver on the radar of property investors in Asia and established networks with the Canadian property sector. The development and real estate companies had formed an informal growth coalition with government, designed to sustain off-shore capital flows into B.C.,” Dr. Ley said in an e-mail.
“Regular trade missions by all three levels of government spread news of opportunities; the federal government alone sent five ‘Team Canada’ missions to Asia in the 1990s. The Business Immigration Program (which included investors) provided the means for both capital and capitalists to enter British Columbia.”
CIBC chief economist Benjamin Tal spoke at the Vancouver Real Estate Forum on April 12, and he said that new immigrants play a key role in the housing market.
An estimated 70 per cent of the 405,000 new immigrants who were admitted last year were already in Canada on temporary visas, which means they speak the language, probably hold jobs and are therefore already well on their way to buying property.
“It’s not just the number of immigrants, but their ability to buy a house and participate in the labour market,” Mr. Tal said.
He said the composition of the immigrants is also important, because there is a labour shortage in the construction industry and so far Canada is not attracting those workers.
“In my opinion, the No. 1 factor limiting supply of real estate now, the new housing in Canada, is labour. You cannot find it. And when you do find it, the charge is enormous. It’s crazy,” Mr. Tal said.
Mr. Yan says the system is failing new immigrants who’ve arrived to work and settle if it also allows new immigrants who are here because they are wealthy and have an appetite for real estate investment. The 110,565 immigrants who came through the federal skilled worker program and purchased a single property had one of the highest total family incomes, at $120,000, and a far lower average property value of $990,000. Although skilled workers outnumber the Quebec investors to Vancouver by a factor of 10, the latter camp has greater spending power, and the ability to drive prices upward.
He’d like to see data on exactly how many properties the wealthy investor group owns.
In this way, immigration policy and housing policy go hand in hand, he said.
“Immigrants from around the world are being sold the dream of Canada, and yet with housing unaffordability where local incomes are so decoupled from housing costs, you’re pulling out the first rungs of that dream. Canada is inviting the world to a dinner party and it turns out to be a potluck for multimillionaires.”

Full text: Alberta Investment Management Corp. said it posted a 14.7per-cent return for 2021, one of the top numbers for large Canadian pension funds.
The results mark a turnaround for AIMCo from 2020, when a $2.1-billion loss on derivatives in the early days of COVID-19 hobbled returns.
Heading into the pandemic, AIMCo’s public-equities portfolio included a strategy that bet against sharp swings in stock prices. That resulted in significant losses when COVID roiled markets.
AIMCo unwound the strategy in April, 2020, but the fund manager posted just a 2.5-per-cent return for the year. Since the blow-up, the fund manager has appointed a new chief executive officer, chairman and chief investment officer.
AIMCo called 2021 the strongest year in its history. The return on the benchmark investment portfolio it compares itself with was 8.0 per cent. Total assets at the end of the 2021 were $168.3-billion.
The annualized total fund returns over four and 10 years are 7.4 per cent and 8.6 per cent, respectively. All returns are after investment costs.
AIMCo invests globally on behalf of 32 pension, endowment and government funds in Alberta. Some member funds have been unhappy for quite some time: the Local Authorities Pension Plan, or LAPP, has complained that AIMCo underperformed its expectations for years, even before the derivatives mess.
AIMCo said each of its investment departments exceeded its benchmark.
Public equities – shares of companies traded on stock exchanges – returned 23.4 per cent, above an 18.1-per-cent benchmark. They now represent about 38 per cent of AIMCo’s portfolio.
Money-market and fixed-income investments – AIMCo’s second largest asset class, at 35 per cent of the portfolio – produced a 1.1-per-cent loss, better than a benchmark loss of 2.2 per cent.
AIMCo reported large gains in several departments that invest in private assets such as real estate, infrastructure and private companies.
AIMCo said it had a 65.9-per-cent return in its $8.2-billion private-equity department, well above its 8.8-per-cent benchmark.
Some of the deals in the private-equity department in 2021 included an initial public offering of pool-equipment seller Hayward Holdings; the sale of a stake in insurance-industry technology specialist Davies Group Ltd.; and the sale, with the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, of a majority stake in Environmental Resources Management.
AIMCo reported a 14.5-per-cent return in its $18.3-billion real estate department and a 19-per-cent return in its $10.6billion infrastructure department. Those returns topped their benchmarks by 6.8 percentage points and 12.2 percentage points, respectively.
Each of the “Maple Eight” big Canadian public pension plans serve a different demographic of benefit recipients, with a different mix of liabilities. So, their portfolios – and the returns they should expect – differ.
That said, AIMCo’s 14.7-per-cent return ranks as the second-highest figure among the five plans that report returns on a calendar-year basis.
OMERS, with $121-billion in assets, has reported the highest return at 15.7 per cent. The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, with $419.8-billion in assets, posted a 13.5-percent return for 2021. The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, with $221-billion in assets, reported an 11.1-per-cent return for 2021. The Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP), with $114.2-billion in assets, recorded an 11.28-per-cent return on investments for 2021.

Are we witnessing the last gasps of globalization?

Full text: Professor of finance and holds the Ben Graham Chair in Value Investing at the Ivey Business School, University of Western Ontario Globalization shrunk the world. Free trade in products and services, unencumbered movement of people, ideas and capital, open capital markets, production and technological inventions, public support for global trade, and adherence to international law reached record levels. The world economy and stock markets thrived.
By displacing expensive workers in developed countries with the cheaper labour force of China and India, the increased pool of labour drove wages down, or prevented them from rising in Western economies, thus keeping inflation low. While manufacturing jobs disappeared at an alarming rate, service jobs increased. The difference between financial services compensation, for example, and manufacturing wages skyrocketed in Canada, Britain and France, and flattened out or declined in China and India.
What is most disconcerting is that the last time we witnessed such a run-up in the difference between financial services and manufacturing compensation was in the 1914-30 period – which began with the demise of an earlier era of globalization and ended with the stock market crash and the Great Depression.
Wars tend to lead to an end of, or challenges to, globalization.
The wave of globalization in the 19th century, ending by the time the First World War broke out, was followed by protectionism and instability. There were efforts to improve economic co-operation after the Second World War with institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, but the absence of the Soviet Union as a member of those institutions made globalization and economic co-operation difficult.
Fast-forward several decades: The fall of the Berlin Wall, the breakup of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War in 1989-91 ushered in the new era of globalization. The admission of China to the World Trade Organization in 2001 completed the picture.
But, as early as 2007-08, concerns started to arise in the United States when critical industries such as semi-conductors, artificial intelligence and other sensitive high-tech fields made dependence on foreign producers a high security risk.
As a result, as early as 2008 companies started to gradually transition toward more local production, with U.S. exports falling as a share of GDP. Trade data between 2008 and 2020 show that exports (goods only) declined on average by 0.1 per cent per annum as opposed to an average 7.4-per-cent increase per annum between 1991 and 2007. The trend accelerated during the pandemic owing to significant supply chain problems. Companies have now started to place higher importance on having goods for manufacturing and distribution close by. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia will intensify the trend.
The surge of new manufacturing in North America is increasing the demand for labour, and since there are not enough workers around to fill the jobs, wages are rising. In December, 2021, there were 11.4 million unfilled jobs in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics.
Moreover, in his recent State of the Union speech, President Joe Biden called on U.S. businesses to bring even more production back home. At the same time, China, Russia and India are challenging globalization.
In my opinion, the secular trend toward globalization has now ended. Notice the similarities with previous end-of-era periods of globalization: a pandemic that has been likened to a war; challenges to globalization by large players such as Russia and China; and rising protectionism, economic instability and galloping inflation.
Deglobalization (with events in Ukraine auguring a new Cold War) and resultant rising inflation and increasing real interest rates create a bleak outlook for the stock, bond and real estate markets. The outlook appears particularly unfavourable for growth stocks, which will be hurt the most by deglobalization and inflation. Their underperformance will also have an adverse effect on the whole market as the share of the technology sector in market indexes has increased steeply in recent years.
Moreover, during the Cold War years between 1966 and 1991 – with U.S. inflation averaging 4.3 per cent annually – value stocks outperformed growth stocks by 10.8 per cent per annum, whereas between 2008 and 2020 – when inflation averaged only 1.7 per cent – growth outperformed value by 4.2 per cent.
The U.S. Federal Reserve may not be able to help this time, as it will be facing a Catch-22. The ballooning debt issuance around the world (including margin debt) in recent years have made economies and financial markets very sensitive to interest rate increases. Between 1991 and 2007, U.S.
debt-to-GDP averaged 60.3 per cent while between January, 2008, and February, 2020, it averaged 98.8 per cent and between March, 2020, and December, 2021, 126.5 per cent. The Fed may abandon the inflation mandate to support the financial system as it has done in the past, but given the amount of debt outstanding in the face of the structural changes referred to above, this may lead to financial markets and the economy falling too quickly to bail out.
The markets have yet to discount this outlook.

Is Canada’s real estate market bound for a big fall or more gains? Taking a look at the case for both

Full text: We all wonder how any middle-class earner can buy a house at today’s prices. But our indignation on that point may be reducing our focus on an equally important question: Even if you can afford to buy a house, should you?
The answer hinges on what you think will transpire over the next couple of decades. If home prices continue to surge higher, homeowners will grow richer and richer while renters fall even further behind.
But if home prices stagnate or even fall over the next couple of decades, the reverse is true. People who have strained to gain a foothold in today’s real estate market will face years of zero or negative returns on their investment. The truly lucky people will be those who avoided buying a house at today’s lofty prices.
So which is it? In talking to housing market experts in recent months for other stories, I’ve been struck by how unsure even the gurus are about the long-term outlook for home prices. As one economist said to me, “There is no more efficient way to look like a fool than to make a housing price forecast.”
Absolutely true. So, allow me to put on the dunce cap and sum up some of the views I’ve encountered.
First up, here’s my case for a big fall.
Housing bears have argued for years that Canadian real estate is absurdly overpriced when compared with historical norms. After the enormous gains of the past two years, their case is stronger than ever.
“The outlook for affordability is grim,” Royal Bank of Canada warned in a recent report. The total cost of home ownership – including mortgage payments, property taxes and utility bills – is now at its highest level compared with median incomes since 1990, by the bank’s calculations.
If this ratio were to move back toward its long-term average through a decline in home prices, some local markets could be hard hit.
Halifax home prices would have to tumble 26 per cent just to get back to the level of affordability that prevailed at the end of 2019, RBC estimated.
Ottawa property would have to slide 24 per cent and Toronto real estate 22 per cent.
The most likely catalyst for declines would be significantly higher borrowing costs. In early 2020, the Bank of Canada dropped interest rates to nearly zero to cushion the economic blow of the pandemic. That gusher of essentially free money helped propel home prices more than 30 per cent higher over the next couple of years.
The gusher is now dry. In an emphatic reversal of its pandemic- era policy, the Bank of Canada doubled its key policy rate this week and signalled more hikes will follow.
Higher interest rates are unlikely to shake the housing market so long as households continue to bask in a robust jobs market and pandemic wealth. Over the longer run, though, Canadians are painfully exposed to every upward tick of monetary policy.
Household debt has now reached a record 186.2 per cent of household disposable income, compared with 181.1 per cent just before the pandemic and 152.6 per cent at the time of the financial crisis in 2008, according to Statistics Canada.
Given that towering level of indebtedness, any sustained move toward higher interest rates could threaten Canada’s housing bonanza.
THE CASE FOR MORE
GAINS Housing bulls like to take a global perspective. They argue Canada’s housing prices may be high against their own history, but aren’t outrageous compared with international rivals.
A 700-square-foot apartment in prime areas of Vancouver and Toronto costs less than in places such as Boston, Stockholm and Berlin, National Bank Financial estimates. When calculated in terms of home prices to household incomes, the run-up in Canadian housing prices since 2015 is high, but not outlandishly so when compared with other advanced economies, according to data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.
For now, strong demand continues to support Canadian home prices. The federal Liberals have substantially boosted Canada’s immigration target to more than 400,000 newcomers a year. Yet Canada is building significantly fewer new homes per capita than it did back in the 1970s and 80s. As long as we continue to construct only 200,000 or so new units a year while admitting 400,000 new Canadians, it is difficult to see how home prices can slide too far.
Could a burst of new construction change this picture? The federal government’s Budget 2022 included a program to accelerate housing development, but much of the real power in this area resides with provinces and municipalities. It is those levels of governm ent that control zoning restrictions and building permits. Until they move, not much will happen.
Some provinces are thinking about it. A recent Ontario task force on housing affordability suggested the province sweep away many restrictions on new construction and set a bold goal of adding 1.5 million homes over the next 10 years. For now, though, that remains a recommendation, not policy.
THE BOTTOM LINE
From under my dunce cap, the outlook for home prices over the next two decades seems moderately unattractive. Strong demand will continue to offer support, but higher interest rates are likely to constitute a powerful headwind.
Over the longer haul, political pressure to do something about home prices is likely to result in more construction and more supply.
This doesn’t mean buying a house right now is necessarily a bad idea, but it does suggest future gains are unlikely to repeat the boom of the past few years. New buyers may want to keep their hopes in check.

Full text: The seaside town of Forte dei Marmi, in northern Tuscany, was virtually unknown outside Italy 20 years ago. The snub of Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich was instrumental in putting it on the map.
In the summer of 2008, Mr. Abramovich – the now heavily sanctioned owner of the Premier League’s Chelsea Football Club – anchored his superyacht, Le Grand Bleu, off Forte dei Marmi and tried to make a dinner reservation at the elegant Ristorante Bistrot. The restaurant was fully booked, so he and his guests were turned away. Reportedly angry, Mr. Abramovich left town and pointed his yacht to Sardinia.
The story took off in Italy. National newspaper Corriere della Sera noted that when the billionaire asks for something, “few have the courage to say no.”
Suddenly, Forte dei Marmi – Fort of the Marbles – was famous.
Rich Russians flooded in, spending lavish amounts renting or buying villas and developing resort hotels that catered to the ultrarich. “This became a Russian city in the summer – ‘Little Russia,’ they called it,” said Ettore Giannecchini, co-owner of the Morinotto property agency, which has done a lot of business with Russians. “But now they are suffering. We probably won’t get so many of them this year because of the sanctions.”
Shop and restaurant owners fear the sanctions will keep the northern visitors locked inside Russia this summer. But for the town residents, the news is not all bad. A few rich Ukrainians are trickling into town, seeking refuge from the war.
One fairly recent villa buyer is none other than Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The gated property, positioned well back from the beach and surrounded by the villas of wealthy Russians, has become a popular video-shooting location for the Italian and international media.
Forte dei Marmi’s winter population of about 7,000 triples or quadruples in the summer, largely because of the arrival of Russians, with some Swiss, French, British and Germans added to the moneyed mix.
The town is located roughly halfway between Pisa and La Spezia on the Tyrrhenian Sea. In recent centuries, it served as the port town for the shipment of the white or blue-grey Carrara marble favoured by some of the top Renaissance and Baroque sculptors, including Michelangelo.
Lately, tourism has been its lifeblood – but not just any tourism. The prices of villas – even to rent – are considered obscene by Italian standards. Local real estate agents say it can cost between 100,000 and 150,000 (about $130,000 to $200,000) to rent for July and August. Some owners have paid almost 15million. Even booking a spot on the beach – a chaise longue and a sun umbrella – at one of the private beach clubs can set you back thousands for the summer (in high season, public beaches are rare in Italy).
Rumours – never backed up – have it that Russian President Vladimir Putin owns a property in Forte dei Marmi. The town is just down the coast from the marina where the Scheherazade, a US$700-million superyacht reportedly owned by Mr. Putin, is currently docked.
Forte dei Marmi obviously caters to wealthy non-Italians. The boutiques around Piazza Cavour, more or less in the centre of the elongated town, include Tod’s, Loro Piana, Paul & Shark, Louis Vuitton and Armani – shops you would find on the smartest fashion streets of Milan, Rome and Paris. The cars and restaurants, some of which offer menus in Russian, are expensive, as are the galleries, where the wealthy buy art to decorate their homes.
One such gallery is Oblong, which also has one on Bluewaters Island in Dubai. The shop is full of contemporary paintings and sculptures from some of the best-known European artists, including the late Polish sculptor Igor Mitoraj. Oblong’s managing partner, Paola Marucci, said she sold a fairly small Mitoraj to a Russian in 2021 for 160,000.
That was the last good year for Forte dei Marmi. This year, the town is bound to see a financial downturn.
“It’s impossible for us to plan,” Ms. Marucci said. “We don’t know if the Russians will come since [the sanctions] mean they can’t pay with Visa or Amex. Maybe the Arabs or the Ukrainians will come.”
Mr. Giannecchini of the property agency said the first wealthy Russians came in the early 2000s.
He remembers a senior executive of Lukoil, one of the world’s top oil and natural gas producers, being among the pioneers. Word spread about the delights of the small seaside resort, and other Russians followed. “There was a chain of them,” he said.
He and the Italian media have said that the rich Russians and oligarchs who rented or bought villas over the years include Oleg Deripaska, the aluminium magnate now under sanctions (his spokesperson in Moscow declined to confirm or deny that Mr. Deripaska was once a Forte dei Marmi regular); Dmitry Bosov, the coal industrialist who was found dead of a gunshot wound in his Moscow apartment in 2020 (his death may or may not have been a suicide, according to various reports); Alexander Knaster, the Russian-American founder of Pamplona Capital, now backed by sanctioned oligarch Mikhail Fridman; and Oleg Tinkov, the financial and retail entrepreneur who, in 2014, was ranked as the 15th-richest person in Russia, with a fortune then estimated by Forbes at US$8.2-billion, and who was indicted for tax fraud in the United States in 2019 (he paid a US$509million fine in a plea agreement last year).
Mr. Tinkov appears to have the most visible presence among the wealthy Russians in Forte dei Marmi. Recovering from leukemia, he is often spotted cycling in the area – until 2015, he owned the Tinkoff professional cycling team, which competed in the UCI World Tour.
He owns the Datcha collection of luxury hotels and resorts, which includes a small palace in the centre of Forte dei Marmi.
Built in 1930, only about 30 metres from the beach, it is one of the most prominent and elegant buildings in town and evidently caters to billionaires, not millionaires. The Datcha website says each of ten rooms starts at 69,000 a week – the equivalent of $13,500 a night. Guests can also rent the hotel’s 28-metre Pershing 9X yacht for 9,900 a day, excluding fuel, tax and port charges.
Mr. Tinkov is trying to distance himself from the Kremlin. On a recent Instagram post, he said he is against the war, denied any connection to Mr. Putin and claimed he was not an oligarch – that he does not owe his wealth to political connections and is not in Mr. Putin’s pocket.
“I have never been to the Kremlin,” he said. “I’m self-made, please stop calling me ‘oligarch.’ … The second reason to exclude me from the list of oligarchs, I am no longer a billionaire.”
Forbes estimated his fortune has fallen more than US$5-billion since the start of the war, partly because of the sanctions against him. The magazine put his postinvasion worth at US$800-million.
Mr. Zelensky must relish the problems of the Russian oligarchs who own properties in Forte dei Marmi. According to various Italian, British and Ukrainian media reports, he bought his relatively modest villa in 2017, two years before the TV comedian became President, for about 3.8-milion through an offshore company. It reportedly has 15 rooms, a pool and a large garden. Local property agents said he could rent it in the summer for about 12,000 a month – a relative bargain. (Neither Mr. Zelensky nor his wife, Olena, have confirmed the villa is theirs.)
Visited by The Globe and Mail, the villa is shielded by high fences and gates and looks unoccupied. Mr. Giannecchini and other residents say Mr. Zelensky has never been spotted in town. One Italian news site called him a “ghost tourist” in Forte dei Marmi. This year, at least, he has a good reason for staying away.

BoC’s rate hike expected to slow hot housing market: Major lenders raise key rates after central bank’s decision, increasing mortgage costs for consumers

Full text: The Bank of Canada’s aggressive rate hike will push up borrowing costs and likely start to slow the country’s booming real estate market after two years of rapid home price increases.
Mortgage rates had already spiked before the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 1 per cent on Wednesday – its second increase in two months and its largest hike since the turn of the century. Now, borrowing is becoming more expensive as the typical home price across the country nears $900,000.
Within hours of the Bank of Canada’s decision, major lenders raised their prime lending rate, which will increase borrowing costs for homeowners with a variable mortgage.
“As rates move up, it’s going to become harder and harder for households to be able to qualify or afford mortgages at the price levels that we’ve reached,” said Jimmy Jean, chief economist at Desjardins Securities. “Given the cumulative effect of interest rate hikes, we could see prices coming down a bit.”
Toronto-Dominion Bank economist Rishi Sondhi said home prices in Toronto and other hot markets could start to ease in the second half of the year. “Higher interest rates will cool demand, with the most pronounced impacts likely to take place this year,” he said.
Bank of Montreal senior economist Robert Kavcic said: “There was a lot of excess demand built on the fact that home prices were expected to keep rising quickly. As that expectation changes, the demand disappears, and does so very quickly.” In its announcement, the Bank of Canada said higher rates will be needed to tame inflation, and predicted that housing activity will moderate. But the bank’s senior deputy governor, Carolyn Rogers, said home prices are expected to remain high.
“We should remember that it’s starting from an extremely elevated level, so even as it moderates, we still think it will stay high,” she said at a news conference on Wednesday.
The last time the central bank successively raised interest rates was in 2017 and 2018, in response to the real estate frenzy in Toronto and Vancouver.
The overnight rate moved to 1.75 per cent from 0.75 per cent. The higher borrowing costs, combined with tougher mortgage qualification rules and foreign buyer taxes, helped to calm the market frenzy.
Today, the popular five-year fixed rate mortgage is between 3.49 per cent and 4.29 per cent, according to mortgage broker Angela Milosevic, who has brokered home loans in the Cambridge and Kitchener-Waterloo area for about 16 years. “Obviously, the borrowing cost will increase and it will affect the borrowing power,” she said. “It may curb some buyers.”
Borrowers seeking mortgages from banks, which usually have the cheapest loans, will have to prove they can make their home loan payments at a higher interest rate. Under the mortgage stress test, the minimum qualifying rate is the higher of 5.25 per cent or two percentage points above the borrower’s mortgage contract. With the five-year fixed mortgage rate now around 4.29 per cent, that means borrowers must prove they can pay their loans with an interest rate of 6.29 per cent.
Even before Wednesday’s announcement, the volume of buyers had started to wane in some of the country’s hottest markets, such as Milton, a growing Toronto suburb.
“We’re definitely seeing a shift,” said Melissa Charlton, broker with the Charlton Advantage real estate team, who has sold homes in the Milton area for about 17 years.
The latest stats for the Toronto region show that monthly home price increases slowed in March.
In the Halton area, which includes Milton, the typical home price dropped 2 per cent after rising 7 per cent from January to February, according to the local board. National resale and home price stats are expected next week.
“Buyers are a little bit more wary and also they have more options,” Ms. Charlton said. She added that she noticed a change around mid-March after the first interest rate hike. Homes are taking longer to sell and not drawing as many bids.
However, she does not think demand will dry up. She said her buyers are not that concerned about rising interest rates. Ms. Charlton said she has found that when interest rates rise, prospective buyers start looking at cheaper alternatives to a detached house. “Maybe they could just barely afford that detached and will shift into a semi, but they’re still looking and interested,” she said.

Concerns cloud property ownership registry: B.C.’s land record aimed at finding hidden owners is bogged down by delays, lack of clarity

Full text: When politicians around the globe went looking for the property of oligarchs to potentially seize as worldwide condemnation kicked in over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month, British Columbia joined in.
But Finance Minister Selina Robinson quickly announced the province was unable to determine whether there were any Russian holdings in the province because a much-touted land registry aimed at finding hidden owners – also known as “beneficial owners” – wasn’t anywhere near complete enough to be of use.
B.C.’s Land Owner Transparency Registry, a first of its kind in Canada and touted by the government as a world-leading effort when it was created in May, 2019, only had information on 37,000 owners, with a total of 66,000 properties. That’s a tiny fraction of the province’s 2.2 million titles worth $2-trillion.
Full compliance with the registry, which was supposed to be in effect by November, 2021, has now been delayed a year, a result of heavy lobbying by B.C. lawyers.
They have complained that the province’s definitions of beneficial ownership are unclear, and that there are problems with how much personal information is revealed.
The B.C. branch of the Canadian Bar Association recently sent a lengthy letter to registry administrator Reuben Danakody outlining adjustments lawyers would like to see. Some are technical, such as allowing duplicate forms and more characters in an entry box, and some appear to go to the heart of the registry’s purpose.
“One of our primary concerns is ensuring the confidentiality of our respective clients’ information. The registry is accessible to all … users within a firm and there is currently no ability to restrict certain users’ access to draft filing forms or previously filed forms,” says the letter dated March 17.
“Given the sensitivity of information included in the filings, many property owners and clients have expressed serious concern with the preservation of their private, personal information once uploaded to the registry.”
Damon Chisholm, a partner at the law firm McMillan and a specialist in the registry’s evolving rules, said he has witnessed these concerns firsthand.
“With this level of drill-down, it’s difficult to walk a client through. And with the client, there’s a concern about giving up a lot of private information and they don’t know where it’s going,” he said, adding that it’s especially difficult when the client is a foreign entity that doesn’t have registry requirements in their home countries.
The registry’s rules are so unclear that law firms are being left to interpret what the intent is, Mr. Chisholm said, with the result that different firms are coming up with different answers and advice for clients.
For example, he said ownership is defined differently in the forms required for the registry and those required for the 20-percent provincial property tax that foreign buyers pay. The two provincial systems also have a different bar for who has to be declared an owner.
The delay caused by those kinds of concerns has led groups and people who monitor foreign ownership and global corruption to express disappointment at how the registry has not lived up to the potential the government promised.
“There was a lot of ambition a few years ago. That’s come to a stall,” said James Cohen, the Ottawa-based executive director of Transparency International Canada. “It was a big step forward and there was a lot to applaud B.C. for, so hopefully we’ll see that ambition pick up.”
The sluggish rollout is no surprise to those familiar with land dealings and ownership complications in the province.
“It was a very difficult law to write. We’ve brought in this very complicated system,” said Ron Usher, general counsel for the Society of Notaries Public of B.C.
That system is, in part, the result of how multilayered property ownership can be.
Most pieces of land in the province are owned straightforwardly by individuals whose names are listed in public records. But many thousands are held by trusts, real estate investment companies, partnerships and, occasionally, obscure companies whose real directors are hidden from view – all ultimately part of a group commonly referred to as “beneficial owners.”
Those are people who benefit from the property and its value even though their names might not appear on the land registry at the B.C. Assessment Authority.
Even parents who loan children money for property and are then listed on the title, with as little as a 1-per-cent share, are considered beneficial owners who have to comply with the requirements of the new registry.
Accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers noted in an article last year that B.C.’s law is part of an international trend to allow for more scrutiny owing to concerns about “use or misuse of private corporations and trusts for tax evasion and other illicit activities.”
Elsewhere in Canada, Manitoba is setting up a registry, as is the federal government. Several European countries have registries in place or are working on them.
But each country is moving at a different pace and with slightly different policies on how accessible the information will be and who is included.
In B.C., sorting that out has become the main reason for the delay, a Finance Ministry representative said.
“Because the legislation is new, there were some areas of concern and confusion regarding how to register and who was required to do so,” ministry spokeswoman Lisa Leslie said.
Complying with the requirements may require parties to look through a chain of ownership, she said.
“For example, a corporation may have a significant shareholder that is itself another corporation. This shareholder corporation may in turn have shares owned by the trustee of a trust or by another corporation. The reporting body must look through the chain until they identify the individuals with ultimate control over the reporting body.”
One example of that kind of complexity was the high-profile purchase five years ago of Grouse Mountain by a newly created company named GM Resorts LP, whose incorporation documents showed a dense web of ownership.
The company was represented by a man named Kenny Zou in news coverage during the sale, who told the CBC that the property would be operated by a “completely Canadian company through and through.”
But figuring out who was actually involved in the purchase was difficult.
The public is legally entitled to look at the incorporation documents of private companies by requesting access from the law office that handled the company’s setup, something few regular citizens or even journalists know. As well, there is public access, for a fee, to founding articles and annual reports of all companies registered in B.C. Still, those documents don’t provide a clear picture of who qualifies as a beneficial owner.
GM Resorts LP was described in the company’s release as an entity established by CM (Canada) Asset Management Co. Ltd., a Canadian company with more than 60 per cent Canadian investors. China Minsheng Investment Group was described as a silent international investor.
But the incorporation documents at Fasken Martineau had three other companies named in the partnership, along with shares owned by various other entities, including a holding company based in Hong Kong, a numbered company in B.C. and another B.C. holding company, all with their own directors, most of whose identities weren’t included in the GM Resorts documents.
There were indications that some of those entities held shares but nothing to clearly show who qualified as a beneficial owner.
(The resort was bought back in 2020 by B.C.’s Gaglardi family.)
A final complication in the land registry’s troubles, lawyers say, is that the province simply hasn’t done a good job of telling people they have to comply.
“A year ago, the B.C. government committed to circulating notices to property owners alerting them to the November 30, 2021, filing deadline. However, by November, notices had not been sent. The government’s social media campaign was laudable but didn’t have the reach necessary to raise sufficient awareness,” Clare Jennings, the local bar association president, said in an e-mail.
“The registry is the first of its kind in Canada. But even today, many property owners in British Columbia are unaware of their obligations under LOTA and the approaching filing deadline,” she wrote, adding the rules were communicated to lawyers but not to property owners directly.
Even once everyone is notified, B.C. is going to have to put some muscle into its enforcement if the registry is going to have any impact, both Mr. Cohen and Mr. Usher said.
Tracking down all the levels of ownership, along with doing whatever it takes to find out if there are silent “handshake” deals between a legal owner and a secret beneficial owner, is hard work, they say.
“To truly enforce it would be breathtakingly expensive,” Mr. Usher said.
As a result, the people registered so far are those whose situations are relatively easy to document.
“The only people who have paid the price are regular people.
Who it’s catching is not Russian oligarchs but mom and dad who co-signed for their son’s condo.”

Full text: On the second day of the world men’s curling championships in Las Vegas, you can count the number of spectators at the morning draw. One hundred and ten. One hundred and eleven if I’m counting myself, because there’s no point sitting up on the media bench when there’s acres of empty real estate directly along the ice.
There’s the woman in the Viking helmet. There’s a quartet of women who sing “That’s the way, uh huh, uh huh, I like it” whenever Scotland does something good.
Later four Canadians with glittered ball caps and an N, an A, a D and an A emblazoned on their T-shirts will show up. I guess C and the third A get the night shift.
We’re sitting in the hockey arena attached to the Orleans Hotel & Casino. In Las Vegas, there’s the Strip, there’s off-Strip and there’s wherever the Orleans can be said to be.
It rises incongruously out of what looks like the warehouse district. They call this sort of place a locals’ casino because tourists don’t often make it out this far. Hence, the curling.
Over the past decade, Vegas has become curling’s de facto home city. Six major international events – four Continental Cups and two men’s world championships – since 2014. It’s far more than any other city anywhere.
It started out a wonderful novelty. The Orleans Arena was close to its 7,000-seat capacity for that first Continental Cup.
Canadians and Canadian ex-pats on tour made up the vast majority of the crowd – 95 per cent, according to organizers. They did even more business the second time around.
If that was a party, this looks like the hangover.
“I was hoping this would be the turning point, for curling and for the pandemic,” says Craig Savill, a Canadian former world champion who’s here coaching the Czech team. “It’s been sad to see no one out there.”
What happened is a warning for all destination events that had become used to a time when travel was carefree and money was flowing. In curling’s case, they killed the golden goose. Then just to make sure, the pandemic backed over it a couple of times.
If you’re worried about COVID, the Orleans Arena is a great place to hide from it.
But just a few hundred feet away, the Orleans’ casino floor is humming at 10 in the morning.
For those like me who haven’t travelled much since 2020, Vegas right now is a largescale experiment in exposure therapy. If your personal comfort bubble has expanded in the past little while from six inches to six feet, this is where it gets popped.
You may have forgotten how a few things feel. Such as getting jostled in a crowded elevator. Or having strangers grab hold of you to squeeze by. Or coughing.
Now that we’re all hyper-attuned to displays of illness, the only thing you hear in any Vegas crowd is all the coughing.
The pandemic is one reason there’s no one here this time. Another is scheduling.
Those Continental Cups will held in the middle of winter. The men’s world championship happens in spring. Which leads into a discussion about farming.
Another thing organizers here tried to figure out is where exactly all those Canadian curling fans come from. The top three provinces – Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan.
When that’s your target audience, scheduling a curling extravaganza in early April is like staging a downtown music festival on May Two-Four weekend – your customers have other places to be.
“Curling is a farmers’ sport,” says Bob Larson, a long-time volunteer at curling events who’s travelled down from Alberta to help out. “Spring is when cows calf.
Spring is when farmers don’t leave their farms.”
No farmers equals no crowd.
Larson is the first of about a hundred people to tell me this. One guy pantomimes the calf emerging from the mother, presumably because he worries that a city doofus like myself thinks beef grows in the ground.
Another person who tells me this is Joe Killoran.
Curling in the desert is Killoran’s baby.
This started as part of an effort to lure a Winter Olympics back to the area. The 1960 Games were held at a resort not from from Lake Tahoe.
The idea was that if you show some ability to host top-tier winter sports events, the Olympics will eventually take notice.
Between Los Angeles holding the 2028 Summer Games and Salt Lake City making noises about bidding again, that effort has faded. Whether it’s inertia or unreasonable hopefulness, the curling continues.
The Continental Cups – a light-hearted Ryder Cup-type of event pitting Canada’s best teams against the rest of the world – seemed like a good fit. The attendance in 2014 proved the organizers right.
But the Continental Cup is a quickie event by curling standards – four days from start to finish.
Anybody who’s spent time in Vegas knows that a day there is like a week anywhere else. A long weekend can feel like a month, and can cost just as much.
The men’s world championship stretches over two weekends. Here’s another thing people kept saying: “A 10-day event in a 48-hour town.”
The first time the event was stretched to a lengthier, less party-oriented tournament – the 2018 men’s world championships – attendance crashed. Organizers sold 1,100 full packages.
So how’s it looking this time?
It takes a while to track down Killoran.
When I ask one curling official if he has a better way of contacting him than the ones I’m using, the official says to me, “I don’t.
And if you do manage to get hold of him, let me know how I can.”
That’s because Killoran – by title, CEO of Sports Nevada USA – is doing everything here. He’s putting together the merch table. He’s making sure people get into their rooms okay. With no little bit of pride, he’ll tell me that if you call the ticket hotline, he’s the one who answers.
When I finally do arrange to meet him, he comes into the room looking like he’s just hopped a few fences to get here. His hair’s all over the place. He’s bug-eyed.
He’s just a bit breathless. You know that look when someone’s neck-deep in the weeds? This is that look.
Killoran, 59, is a former local sportscaster. He’s also one of those great American true believers. He doesn’t work with colleagues. He works with colleagues “who have become my close, close friends.” He name drops and name checks with such relish, it’s difficult to keep up.
He tells a long story involving his buddy Nick and the breakfast buffet. It takes me a while to figure out that he means Olympic curling gold medalist and world defending champion Niklas Edin of Sweden.
Killoran’s evident care that this tournament goes off well and safely – he gets teary eyed when he talks about the volunteers such as Bob, “who have become like family” – makes it hard to ask the obvious question.
How many people are here? “I can tell you that,” Killoran says, his voice jumping an octave.
“I have no problem telling you that.”
He pulls out his phone and begins scrolling through email.
“I haven’t looked at a ticketing report all week. I’m not going to worry. So lemme see … full event packages? Two-hundred and thirty-eight.”
Killoran says this as though 238 is the exact right number he was expecting, even hoping, to see.
But without turning toward us, the media volunteer sitting at the back of the room listening to all this mouths the word “Wow.”
The empty stands would be bad enough, but the talent is also restless.
You can roughly divide top-tier men’s curling into two groups – the happy-to-be-there guys and the must-win guys.
Here in Vegas, the happy-tobe-there guys are happy to be there.
“There’s nothing else you can ask for,” says Italian skip Joel Retornaz. “A great hotel facility.
Great ice conditions. The pool. It’s nice to play curling in this way, and not always in the cold.”
Many of the other Europeans give some version of this answer.
The must-win guys have another take.
After the first of two dispiriting last-minute losses in the round robin, a clipped Edin is defender of Las Vegas, curling hot spot.
“What’s there not to like about this place?” Edin said.
The incongruity of it, maybe?
A cold, parochial sport in a hot, flashy place?
“Every fall, it’s the same thing when we go to Toronto,” Edin said. “It’s 30 degrees.”
Edin has established many remarkable firsts in his career. And now he is the first man to climatologically liken Toronto to the Nevada desert.
The next day, Edin’s had a change of heart about the conditions: “Feels like playing in a curling club. Very unpredictable.”
He’s just won one, so maybe he thinks it sounds less like complaining and more like an observation.
But the real critic is Canadian skip Brad Gushue. Gushue may be the best quote in sports. Everything he says sounds as though he wrote it down first to get it just right. When he cuts you, it’s surgical.
He’s winning here, but he’s not happy with how the rocks are curling.
Right after a win, when a reporter asks him when he got comfortable on the ice, Gushue says, “When I got off it.”
A week ago, the Orleans Arena was being used as a hockey rink for a local minor-league team. To hear Gushue tell it, it’s still a hockey rink.
“I’ve played here three times and the ice is always difficult,” Gushue says. “For a Continental Cup, you can deal with it because it’s more about the show. But at a world championship, you want to see incredible shot making.
You’re not going to see that on this type of ice.”
And the empty seats?
“The virus is still around. If you haven’t had it, this is a pretty scary place to be,” Gushue says.
“You know you’re going to be exposed to it. I can understand people’s hesitation about coming down here.”
So is Vegas played out, curlingwise?
“Hopefully we’re back here in the future. But for more of a Continental Cup-style event.”
Ouch.
Even Killoran, a man supercharged by positivity, sounds unsure.
“Curling works here. Whether you call it odd or quirky, but curling works. How many other places in the world can you enjoy your curling and then walk out and have a nice straw beverage sitting poolside?” he says.
“There’s a definite growth opportunity here. We just have to see how the dust settles.”
Killoran said there are no plans to do more curling events in Vegas.
At the Orleans, the Brier Patch – a regular social and drinking gathering at every curling championship – is at the pool. As the event MC has it “going from the hard water to the soft water.”
I head out there in the early afternoon at peak straw-beverage time. It’s just one parking lot over.
A few scattered couples face down on their chairs, gently baking. No flags. No pin exchange. No straw beverages. No woo-hoo’ing of any sort.
It raises an existential question – if the Patch is empty, can it really be said that curling happened at all?

Full text: Late last summer, as Canadians dared to hope they were emerging from COVID-19, a handful of the country’s business leaders stepped back to capture their company’s journey through the pandemic.
Thirty CEOs from businesses on the front lines of the health crisis – airlines, long-term care homes, grocery stores, retailers, restaurants, banks and hotels – wrote deeply personal accounts of what they’d experienced over the prior 18 months. They reflected on how those lessons will shape their companies – which employ a total of a million people around the globe – and their country going forward.
The stories became Unprecedented, a book compiled by investment banker Steve Mayer, president of Greenhill Canada, and Globe and Mail columnist Andrew Willis that will be published on Tuesday. When COVID-19 hit, there was no case study or textbook on how to manage the crisis. Now there is.
Unprecedented reveals the experiences of leaders who were accustomed to making decisions driven by bottom-line profits, and informed by reams of data, suddenly finding themselves making choices based on shared corporate values, not financial results. CEOs of iconic companies such as Lululemon, Couche-Tard, Sobeys, Brookfield Asset Management, Canadian Tire, Air Canada, Telus and Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts offered their personal takes on how they managed through unprecedented times.
To navigate the crisis, CEOs talked about the need to be agile, empathetic and intuitive. Several pointed out that the challenges they faced were compounded by inaction, vacillation or lack of clarity from political leaders and government institutions.
The book, published by Signal/McClelland & Stewart, an imprint of Penguin Random House Canada, highlights the permanent changes in the way we do business. “Candidly, prior to March 2020, I would have said that if you were working from home, you weren’t really working,” said Clearco CEO and CBC Dragons’ Den veteran Michele Romanow, who wrote the foreword to the book. “The improvements in productivity we have seen during the pandemic show that going forward, companies can and should be flexible around how to structure their workplace.”
Proceeds from Unprecedented are being donated to United Way Centraide Canada for COVID-19 recovery across Canada. To date, companies involved in the project have pledged more than $3.5million. Here are excerpts, edited for length, from executives whose reflections will ensure the hard-earned lessons of this painful time will help Canadians cope with the inevitable next crisis: DINO BIANCO, KRUGER PRODUCTS Kruger is Canada’s largest supplier of toilet paper It was March 2, 2020, when I received a text from a good friend saying Costco had run out of toilet paper. That can’t be, I thought.
Costco always had lots of inventory. I had to see this for myself. I got in my car and drove to my local Costco, in the Toronto suburbs. I could not believe my eyes.
People were pushing shopping carts filled with toilet paper. The floor pallets, normally piled high with Kruger Products’ Cashmere and Purex brands, were empty. In that moment, I knew that life was about to become very different.
On March 12, I received a call from a Globe and Mail reporter who wanted to do an article on toilet paper based on hearing of the short supply. That’s odd, I thought. With all the challenges going on with COVID, why do they care about toilet paper? Nobody ever cares about toilet paper. Until, of course, you don’t have any. So I did the interview. I took an upbeat tone. I reassured Globe readers that our toilet paper was made in Canada, we had lots of supply, and what consumers were experiencing was short term and the shelves would be stocked again soon.
Well, I was only partially right.
We were shipping toilet paper at record levels to retailers, but as soon as an order got to the store, it was gone. Panic-buying had set in. Under Maslow’s new hierarchy, toilet paper ranked near the top, right after food, water, and shelter! Suddenly people realized that this product that everybody used but never really thought about had become the beacon for the COVID crisis. If you run out of pasta, you have rice; run out of oranges, you eat apples; but run out of toilet paper, then what?
As the Canadian market leader in the category, at a family-owned, Montreal-based company with one hundred years of history in this country, I realized I had a responsibility to ease the mounting uncertainty around a basic household staple. I told the outlets that our production came from Canada – many people thought most of our toilet paper came from China. I informed them we had lots of capacity to produce and encouraged them not to hoard and to buy only what they needed so that more people could get toilet paper.
My message didn’t get through.
From the first Canadian lockdowns in March right through to July, we could not catch up to the panic-driven demand. Our plants were running at full capacity, day and night. Not only were we short on toilet paper, but demand for paper towels and facial tissue spiked. People were stuck at home and clearly decided to clean anything and everything.
As I reflect on the time before the pandemic, I had always thought that, as a leader, I was prepared to handle pretty much anything that could come my way. I’m at the stage in my career when I thought I’d seen it all.
Then came COVID.
JOSÉ CIL, RESTAURANT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL RBI owns Tim Hortons, Burger King, Popeyes and Firehouse Subs One morning in May, 2020, our general legal counsel, Jill Granat, called me to say that the White House was seeking our opinion on several policies. I was anticipating a brief phone call with a policy advisor, but then quickly learned that I was being invited to meet with President Donald Trump and a half-dozen other restaurant leaders at the White House a few days later to discuss policy options on how to balance the protection of U.S. citizens while continuing to stimulate the U.S. economy.
The meeting would include discussion of the Paycheck Protection Program, a loan program for small businesses (many of our franchisees would participate) backed by the U.S. federal government’s Small Business Administration, so I knew that it was important for RBI to have a voice at the table.
My parents both emigrated from Cuba to Miami as children, and although my father has passed away, I felt their pride in my being able to represent our industry. The journey to Washington, D.C., through deserted airports and on an almost empty airplane, was a surreal experience. I was told that when I arrived at the White House, we would be tested for COVID, and that unless they tapped us on the shoulder during the meeting, all was fine.
The White House meeting was in the State Dining Room, an impressive if not imposing space used to host receptions and banquets for visiting heads of state, with a large portrait of Abraham Lincoln above the central mantel.
As I walked around the room, looking for my seat, I saw Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, and Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council. I was also looking out for fellow restaurateurs like Thomas Keller of the French Laundry, Niren Chaudhary of Panera, and Will Guidara of Eleven Madison in New York City, but I wanted to first find my seat.
When I located my name, I observed that I would be sitting next to Secretary Mnuchin, who was placed a socially distant six feet to my left, and as I looked to see who would be seated on my right, I couldn’t see a nameplate in front of the chair. As I looked more closely, I noticed that the unmarked chair was in the centre of the table, directly in front of the mantel and the Lincoln portrait and flanked by two flags.
Dozens of cameras were set up directly opposite.
I realized I would be sitting next to President Trump, and the seriousness of the moment dawned.
President Trump and VicePresident Pence soon came in together, and not long after that we all sat down. President Trump spoke briefly in introduction and then turned to the topic at hand, saying “We’re here with the leaders of the restaurant industry” and noting that we had been tremendously impacted by COVID.
Then, sure enough, he turned to his left, looked at me, and said, “We’ll start with you.”
One of the things I made a point of emphasizing in my comments at the White House was the need to expand the Paycheck Protection Program past the eight-week deadline that had originally been envisioned.
“When it was implemented, eight weeks probably seemed like an eternity,” I said at the time. “But today we’re in the tenth week of the pandemic and I think it’s going to take some time for our restaurants and our owners to get back to the capacity levels and the traffic levels that we were seeing pre-COVID.” I took the opportunity to suggest extending the program to twentyfour weeks, to allow restaurant owners to be able to manage through and rehire their employees over a longer period. In fact, the program ended up being extended for an additional year, through the end of May 2021.
That White House meeting was just weeks into the pandemic, when everyone still thought that the tide would start to turn within weeks. Looking back at that moment from the vantage point of more than a year later, as we continue to weather the effects of the pandemic and its repercussions, it’s striking how much has changed economically, politically, and medically.
DANI REISS, CANADA GOOSE Maker of performance luxury apparel We knew from news reports that frontline workers and essential public and private sector organizations across Canada were running perilously low on personal protective equipment, or PPE – another acronym the world added to its COVID vocabulary in those early months. Canada, a first-world nation with many ostensible advantages, had a clear deficit when it came to our mostly extinguished manufacturing sector. That became heartbreakingly clear as government officials scrambled to secure sought-after PPE from other nations and fell short in their efforts. Staff at nursing homes were reusing N95 masks, and workers across the country desperately needed items like sterile masks, gloves, visors, surgical gowns, caps, and booties. Frontline workers, the people who worked tirelessly through the most terrifying early weeks of the outbreak, were left vulnerable.
At Canada Goose, we saw the PPE crisis unfolding and knew very quickly what we had to do. We came to a decision to make whatever PPE we could. As a brand whose roots lie in making products that protect people from the harshest elements, it made good sense to pour all of our efforts into protecting the people of Canada from this terrifying disease.
I have championed our “Made in Canada” commitment proudly for over two decades, and at a time like this I realized just how vital that was to helping hold our nation together. If there was one thing Canada Goose could do with our closed factories and furloughed staff, we could make the PPE that our frontline workers so desperately needed, no matter what it would cost us.
I knew that if we were going to do it, we would have to do it right.
We began without contracts, knowing that we were in a position to help. In March, we jumped in. We retrofitted our factories and recalled and retrained our workers. All eight of our facilities worked at full, but modified, capacity to churn out PPE for our dedicated Canadians working on the front lines of the crisis After we reopened our factories to make PPE, I visited our Scarborough facility. It was an incredibly emotional highlight of an otherwise scary time. Every single worker on the floor was filled with purpose. It made me incredibly proud to know how many of our people, caught up as we all were in the fear and uncertainty of the pandemic, were prepared to come back to our factories to help our country.
Over the course of the pandemic, Canada Goose made over 2.5 million units of scrubs and hospital gowns, supplied at cost, across our facilities in Winnipeg, Toronto and Montreal.
REBECCA McKILLICAN, McKESSON CANADA Owner of Canada largest drug distribution network and the Rexall, IDA and Guardian chains The pharmaceutical supply chain is truly global, and at this time [April 2020] we saw various countries – such as India, China, and others that typically export active pharmaceutical ingredients used for producing common pharmaceutical products – in various states of lockdown. They had halted their pharmaceutical exports over fears about how they would manage the health of their own populations. Countries became protectionist, and it had immediate implications for us in Canada.
Our customers at McKesson Canada are some of the largest retailers and hospitals in the country. Both our own retailers and our customers were placing incredibly large orders from us each day and understandably calling into our customer care centre at unprecedented volumes.
We needed to discourage hoarding by our customers. We implemented product ordering limits.
Often times, we are the only distributor for a certain drug in Canada, so if we allowed a few eager customers to order the product in large quantities, there would be nothing left for other cities, provinces, territories, hospitals, and pharmacy retailers.
On March 24, we made the critical decision to look at the historical weekly demand of each customer, and adjusted their allowable order limits based on their historical demand. We calculated this would provide a reasonable buffer for customers – a chance to get extra product and serve the healthcare needs of their patients. We knew that, outside of COVID-19, there were no different illness patterns related to chronic or acute care in the country, so historical data should be sufficient in predicting forward-looking demand. It seemed the most equitable thing to do, and it would ensure patients across the country continued to get their medications.
That is easy to say but hard to do when faced with healthcare professionals across the country working under very stressful and unknown conditions. Try telling hospitals urgently needing medication that we’re going to have to monitor ordering behaviour and scale back if we notice unusual activity. Yes, exactly. Predictably, people were not happy. We received hundreds of concerned calls every hour from governments and customers alike.
Through my previous retail experience I was accustomed to having to occasionally communicate to customers that their favourite shampoo or food item was out of stock. However, being in a situation where we had to communicate to some of the largest retailers in Canada, or our own healthcare teams at pharmacies like Rexall, Guardian, IDA, and Uniprix that we were holding back pharmaceutical products or tempering their orders – that was a whole new world for me, and for our teams.
BRIAN PORTER, BANK OF NOVA SCOTIA Canada’s third largest bank has 90,000 employees in more than 30 countries One day in late April 2020, with the pandemic just over a month old, I was at Scotiabank Arena helping to put together meals that would be distributed to frontline workers at hospitals, charities, and shelters. The initiative was supplying ten thousand healthy meals a day to people putting themselves at risk to help others. I was moved by the efforts of the people there giving of themselves for their community.
Moved, but not surprised. Canada is a generous, open place where people look out for one another. I knew then that however difficult this challenge proved to be, we would pull together and come out stronger on the other side.
We were getting close to that other side in late June 2021 when another event took place at Scotiabank Arena. This time, we had helped organize a mass vaccination clinic. Over the course of the day, more than twenty-six thousand people would get their first or second vaccines, a global record. The event had a joyous, celebratory feel, one of those moments when we all felt like life might soon start getting back to normal.
But I couldn’t help thinking that maybe we could do even better than getting back to where we had been before the pandemic.
Those difficult eighteen months revealed this great country’s many strengths, but they also exposed shortcomings that need to be addressed, both to prepare for the next crisis and to ensure our prosperity in the decades ahead.
On the first count, we simply must make our healthcare system better, and that means investing in it. As chair of the University Health Network, a research and teaching hospital network in Toronto, I saw first-hand the impacts of the pandemic on the system. Yet the issues existed before the pandemic. Although the population density in the Greater Toronto Area has grown substantially, the number of hospital beds has fallen. The answer isn’t just more beds; many services can be delivered in the home or the community if the necessary funding is there. As well, this country used to have vaccine manufacturing capability, but it no longer did by the time COVID struck. We were reliant on others for the life-saving shots The pandemic highlighted several economic issues that need serious attention. One is a housing shortage that has seen real estate prices skyrocket. While Canada has significantly increased the number of new Canadians it welcomes every year – a move I fully support – our housing stock hasn’t kept pace with the population growth. Governments at all levels must work together to remove the obstacles to the construction of housing.
We also have to look at our economy and determine where the strengths are and how we sustain them. Where do we have a strategic competitive advantage?
How can the government enhance investment? We’ve had issues with productivity – a key measure of economic growth – in this country for a long time.
For years we have been satisfied living in what some call the 2% trap, with modest economic growth of that order being the norm. How do we break out of that trap to create the robust growth that will add to the prosperity of all Canadians? Part of the answer may be to fashion what one might call a modern industrial policy. we must identify the sectors where we can lead and win and make sure those sectors get the support they need to compete globally. We must aggressively pursue our economic interests and encourage entrepreneurship, innovation, and creativity in all their forms. Let’s not allow the lessons of this difficult time slip past us. Rather, let’s seize the opportunity to make Canada an even better country for all.
The Bank has a part to play here. I have often described the role of Scotiabank, and of other financial institutions, as being that of shock absorber for the economy. We are responsible for most of the capital allocation in this society. During difficult times like the ones we just went through, that capital provides a backstop for the businesses, large and small, upon which the economy depends.
That social and economic responsibility is part of the reason that I consider banking to be more of a calling than a career.

Home builders see challenges in Ottawa’s program to speed construction: Sector says $4-billion accelerator fund introduced in budget unlikely to address root problems of housing crisis

Full text: Home builders are warning that Ottawa’s new $4-billion fund to help municipalities move faster on new home approvals faces significant hurdles in speeding up the pace of construction in Canada.
Thursday’s federal budget estimated that the country needs 3.5 million new homes by 2031 to house a growing population. That would require housing starts to double from an annual average of around 200,000 units to nearly 400,000.
A key measure in Thursday’s budget aimed at helping reach that target is the Housing Accelerator Fund, which is supposed to help spur construction of 100,000 new homes over five years by providing financial rewards to cities that can quickly build homes.
“It sounds wonderful. Is it gonna work?
I doubt it,” said Scott McLellan, a senior vice-president with Plazacorp, which is building condos in the Toronto region.
Under the program, municipalities would be eligible for payments from Ottawa if they increase the pace of approvals for new home construction.
Mr. McLellan said he does not know if throwing more money at the development process will address the problem of local councillors supporting pushback from local residents who want to halt approvals when condo buildings and other multiresidential homes are slated for their neighbourhood.
The budget did not provide much detail on how the housing accelerator fund would work except to say that it could include an “annual per door incentive,” for cities, as well as funding for planners and other ways to speed up development.
The federal government does not directly control home-building approvals so the program can only work with co-operation from municipalities, which will only be eligible for funding if they sign on and agree to the financing terms.
“Certainly, if they don’t get on board, it’s not going to happen,” said Kevin Lee, chief executive of Canadian Home Builders’ Association, a lobby group that represents 9,000 home-building entities including trade contractors and insurers.
The budget attempts to tie public transportation funding to new home construction, which Mr. Lee said could provide another incentive for some municipalities to participate. It is not known if Toronto or any of the cities in Southern Ontario with desperate housing needs will comply.
Even if the new fund can succeed in speeding development approvals, the construction industry says it will be hard to double the pace of home building because of an industry-wide shortage of construction workers and other tradespeople.
“We have some real challenges with labour availability and so it’s going to be a challenge to find all the workers,” said Sean Strickland, executive director with Canada’s Building Trades Unions, which represents 600,000 construction workers across the country.
Mr. Strickland said the labour shortage has been exacerbated by the combination of older tradespeople retiring as new home construction and other commercial real estate building soars.
The budget also proposes to make it easier for construction workers to travel for new projects in the country by providing a tax deduction of up to $4,000 a year in relocation expenses. That would be effective for the 2022 tax year.
Mr. Strickland that will help immediately, since developers do not typically compensate workers for relocation and historically tradespeople have not been allowed to deduct their moving expenses.
Other measures to attract and train more workers will take more time.
And even with the push to hire and train more construction workers, there is a lack of building materials. The pandemic slowed the movement of goods around the world, leading to all types of shortages and production delays. Global supply chains have been further disrupted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“That will be a logistical challenge for the industry,” Plazacorp’s Mr. McLellan said.
Not only have home prices skyrocketed during the pandemic, apartment rental vacancies have dropped. The vacancy rate was close to 1 per cent in Halifax, Gatineau, Kingston and Victoria last fall, according to the most recent government data.

Full text: 47589 Sparta Line CENTRAL ELGIN, ONT.
Asking Price: $1,895,000 Taxes: $4,286.53 (2021) Land Size: 41.5 acres Agents: Paul Maranger and Christian Vermast, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada THE BACKSTORY Suzanne Steed and Jim Bundschuh had been living in Germany for a few years when they decided to return to Canada in 2000.
The move presented the couple with the opportunity to reimagine the next phase of their lives with their young daughter, Elise.
Mr. Bundschuh, an engineer in the automotive industry, took a new position near St. Thomas, Ont., and the pair began searching for property in the surrounding countryside.
For Ms. Steed, the chance to reunite with her show horse, Teekah, had a strong influence over where the family would choose to settle down.
In the fall of that year, they found a 41-acre farm in a bucolic setting just outside the historic village of Sparta. The wooded property sits on a ravine, with Catfish Creek running along the western edge.
“There were these beautiful fall colours and horses in the paddock,” Ms. Steed recalls of their first visit. “It was just beautiful.”
The location near Lake Erie would also allow the family to enjoy sailing and swimming in summer.
The couple purchased the property and soon brought Teekah from the farm where she was boarding to her new home in a well-appointed barn.
THE FARM TODAY As the family settled into their new home, Ms. Steed returned to work part-time as a public-health nurse.
After their son, Quinn, was born, she decided to look into new pursuits that would allow her to spend more time on the farm with the kids.
With a fine arts degree and a few courses in horticulture and landscaping, she began to explore the idea of creating a wellness garden.
“You can always use your nursing background whatever you do,” one of her advisers suggested.
Ms. Steed looked at the thriving lavender plants in her perennial gardens and decided to plant more.
“Lavender made sense to me. The sun always shines in Sparta and lavender needs sun,” she says. “It’s well-drained soil and that’s what lavender wants.”
Ms. Steed connected with some local farmers who were interested in making the transition from tobacco-growing to lavender. She co-founded the Ontario Lavender Association so that members could experiment with different varieties and share their knowledge.
Sparta, established in 1813 as a Quaker settlement, was already a tourist draw, and Ms. Steed figured her fragrant fields of lavender would be an added attraction for the area.
Within a few years, the lavender fields had expanded to two acres and Ms. Steed had a successful agri-tourism business with 30,000 annual visitors. She converted the heated garage into a retail shop where she sells lavender-infused honey, cookies and jams. Wellness products – including lotions, essential oils and a dog shampoo – are created on the farm.
“If I can think of it, we’ll make it,” Ms. Steed says.
Visitors roam the property, photograph the birds and butterflies, and relax for hours in chairs overlooking the ravine.
“We offer a day in the country – it’s so nice to offer people a little bit of respite,” she says. “I probably have about 30,000 stories every year. We spend time with our visitors.”
As the lavender enterprise grew, the couple decided in 2005 to renovate and expand the house. With the help of an architect and designer, they created a 2,464-square-foot house in the arts and crafts style.
Today, the house has an open plan with a large kitchen and dining area. The kitchen, with Shaker-style cabinetry, has a large walnut island topped with soapstone.
“We were really conscious to make it fit into its rural setting,” Ms. Steed says of the transformation. “We were inspired by an informal country home.”
The addition at the rear of the house includes a family room with a vaulted ceiling and a 17- by 17-foot screened porch. The backyard garden has a small pond with a waterfall.
“It was so important to have all sorts of views,” Ms. Steed says of the large windows facing the gardens and ravine.
The main-floor primary bedroom has an ensuite bathroom with walk-in shower.
Upstairs, there are two large bedrooms and a family bathroom.
The lower level includes a woodworking shop, a second kitchen and a dog shower.
Ms. Steed says growing up on the farm gave her kids a magical connection with nature.
When Quinn was 9, he took an interest in raising chickens and assembled a flock of heritage breeds that lay colourful eggs.
He joined a local poultry association and entered his most striking hens into competition at agricultural fairs.
“He won trophies – it was so much fun,” Ms. Steed says. “Who knew that you had to bathe them and use a special shampoo and use a hair dryer to fluff them up?” Within the property, the couple has protected the farm’s stand of Carolinian forest, which is part of a corridor travelled by the endangered Monarch butterfly and the threatened Canada warbler, among other migrating species of wildlife. The couple has added plantings of native river birch, paw paw, tulip and coffee trees over the years.
A pair of bald eagles nests in the mature trees at the back of the property.
“My husband and I felt a real stewardship here,” Ms. Steed says.
The forest is designated as an Area of Natural Scientific Interest, or ANSI, which allows the family to claim a hefty tax incentive.
Conservation authorities also aim to protect the natural flood plain bordering Catfish Creek, which flows into Lake Erie.
In 2020, as Ms. Steed was fully immersed in the business, the Government of Ontario was reaching out to retired nurses and recruiting their help in handling the pandemic. Ms. Steed returned to her public-health role as a COVID-19 case manager.
Now that the family has decided to move to another part of Ontario, Ms. Steed says the lavender plants will remain on the farm, but she is not selling the business. She plans to continue the Steed and Co., brand in her next venture.
“It’s been a wonderful rural life,” she says of their tenure on the farm.
THE BEST FEATURE Over the years, the family acquired two more horses to share the seven-stall barn with Teekah, who has since retired from competing in equestrian events.
The horses take their exercise in an outdoor riding ring in addition to the paddocks with oak fencing.
Trails wind throughout the property and the family members ride on neighbouring lands as well.
“You can get on the horses at the back of the barn and be gone for two or three hours and not even cross a road,” Ms. Steed says.

Home and condo builders aim to develop properties without carbon emissions: New technologies could eliminate the dependence on natural gas, but red tape is making it difficult

Full text: On a former farm in the hamlet of Embro, just west of Woodstock, Ont., builders are putting the finishing touches on a row of six townhomes that come, perhaps a bit unexpectedly, with a full complement of climate features intended to radically cut their carbon consumption.
Constructed on spec by Langlois Ecohomes and not yet on sale, the dwellings have been built to Passive House standard, meaning they are fitted out with thick walls packed with insulation, a few thermal breaks, triple-glazed windows and, notably, don’t use natural gas. Such buildings can reduce emissions by up to 90 per cent compared with conventional dwellings.
“For us, it’s been quite a few years in actualizing this project,” says president John Langlois, who runs the small family-owned firm with his daughter, Nicole, the general manager, and son, Marc, who oversees site management and excavation.
Aiming for Passive Housegrade performance, they acknowledge, has been challenging: Local contractors aren’t trained in Passive House construction techniques and the cost of materials exceeded their pro formas.
“It hasn’t been as smooth as we would have liked,” John says. Still, as Nicole points out, it’s a seller’s market and they’re confident about the project, which has generated a steady stream of inquiries.
The Langloises, however, have a larger goal: The townhomes sit on the edge of a 70-acre farm that they own, and are in the process of converting into what they say will be a “net zero” community of detached houses. And they are looking to fit out another, smaller development site with a geo-exchange system as an alternative to natural gas.
In the latest in a series of red alerts, the International Panel on Climate Change this week released a report predicting irreversible warming without drastic and almost immediate cuts to fossil-fuel use. The report comes half a year after the International Energy Agency concluded that limiting temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2030 would require significant investments in energy efficiency, electrification and clean energy innovation.
Despite all the attention trained on global warming and Canada’s contribution to it, Nicole says that building low-emission housing remains a significant challenge, which, she adds, “is a strange oversight.”
Natural gas hook-ups, mandated by many municipalities and regulated by the provincial government’s energy planners, guarantee decades of carbon emissions from new homes or condos being constructed today, even in places such as the city of Toronto or Oxford County, both of which have declared climate emergencies.
As she observes, “There’s very little emphasis on transitioning away from fossil fuels.”
The Ontario government’s push to sharply accelerate new home construction, in theory, marks a huge opportunity to wean the development industry off its preference for natural gas, especially as electric heat pumps gain wider consumer acceptance.
A growing number of builders, however, are looking at largerscale geo-exchange systems as an alternative. Geo-exchange technology, also known as geo-thermal, gathers and concentrates energy from deep in the ground to provide heating and cooling.
According to data compiled by the City of Toronto, about 20 such projects, mostly in multiunit residential or institutional buildings, have been approved since 2018.
“Many more are coming this year that have yet come through site plan approval, which is when we would typically start tracking them,” says David MacMillan, a senior City of Toronto energy planner.
A recently approved example: a nine-storey, 71-unit rental building at Parliament Street near Shuter Street that features a geoexchange system installed beneath the parking garage. The builder is Core Developments and Subterra Renewables is constructing the geo-exchange infrastructure.
In several cases, he says, developers are aiming to get ahead of planned energy consumption minimum standards that come into effect later in the decade as part of planned revisions to the Toronto Green Standard. “Geoexchange systems are helping developers meet emissions levels that won’t be mandatory until 2025 or 2028.”
There’s evidence of this kind of thinking elsewhere in the GTA.
Minto Group, for example, in the midst of developing a five-tower complex in Oakville, dubbed North Oak, will be serviced by a geo-exchange system built, owned and operated by Creative Energy, a Vancouver district energy firm which is providing similar infrastructure for Mirvish Village.
Carl Pawlowski, Minto’s project manager for sustainability, says the geo-exchange system will allow North Oak to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 75 per cent. He says Town of Oakville planners have been very supportive and adds that Minto intends to pursue this kind of low-carbon energy infrastructure in other projects. “The idea is to grow the internal capacity so we can better bring these solutions to market.”
The company is also implementing related low-carbon design features, including integrated photo-voltaic panels, all-electric appliances and balconies constructed with “thermal breaks” – a reference to a means of avoiding one of the most significant sources of energy inefficiency in highrise buildings, which is heat loss enabled by concrete slab balconies.
Both Mr. Pawlowski and the Langloises say that home buyers are increasingly interested in such features, and the role they play not just environmentally, but as a hedge against the rising cost of gas owing to carbon pricing. “People are more and more aware of what they’re spending on gas and electricity,” Mr. Pawlowski says.
The move to spin off the operation of the district heating/geoexchange system to Creative Energy, he adds, is a way to ensure that the system is properly maintained, something that might not happen if left to the condo corporation and property manager.
As for Minto’s own balance sheet, Mr. Pawlowski points out that on a new project at the scale of North Oak, there’s no reason not to go with geo-exchange.
Compared with installing a conventional HVAC system, he says, “it’s cost-neutral.”

Investors flood Vancouver property market: Unprecedented demand in B.C. for past 30 years has not been affected by typical market swings, developer says

Full text: What came first, investor demand or a lack of supply? For many, the question of Vancouver’s affordability crisis is a lot like the old chickenor-egg riddle. There are those who fiercely believe that local governments and homeowners have impeded the progress of new construction over the years, constraining supply and driving up prices. And then there are those who believe that a lot of the new housing that’s brought online targets investors who seek to maximize profit, turning housing into a game of real-life monopoly.
In the past few years, big money investors, also known as institutional investors, have moved into the Lower Mainland to take direct advantage of one of the world’s most lucrative real estate markets. The Vancouver Real Estate Forum, to be held this year on April 12 at the Vancouver Convention Centre, includes a panel discussion on the growing trend of institutional investors partnering with local developers. And experts from investment firms will talk on other panels that cover everything from government policies and the demand for rental housing to the affordability crisis.
“They are aligning with local developer talent that are good at sourcing opportunities and properties – the pension funds are happy to participate directly with guys like us,” said Brent Sawchyn, principal and chief executive officer of development company PC Urban Properties, and a Forum panelist. Mr. Sawchyn’s midsize company has partnered with several such companies on projects in recent years.
He estimates that, globally, there are about a dozen markets for pension fund types to inject their money and Vancouver is a draw. They are looking for markets where population and business opportunities are on the rise. For developers, such investor partnerships have become more appealing because of the high cost involved in development.
“If you’ve got $10-billion of money that you want to put into real estate in certain markets in Canada – let’s say multifamily apartment buildings – you need to cast your net pretty broadly to be able to fill that need, to place that amount of money,” Mr. Sawchyn said.
“The pension funds and ‘near pension funds’ are all interested in participating in real estate so that they can, at the end of the day, attract an ongoing return for their investment – so they can go buy existing apartment buildings or they can participate with us, where we can build a brand new apartment building that is smack clean out-of-the-box brand new, with a lot less requirements for repairs and maintenance and then generate an attractive return for them.”
Some housing advocates have accused the institutional investor of pushing prices higher because they snap up old apartment stock and seek healthy returns.
Mr. Sawchyn and others argue that they are serving the opposite purpose, because rental apartments would be otherwise too risky to build. For big money investors, however, apartment buildings “are very well sought after and prized,” he says.
“Without institutional investment into, say, new apartment buildings, we wouldn’t be delivering any stock.
“Some argue, ‘this is a new building, rents are expensive, it’s not affordable.’ But if we’ve got 75,000 to 100,000 people moving here a year to the Lower Mainland, we need to build housing.
And without pension funds participating in housing, we are not going to have any more stock.
Rents will keep going up.”
But it’s also true that the big investor is in the Vancouver market expressly because growth is the expectation. Some argue that anything that gets in the way, such as government regulation that restricts rents, or building heights, or costly development fees, or public engagement that stalls projects for years, for example, impedes the delivery of supply. For some, less regulation of the housing system is the most effective way of meeting the future demand.
Simon Fraser University professor of finance, Andrey Pavlov, argues that institutional investors are generally better landlords than mom-and-pop landlords, and regulations and taxes designed to cool the market only add to their financial burden, making housing less affordable.
We shouldn’t be just building for the current population – we should be building to house future populations, says Mr. Pavlov.
“We have constrained population growth in the Lower Mainland because of limits on housing,” he says. “There is that additional complication that maybe you have investment demand that has nothing to do really with current population growth. In my view, we should provide enough housing even for that, and it can be done, but there is a more difficult argument to be made there. However, in the rental market it is very, very clear.”
The residential rental vacancy rate, he says, should get to at least 3 per cent to adequately supply the population.
Patrick Condon, University of B.C. urban design professor and author of Sick City: Disease, Race, Inequality and Urban Land, argues that the housing crisis stems from the commodification of land, which is no longer based on its value for housing, but for its value as a global asset class. In order to solve the housing problem, he says, you have to control the price of urban land.
“Housing is no longer valued for its utility. It is now valued as a commodity, just like gold, Bitcoin or stocks and bonds,” he said in an e-mail. “We have moved from an economy based largely on wages to one based largely on investments, with investors now in the driver’s seat.
It’s extra complicated, because most of us participate in it and benefit from it, with our RRSPs and our pension fund contributions, not to mention the baby boomers benefiting from a passive gain of $4-million for their Dunbar home.”
Developer David Fullbrook says that he’s not sure that a glut of new supply will bring prices down.
“I look at the paradigm and it has got too many opposing forces.”
There are a lot of constraints on available land, and land cost is high. He says it means that only a few major players with deep pockets can afford to play.
“By and large, it’s more the commodification of housing that is fundamentally a problem, that we just haven’t identified as being a real thing. We haven’t allowed that to happen for health care and we have allowed it to happen for housing – and now that die has been cast it’s going to be very hard to unwind that, I would guess,” he said.
Mr. Fullbrook, who has been in the industry for 30 years and spent most of his career in the U.S., partners with investors and builds mostly commercial developments in B.C. and Alberta, including some multifamily residential.
“When the dot.com collapsed in 2000, that sort of released a lot of capital and that money began to flow into commercial real estate. I’m talking globally. … When that money started to flow, it never stopped and it began to accelerate. So what you’ve got now … is really institutional capital that is driving predominantly home development.
“I think the big collapse was obviously the Liberal government’s lack of attention to housing and the value that was created for them politically by this Chinese inflow of capital, this foreign investment money that really protected Vancouver from some of the cyclical swings that were happening throughout North America.
“I always look at Vancouver investors as being rewarded for speculation. They buy property and they may over pay. They don’t really know what a downturn looks like. So there has always been money to be made, and the province is constantly trying to manipulate the system to drive or incentivize capital to behave in a certain way – and we are just too late.
“Since Expo, there has been 30 years of unprecedented demand for B.C. real estate and it doesn’t seem to be impacted by typical market swings that would make people a little more cautious, particularly the speculative venturers who don’t really add a lot of value to the process, in my own view.”
Mr. Fullbrook finds the increasing rents worrisome and is concerned about his own children’s futures. He said he just priced a 128-unit, 20-storey concrete tower at $650 buildable per foot, not including land, profit and interest to cover the financing. The means the consumer is looking at about $500,000 for a 500-square-foot condo. That’s about 10 times the average salary, compared to when he was starting out and a home might be three times the average salary.
That creates a “vicious circle of haves and have-nots,” Mr. Fullbrook says.
And investors are, by necessity, driven by profit.
“We had a deal we were quite interested in, and there was an investor group that was interested in the project, and putting capital in, and what they wanted us to do was something that I just would not do. I would not undermine a community that was thriving, and in a good place, to make a quicker yield.
“That was really what they were driven by: ‘we want to make that money in three years and get it out and then get it back in.’ ”I don’t judge it,” he adds. “I just recognize it as being a factor of the market, that there is an avaricious quality to investors.”

Full text: 825 Black Cherry Dr., Oshawa TAUNTON Asking price: $1,199,000 (February, 2022) Selling price: $1,412,000 (March, 2022) Previous selling price: $435,555 (November, 2013) Taxes: $6,807 (2021) Days on the market: Six Listing agent: Eddie Harnick, Coldwell Banker R.M.R Real Estate THE ACTION This four-bedroom house in Oshawa, about 75 kilometres east of downtown Toronto, attracted more than 20 visitors eager for a detached property backing on a ravine. Shoppers drove in from across the GTA and Durham Region over six days in late February and early March.
Three reappeared on a Wednesday evening with offers in hand. A local buyer came out on top with a $1.412-million pitch.
“In that specific pocket at the time, we were the only ones actively for sale because others had recently sold,” agent Eddie Harnick said.
“And most of the homes within the vicinity had certainly sold above list price and in multiple offer [scenarios].”
WHAT THEY GOT This roughly 10year-old house sits on a gently sloping 60- by 110-foot lot. The attached, double garage fronts onto a quiet street, while a one-bedroom basement suite exits out to a back patio and pool.
The main floor is arranged with an office, a formal dining area and an eat-in kitchen, as well as an entertaining area with a gas fireplace and access to an upper deck.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s a fairly standard size for a newer, north Oshawa home, but the difference was the basement in this one was fully finished, had 10-foot ceilings and a walkout private entrance,” Ms. Harnick said.
“[Plus] it’s really a turnkey home with everything done, which makes it extremely attractive to buyers looking to get in and unpack rather than spend money to renovate.”
“It backs onto the ravine and has a private backyard, fully landscaped and fenced,” Ms. Harnick said.
“It’s a fabulous location for commuters because it has easy access to the 407 and 401 [highways], and it’s surrounded by great schools, parks, shopping and restaurants.”

Full text: A Toronto house that appears to have suffered decades of neglect is on the market for $1.849-million.
The value has much to do with the extrawide lot in a fashionable Junction neighbourhood in Toronto’s west end, but a virtual tour of the property that has been shared widely on social media shows a building in a very poor state of repair.
As startling as the images are, the decision to show off the deficits of 81 St. John’s Rd. was intentional.
“The rationale behind having the virtual tour is to try not to be disrespectful to the owner, but to make sure people knew the condition of the home,” said Joe Picozzi, a sales representative with Keller Williams Co-elevation Realty who is the listing agent on the home. “I didn’t want huge crowds of people to come in only to find out it would be too much work for them.”
Mr. Picozzi said he believes if the home was completely renovated it could be worth somewhere just below $3-million, given its 40-foot frontage in an area full of more narrow lots. The house is zoned to allow for as many as three separate living units, which could be attractive to investors. However, most of the local sales in the past year were for homes that are currently livable and they tend to top out around $2.2million, according to selling price data on public sites such as HouseSigma.com.
The average price of a detached home in Toronto rose above $2-million for the first time in 2022.
Property records show that in 1969, Irene and Karl Cook bought the home for $31,300. Mr. Cook’s occupation was listed as sewing machine operator. Ms. Cook died in 1998 and Mr. Cook died in 2010, after which the estate was transferred to their son, Robert (Bob) Alexander Cook.
Residents in the neighbourhood who didn’t want to talk on the record but claim to know Bob Cook say he is a pleasant and a happy neighbour who has lived in the house for at least 40 years. He declined to speak to The Globe and Mail, but neighbours say the condition of the house can be attributed to its maintenance requirements having “gotten away from him.”
There are polite ways to describe a home where every room is either filled to the brim with bric-a-brac, or has peeling paint, buckling floors and holes in the walls and ceilings. Then there’s the way some on social media described it: “Reminds me of the house in Fight Club.”
The tour starts in an attic loft where almost every flat surface is covered in a mix of vinyl records, old electronics, broken-down furniture, and boxes of odds and ends; the paint is coming off the walls in dinner-plate-size flakes.
Next to it is a room filled halfway to the ceiling with everything from engine parts to hat boxes, and the tour continues on from there.
Some rooms are completely empty, and Mr. Picozzi said several dumpsters worth of items were hauled out of the house before the pictures were taken. As for the remaining items, the owner wasn’t ready to part with them yet.
“He wants to keep a fair amount of it, he wasn’t ready to put it in storage just yet,” Mr. Picozzi said.
Mr. Picozzi said he has had full days of showings since the home was listed, and a lot of interest both from contractors and renovators looking for value as well as individuals hoping to renovate it for their own use. “Structurally it seems pretty sound, but it needs to be gutted,” said Mr. Picozzi, who held an offer day on April 6 in hopes competitive bidding will drive up the price.

Investors flood Vancouver property market: Unprecedented demand in B.C. for past 30 years has not been affected by typical market swings, developer says

Full text: What came first, investor demand or a lack of supply? For many, the question of Vancouver’s affordability crisis is a lot like the old chickenor-egg riddle. There are those who fiercely believe that local governments and homeowners have impeded the progress of new construction over the years, constraining supply and driving up prices. And then there are those who believe that a lot of the new housing that’s brought online targets investors who seek to maximize profit, turning housing into a game of real-life monopoly.
In the past few years, big money investors, also known as institutional investors, have moved into the Lower Mainland to take direct advantage of one of the world’s most lucrative real estate markets. The Vancouver Real Estate Forum, to be held this year on April 12 at the Vancouver Convention Centre, includes a panel discussion on the growing trend of institutional investors partnering with local developers. And experts from investment firms will talk on other panels that cover everything from government policies and the demand for rental housing to the affordability crisis.
“They are aligning with local developer talent that are good at sourcing opportunities and properties – the pension funds are happy to participate directly with guys like us,” said Brent Sawchyn, principal and chief executive officer of development company PC Urban Properties, and a Forum panelist. Mr. Sawchyn’s midsize company has partnered with several such companies on projects in recent years.
He estimates that, globally, there are about a dozen markets for pension fund types to inject their money and Vancouver is a draw. They are looking for markets where population and business opportunities are on the rise. For developers, such investor partnerships have become more appealing because of the high cost involved in development.
“If you’ve got $10-billion of money that you want to put into real estate in certain markets in Canada – let’s say multifamily apartment buildings – you need to cast your net pretty broadly to be able to fill that need, to place that amount of money,” Mr. Sawchyn said.
“The pension funds and ‘near pension funds’ are all interested in participating in real estate so that they can, at the end of the day, attract an ongoing return for their investment – so they can go buy existing apartment buildings or they can participate with us, where we can build a brand new apartment building that is smack clean out-of-the-box brand new, with a lot less requirements for repairs and maintenance and then generate an attractive return for them.”
Some housing advocates have accused the institutional investor of pushing prices higher because they snap up old apartment stock and seek healthy returns.
Mr. Sawchyn and others argue that they are serving the opposite purpose, because rental apartments would be otherwise too risky to build. For big money investors, however, apartment buildings “are very well sought after and prized,” he says.
“Without institutional investment into, say, new apartment buildings, we wouldn’t be delivering any stock.
“Some argue, ‘this is a new building, rents are expensive, it’s not affordable.’ But if we’ve got 75,000 to 100,000 people moving here a year to the Lower Mainland, we need to build housing.
And without pension funds participating in housing, we are not going to have any more stock.
Rents will keep going up.”
But it’s also true that the big investor is in the Vancouver market expressly because growth is the expectation. Some argue that anything that gets in the way, such as government regulation that restricts rents, or building heights, or costly development fees, or public engagement that stalls projects for years, for example, impedes the delivery of supply. For some, less regulation of the housing system is the most effective way of meeting the future demand.
Simon Fraser University professor of finance, Andrey Pavlov, argues that institutional investors are generally better landlords than mom-and-pop landlords, and regulations and taxes designed to cool the market only add to their financial burden, making housing less affordable.
We shouldn’t be just building for the current population – we should be building to house future populations, says Mr. Pavlov.
“We have constrained population growth in the Lower Mainland because of limits on housing,” he says. “There is that additional complication that maybe you have investment demand that has nothing to do really with current population growth. In my view, we should provide enough housing even for that, and it can be done, but there is a more difficult argument to be made there. However, in the rental market it is very, very clear.”
The residential rental vacancy rate, he says, should get to at least 3 per cent to adequately supply the population.
Patrick Condon, University of B.C. urban design professor and author of Sick City: Disease, Race, Inequality and Urban Land, argues that the housing crisis stems from the commodification of land, which is no longer based on its value for housing, but for its value as a global asset class. In order to solve the housing problem, he says, you have to control the price of urban land.
“Housing is no longer valued for its utility. It is now valued as a commodity, just like gold, Bitcoin or stocks and bonds,” he said in an e-mail. “We have moved from an economy based largely on wages to one based largely on investments, with investors now in the driver’s seat.
It’s extra complicated, because most of us participate in it and benefit from it, with our RRSPs and our pension fund contributions, not to mention the baby boomers benefiting from a passive gain of $4-million for their Dunbar home.”
Developer David Fullbrook says that he’s not sure that a glut of new supply will bring prices down.
“I look at the paradigm and it has got too many opposing forces.”
There are a lot of constraints on available land, and land cost is high. He says it means that only a few major players with deep pockets can afford to play.
“By and large, it’s more the commodification of housing that is fundamentally a problem, that we just haven’t identified as being a real thing. We haven’t allowed that to happen for health care and we have allowed it to happen for housing – and now that die has been cast it’s going to be very hard to unwind that, I would guess,” he said.
Mr. Fullbrook, who has been in the industry for 30 years and spent most of his career in the U.S., partners with investors and builds mostly commercial developments in B.C. and Alberta, including some multifamily residential.
“When the dot.com collapsed in 2000, that sort of released a lot of capital and that money began to flow into commercial real estate. I’m talking globally. … When that money started to flow, it never stopped and it began to accelerate. So what you’ve got now … is really institutional capital that is driving predominantly home development.
“I think the big collapse was obviously the Liberal government’s lack of attention to housing and the value that was created for them politically by this Chinese inflow of capital, this foreign investment money that really protected Vancouver from some of the cyclical swings that were happening throughout North America.
“I always look at Vancouver investors as being rewarded for speculation. They buy property and they may over pay. They don’t really know what a downturn looks like. So there has always been money to be made, and the province is constantly trying to manipulate the system to drive or incentivize capital to behave in a certain way – and we are just too late.
“Since Expo, there has been 30 years of unprecedented demand for B.C. real estate and it doesn’t seem to be impacted by typical market swings that would make people a little more cautious, particularly the speculative venturers who don’t really add a lot of value to the process, in my own view.”
Mr. Fullbrook finds the increasing rents worrisome and is concerned about his own children’s futures. He said he just priced a 128-unit, 20-storey concrete tower at $650 buildable per foot, not including land, profit and interest to cover the financing. The means the consumer is looking at about $500,000 for a 500-square-foot condo. That’s about 10 times the average salary, compared to when he was starting out and a home might be three times the average salary.
That creates a “vicious circle of haves and have-nots,” Mr. Fullbrook says.
And investors are, by necessity, driven by profit.
“We had a deal we were quite interested in, and there was an investor group that was interested in the project, and putting capital in, and what they wanted us to do was something that I just would not do. I would not undermine a community that was thriving, and in a good place, to make a quicker yield.
“That was really what they were driven by: ‘we want to make that money in three years and get it out and then get it back in.’ ”I don’t judge it,” he adds. “I just recognize it as being a factor of the market, that there is an avaricious quality to investors.”

Tax for non-residents won’t help housing crunch: N.S. realtors: New measures include a 5-per-cent deed transfer tax and 2-per-cent tax on homes for people living outside province

Full text: In an effort to ease the unprecedented pressure on its housing market, Nova Scotia is trying something few provinces have done before: increasing taxes for all residential property owners who don’t live in the province full-time.
In last week’s budget, Nova Scotia introduced two controversial tax measures: a 5-per-cent deed transfer tax on homes bought by non-residents and a 2per-cent tax on properties owned by people who normally reside outside the province. The government says the new fees, which will triple the property taxes for a seasonal property, could generate $81-million in the coming fiscal year and help make more housing available for Nova Scotians.
The new taxes won’t affect buyers who are moving to Nova Scotia permanently; they only target those who maintain a primary address elsewhere. Out-ofprovince property buyers will have six months after their closing date to become residents and avoid the new transfer tax.
While several provinces have introduced foreign buyers taxes in recent years, most don’t have special property levies that affect other Canadians. British Columbia applies a 0.5 per cent Speculation and Vacancy Tax on outof-province property owners, but no other province has gone this far. About half the 27,000 properties in Nova Scotia owned by non-residents belong to people who reside for most of the year in Ontario.
Nova Scotia realtors, and the province’s real estate association, say the new taxes target the wrong people and do nothing to deter speculators, who are helping drive up the prices of homes in cities such as Halifax. They say the policy will hurt rural communities and won’t ease the province’s housing crunch.
“It’s discriminatory,” said John Duckworth, a real estate broker in Kingsburg, N.S., a small coastal community on the South Shore, where about half the residents are seasonal. “I don’t see any other province treating their nonresidents this badly. It leaves the impression that people from outside the province aren’t welcome, and I think that’s a huge problem.”
Nova Scotia’s population has ballooned during the pandemic, passing one million for the first time, and Premier Tim Houston’s government has been under pressure to address a crippling housing shortage. In Halifax, the residential vacancy rate is just 1 per cent, among the lowest in Canada. The city’s downtown is the fastest-growing urban core in the country, surging more than 26 per cent from 2016 to 2021, according to Statistics Canada.
About 4 per cent of all properties in Nova Scotia are owned by non-residents, according to Statistics Canada. That’s higher than both Ontario (2.2 per cent) and British Columbia (3.2 per cent), where foreign buyers taxes were introduced in 2016 and 2018.
“It’s incredibly difficult to find housing, whether it’s affordable housing or even attainable housing … so we’re hopeful this measure will help people who are struggling to find a place to live,” Finance Minister Allan MacMaster told reporters.
Mr. Duckworth argues that non-residents have injected millions into the rural economy by building new homes and renovating older properties, often in places that were in decline for years. When he bought a oneroom schoolhouse by the beach in Kingsburg in 1972, the community was full of crumbling, neglected buildings. Today, the former fishing village has been rejuvenated into a retirement and vacation destination, he said.
Many seasonal properties in the province are rented out when their owners aren’t there, generating tourism revenue, Mr. Duckworth said. He warns that some of these homes may be sold as a result of the new levies and worries they will have an impact on new home construction in rural areas.
Seasonal property owners aren’t a drain on government services, Mr. Duckworth says, because their children don’t attend local schools and their home provinces reimburse Nova Scotia’s health care system for any costs. Instead, they’re being unfairly penalized because they’re seen as non-voters who can afford more than one home, he said.
“It’s like a wealth tax – I think that’s how they see it,” he said.
“But most of these people aren’t wealthy.”
Mark and Linda Northwood of Toronto are among the thousands of non-residents facing steep increases in their property tax bills. The couple bought land in the Kingsburg area sight unseen a year ago and planned to build a retirement home on the property.
Now they’re having second thoughts.
“If we had known this was coming a year ago, we would never have bought that property,” said Mr. Northwood, a 63-yearold private investigator. “We intend to be residents when we retire. But we’d like to retire on our terms, not the government’s.”
Mr. Northwood said he sympathizes with first-time homebuyers who are struggling to get into the housing market, but doesn’t see how a “tax on rural communities” will help. He said he and his wife are also reluctant to give up their access to Ontario’s health care system by becoming permanent residents of Nova Scotia, which has a wellpublicized shortage of doctors.
“We love the people of Nova Scotia and we’re still attracted to the province,” he said. “But the government is a completely different story. We don’t see the logic in any of this.”

Industrial land demand heating up in Waterloo Region: Competition is fierce for the ideal mix of location, buildings and talent in one of the country’s hottest markets

Full text: This fall, Angstrom Engineering Inc., of Kitchener, Ont., will move in to a 53,000-square-foot building in a new tech-oriented business park 10 kilometres away, ending a prolonged effort by the fast-growing company to buy industrial property.
Rising demand and shrinking supply of serviced industrial land in the Waterloo Region (which includes Cambridge, Ont.) have tested companies such as Angstrom and others competing for property in one of the country’s hottest industrial markets.
The COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions and dwindling inventory of municipal industrial parks contribute to the current squeeze.
Three years ago, Angstrom officials looked for 20,000- to 30,000-square-foot buildings but, with company growth, broadened their search to facilities of 50,000 square feet. What they found, says Angstrom president David Pitts, was “almost nothing in that 30,000- to 50,000-square-foot size. … It was challenging.”
His experience is familiar to Waterloo Region realtors.
“I joke that over the 30 years of my career, for the first 25 to 27 years, I was trying to drag people out of Toronto to look at Kitchener-Waterloo, saying, ‘Please come and have a look and buy something,’ ” quips Karl Innanen, managing director of Colliers International in Kitchener.
Given “the spillover effect” from Toronto-area demand, he says, “for the last two to three years, I’ve felt like a bouncer at a big party trying to keep them out.”
In the fourth quarter of 2021, industrial vacancy in the Waterloo Region fell to 0.7 per cent, according to a report by Colliers, given demand from local and out-of-town land buyers. Average asking net rents increased to a record $8.51 per square foot in the final quarter of last year (up 23.5 per cent over the same period in 2020).
Last fall, for the first time, the cost of some industrial land crept above $1-million per acre, spurred by COVID-19 disruptions, causing manufacturers and suppliers to relocate some of their production from abroad back to Canada.
At Angstrom, which designs and builds machines that create nano-film materials used to research the evolution of everyday products such as cellphones and batteries, as well as high-technology products, the search for new quarters predated the pandemic.
“The main driver was growth, and we needed more space,” Mr. Pitts says.
As the company outgrew its 15,000-square-foot facility in Kitchener, Mr. Pitts says Angstrom was determined to stay in the area for its existing work force and its links to skilled graduates from the region’s postsecondary institutions.
In early 2021, Angstrom purchased a five-acre parcel in Cambridge IP Park, an industrial campus developed by Toronto-based Intermarket Properties to attract companies in advanced manufacturing, research, distribution and logistics.
Unlike some newcomer developers, Intermarket Properties president Mark Kindrachuk dates his involvement in the Waterloo Region to 2001. Over a 12year period, he and business partner Sandy Acchione assembled 400 acres of land for their industrial park in the north end of the city.
Over the past two years, Intermarket sold a significant portion of its 400-acre IP site to various developers, including the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan, Montreal-based Broccolini, and First Gulf, of Toronto. Intermarket retained 85 acres to develop and lease buildings for smallerscale industrial users, not planning further property sales.
However, Angstrom purchased five acres in IP Park because Mr. Kindrachuk saw a fit with his plans for an amenitiesrich industrial campus for hightech and related firms. Those amenities include green space, walking trails and bike trails integrated into existing woodlots and creeks, key features of a master plan developed by Intermarket and the City of Cambridge.
“Our position is that if you can attract the best talent to the area, you will attract very good corporations,” Mr. Kindrachuk says.
“That war for talent has come to the industrial marketplace, especially in advanced manufacturing.”
Given low vacancy rates, Mr. Kindrachuk is so confident he can bring in the firms he wants that his company will begin construction in May on a 100,000square-foot building, possibly for a data centre, without signed tenants yet.
Other buildings are scheduled for construction later this year.
Meanwhile, the pandemicfuelled land squeeze led some companies to modify their acquisition strategies.
Eclipse Automation, based in Cambridge but also with operations in the United States and Europe, designs and builds complex automated systems for a variety of medical, transportation and clean-energy products.
Land was readily available when Eclipse opened in 2001, says president and co-founder Steve Mai, who made regular purchases in the Cambridge area to keep pace with company growth.
But escalating land prices over the past three years made it difficult to buy or lease the right buildings in a timely manner.
“We have to fight for our real estate now,” says Mr. Mai, whose new strategy is to buy property well ahead of immediate needs.
“I have to entertain whatever comes available in the market at an inappropriate time for my business but appropriate for my [company’s] future,” he says.
The supply-demand pressure comes as municipalities no longer buy land for industrial parks.
Cambridge, for example, sold its last inventory of industrial lands two years ago, with no plans to acquire new supply, says economic development director James Goodram.
“The private sector is doing that now and they have really come in [to the region],” he says.
Mr. Goodram says municipalities now play a supporting role by installing water, waste and other services for privately held industrial lands, recouping those costs through development charges.
Currently, the city is assisting in the development of 400 acres of employment lands in north Cambridge and in Waterloo. Half of the developer-owned acreage is already serviced, with the other half expected to be ready later this year, says Mr. Goodram.
For Angstrom’s Mr. Pitts, relief is in sight. “We are looking forward to getting in to the new space that is purpose-built for us.”

Full text: DONE DEAL 186 Bellamy Rd. N., Toronto SOUTH CEDARBRAE Asking price: $849,900 (January, 2022) Selling price: $1,301,990 (January, 2022) Taxes: $3,263 (2021) Days on the market: Seven Listing agent: Ira Jelinek, Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd.
THE ACTION This three-bedroom house was one of the only detached properties up for sale in Scarborough’s quiet South Cedarbrae neighbourhood. The lack of listings resulted in an inundation of house hunters, with 100 requests for private showings.
Within a week, 14 offers were made, all of them over the $1-million mark, despite the $849,900 list price. The winning bid came in at $1,301,990.
“Anything more than three offers is a good starting place for the seller,” said agent Ira Jelinek.
“All the offers were between about $1.1-million and $1.17-million, but one person gave over $1.301-million, so it was a no brainer.”
WHAT THEY GOT The 40-year-old house is linked to its neighbours by a concrete wall in the unfinished basement but is completely detached above ground.
There is a large living room and a separate kitchen flanked by two dining areas; one casual, the other formal. Sliding doors open to the rear of the 35-foot-by-131foot lot.
On the second floor, the largest bedroom contains one of the home’s three bathrooms.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “The bones were good, so you could do work on the whole house,” Mr. Jelinek said.
“It also has a great, deep back yard.”
The surrounding area is also improving with new additions.
“It’s close to Eglinton [Avenue] and the new transit line coming up,” Mr. Jelinek said.
“And it’s a good community close to local plazas.”

Full text: The district of Squamish, B.C., has delivered thousands of housing units to meet its growing population and continues to streamline its approvals process. Facing rapid growth, it has done an admirable job of delivering sufficient supply of new housing to its community.
With thousands of new units, it follows then that housing prices should have at least softened.
Instead, the district experienced one of the greatest bumpups in prices in B.C.
“We are using all the tools in the municipal toolbox to deliver more supply and we are seeing that come on line … But we are not seeing that actually translate into a reduction in prices – either in rent or purchase prices. It’s actually going the other way,” acting mayor Jenna Stoner said.
“Building stuff is important, and we are happy to share what it is we have been able to do in Squamish. But none of them are a silver bullet. We are not seeing the results we want, to bring those prices down. There are lessons we have learned with other municipalities but it’s not as simple as building more homes.
“Prices continue to go up the more houses we build – and that’s partly the demand factor, and so many things go into that demand factor.”
The assessed value of a detached Squamish home was up 35 per cent, according to BC Assessment data released in January. Strata units went up 29 per cent. As for rents, the vacancy rate had improved since 2019, when it had a 0.3-per-cent vacancy rate, according to CMHC. In 2020, it climbed slightly to 1.4 per cent, a small improvement. But rental rates had increased by an average of 9 per cent between 2020 and 2021, according to data provided by Sea to Sky Community Services Society. A few years ago, Squamish was the very affordable option to Vancouver. Now, a two-bedroom downtown condo rents for around $2,500 a month.
As a result, people may be moving to Squamish, but they are also leaving, says Ms. Stoner, a millennial-age resident who is seeing friends forced to leave because of rising costs.
Last week, the Union of B.C.
Municipalities (UBCM) released a report that pushed back against idea that the continued delivery of market-rate housing, without other significant interventions, will solve the affordability crisis.
No one could accuse Squamish of artificially constraining supply by failing to approve developments. The district, which sees growth of about 600 to 700 people a year, approved 800 residential units in 2020 alone, which would accommodate about 2,000 people, Ms. Stoner said. They’ve also regulated short-term rental, fast-tracked rental projects, incentivized affordable rental housing and waived fees for gentle density in single-family house zones. They have an official community plan that has identified three new neighbourhoods for an additional 12,000 people, plus employment space. But financing, supply chain issues and labour shortages all play a role in delivering affordable housing.
“Simply because you can build, it doesn’t mean that the supply and demand economic model is actually holding true.
The only folks I have heard say that we can build our way out of the affordability crisis have been developers,” Ms. Stoner said.
The district has asked the province for demand-side measures to help them out. It formally requested to be included among municipalities whose residents are expected to either declare or pay the province’s annual speculation and vacancy tax and the foreign buyer tax. Those demand-side measures were introduced to cool rampant speculation that had been continuing in urban areas throughout the province, but Squamish wasn’t included.
Ms. Stoner says the town is being marketed by the real estate industry as a place where they don’t have to pay those taxes.
“I have personally seen developers and real estate agents use that as a marketing tool – that we are not included in the foreign buyer tax. We don’t really have super great data in terms of what impact that is having in our market, but the fact that it’s being used as a marketing tool is concerning to us. There seems to be reluctance from the province to expand that program, and it’s having unintended consequences for those of us that are on the periphery of municipalities that have been included.”
The census data cited in the UBCM report referred to major census metropolitan areas, and the new housing units that had come onto the market in those areas versus the change in population numbers. Completion of new dwellings had kept pace in Vancouver, Victoria, Kelowna and Prince George, but the district of Squamish stood out from all the rest.
New construction in the community, located a one-hour drive from Metro Vancouver, had significantly outpaced population growth. Between 2016 and 2021, Squamish had seen a 30.3-percent increase in new dwellings, while its population grew 21.8 per cent. In numbers, the district had added 4,339 people and 2,331 dwellings in that period, according to the UBCM report, which was based on 2021 census. As of the 2016 census, Squamish had an average household size of 2.6 people.
The UBCM, which represents local governments, released its report in response to public criticism from B.C. Housing Minister and Attorney-General David Eby that municipalities needed to better address the affordability crisis. Mayors, city councillors and municipal staff have responded in recent weeks that they are unfairly being lumped together.
Ms. Stoner said she wasn’t going to start pointing fingers, and many municipalities are doing the best with what they’ve got.
“To me it’s a broad brush comment to simply say that we need to build more supply. That is frustrating to hear when we are seeing a lot of buildings being built, and prices are not coming down.”
The report cited investor behaviour as partially driving prices.
Andy Yan, director of the city program at Simon Fraser University, said that 36 per cent of all Squamish dwellings are not owner occupied, which means they are likely investment properties.
That figure is comparable to the City of Vancouver, which is at 34 per cent. His analysis used data from the Canadian Housing Statistics Program.
The bigger shocker, Mr. Yan said, is the percentage of recently built condos in Squamish that are not owner occupied – 64 per cent.
The UBCM report pointed out that while supply is necessary, it’s about obtaining the right kind of supply.
Secondary rental, such as investor-owned condos, is not as secure as purpose built rental.
And new dwelling units do not necessarily become full-time homes for local residents. They can be left empty or used for short-term rental.
Ms. Stoner said greater subsidies for affordable housing are also necessary to protect residents from displacement. The market rental units that they are building are not accessible to the majority of her community, she says.
On paper, Kelowna also has done a decent job of keeping ahead of population growth in terms of supply. The Okanagan city had a greater percentage of total private dwellings, at 15.5 per cent, compared to total population growth of 14 per cent. However, Mayor Colin Basran has not seen prices soften, either.
“We have not seen that, which would lead me to believe that perhaps more supply is a greater need, although it’s a complex issue,” Mr. Basran said. “Just supply alone potentially isn’t going to solve it, even though it’s a big part of it.
“But the report validates what we are seeing here. It calls for the ‘right supply,’ because the number of new units in Kelowna certainly are significant, but the number of people having a hard time finding a place to either buy or rent means something is amiss.
“I think we have a pretty good idea of what that is, and it calls for more rental particularly below market rate rental.”
New Statistics Canada census data showed that Kelowna, the fastest growing census metropolitan area in Canada, was also one of the few regions to see an increase in empty or underoccupied dwellings. The city grew 14 per cent within five years, but the number of dwellings empty or underoccupied is at 7.3 per cent – the highest rate of all communities over 100,000 people in the province. That is a higher rate than Vancouver.
Dwellings not occupied by the usual residents are used as shortterm rentals or part-time homes.
They might also be awaiting occupancy. Kelowna is subject to the SVT, and Canadian citizens are charged 0.5 per cent for leaving a unit empty for more than six months.
Mr. Basran said subsidies are necessary to help residents who continue to struggle to find affordable housing.
Kelowna has incentivized the development of thousands of purpose-built rental units, Mr. Basran said.
“And yet the market is still tight.”
Like Ms. Stoner, the Kelowna mayor is calling on the federal government to get back into the business of providing affordable housing for its citizenry.
“We would like to see the federal government be more active getting more shovels in the ground here in Kelowna. We haven’t seen that yet. And I think that’s one of the biggest pieces that is missing.
“I know for a fact I’ve never seen a federal housing project built in Kelowna in my almost 11 years on council.”

Full text: 474 Bob-O-Link Rd., Mississauga RATTRAY PARK ESTATES Asking price: $3,250,000 (February, 2022) Selling price: $3.5-million (February, 2022) Taxes: $11,484 (2021) Days on the market: One Listing agents: Christian Vermast and Paul Maranger, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada THE ACTION Agent Paul Maranger was confident one week was enough time for buyers to check out this four-bedroom home on a nearly half-acre lot just south of the Rattray Marsh Conservation Area.
To his surprise, four visitors were on the doorstep almost immediately and two of those proffered a bid. He cancelled the next few showings to focus on negotiating a final $3.5-million deal.
“The buyers were definitely local because they acted so quickly in seeing the property and showing strong interest,” Mr. Maranger said.
“Our goal was to get a lot of interest from Toronto [buyers] and people wanting land outside the city, but we didn’t have time – it sold that quickly.”
WHAT THEY GOT This two-storey, brick building has been updated and expanded over the years and currently provides 3,658 square feet of living space. There is an enclosed office and a sunken family room with a gas fireplace, with doors opening onto an oversized patio and in-ground pool.
There are formal living and dining rooms, as well as an open recreation area on the lower level.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s a beautiful Georgian-inspired, American Colonial-style home, so it has a wide centre-hall plan and a wide double-car garage,” Mr. Maranger said. He adds that the pool was a popular asset.
“A colleague of mine wants a pool and is on a two- or threeyear wait list. So pools are gold these days.”
However, the larger than average lot was the main attraction.
“The lot is unbelievable, it’s like a park, like Edwards Gardens,” Mr. Maranger said.
“When I got out of my car, I could hear the sound of the waves on Lake Ontario … even though this isn’t a waterfront lot.”

Full text: 259 Adeline Ave., Hamilton NORMANHURST Asking price: $449,000 (January, 2022) Selling price: $675,100 (February, 2022) Previous selling price: $336,000 (May, 2021) Taxes: $1,752 (2021) Days on the market: Six Listing agent: Tobias Smulders, Re/Max Escarpment Realty Inc.
THE ACTION The owners of this twobedroom bungalow in Hamilton had plans last year to modernize it and rent it out, but as the market strengthened in January, they quickly changed tack to selling it outright.
“My clients bought it with the intention of fixing it up and renting it, but the market was so good, they decided to change gears and sell it,” agent Tobias Smulders said.
“There was low inventory and not a lot to chose from.”
The lack of options and an asking price under $500,000 drew 16 bids on property, with the winning offer coming in $226,100 over asking.
“Everybody always thinks Toronto buyers are going to bring the most money,” Mr. Smulders said. “But the winning bid was from a local buyer and most of the other [interested parties] were local.”
WHAT THEY GOT This nearly 80-yearold bungalow has about 625 square feet of living space and no basement.
Cosmetic finishes are all brand new, such as the flooring in the open living and dining area, and updated cabinetry and stainless-steel appliances in the kitchen.
A separate laundry room exits to a newly paved driveway on the 40-foot-by-100-foot lot.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s not a big home,” Mr. Smulders said.
“[The sellers] invested some money in renovating and rehabbing the property because it needed a lot of work.”

Renovation brings new life to condo: Corner unit in a building across the street from the Notre Dame Basilica of Montreal given a contemporary look

Full text: 81 Rue De Brésoles, No. 505/506 MONTREAL Asking Price: $1,395,000 Monthly Maintenance Fees: $935 Size: 1,727 square feet Listing Agent: Jeff Lee, Engel & Völkers Montreal THE BACKSTORY If life was a book, then the apartment in the historic Old Montreal neighbourhood could be titled the “pandemic years” chapter of Francis Gosselin’s story.
He was selling his old apartment in the city’s Mile End area just days into the fullforce arrival of COVID-19 in Canada, back in March, 2020. Shopping for this apartment was a somewhat surreal ordeal typified by restrictions and precautions that feel almost superstitious as our society cautiously comes out of pandemic times many months later.
“The couple who owned this before us were terrified of catching COVID – not that I wasn’t – but we had to visit with all the doors open and all the drawers pulled out and wear gloves,” Mr. Gosselin said.
The apartment wasn’t that old – the building was finished in 2005 – but the couple wanted a more contemporary style and so carried out a gut renovation of the space, spending much of their time out of the city while they did the work. When it was all finished, they hunkered down as vaccines changed the game and the pandemic began to recede in 2021.
Now, the couple is expecting a child and the next chapter requires another new space.
THE APARTMENT TODAY The apartment doesn’t open directly into the living space as you’d expect in a smaller condo. Instead, a small foyer takes a left turn to run down a short hallway lined with closets, a powder room, laundry closet and storage. At the end of the hallway, the main living space opens to the right, and down a short corridor to the left is the main bedroom.
It’s a corner unit and the main living space is a wide open L-shaped room that is filled with light from the two walls of windows. The building is across the street from the Notre Dame Basilica of Montreal and the apartment’s windows start at the roofline, providing views that make for a portrait-wall of Gothic revival architectural details. On the other side, if you look out the right window, Mr. Gosselin says you can also see the iconic modernist Habitat 67 project by Moshe Safdie across the harbour.
“We redid the entire kitchen,” Mr. Gosselin said, filling it with natural wood on the lower cabinets and bright white on the uppers, hallmarks of the Cuisine Steam design team that specializes in contemporary kitchens. Everything in the space is contemporary, including the light fixtures that hang above the island – three skinny black circles with LEDs on the inner rim – which were found by friends of the couple who own a lighting store.
“They said, ‘You have to see these new LED lights!,’ ” which they had spotted at a lighting trade show in Texas. ”At first, my girlfriend hated it, but when people come they say it’s actually quite fabulous.”
Another bold fixture is the chandelier above the dining-room table, that takes the familiar spring-balanced desk lamp (a common feature of early Bauhaus apartments) and mounts more than a dozen of them in black around a ring to make something that looks like a cross between a spider and a robot.
The living room is separated from the dining space by a low bureau running behind a long sectional couch, with TV and media equipment on the far wall. Tucked next to the couch is a doorway to a second bathroom with a stand-alone glass-walled shower and white walls and tiles, except for the dark grey floor tile that extends onto the surround for the soaker tub.
All the windows in the apartment have unpainted wood frames and, other than the bathrooms, all the floors are done in the same hardwood; these natural elements balance with the uniformly white walls and the industrial exposed concrete ceilings.
The previous owners were a couple with children and the space used to be more chopped up. Mr. Gosselin’s renovation did away with two bedrooms, leaving essentially an office at the end of the hallway behind the kitchen (which could serve as a small bedroom) and one very large primary bedroom suite.
If the primary bedroom suite feels huge, that’s because it used to be its own apartment. “The previous owner, they bought this other unit, and got an engineer to make a passageway between the two,” Mr. Gosselin said.
In the course of his own renovation, he was able to find an extra couple of square feet in walls that were previously overengineered to serve as a fire and sound break between the formerly separate units.
“They had left everything that belonged to the old kitchen behind the walls, there were a lot of surprises when we decided to open it up.”
The length of the bedroom – 25 feet – is accentuated by a wall of shelving that runs from window wall to doorway, behind which is the ensuite bathroom and a second door to the hallway. The ensuite has a double vanity, rain shower and a walk-in closet tucked behind.
The only other feature of note is a parking spot with an electric charger and the option to buy a second spot.
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD Tourists love Old Montreal, though some locals may have a more conflicted relationship about living in a protected heritage zone.
“They never thought they would live in Old Montreal,” said listing agent Jeff Lee of his clients. “I cannot describe it, it is a very different animal. … You feel like you’re going to find treasures, it feels like it’s always Christmas in this area.”
There are dozens of restaurants nearby, lots of specialty shops, not to mention all the souvenir places and street performers in the summer. There’s also the year-round attractions of the nearby Old Port.
Of course, over the past two years it’s been unusually quiet.
More to Mr. Gosselin’s taste a half block away is Saint-Paul Street, which has dozens of art galleries in a kilometre-long stretch. Mr. Gosselin is something of an amateur collector, and a triptych of paintings by local artist Olivier Corno (a.k.a. Olicorno) hangs in Mr. Gosselin’s bedroom.
“I bought them from him when he was a kid, when I could afford them, before his career completely exploded,” he said.
The next owner might have the same luck strolling down Saint-Paul.

Full text: 153 Mahogany Terrace SE CALGARY Asking price: $624,900 (February, 2022) Selling price: $705,000 (February, 2022) Taxes: $3,410 (2021) Days on the market: five Listing agent: Joel Gwillim, CIR Realty THE ACTION The competition was fierce for properties in the lakeside neighbourhood of Mahogany in south Calgary this February.
This three-bedroom house received five offers less than 24 hours after a busy open-house event.
“This would have been a situation that would blow away most local agents, but it’s become the norm now for single-family, detached properties,” agent Joel Gwillim said.
“They are very in demand due to the fact there’s almost nothing on the market.
“The highest priced offer ended up being unconditional, too, which means you wait for the deposit to be delivered and confirmed, and then we have a firm sale. We didn’t have to wait for someone to clear conditions, like financing.”
WHAT THEY GOT This 1,987-squarefoot house with a double garage was built in 2009 on a 36-by-115foot lot near the entrance gate of the Mahogany development that features a large, crescent-shape lake with beaches, natural wetlands, a clubhouse and tennis courts.
The living room has a gas fireplace and vaulted ceilings. The updated kitchen comes with two breakfast bars and is linked to a dining area with access to the back deck.
Annual homeowners association fees are $511.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “Being in the earlier phase of the neighbourhood allows for quick access in and out of the community,” Mr. Gwillim said.
“It also has west-facing windows, so it has mountain views from the second floor, and with no one behind you, just a pathway, it didn’t feel congested like a lot of other suburbs.”
Lake communities such as this one have been especially popular during pandemic lockdowns. “It has more of a community feel and people have stuff to do during the spring and summer months if they’re land locked in their city or community,” Mr. Gwillim said.

Full text: House hunters grappling with soaring real estate prices have another pain point to contend with: the cost to move their stuff to their new digs is skyrocketing.
During the last half of 2021, the rates charged by local and longhaul trucking companies for moving used household and office goods jumped as labour shortages and supply-chain disruptions upended the trucking industry.
The spike comes as more people are on the move than in decades. Last year, for instance, 356,000 people moved to another province, the highest number since the early 1980s and a 20-per-cent jump from prepandemic levels, an analysis of Statistics Canada’s latest demographic figures shows.
At the same time, the sector is struggling with a dire shortage of drivers, with a record-high 22,900 job openings for truckers, according to the latest report from Trucking HR Canada, a trade group.
Rising oil prices are also making it far more expensive for trucking companies to run their fleets, a cost they are passing on to consumers. The data from Statistics Canada on freight rates predate the latest surge in gasoline prices stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, suggesting it’s only gotten more expensive to move house since then.
The jump in moving-company rates is a sign of how soaring inflation is no longer as limited to goods as it was in the early stage of the recovery, and is spilling further into the service sector.
In other words, it’s not only costing more to buy stuff, but to take it with you when you move. JASON KIRBY

Full text: A key provision of Ontario’s new bill meant to speed up housing construction would force municipalities that fail to make decisions on developers’ plans within tight deadlines to refund tens of thousands of dollars in application fees – a change that some urban-planning experts say will only result in more delays.
The ticking clock, aimed at cutting red tape and increasing housing supply, is part of a package of proposed changes labelled the More Homes for Everyone Act and unveiled by the province this week amid widespread concern about runaway real-estate prices.
As of next January, it would require municipalities to refund half of the fees for a rezoning application if they have not made a decision with 90 days, or 120 days if the application also calls for an amendment to an official plan.
After 150 days (or 180 days for official plan amendments), a 75per-cent refund is required, with the whole amount due after 210 days (or 240 days for official plan amendments). In Toronto, an official plan-amendment application alone costs $60,000.
Theses deadlines are already almost never hit in Toronto as approvals can take close to two years – which developers have long complained gums up their ability to build new homes and adds thousands of dollars in costs to each new unit.
But critics warn that under the new system, if planners do not have time to evaluate, for example, a major condo-tower application for its effects on water, roads and other infrastructure, they may simply turn it down to avoid the financial penalty. This could force developers to appeal more often to the already-backlogged Ontario Land Tribunal (OLT), where a decision could take years.
On Twitter, Gregg Lintern, Toronto’s chief planner, compared the deadlines to Pizza Pizza’s 30minute delivery guarantee: “Building a city is not like ordering pizza … no matter what role you play in urban planning in Ontario, you’ve gotta think a ‘30 minutes or free’ approach on refunding application fees will not result in more homes for everyone.”
In an interview, Mr. Lintern warned that setting an artificial timeline on the process was “impractical and it belies reality,” noting that it can take 30 of the proposed 90 days just to undertake the statutory notice of putting up signs and advertising in a newspaper. He said he is worried the result will be a quick pipeline to the OLT.
“The outcome that we don’t want, the unintended consequence of this, is that applications get filed to the OLT,” he said. “And they lawyer up and it becomes adversarial.”
Both he and Ana Bailao, Toronto’s deputy mayor for housing, argued that the planning process works best on major projects when there’s a dialogue between the developer and city staff, as well as the local community.
Ms. Bailao noted that this can be a complicated back and forth and said that the onus can’t be on the city alone to speed the process.
“The legislation needs to be drafted in a way that not only tells municipalities that they have to do things in a certain way, but the applicant as well,” she said in an interview. “We give them comments. So if they take long to respond, there’s nothing we can do.”
Giulio Cescato, an associate director with IBI Group and a former manager of community planning with the City of Toronto, said the deadlines are unrealistic for large projects. He said the province’s plan appears poorly thought out and could further jam the OLT with appeals.
“If the intent of this was to speed up the process, I think the result of it will be precisely the opposite,” Mr. Cescato said in an interview.
He said no one disagrees the planning system needs to be improved. A better way forward for Toronto, he said, would be to concentrate efforts on revising its outdated zoning rules, which determine how high buildings can be, among other things, so that they match its official plan, which lays out where the city intends to grow.
Doing so, he said, would allow developers to get their approvals without jumping though as many hoops.
Despite the concerns, Ontario’s Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister, Steve Clark, doubled down on the refund policy as a key incentive to speed up application approvals at the municipal level.
“I make no apologies about trying to add some rigour into the system,” Mr. Clark told reporters on Thursday at Queen’s Park. “We’ve got to get shovels in the ground faster and this is the way to do it.”
Cam Guthrie, the mayor of Guelph, Ont., and the current chairman of Ontario’s Big City Mayors group, said he agreed the deadlines could cause issues with planning departments, which are already short-staffed. But he said the housing crisis means all governments need to work together to find new solutions.
“We have to try something new,” Mr. Guthrie said. “We can’t continue the way we have for years, because the current reality of housing is not working.”

Ontario bill plans to boost housing supply while prices keep rising: New changes made by the province meant to speed up construction while the real estate market prices continue to skyrocket

Full text: Ontario’s Municipal Affairs Minister is introducing a series of proposed changes meant to speed up the municipal planning process to boost the province’s supply of housing, though they exclude most of the recommendations made earlier this year by a government-appointed task force.
One key housing affordability recommendation not included in the bill Steve Clark put before the legislature on Wednesday is a sweeping proposal to ban zoning rules, which currently exclude all but single-family homes in swaths of the province’s cities.
That idea, while backed by many housing experts and the Toronto Region Board of Trade, was expected to induce opposition from some homeowners, with provincial and municipal elections looming.
Mr. Clark, who had promised a bold plan to address surging housing prices before the June election, told reporters that municipalities had pushed back against these zoning reforms, prompting the government to hold off. But he said he is launching new public consultations and a working group with municipalities on future measures, and that he remains committed to using the task force report as a “longterm road map” over the next four years.
“I couldn’t bust forward … when municipalities are so adamantly opposed,” he said, citing reluctance from the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, as well as Toronto, which has nonetheless started its own study of similar zoning changes. “I have to get them onside. This is not going to work with just one level of government doing whatever they want.”
Provisions that are in the bill are aimed at what the development industry has long complained is a sluggish municipal approvals process that can take anywhere from nine months to two years before housing can be built. One change would ensure that municipal-planning staff, not elected councils, oversee the detailed “site plan control” process for development projects, which involves sorting out landscaping, walkways or parking.
Municipalities will also be forced to refund developer fees if they miss deadlines for approvals.
And new rules, yet to be drafted, would limit the authority of municipalities when approving plans of subdivision.
The bill also includes a new process for municipalities to request fast-track approval from the province for certain key projects, a move aimed at addressing criticism from the Auditor General and opposition politicians of the government’s frequent practice of issuing what are known as ministerial zoning orders (MZOs). The government says this new “Community Infrastructure and Housing Accelerator” could be used to speed up projects such as hospitals and community centres, “while increasing transparency and accountability.”
MZOs, critics have pointed out, insulate projects from appeals before the province’s land tribunal and have been used to skirt environmental rules. Many have been granted to large developers who are also large donors to the PC Party. Mr. Clark said the new process will require municipalities to consult the public on these projects, make the request and any resulting order public.
The minister of municipal affairs and housing will also be able to impose conditions on the approvals.
The bill would also amend the province’s building code to allow for 12-storey wood-timber buildings, something proponents say is a more environmentallyfriendly alternative to concrete and steel.
Richard Joy, president of the Urban Land Institute, said he was disappointed the government did not adopt the most attentiongrabbing recommendation from the task force – to allow more density in neighbourhoods across the province – arguing that putting forward such legislation before the election could have helped the Tories pursue a mandate for the controversial move.
“I don’t doubt how difficult it would be to advance that idea politically, but it is essential nonetheless,” he said. “It is arguably one of the most important frontiers for the future.”
Ontario Real Estate Association head Tim Hudak, a former Progressive Conservative leader, said in a statement that the group would continue to push for an end to exclusionary zoning that allows only houses in many city neighbourhoods. But the group praised the government for its move to speed up bureaucracy related to development.
Toronto’s deputy mayor for housing, Ana Bailao, said that while it was positive to speed up the approvals process, there were other factors hindering housing construction, such as supplychain issues and labour shortages.
“I think there’s more to it than just saying, ‘oh, municipalities are approving things too slowly,’” she said. “Could there be improvement? Absolutely, and I think we all acknowledge that.”
Opposition NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the plan doesn’t do enough to make housing more affordable or reduce rents. Ms. Horwath said the province should reintroduce rental controls and help prospective first-time home buyers enter the housing market.
“People need a roof over their head if they’re going to build a good life in this province and they need to be able to afford that roof,” Ms. Horwath told reporters.
“This announcement today does nothing to solve that housing crisis.”
On Tuesday, Ontario announced another move aimed at cooling the red-hot housing market, saying it would extend a speculation tax in place for foreign property buyers to the entire province and raise it to 20 per cent from 15 per cent.
Since being elected in 2018, the government has made a series of major changes to the province’s planning regime with the aim of getting more housing built. Mr. Clark points to recent housing starts, the highest in decades, and increasing numbers of rental housing construction as proof his strategy is working.
But opposition critics and environmentalists have said that too many of the policy changes, which included loosening density requirements and making municipalities designate more farmland for development, have favoured companies looking to build low-density sprawl outside Toronto.
In February, the government’s housing affordability task force, chaired by Jake Lawrence, the Bank of Nova Scotia’s CEO and group head of global banking and markets, issued a set of sweeping recommendations for changes to the planning process and said the province needs to commit to building 1.5 million new homes over the next 10 years.
The report said the government should declare that up to four units, with up to four storeys, be allowed “as of right” – automatically without rezoning – doing away with local rules that now mandate just single-family homes. It also called for the legalization of rooming houses and the end of parking-spot requirements for developments in municipalities of 50,000 people or more.

Halifax’s rapid growth driving commercial real estate: Record-breaking migration is boosting development of new spaces while industry and office markets try to keep up

Full text: What happens to a region when its housing market goes crazy and then businesses and industries need commercial space to support those new residents?
Halifax is finding out.
Since December, 2019, house prices in Halifax rose by nearly 50 per cent, an increase that The Economist describes as “a boom that only a tiny number of cities have bettered.”
Downtown and suburban office vacancy rates in the Halifax area are still relatively high, according to data released last week from Colliers Canada. That’s changing as the pandemic finally shows signs of waning, people continue to move to Halifax, workers are expected to return to their cubicles and tourism gears up for a major boost.
A new luxury hotel, the 109-room Muir, opened on the Halifax waterfront in early December, anchoring a major $200-million redevelopment of the city’s prime tourist area. The hotel, designed by Nova Scotia architect Brian MacKay-Lyons, seeks to capture the mystique of the great luxury liners, jutting toward the water and built with local sandstone, timber and material called Muntz metal – a blend of copper, zinc and iron used in shipbuilding to withstand harsh seawater.
Another nearby mixed-use project called Cunard is under construction, which will include retail and public space along with 231 residential rental units.
Meanwhile, the office and industrial market is trying to keep up. The relatively high office vacancy rate is expected to tighten, and to meet the anticipated demand, three large office projects are now under construction in the Halifax area, which will add nearly 175,000 square feet. Industrial property is already scarce, with a record low vacancy rate of 2.4 per cent in this year’s first quarter, down from 2.7 per cent in the last quarter of 2021.
“If you come here you’ll see a skyline full of cranes,” says Mike White, director of valuations at Colliers Canada in Halifax.
Commercial activity has been prompted by the influx of new people in Halifax, says Patrick Sullivan, president and chief executive officer of the Halifax Chamber of Commerce.
“Statistics Canada recently ranked growth in downtown Halifax as number one in the entire country between 2016 and the end of last year. The overall population grew by 9.1 per cent and downtown Halifax grew by 26.1 per cent,” Mr. Sullivan says.
By comparison, Toronto’s downtown grew by 16.1 per cent in the same period, as city dwellers moved to the suburbs and to other cities – including Halifax.
According to Statistics Canada, more young people moved to Nova Scotia in 2021, and the province’s population reached one million for the first time. The province gained 4,678 new residents from other parts of the country in the second quarter of 2021 alone.
Migration to Halifax is driven at least partly by the fact that even though house prices are jumping, they’re still relatively cheap – in January, 2022, the average Halifax home sold for $392,828, which can hardly fetch a closet-sized condo in Toronto or Vancouver.
But this migration is raising expectations in the commercial market, Colliers’s Mr. White says. Although there are currently still many vacant offices in the Halifax area, demand is growing, he says.
“A lot of long-vacant commercial properties downtown are being bought up and either renovated or repurposed for live-work space,” Mr. White says. “National investors are starting to recognize that we exist out here.”
In the first part of the pandemic, after it was officially declared in March, 2020, retail properties languished in the region as people were locked down and couldn’t shop, Mr. White says.
Since then, properties that include grocery and pharmacy chains have risen in demand, not just by the grocers and the drug stores but by other retailers who want to be close by.
“There’s definitely more interest in these rock-solid, pandemic-proof tenants,” Mr. White says.
There are also new 21st-century jobs, Mr. Sullivan adds.
“Halifax has been awarded hundreds of millions [shared with other Atlantic regions] for the Ocean Supercluster,” he notes, a program in which the federal government matches funds with investors, startups and researchers in leading-edge areas related to ocean resources and protection, such as digital technology, artificial intelligence, plant science, advance manufacturing and – in Halifax’s case – ocean research.
“It’s another reason why the demand for industrial property in Halifax has been on fire,” Mr. White says.
“The supply of industrial sites here is highly constricted. There’s one primary site for ocean-related industry and it’s pretty much full,” he explains.
“Halifax has also reached number seven on the list of cities in the growth of its tech sector,” Mr. Sullivan adds. The ranking is from CBRE’s 2021 Scoring Tech Talent survey, which showcases up-and-coming areas for tech-related jobs and startups.
There is some potential as well for Halifax to benefit from the worldwide trend among manufacturers and distributors of all kinds of goods to rethink their supply chains, which were disrupted by COVID-19.
“Halifax is one of Canada’s major ports.
Our supply chains weren’t disrupted as much as some others during the pandemic, but companies are looking at industrial space for distribution centres,” Mr. Sullivan says.
As for desk jobs, Colliers’s new commercial real estate report for Halifax notes that in the first quarter of this year, more than 130,000 square feet of office space have been rented, as businesses make decisions “that were on hold during the pandemic.”
“From a commercial perspective, Halifax was moribund for a long time, but it’s finally showing up on people’s radar,” Mr. White says. “That has costs – it drives up housing prices and the cost of living and the infrastructure has to keep up – but in the long run it’s a good thing.”

Full text: If you want to understand the biggest problem in Canadian tech right now, ask someone who jumped from a Canadian company to an American one how their life has changed.
You’ll probably get one of two answers.
One of them is about money. A Torontobased engineer who spoke to The Globe and Mail recently described getting a 20per-cent raise when the startup they worked for was acquired by an American company.
“I was the same smart – or stupid – person I was when I was working for a Canadian company,” the engineer said. (The Globe is not identifying many tech-sector workers who spoke for this story who requested their identities remain confidential so as not to hurt future job prospects.)
The other answer is more existential.
Canada doesn’t seem to know how to support its own talent. That same engineer remembers politicians bragging about the low cost of Canadian labour as governments rolled out the red carpet for Amazon.com Inc. a few years ago, hoping it would establish a second headquarters in a city such as Toronto or Calgary in a widely publicized competition across North America.
“Are you the greatest thing since sliced bread, or are you cheap outsourcing for America?” the engineer asks. It’s a worthwhile question, given the number of U.S.
giants that have already set up engineering outposts here, including Amazon.com Inc., Twitter Inc., and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.
The problem gets worse. American corporate hegemony has a lot to do with America’s market size, but that size also generates lots of genuinely world-changing ideas. By contrast, many of the biggest TSX-traded tech companies care more about mergers and acquisitions than innovation, sell boring business-to-business software, or both. Even among Canada’s more innovative mid-sized companies and startups, few are trying to build the next great platform.
Platforms are exciting – a chance to work on the cutting edge of how everyday people experience the digital world.
But Canadian companies, numerous engineers and developers say, are very rarely so exciting. “People who graduate from [the University of] Waterloo don’t want to write insurance software,” said the engineer.
One Toronto-area undergrad who just completed a $10,000-a-month internship in Canada with a Big Tech company puts this feeling more succinctly. His country, he said, is filled with boring “boomer tech companies.”
The COVID-19 pandemic’s shift to remote work has made it a lot easier for people such as the engineer and the undergrad to work for American companies. Increasingly, many of them are doing just that.
Nearly every Canadian tech executive is sweating this change. Talent was already hard to come by before 2020. Now its scarcity is driving salaries up by as much as 30 per cent a year for some companies, executives say, as they battle for Canada’s best engineers, scientists, developers and designers.
That’s great for workers, but it also leaves the sector facing a crisis. It’s had near-miraculous growth recently. Tech firms lured $14.7-billion in venture capital investment last year – passing the inflation-adjusted record set in the dot-com boom for the first time. The size of the ecosystem has expanded vastly: There were 752 deals last year, the Canadian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (CVCA) said, compared with 361 in 2013, when the group began regularly tallying such data.
All that money comes with an expectation to perform. But it’s hard to perform when your talent is constantly getting poached by both domestic and global companies willing to pay them more.
Many Canadian tech executives are scrambling to keep their best staff and hire replacements for people who’ve already left – let alone hire more to sustain their momentum.
If domestic firms can’t attract enough skilled employees, it will be difficult to pull off ambitious growth plans. And since labour is usually one of a company’s biggest costs, skyrocketing compensation will pinch bottom lines everywhere if revenues don’t keep up with lofty growth expectations.
“If we stay on this trajectory, we’re in trouble, because the only way you can sustain this increase in wages is if you become more competitive in terms of the output you create,” said Viet Vu, senior economist at Toronto’s Brookfield Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, who studies the intersection of tech and labour.
Cory Janssen, co-chief executive of the mid-sized Edmonton-based artificial intelligence firm AltaML, puts his struggle plainly. “Can we compete with Big Tech? I don’t think it’s fair to say that we’d ever be able to get up to the numbers they’re throwing around,” he said. “So we’re doing everything we can in terms of flexibility and benefits, and the type of projects we’re working on.”
He and his fellow executives have a lot of convincing to do.
For an industry worried about a worker shortage, tech companies have never employed so many people. The number of Canadians working in professional occupations in natural and applied sciences – put another way, many of the country’s STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) jobs – has jumped by nearly 200,000, or 19 per cent, since the pandemic started, hardly affected by widespread COVID-19 layoffs.
More specifically, jobs are up 22 per cent (close to 60,000) in computer systems design, which includes everything from web developers to video game designers. Positions in scientific research and development are up 19 per cent, and in data processing, they’re up 32 per cent.
Employment in the rest of the economy is growing, too – but at nowhere near the same pace.
The numbers suggest that Canada’s labour market has experienced a sizable realignment – one that’s driven more people into white-collar jobs, and away from close-contact service industries that, in many respects, are still reeling from two years of rolling lockdowns.
“Tech clearly stands out as one of the leading sectors in the recovery from the pandemic downturn,” said Brendon Bernard, senior economist at Indeed Canada, a job-search site.
As of mid-February, tech job postings on Indeed had more than doubled from prepandemic levels. The sharpest growth (153 per cent) was for high-wage jobs with annual salaries above $81,000. Those figures point to “a challenging hiring environment for employers trying to fill those roles,” Mr. Bernard said.
For workers with the right skills, the amount of choice in today’s Canadian tech-job market is astonishing.
In just the past two weeks, Walmart Inc.
announced it would open a Toronto tech hub, with plans to hire 45 software developers, technical program managers and product managers. Meanwhile, Pinterest Inc. revealed that Toronto is its biggest international engineering outpost. The image-sharing site will have 125 employees there by the end of 2022. Even though the company is still working out the future of in-person work in Toronto, all of these employees are required to live in Ontario.
With a few exceptions, the biggest being e-commerce platform Shopify Inc., Canadian companies don’t carry as much global cultural cachet as a giant such as Pinterest would. Canadian providers’ products are often innovative, but behind the scenes.
The aforementioned undergrad said that when his peers look at Canadian companies, they tend to zero in on those with big-name U.S. co-signs, such as Y Combinator, the large and influential Mountain View, Calif., startup accelerator.
Otherwise, for those workers taking a long-term view, many Canadian companies can pose a “risk” on a résumé.
For years, this kind of attitude has resulted in what concerned executives and pundits called a brain drain of Canadian talent to Silicon Valley. But now those brains don’t even have to get on a plane.
One Canadian employee of Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. said working on products being used around the world is “an exciting proposition.” In his first stint with Facebook, he was based out of its Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters, where he was surrounded by fellow Canadians who saw the same opportunity he did.
Now he works remotely from Toronto, and his team members are as far-flung as Atlanta, Seattle and London. He is, however, paid less than his colleagues in San Francisco. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has embraced telework, but insisted that compensation is curbed in lower-cost areas.
Still, those wages are competitive, the Toronto employee said.
Although the city’s house prices and rents are steep, they aren’t as stratospheric as those in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley.
Meta looks at local salaries for a particular role and pays at the top percentile, he explained.
This is putting enormous pressure on Canadian companies to catch up. “Because the war for talent is so real, you’ve got people jumping ship left and right to
take another $5,000 to $10,000 – or we’ve seen $40,000 or $60,000 [raises] per year to go to the company next door,” said Travis O’Rourke, the president of recruiting firm Hays Canada, which often works with technology companies.
Those anecdotes bear out in the data, to an extent. Canadian companies recruited around 8,000 software engineers and more than 12,000 computer programmers in the fourth quarter of 2021 – both substantial increases from two years ago, according to Statistics Canada figures. For computer programmers, the average hourly wage being offered was $40.35, a two-year increase of 15 per cent. For software engineers, those offers jumped 18 per cent to $47.30 an hour.
And those figures don’t account for the hiring bonuses, performance-based compensation and stock options the industry frequently uses to attract or retain highlyskilled employees – and which are adding to prohibitive labour costs for tech firms.
And the longer this situation persists, the more pressure there’ll be to keep boosting compensation.
Jean Le Bouthillier, CEO of the Quebec and Waterloo, Ont., cybersecurity company Qohash, said he’s raised salaries by 30 per cent. “That’s probably going to keep going,” he said. “If you have colleagues who work for a U.S.-based company who make a higher salary, word gets around.”
One of the top complaints in Canadian tech used to be that it was impossible to find seasoned executives who knew how to scale up specialty teams, such as in sales and marketing, to help companies navigate the tough changes needed to grow into bigger, more mature organizations.
That concern, CVCA CEO Kim Furlong said, “has diminished with that fact that Canadian companies can hire in the U.S.
or anywhere in the world, and find a way to bring this person on their team in some sort of remote fashion.”
The problem has now reversed: Every digital company around the globe can now hire anywhere it wants for any position. So, a new worldwide problem has emerged. “Planet Earth has not made enough engineers to deal with rapid digitalization,” Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke told analysts on a conference call last month.
On the call, Mr. Lutke revealed his company more than doubled its R&D hiring rate last year over 2020. He insisted Shopify is one of the world’s best-paying, too, and the company said the company’s stock-based compensation and payroll expenses would double to US$800-million this year.
Compensation aggregator Levels.fyi suggests that a front-end web developer for Shopify in Toronto can make as much as US$206,000 a year in base pay, stock and bonuses – roughly in the realm of some Toronto jobs at Amazon.
Even so, some Shopify employees have been quietly frustrated with compensation in recent months, according to complaints on the app Blind, a forum for techsector workers that verifies users’ employers, but lets the workers post anonymously.
Now that Shopify’s stock price has collapsed by more than half from its November, 2021, to $846.65 last week, amid a broad tech sell-off, many of the 215,893 stock options the company granted, at an average exercise price of $1,380.21, are underwater and currently of little value.
At Edmonton development shop Punchcard Systems, managing partner Sam Jenkins is looking at a 20-per-cent pay boost across the company. “That scares the crap out of me,” he said, “If our largest expense is increasing by 20 per cent, I’m struggling to figure out how to pass that down. How do we ask our customers to pay 20 per cent more?” Executives across the country are doing the same, openly discussing raises of between 10 per cent and 30 per cent – in some cases, mulling boosts of 75 per cent.
“There’s almost no ceiling,” said Anette Ceraficki, director of people at the Calgary employee-recognition platform Kudos Inc, and a co-chair of Tech West Collective, a group of executives trying to lure workers to local companies.
There’s another way to buy yourself out of a crisis. Toronto’s Daylight Automation, which helps businesses digitally automate form-filling and data collection, had tried everything from matchmaking services and recruiters, to hosting networking events, in order to hire software developers and other technical staff who would be a cultural fit.
Of course, Daylight has raised salaries.
“We have to deal with the realities of the market,” said co-founder Art Harrison. But it also came up with another solution: It bought one of its best clients. The company scooped up Whitehorse’s Proof Data Technology in January in an “acqui-hire” that instantly grew its engineering team by seven people who already knew how its software worked.
“It meant we could fill these roles – to get the great candidates in, and know they can make an impact on day one,” Mr. Harrison said.
Cory Janssen normally spends his days selling his vision for harnessing artificial intelligence to make life easier for customers and partners such as Suncor Energy Inc. and Alberta Heath Services. Lately, though, Mr. Janssen finds himself spending more time scouring LinkedIn. To deal with the talent crunch, the co-CEO of 125employee AltaML has got deeply involved in recruitment, even showing up in job interviews to make a personal pitch. “I feel like I’m the closer,” Mr. Janssen said.
Tech executives say they also try to appeal to candidates’ sense of corporate purpose to persuade people to join them.
Some clients of Alberta’s AltaML are in the health sector, which Mr. Janssen emphasizes during recruitment to lure employees seeking meaning in their work. “I think you need to tell a story about who you are,” he said.
If there’s one story Canadians know well, it’s the never-ending tale of scorching house prices and rents. One recent Globe and Mail analysis found that a person needs a salary of $95,000 a year to comfortably cover rent and utilities in a onebedroom apartment in Vancouver, and $90,000 in Toronto. This doesn’t just prevent the majority of society from living comfortably – it’s also a cutoff for people in some of the most lucrative jobs in some of the country’s fastest-growing industries.
One person who was born and raised in Vancouver told The Globe they decided to take a job with a Big Tech platform in New York partly because of the city’s draw, but also because they’d be able to save for a Vancouver home faster there.
Pay in New York is a “significant multiple” of what B.C. companies would offer, the person said. In other words, in order to buy a house in the Canadian city they want to call home, they had to leave it: “If this is my internal calculus, this is certainly happening at scale.”
It very well may be. The Toronto-area undergraduate who called homegrown firms “boomer tech companies” is planning to leave as soon as he graduates and make a beeline for the United States. Relocating for work “sucks so much,” he said – and he loves his hometown – but it’s hard to choose time with friends and family when Silicon Valley or Seattle companies wave “this big paycheque in your face.”
Staying home can be “hard to justify” for these workers, said Mike Moffatt, who researches Ontario migration trends as an assistant professor at Western University’s Ivey Business School and a senior director at the Smart Prosperity Institute.
“It used to be that you could stay in Toronto, and yeah, you wouldn’t make as much as you would in Silicon Valley, but you could conceivably afford a house. … That’s largely gone now.” The remotework era, he said, exacerbates a trend playing out within Canada. As Torontonians buy up real estate in nearby centres such as Hamilton, Kitchener and Brantford, and continue to earn Toronto wages, they displace locals who earn less.
There are other unique Canadian roadblocks to consider as well. The cybersecurity company Qohash is technically now fully remote, but its Quebec headquarters could leave the company subject to the province’s new ambitious Bill 96 language law, which is expected to require many businesses to conduct communications largely in French.
Mr. Le Bouthillier, its CEO, said despite his company’s pay bumps, he’s struggling to find specialized talent – including experts in development, security and operations – and the language law may make the hunt even harder.
It should be said that not everyone in Canada’s sector believes the future of talent retention is a gloomy one. CVCA’s Ms. Furlong believes “people will find creative solutions to find the right people to build your teams.” Ben Bergen, president of the Council of Canadian Innovators, believes enhanced training programs and immigration of skilled workers will be “paramount to the future of the country’s economy and its prosperity.”
There are a variety of ways the government could support the sector in ways that could offset salary costs while boosting R&D, said the Brookfield Institute’s Mr. Vu. Ottawa could revamp procurement rules to better focus on Canadian companies; move forward with the advanced research agency the Liberals promised in the last federal election campaign; and revamp federal tax credits to better focus on R&D.
The sector could get some imminent relief through immigration, which slowed during the pandemic. The federal Liberals have ramped up their targets for immigration intake over three years, aiming to admit more than 1.3 million permanent residents by the end of 2024. Ottawa has explicitly said its plan is designed to fill labour shortages in a range of industries.
Tech companies are certainly drawing interest. In January, nearly 19 per cent of clicks on Canadian tech job postings on Indeed were made by job seekers abroad, compared with 16.3 per cent two years ago.
But minting new Canadians also means adding more pressure to the housing market. Without a significant uptick in new builds, soaring housing costs might make the country less attractive to job seekers.
But for all the structural problems throwing talent retention into disarray, the sector is offering some structural solutions, too. Universities could focus more on partnering with Canadian companies to build out a talent pipeline, said Mr. Bergen, whose Council of Canadian Innovators lobbies on behalf of 140 of Canada’s highest-profile tech companies.
Many schools already have direct pipelines into American companies, after all.
He brings up the University of Toronto’s deep connection to Google, thanks to its acquisition of professor and AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton’s business DNNresearch Inc. nearly a decade ago.
“How can you help direct that amazing talent towards building companies here, building wealth here, building opportunity here?” Mr. Bergen asked.
Some businesses are taking training into their own hands. In late 2020, Mr. Janssen’s AltaML launched paid internships with some of its corporate partners, including Suncor and ATB Financial, to train people with technical experience in AI to apply it in real corporate settings. If people don’t have the right applied skillsets – which can be hard to find in burgeoning fields such as machine learning – AltaML decided to help those people get the skills themselves.
Eighty-six per cent of its first cohort found work in Calgary after finishing the internship program. Leave it to an Alberta company to build a pipeline. “You can’t just sit there and hire people with five years in machine-learning experience,” Mr. Janssen said. “They don’t exist.”
Other organizations are intervening even earlier. “We know this is a long-term problem,” said Tech West Collective’s Kelly Thompson. “So we’re reaching all the way down to school-aged kids … and hopefully we can get them more excited about STEM.”
None of this, however, will quickly solve the sector’s most pressing problem. “Talent is probably the thing that I stress most about,” Punchcard’s Mr. Jenkins said.
“This is a great time to be a software developer, because you have so much choice.”

Full text: 28 Foxtrail Cres., Vaughan, Ont.
WOODBRIDGE Asking price: $2,088,000 (January, 2022) Selling price: $2,330,000 (January, 2022) Previous selling price: $1,001,000 (October, 2014) Taxes: $7,309 (2021) Days on the market: One Listing agents: Belinda Lelli and Suzanne Stephens, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
THE ACTION Agent Belinda Lelli said she was warned by locals that the $2.088-million price tag on his four-bedroom house in Woodbridge was too rich, since a larger home in the Vaughan neighbourhood only sold for $1.5-million a few months earlier.
But Ms. Lelli said that buyers from other parts of the Greater Toronto Area saw the value in paying a premium for the home on a large 53-foot-by-110-foot lot abutting protected greenspace. Within a day, four bidders made their offers and the house sold $242,000 over asking.
“The original offer date would have been exactly one week from the list date, but the activity was frenetic,” Ms. Lelli said.
“What this house offered that you’re not getting in the city is a backyard looking onto Boyd Conservation Area, so you feel like you’re in Muskoka or at a cottage; it’s extremely peaceful.”
WHAT THEY GOT The 23-year-old house has a formal dining room and a breakfast area off the kitchen. The adjacent family room features a three-sided fireplace, vaulted ceilings and a skylight.
Upstairs, the largest bedroom has his and her closets and a six-piece bathroom.
There is an interior entry from the double garage and, in the back, two south-facing decks and a patio. The basement is unfinished.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s ideal for families because they can sit and relax in the family room and at the breakfast counter in the chef’s kitchen, in addition to a whole eat-in area overlooking the conservation area,” Ms. Lelli said.
The property is close to established amenities. “You’re completely flanked by conservation space, a recreation centre and top high school, so nothing else will be built around you,” Ms. Lelli said.

Full text: In February, real estate in the city of Toronto broke another record on price appreciation when the price of the average detached home reached $2-million for the first time.
Toronto has seen multimillion-dollar homes selling by the handful in recent years and there are some entire neighbourhoods where $2-million won’t buy you much, but for the average of a detached home to get there was a new thing, a psychological barrier broken. It wasn’t that long ago that the average resale price for all homes (including apartments, semis and townhouses) crossed the million-dollar mark, which set off a wave of affordability hand-wringing.
So what exactly is $2-million worth today? Here are five examples of homes listed for $2-million across the country.
VANCOUVER In February and (so far in) March of 2022, about 20 detached homes have sold in Vancouver around the $2-million mark according to Douglas Gibson, associate realtor with Stilhavn Real Estate Services. Across the greater Vancouver region, the average price of a detached home is $2,288,072 – so if you’re below the average, some of those homes are not going to be showpieces.
“I’m looking at these houses and, holy moley, you’re not super stoked. Those are not amazing homes,” Mr. Gibson said. Oftentimes, the actual house is significantly less valuable than the land it sits on. Many of the $2-million homes are some version of the Vancouver Special, where the owner might live in 1,100 square feet while a renter lives in a similar size unit on the ground floor or in a basement suite.
Mr. Gibson recently listed a charming house – built in 1931 but recently given a high-end renovation, complete with a basement income unit – on a corner lot at 1795 E 34th Ave. for $1,999,988.
The house ended up selling significantly over asking, but Mr. Gibson would not reveal the final purchase price, as the deal was still in probate.
“It’s in the middle of East Vancouver,” an area he said had a rough and “edgy” reputation in the 1980s but these days is “hip and historic.”
CALGARY With dark stucco and stained wood exterior elements, 72 Patterson Cres. looks like a fairly standard modern suburban splitlevel home. Inside is something else entirely.
Fully renovated in 2017 with interior design by one of the city’s top firms, Cridland Associates, the main room of the 6,000square-foot house is an atrium that opens to a second-level mezzanine balcony that showcases an enormous mural by the late local artist Jason Gogo.
“This house is very high end and very custom: Not everybody wants an apple-red kitchen,” said Lisa Atkins, sales representative with Century 21 Bravo Realty.
With a list price of $2.075-million, she is pushing the expectations for the neighbourhood: “This house is definitely the jewel amongst them. … If we took that house and moved it to a more affluent neighbourhood [it] would be over $3-million and it would probably sell in 12 hours with multiple bids.”
In February, the average selling price for detached homes in the city of Calgary hit $677,652 (up 15 per cent year over year). That average draws attention: “Toronto thinks we’re on sale – we’ve had clients say, ‘We’ll take these five houses,’ ” Ms. Atkins said. ”You guys [from Toronto] are really helping the market.”
TORONTO There are five houses for sale in Toronto for more than $20-million as of late March, so maybe it’s a bargain to find something for 10 times less.
Take the two-storey house at 17 Ferrier Ave. – about a half-block north of Danforth Avenue near Pape Avenue – that’s listed for $1,949,900. Sales representative Thalia Kiriopoulos with Keller Williams Referred Realty helped her investor client purchase the home in 2017.
“He never lived there; when he first purchased it it was tenanted, so he was renting it for a couple years,” she said, until he gave those folks their notice and renovated the space top to bottom.
The interior is what you might call flip-for-sale chic: Light hardwood floors, open-concept main room, all the finishes done in white or glass. Three bedrooms upstairs (primary bed with ensuite bath and front-porch balcony access), two in the basement, four bathrooms total.
Ms. Kiriopoulos is realistic about where the heated market is; she is not holding offers and doesn’t expect the home to sell over the asking price. “I think [my client] was expecting over $2million for this house, but it’s not worth over $2-million,” she said.
“He’ll still make a great profit.” According to HouseSigma.com data, the home was bought for $1.095-million in 2017.
MONTREAL In the third-most expensive borough of Montreal, $2-million will buy you a fixer-upper on a big lot with room to grow, according to Kyle Shapcott, broker with Re/ Max Du Cartier.
He is listing 428 Walpole Ave. in the Town of Mont Royal (a postwar inner suburb on the Island of Montreal) for $2.095-million, and could get more if it had a newer kitchen and updated bathrooms.
“It’s got the charm of a 1930s home, rare for the neighbourhood … and it’s got all the bones for somebody to make something really exceptional of it,” Mr. Shapcott said.
At the end of 2021, average prices for detached homes were $950,675 on the island. That’s up 14 per cent year over year.
In the Mont-Royal Plateau area, detached home prices averaged just under $1.3-million by the end of 2021.
“You’re looking at about a 10to 12-per-cent rise in prices per year since the pandemic started,” said Mr. Shapcott, who also said the bilingual Westmount and Mont Royal Westmount areas (the No. 1 and No. 3 most expensive neighourhoods) have seen faster price growth than the mainly French Outrement. That, he says, can be explained in part by the influence of foreign buyers, who went from 5 per cent of home purchasers in Mont Royal prior to 2017 to more than 25 per cent today.
HALIFAX The closest any sales in Halifax came to $2-million in February was a $1.8-million sale, so it takes a special property to break the $2million mark.
That’s what Sandra Bryant, broker for Bryant Realty Atlantic, says she has with 810 Young Ave., a stately address near Point Pleasant Park.
“You’re on the main street of Halifax,” Ms. Bryant said. “This street is made up of established older homes and extremely wealthy people. If you went three or four doors to the right, you’ll see one of the richest people in the East Coast; he built a mansion and he’s into his home for $20million.”
Built in 1918, the 5,700-squarefoot, seven-bedroom, five-bathroom does need some updates, but a key feature is a spectacular half-acre lot facing southwest. It was initially listed at $2-million, but it’s now advertised at $2.59million.
It’s a lot more than the average Ontario buyer – who Ms. Bryant said she deals with every day – is looking to spend, but there are deals to be had elsewhere.
In February, the Halifax-Dartmouth area saw average sale prices reach $634,406 for a detached home, which is double or more than every other community in Nova Scotia except for the Annapolis Valley, where prices averaged $393,537 in February.

Full text: 367R Euclid Ave., Toronto LITTLE ITALY Asking price: $1,289,000 (February, 2022) Selling price: $1.69-million (February, 2022) Previous selling price: $275,000 (June, 2000) Taxes: $5,963 (2021) Days on the market: Eight Listing agents: Christian Vermast and Paul Maranger, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada THE ACTION This laneway house near the bustling shops and bistros of College Street drew about 30 visitors with its attractive modern redesign of a heritage space.
The former dairy stable was toured by a variety of house hunters, including a couple of Florida retirees looking for a Toronto pied-à-terre and local first-time buyers looking for open space.
Within a week, a dozen offers landed, all willing to at least meet the $1.289-million sticker price. But one bid surpassed all others at $1.69-million, or $401,000 over asking.
“We knew it was a unique property and it would get a lot of attention … but did we know it would get that much attention?
No,” agent Christian Vermast said.
“There are more and more laneway homes coming up, but very few are in prime Little Italy and very few are duplexes.”
WHAT THEY GOT This yellow brick building on an 18-foot-by-64-foot lot was built in 1890 to accommodate horses transporting milk for Coopers Canadian Dairy.
In 2015, veteran actor Christopher Heyerdahl hired the architectural firm Sustainable T.O. to redesign the interior with two modern units, leaving original details intact.
Brick walls are exposed in the foyer leading into a one-bedroom unit with open entertaining and cooking quarters.
In the owner’s suite – entered via a side door – a main-floor office displays rich, beamed ceilings and new bamboo floors and stair treads to the second floor.
That level provides two bedrooms, an open living room and a raised kitchen with skylights.
Directly above is a 325-squarefoot deck.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “Although it was renovated, it kept a few historic elements that made it more interesting,” Mr. Vermast said.
“I loved the fact it was at the end of a lane, sheltered by a condo building and literally 50 steps to College Street, but I also loved the rooftop deck. It was a very fabulous, sexy rooftop deck.”

A home for the hard times: Owner says her Lytton Park house helped her ‘to keep seeing the beauty in things’

Full text: 269 Glengrove Ave.
TORONTO Asking price: $5,299,000 Taxes: $18,880.30 (2021) Lot size: 40 by 175 feet Listing agent: Jamie Dempster, Broker, Re/Max Hallmark Realty Ltd., Brokerage THE BACKSTORY Realtors will often urge sellers to declutter and depersonalize a house’s interior spaces, but sometimes the most personal elements are a vital part of that home’s story.
That’s the case for Madeleine Greenwald’s home at 269 Glengrove Ave. Renovated and enlarged in 2009-10 by Toronto residential architect Peter Higgins, the red-brick façade evokes the sombre reserve of Georgian homes (while missing some of the geometric symmetry common to that form).
Inside, a different story emerges as hanging on the wall of the front foyer – done in white panel with picture-frame moulding – is a vivid painting; a riot of colour that features a man in a kayak paddling toward the horizon.
Called Sunset Paddle, this is just one of many paintings by Ms. Greenwald that fill the home, a passion that became a second career after her family moved to Canada in 2015.
“My husband got a job up here and we fell in love with this neighbourhood,” she said, thanks to its schools, important for their three children. House hunting in a new country while still living in Chicago was a challenge; Toronto’s market in 2015 was not as scorching as it is now, but homes were moving fast on multiple offers.
On the hunt for a turnkey home with no need for renovations, Ms. Greenwald’s husband made an offer on the Glengrove house before she even had a chance to see it, as he was about to board a plane.
They got it, the kids were settling in and then an unwelcome surprise.
“Six months after moving to Toronto I was diagnosed with breast cancer,” she said. The treatment and recovery was difficult, as was settling on what to do with her career: She had been a women’s health advocate and lawyer before leaving the U.S.
“One day my husband came home with an easel. It was the greatest gift anyone’s ever given me. It’s brought back a passion that I always had,” said Ms. Greenwald, who studied art at the University of Wisconsin before pursuing a career in law. “When you have cancer you decide, ‘I’m going to do everything now.’ ” She found support and inspiration in her new surroundings. She took classes at a nearby art school, she joined the North Toronto Group of Artists and the Lawrence Park Arts Collective, and had her work exhibited at churches, real estate offices, local galleries and this past September had her first solo show ”Beautiful Ontario,” at the Niagara Pumphouse Arts Centre in Niagara on the Lake.
“It’s been really exciting to have the career as an artist that I really always wanted to have,” she said.
THE HOUSE TODAY Since moving in, Ms. Greenwald has done some updates, but hasn’t substantially changed much, not least because she was over the whole “living through a project” thing: “We had done a renovation in a house in D.C., and this was our third move in three years … we just didn’t want to do it.”
Next to the foyer with the sunset paddler is what could be a sitting room with a cozy fireplace were it not for the baby grand piano (“My middle child played piano,” Ms. Greenwald says). This music room opens into a formal dining room, also accessible from the front hall. At the end of the tiled front hall – with its diamond pattern inlays – is a doorway that opens up to the kitchen and family room that occupies the back half of the house.
“We definitely spend most of our time in the family room/ kitchen, it’s the hub of the house,” Ms. Greenwald said.
The room is split almost evenly, and the kitchen is defined by the large island (with sink) that runs parallel to the rear wall and the gas range countertop. The cabinets are two tone: white shaker-style on the walls, dark brown wood on the island and upper storage, with dark stone counters.
A butler’s pantry is accessible from the back corner next to the wall-mounted double ovens. On the south-facing rear wall are two sets of French doors and large windows that fill the room with light, making it ideal for a somewhat unique use as a satellite painting studio.
“I do have a separate studio, but I end up painting at our kitchen table all the time,” Ms. Greenwald said. “[The kids] do their homework at the kitchen bar, we play games – we like each other, and we like to be around each other.” The living room side is framed by built-in shelving on two walls, surrounding the fireplace and flat-screen TV, and a huge set of bookshelves complete with ladder rail to reach the highest volumes. More of Ms. Greenwald’s landscapes and studies pepper this room.
The backyard is a sizable sward of green, and features one of the few major additions the couple put in: a hot tub. “My husband really loves hot tubs.”
The basement is primarily the domain of the kids. It has two guest bedrooms and two washrooms, and a massive recreation space that fits in a home gym, ping pong and foosball, and a hockey practice area complete with artificial ice flooring and a net.
“I manage my 14-year-old’s hockey team, and we have had the whole team of kids in the basement, and parents upstairs … the house is laid out really well.”
There are five bedrooms upstairs – four on the second level and a fifth in the attic that has balcony access – and all the rooms have access to an ensuite bath.
The primary suite occupies the back half of house on the second floor, and has balcony off the bedroom, a large walk-in closet and a six-piece showpiece bathroom complete with a stand-alone soaker tub next to the south-facing windows.
NEXT In the seven years since arriving in a new country, Ms. Greenwald has lived through a cancer diagnosis, a career change, has gotten two of her three kids off to university and lived through a global pandemic. With family in the United States – including one daughter who attends school there – she estimates she has spent roughly four months of the past two years in quarantine isolation (in that attic room, which became the third studio in the house as she painted prolifically while obeying publichealth rules).
They have entertained their community in the good times, and practised outdoor get-togethers (including frequent backyard Pilates sessions) in the tougher times. After all of that, it’s time to downsize and maybe move on.
Her solo show was themed around Ontario’s beauty, and one thing she won’t forget is how this place brought her back to art.
“It was really a tribute to this beautiful place that renewed my love of painting and allowed me to keep seeing the beauty in things during a really difficult time,” she said. “For me, art is about optimism. I really paint the world as I want it to be.”

The pricier end of the market can be slow: Despite Toronto’s red-hot market, some of the more expensive properties take a while to find a buyer

Full text: Even in the high-octane Toronto real estate market, some houses and condos are so singular that finding a new owner among a smaller pool of buyers takes some creativity.
In Toronto, a six-bedroom house in Lawrence Park is generating buzz for its $26.9-million asking price.
One reason for the curiosity is that the previous high water mark for a sale in the upscale family neighbourhood is around $14.6million.
The opulent six-bedroom house at 16 Stratheden Rd. has been on the market for more than 150 days.
Properties in the upper tier often stay longer on the market because sales in that price range are driven by desire, not need. Buyers who pay $20-million or more for a house often want to create their own vision.
The house is listed with agents Karen Rosenberg and Geraldine Del Zotto of Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd., who spotlight the “epic man cave” in the subterranean vehicle showroom, which has room for 12 cars. The area includes a cantilevered hydraulic lift and a tempered glass wall with a view into the billiards room.
The property is also featured on the cover of the realtor’s lifestyle magazine, which describes the grand foyer with marble flooring, a family room with a glasssurround cupola ceiling and a high-end kitchen in 10,500 square feet of above-ground living space.
Builder Andrew Nullmeyer of the design-build firm Nuvo Homes combined two properties to build the house on a 150-footby-125-foot lot for his family. His mother, Catherine Nullmeyer, owns the house.
Lawrence Park tends to appeal to families who want a well-appointed home on a large lot with lots of outdoor space under mature trees.
Agents say many buyers with deep pockets would choose to live about three kilometres to the north, in the Bridle Path, where two-acre lots provide plenty of room for palatial homes and some residents find seclusion in gated estates.
Even in that enclave, the richest price for a sale last year was around the $23-million mark.
At the centre of the city, Scott Hanton is battling the concept that the area around the pivotal intersection of Bloor and Yonge streets has not lived up to its promise in recent years.
Mr. Hanton, broker with Weir Team Brokerage Inc., recently listed a two-level penthouse with walls of glass and a view expanding from just below Bloor Street to Lake Ontario.
Penthouse 4601 at 33 Charles St.
E. is listed exclusively on Weir Team’s website with an asking price of $2.895-million.
Mr. Hanton says the unit has had a strong number of showings during the week or so it has been on the market.
“It’s super high-end but not in a super high-end area,” says Mr. Hanton, who also owns a unit in the tower known as Casa.
“I bought before it was even a hole in the ground,” he says.
Mr. Hanton says Charles Street east of Yonge Street was less dense when Casa broke ground. Now, six or seven towers line that stretch and the streetscape is less friendly to pedestrians.
“The sidewalks aren’t big enough any more,” he says of the influx of residents.
To bring exposure to the condo, Mr. Hanton let all of the highend agents in his database know that it has landed on the market.
He also added the listing to two carriage-trade portals in China.
Mr. Hanton’s marketing emphasizes the unit’s 2,000 square feet of indoor space and ceilings 10- and 15-feet high. The current owners redesigned the suite with such luxuries as a waterfall island and high-end appliances in the kitchen, a soaker tub in the ensuite bathroom and a home office overlooking the city.
Mr. Hanton had the expansive outdoor terraces virtually staged so prospective buyers could see how they would appear with comfortable loungers and planters filled with greenery.
His challenge in selling the penthouse, he says, is that many people with the budget to purchase an opulent condo would choose a more staid neighbourhood.
One of Casa’s neighbours is Sanctuary, an outreach centre for marginalized people living downtown.
“It is there to do good and it has been doing good for a long time,” Mr. Hanton says.
A couple of years ago, a tent city was established in a nearby park.
After that, the park was fenced off so that condo dwellers and other local residents no longer had access.
“It should feel more cared-for,” Mr. Hanton says of the neighbourhood. “It should be a place you want to go as opposed to a place you need to pass through.”
At one time, Mr. Hanton expected buyers at Bloor and Yonge to come from large houses in nearby Rosedale. Now, he says he believes they are more likely to be upsizers than downsizers.
“It does tend to skew a bit younger – an older couple would be in Yorkville proper,” he says.
Yorkville, the upscale neighbourhood just north of Bloor and a few steps to the west of the condo, tends to have more outdoor patios and high-end restaurants, he says.
In the past, Charles Street East had a quaint ambience, but today establishments with wroughtiron fences and flower boxes have given way to taller buildings.
He’d like to see a rejuvenation of the streetscape.
“It seems to be missing a lot of its charm now.”
To attract potential buyers of the penthouse, Mr. Hanton says, he stressed the solitude of the terrace 46 floors above ground level.
Residents can watch the weather rolling in and feel removed from the hectic pace of the city.
“When you walk in and see that spectacular view, that’s a big draw,” he says. “So what if there’s a little bit of riff-raff on the street?” Looking ahead, he sees room for Yonge and Bloor to bounce back as pandemic restrictions wind down and more retailers and restaurants move in.
“We’re on the upswing, but it’s been a tough few years.”
Jennifer Chan, broker with Sotheby’s International Realty Canada, is trying some new tactics after she listed a condo unit for sale in a boutique building across the street from Roy Thomson Hall.
Suite 2003 at 71 Simcoe St. is listed with an asking price of $1,799,999.
The two-bedroom-plus-den unit has lots of fine craftsmanship in the walnut floors, mahogany trim and hand-painted Venetian plaster finishes.
“It’s very traditional and beautiful – they put a lot of working into it,” Ms. Chan says.
The challenge for Ms. Chan is that the property has not been seeing traction with buyers because the decor is not in keeping with the current trend toward modern spaces with minimal finishes.
Ms. Chan said a stager she called in recommended the unit be painted all white.
The owner would prefer not to paint over the expensive materials, so Ms. Chan had the 1,725square-foot unit “virtually renovated” using digital image manipulation. The images show the suite as it would look with a modern facelift.
“I painted over it without giving her a heart attack,” Ms. Chan says. “We need to guide people to see the potential of the unit.”
After 29 days on the market, the owner has agreed to try Ms. Chan’s approach.
The area around King Street West has a very specific clientele, Ms. Chan adds. “I’m waiting for these people to come back.”
Ms. Chan says the residents of the area tend to love the theatre, the symphony and the area’s night life.
She imagines the buyers will use the suite as a weekend home or they may be a small family. An expat returning to Toronto may also find the location appealing.
Ms. Chan has given the unit lots of exposure in her WeChat group with agents in Hong Kong, mainland China and Singapore.
With pandemic restrictions lifting, King West is undergoing a revival, she says.
The high-end condo tranche has been moving in ebbs and flows in recent weeks, Ms. Chan adds.
“There are people still looking,” she says. “We’ll see what the market does.”
Agents in many segments of the Toronto market are reporting a slowdown in March. Some buyers appear to be exhausted, while others are concerned about the outlook for interest rates.
At Capital Economics, senior Canada economist Stephen Brown now expects the Bank of Canada to hike interest rates more aggressively than he had assumed.
Mr. Brown says the booming jobs market offsets the downside risks to near-term economic activity from higher energy prices.
Since inflation and economic growth appear to be running at a faster clip than his previous forecast, the central bank will likely tighten policy more boldly in order to get inflation under control, he adds. Such moves in turn present a downside risk to housing.

Full text: Over the past 18 years of writing “The Architourist,” I have tried to avoid listicles and top 10s, since they are typically poorly researched, vacuous affairs that don’t generate any further thought. About six months ago, however, a fellow architectural aficionado asked me which Toronto buildings pushed the city forward.
“Which buildings,” she asked, “advanced Toronto both culturally and artistically?” “Hmm,” I said. “Other than Viljo Revell’s New City Hall or the TD Centre, I guess, since those are too obvious?” “Sure,” she said.
I have been thinking about it ever since. Buildings have flashed before my eyes and then faded just as quickly. But a few have stayed knocking around in the ol’ Architourist noggin. So, with a hope that you, Dear Reader, don’t find this vacuous, I present nine still-standing buildings that pushed Toronto forward (1920s-2010s): THE ASHLEY-CRIPPEN HOUSE (1922, B. KELLY), 110 INGLEWOOD DR.
Often hailed as the first non-traditional residence built in Toronto, this Spanish/art-deco house was commissioned by owners of a photography studio. Still standing, it features a flat roof; an unusual arrangement of windows (including at least one porthole); and was built using large, hollow tiles upon which a pebbled stucco was applied. B. Kelly remains a bit of a mystery, however, as writers with greater research skills than I have turned up nothing.
THE R.C. HARRIS WATER TREATMENT PLANT (1932-1941, THOMAS CANFIELD POMPHREY), 2701 QUEEN ST. E.
The “Palace of Purification” may seem like an obvious choice, but the choice of bold art-deco styling and the massive scale of this piece of city infrastructure make it hard to ignore. Thomas Canfield Pomphrey, according to a great article by Wayne Reeves for Spacing, was a “second-tier architect” who died in relative obscurity in his native Scotland in 1966.
BANK OF NOVA SCOTIA (1956-57, JOHN C. PARKIN), 885 LAWRENCE AVE. E.
Toronto built a great many glassand-steel buildings in the 1950s, but this one has always stood out for me. Up until the 1940s, banks, traditionally, had been imposing stone buildings with massive columns holding up massive pediments – the building as impenetrable vault. That an architect could propose a mostly transparent building that looked strikingly like the Edith Farnsworth house (Mies van der Rohe, 1945-51) speaks of the public’s acceptance of modernism … at least in the very progressive new town of Don Mills.
THE COLONNADE (1963, GERALD ROBINSON), 131 BLOOR ST. W.
One of the earliest mixed-use developments in Canada, this brutalist building took a leap of faith that Toronto’s urban core was not going to empty out like had been happening in many U.S. cities.
Two levels of retail and offices and residences above, the building even housed a National Design Centre gallery at one time.
ONTARIO PLACE (1971, EBERHARD ZEIDLER), 955 LAKE SHORE BLVD. W.
If the Canadian National Exhibition was what a 19th- and early-20th-century fairground/ showplace should look like, then Ontario Place was the future of that typology: pods in the water, a space-age cinema and an innovative landscape by Michael Hough.
It’s a shame the provincial government has rejected that future.
MARKET SQUARE (1980, JEROME MARKSON), 80 FRONT ST. E.
At a point when Toronto was throwing up towers in all corners of the downtown core, here was a skyscraper on its side, with intimate courtyards and pokey lanes that, with its enormous windows, harked back to 19th-century warehouses of the area. The way it frames St. James Cathedral is sublime.
CANADIAN BROADCASTING CENTRE (1992, PHILIP JOHNSON), 250 FRONT ST. W.
When diehard modernist Philip Johnson went postmodern, it was like Bob Dylan going electric. But once the 1984 AT&T started to rise in Manhattan, the style was codified. For the CBC, Mr. Johnson created a formal, red-gridded box that has dark cylinders and cubes busting through the walls. It should be listed as a Heritage building.
OCAD-U SHARP CENTRE (WILL ALSOP, 2004), 100 MCCAUL ST.
Despite this checkerboard box, Will Alsop was an outside-thebox thinker and, since he passed in 2018, the world will not be gifted with any more of his playful, exuberant buildings. When the “flying tabletop” opened, it showed the world that Toronto was still willing to take chances, just as it did with New City Hall 40 years earlier.
60 RICHMOND HOUSING COOPERATIVE (STEPHEN TEEPLE, 2010), 60 RICHMOND ST. E.
Tucked away on an unassuming part of Richmond Street East, this composition of solids and voids has a 60/40 split of opaque panels to glazing, which is completely at odds with current all-glass thinking. If this building has a vaguely Nordic look to it, that’s because the Norwegians have been designing this way for decades. It’s the right thing to do in our climate.
And yes, I have a list of runnersup as long as my arm. What buildings do you think pushed Toronto forward in each of the past 10 decades? I’d love to hear from you at dave.leblanc@globeandmail.ca.

A rising tide of condo water problems: After several high-rise floods, developers are bringing in new abatement technology

Full text: One of Canada’s largest condominium builders has announced it will add a raft of new technologies and systems to its future high-rise projects to help address an increase in water-damage problems.
“Water damage in condo development is an industry-wide issue,” said Peter Webb, senior vicepresident of development for Concord Pacific Group Inc.
“When there is water damage, it can be rapid and expensive, and it’s causing big impacts on insurance premiums. Our interest is trying to protect against inflated premiums, and in trying to mitigate the potential of these problems.”
There have been several recent high-profile examples of the problems water can cause in high-rises. Faulty gaskets at the 49-storey Vancouver House condominium flooded 17 units in April, 2021.
On Christmas Eve, a frozen pipe burst and drenched 15 floors of a 41-storey apartment building in Calgary, forcing hundreds of residents out of the building for weeks.
Insurers have taken notice.
The cost of liability coverage for Vancouver-area strata corporations has risen as much as 50 per cent in recent years.
The main issue with high-rise buildings is the amount of pressure in the water system, according to Nathan Normoyle, vicepresident for global operations at Access Restoration Services Ltd., which specializes in remediating damage done to high-rise buildings.
“Typical city water pressure will bring cold water up to the seventh floor,” Mr. Normoyle said. “For buildings that are higher, you have to have booster pumps. When you’ve got highly pressurized lines – these are fourinch and six-inch lines – with even the smallest break, you can cause millions of dollars of damage in a few minutes.”
That’s what happened at the Emerald condominium in north Toronto in April of last year, when a viral video captured the aftermath of a catastrophic plumbing failure, leading some wags to call the building Toronto’s Niagara Falls. But despite the deluge only lasting less than half an hour, residents are still feeling the consequences.
“We had over 200 units in this building damaged,” said Howard Keith Juriansz, a condo board director at the building. “They cleared everybody out; from floors 25 and up they had to leave.”
Mr. Juriansz was unable to return to his 40th-storey penthouse apartment for five months. The water filled hallways and gushed down elevator shafts. All four of the building’s elevators were damaged (a common risk when a high-rise floods). Mr. Juriansz recalls how an elevator technician had to ride on top of the one functioning elevator car for hours to keep it working long enough to remove those in the building with mobility issues.
Mr. Juriansz praised the insurance company for quick action, though he noted the building’s new insurance now comes with a steep $250,000 deductible, and the rates are higher, too. The total bill for damage and relocation costs is still unknown, but he said its already into the millions.
When water gets into a highrise, the two major problems are mould and structural damage, according to Mr. Normoyle.
Sound- and fire-proofing in walls creates multiple layers of materials that have to be dried or replaced, and steel wall studs also have open tracks at the bottoms that are perhaps too good at collecting water (which can lead to rust, if unattended).
“What we have noted is the frequency of water damage in new buildings; those built in the last three years,” Mr. Normoyle said, which he blamed on “the quality of the workmanship or materials or installation.”
Insurers have noticed the pattern, too. In 2020, the British Columbia Financial Services Authority, which regulates the industry, surveyed strata properties across the province and concluded that, in terms of the value of claims, newer buildings less than five years old were collecting the highest median payouts in the sector in 2019 ($2,576, and an average of $18,091 a claim).
While the majority of the claims were for water damage – “plumbing leaks and failures” – in every year since 2015 (typically more than 66 per cent of claims) the value of those claims was relatively lower, representing 46 per cent of dollars claimed since 2017.
But the BCFSA also found an outlier year in 2018, when more than 11,000 water claims came in, pushing water damage costs to 56 per cent in the value of claims.
As a result, the BCFSA said, in addition to premium hikes, insurers were raising deductibles, which between 2019 and 2020 rose 124 per cent over all in highrise buildings, and up 96 per cent for water damage. In condos, the water damage deductibles leapt 135 per cent in the same period.
“It’s a fair comment to say premiums would be higher compared to five years ago. … We’re just seeing more claims,” said Rob de Pruis, national director of consumer and industry relations for the Insurance Bureau of Canada. He cautions that not all the rise in premiums has been related to water; replacement costs are also up because of the rising high-rise apartment values and the overall costs of construction and material.
“They just are costlier, even the finishings inside are typically a lot higher scale,” he said.
Still, a 2021 report from the accounting and consulting firm Deloitte found the changes in rates and deductibles were having their desired effect, and projected insurers in B.C. would soon stop paying out almost every dollar they collected in condo insurance. As Deloitte noted, most water-damage claims are not from catastrophic failures: They come from washing-machine overflows, or sink-plumbing failures, or even in-suite heating and cooling units that use water. Raising deductibles pushes smaller, less severe claims off the insurer’s books, and as the Deloitte report noted, the lack of building-wide coverage “may also encourage unit owners to purchase individual insurance coverage to protect against potential losses due to deductible payouts.”
Deloitte’s survey of insurers projected these cuts to coverage and rise in prices could lower the premium-to-claim ratios significantly, perhaps from 100 per cent to 80 per cent.
While Mr. Webb said Concord Pacific has had no catastrophic leaks at its recent projects, it will nevertheless take the six projects it has under construction or soon to begin and add in a series of mitigation measures. The list of changes includes high-tech ideas such as water sensors in the elevator shafts and on the main pipes, as well as automated shutoffs that will rapidly notify building managers and give them the option to shut down in the event of a sudden surge in water.
Others are more physical, such as adding grading to the elevator lobby to direct water away from elevator shafts and recessing into the ceiling the fire-system sprinkler heads so they are less likely to take accidental damage and be set off through negligence.
“We have seen people that hang laundry on these things [sprinkler heads],” Mr. Webb said. “It’s incredible what people will do. … A sprinkler can release 60 gallons of water a minute.”
Mr. de Pruis cautioned that while every high-rise has a different set of local conditions that go into determining the insurance rates, he thinks Concord’s moves could be positive.
“Any type of mitigation will have a positive effect over the long term, in reducing or mitigating claims costs,” he said.
Concord’s upfront costs for the water mitigation are pegged at about $1-million a building (which will not be passed on to preconstruction buyers who have already purchased units), but the savings down the road for condo owners could be well in excess of that.
“By putting these things in, it will probably change the industry standard,” Mr. Webb said. “I have heard from some other developers already, asking how much did I just increase the cost of their buildings.”

Full text: 51 Percy St.
COLBORNE, ONT.
Asking Price: $1.2-million Taxes: $2,776.00 (2021) Lot Size: 1.77 acres Agent: Jacqueline Pennington, Re/Max Hallmark First Group Realty Ltd.
THE BACKSTORY The red-brick Victorian farmhouse on Percy Street is a local landmark in the small town of Colborne, Ont., says Shannon Hamilton, who has grown up in the house her parents purchased 21 years ago.
“It’s a true historical home, but it’s one that people know about locally,” Ms. Hamilton says of the property, which has a rustic barn and period coach house.
The township heritage association, Heritage Cramahe, describes the house as one of the finest examples of the Gothic revival cottage in the area. The group points to the steep gable on the front façade and the tall and graceful Regency-style windows in a three bay layout.
Colborne is located on the shore of Lake Ontario in Northumberland County. For many thousands of years, Indigenous peoples were stewards of the land. Northumberland County is located on the Mississauga Anishinaabek territory and is the traditional territory of the Mississauga.
Many of the first European settlers in the area were United Empire Loyalists who received land grants from the British Crown.
During the early 1800s, the vacant land known today as 51 Percy St. passed through several owners. Local records do not pinpoint the year the house was built, but Heritage Cramahe says it likely dates to the period between 1862 and 1871.
The wide front porch with Doric columns may have been built at the time or might have been a later addition, Heritage Cramahe says.
The house is also included in the Illustrated Historical Atlas of Counties Northumberland and Durham, Ont.
Ms. Hamilton was in elementary school when she moved to Colborne from Unionville with her parents, Kathryan O’Malley Hamilton and John Hamilton.
“For our house, it was love at first sight,” Ms. Hamilton says. “I don’t think we even looked at other houses.”
Mr. Hamilton says the couple decided to move closer to the extended family following his wife’s retirement from teaching. The couple had never owned a heritage home before, but Ms. O’Malley Hamilton knew she wanted to live there as soon as they walked in the door.
“Once she saw the staircase, she said, ‘Let’s buy the house,’ ” he recalls. ”It was a signed deal then.”
THE HOUSE TODAY The Hamiltons have preserved the character of the house, starting from the covered porch and heavy wood front door.
Inside, previous owners refurbished the delicate spindles and handrail of the Victorian staircase, which had been painted black, Ms. Hamilton says.
The principal rooms have high ceilings, tall baseboards and wood trim around the windows.
“The craftsmanship is really outstanding,” says Ms. Hamilton, who moved back to Colborne after studying visual arts at York University.
Only a handful of windows in the house are new, she adds, with the others containing glass with waves and bubbles typical of a century home.
A formal living and dining room each have French doors. Ms. Hamilton says a large window In the living room is a sunny place to sit for morning coffee on a winter’s day. In milder weather, family members carry their coffee through the French doors to the porch.
Previous owners added a family room at the rear of the house, with a large primary bedroom above.
The kitchen has wood cabinets, built-in wall ovens and skylights above.
Ms. Hamilton says the layout provides a nice flow for entertaining.
“We had a lot of family gatherings here.
On New Year’s Day, we had just moved in and we had about 70 people here for dinner,” she says.
Doors open to porches on either side of the family room so that the residents can choose the most comfortable place to relax, depending on the time of day.
Upstairs, the large primary bedroom has a fireplace and skylights above. Two additional bedrooms on that floor have sloped ceilings and wood-trimmed windows.
There’s also a cozy reading nook on the landing at the top of the stairs.
The main bathroom has a claw foot tub, sloping ceilings and rose-patterned wallpaper.
The family turned a large, walk-in closet into a second, more modern bathroom with a walk-in shower.
Throughout the house, large windows and skylights bring in added light and air.
“The light and the energy is very lovely,” Ms. Hamilton says.
Although the house is historical, the property is not designated under heritage regulations. For the Hamilton family, it was important to conserve the property and its original details in order to keep the integrity of the home.
Outside, a horseshoe driveway that wraps around the house is a reminder of the days when the residents would drive a horse and buggy into town. The Hamiltons enjoyed spending time in the garden and puttering around the house, but now they are looking to downsize.
“My mom was especially a very gifted gardener,” Ms. Hamilton says.
Mr. Hamilton is head waiter at Barberian’s Steak House in downtown Toronto.
Approaching retirement now, he has been with the well-known restaurant for nearly 40 years.
Before the pandemic brought on-andoff closings to the industry, he made the drive to Yonge and Elm streets most days of the week. Because he works nights, he can avoid driving in rush hour, he adds.
On his days off, the house in Colborne is a tranquil place to rejuvenate.
“I don’t mind getting on the lawn mower for a couple of hours and shutting the world out.”
In addition to the expansive lawn, there’s a stream and mature woodland. For Ms. Hamilton, the stream and woods were great places for exploring, with family pets along for the adventure.
“When we moved here, we got my first dog.”
Ms. Hamilton, who grew up playing hockey in town, says the community has grown in recent years but it remains closeknit.
“It’s definitely a different pace of life,” she says.
THE BEST FEATURE The weathered barn, with a single, uncut 48-foot beam to support the rafters, still has visible antique nails, Mr. Hamilton says.
There’s also a coach house, which is now used as a garage and workshop.
Ms. Hamilton says the family often wonders about the farm’s earlier inhabitants and how they built such a sturdy barn, for example.
“Outbuilding like ours are meant to last,” Ms. Hamilton says. “It’s fun to imagine how things came to be.”

Full text: 23 Glenbrook Dr., Markham, Ont.
BERCZY VILLAGE Asking price: $1,888,888 (November, 2021) Selling price: $2,428,000 (November, 2021) Previous selling prices: $1,275,000 (July, 2015); $628,000 (2008) Taxes: $7,677 (2021) Days on the market: one Listing agents: Jennifer Chan and John Genereaux, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada THE ACTION This four-bedroom house is just more than 10 years old but had been recently refreshed with such things as new kitchen cabinetry. Those updates, given the increasingly long waits and difficulty in finding renovation materials and tradespeople in the Greater Toronto Area, was a major reason the sellers received six offers,” agent Jennifer Chan said.
“We were expecting moderate activity, but we didn’t expect this level of activity. It was a frenzy.
What made it stand out was the care and love [the sellers] put into the renovation.”
WHAT THEY GOT This two-storey house has about 3,200 square feet of living space inside, with a formal dining room, study and family rooms.
The lower level has a studio, guest bedroom and one of five bathrooms, plus two recreation areas separated by a wet bar.
The 55-foot-by-90-foot lot also accommodates an attached double garage and sits across from Berczy Park South.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It has an office on the main floor, so that seems to be quite popular lately,” Ms. Chan said. “There is a recording studio in the basement and a balcony off the primary bedroom overlooking the park.”
Buyers were also drawn to local amenities. “Some buyers were attracted to the schools,” Ms. Chan said. “There is a very good French immersion school in the neighbourhood.”

Full text: In his pulpy London gangster film, RocknRolla, Guy Ritchie saved the villain’s role for oligarch Roman Abramovich.
The antagonist wasn’t called Abramovich. He was called Uri Omovich. But it was transparently Mr. Abramovich – a silken Russian aesthete in the midst of infiltrating upper-class British society, a component of which is running a soccer club.
The secret to a good movie villain is aspiration. It should be someone whose persona and lifestyle cause envy in the viewer.
At the moment of RocknRolla’s 2008 release, nothing epitomized this hook better than the oligarch. And there was no more famous oligarch than Mr. Abramovich.
It isn’t hard to see the appeal.
You pull a quick one in some dreary, far-flung place and then move your dirty money to a much nicer place. Once there, you spend lavishly to purchase an entrée, all while sitting a bit above the fray. It’s Gatsby with different set dressing.
That’s an old story. Mr. Abramovich’s addition was his common touch. In order to ingratiate himself with the local proletariat as well as the aristocrats, he bought a ball club.
A former solider and low-level hustler, Mr. Abramovich made his money in oil and gas during the post-Soviet gold rush. How does one go from running a doll business out of a Moscow apartment to co-owning one of the biggest petroleum concerns in the world? Don’t ask. That’s how.
Mr. Abramovich was still in his 30s when he popped up in London’s moneyed circles like a Great White in a swimming pool.
His first move was buying Chelsea Football Club – a storied, if perpetually middling, team. Mr. Abramovich injected hundreds of millions into the operation, turning Chelsea into a global powerhouse nearly overnight.
Because there wasn’t much hope of recouping his money, this struck the average fan as an act of outrageous charity. This nice, foreign gentleman was refurbishing some rundown cultural real estate.
It was considered bad form to look at it another way – that Mr. Abramovich was buying complicity as well as trophies. As long as he kept the sports tabs busy, no one wanted to look too deeply into where his money came from or who’d been run over in the getting of it.
People knew on some basic level that Mr. Abramovich was probably a bad guy in business with some much worse guys. It was no secret that he was a great favourite of Russian President Vladimir Putin. But that just added to the SPECTRE feel of the whole set-up.
So for 20 years, Mr. Abramovich didn’t have to bother deceiving anyone. They deceived themselves.
Then Ukraine happened.
Mr. Abramovich’s first move was putting out a limp statement expressing regret. That went poorly.
His next move was attempting to foist Chelsea on his own charitable foundation. The trustees of the foundation wanted nothing to do with it.
His third move was announcing he would sell the club and give “all net proceeds” to “all victims of the war.” That prompted a general parsing of the exact meaning of “net proceeds” and “all victims.”
The fourth move was made on Thursday by the British government. It has frozen Mr. Abramovich’s assets, including the soccer club.
As a result, Chelsea can no longer buy and sell players. It can’t renew contracts. All incoming money can only be spent on the bare minimum of “footballrelated activity.” In order to sell the club, Mr. Abramovich will need government approval.
While our collective thinking about the way the world works has evolved in the past three weeks, it’s only come so far. At the moment, the big soccer story in Britain is “What happens to Chelsea now?” You’d think that before jumping into that discussion, the people who helped launder Mr. Abramovich’s image might instead ask themselves, “How did this happen in the first place?” Greed is what happened, and the willful ignorance that so often goes with it. Mr. Abramovich located a weakness in the European psyche – the love of frivolous games – and exploited it.
Had he said he was pushing millions into public health care, people would have clapped for a couple of days and then forgotten all about it. But sports – that’s important.
Mr. Abramovich identified a way to obtain the same clout you’d get doling out a hundred political backhanders, but with added sex appeal.
To judge the success of the Abramovich approach, look at what’s happened since. The soccer market has been flooded with Saudi, Qatari, Russian and Chinese money.
If this new generation of super-rich sports owners aren’t doing this to turn a profit (and most aren’t), what exactly are they buying?
Nobody wanted to investigate that too closely until the tanks started rolling.
Now Mr. Abramovich’s most brilliant stroke – putting the soccer club out in front of all the other businesses – is his biggest problem. In styling himself as the great benefactor, he also made himself a target.
The team is now a financial hostage of the British government. What does that mean?
The club will be sold to other rich people who will carry on as before. Mr. Abramovich, a citizen of Israel and Portugal as well as Russia, will come out of this diminished, but still fantastically wealthy. People will continue rallying around anyone offering a free lunch. So, nothing. It doesn’t mean anything.
But in the short term, three goals have been achieved.
Punishing Mr. Abramovich makes Britain look tough on Russia without having to go to the trouble of doing anything to Russia.
Unable to take out the villain who is its real target, Britain whacks a lesser villain instead (but hey, good enough for Guy Ritchie).
And it warns anyone else looking to pull the same trick – you can buy it, but whether you keep it is up to us.
So in this complicated story of dark money and shady characters, who is it that turns out to be the actual capo dei capi? Her Majesty’s Government.
It isn’t much of an accomplishment in real-world terms. What it is instead is highly effective brand management.
Which fits, because that’s what this has been about all along.

Full text: Professor of finance who holds the Ben Graham Chair in Value Investing at the Ivey Business School, University of Western Ontario Buying the dips as a strategy has worked well over the past 10 years – primarily with the help of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Such an approach to investing has worked because none of the secular forces behind inflation, real interest rates and globalization had changed. But I am afraid that buying the dips may no longer be as safe a strategy as it was.
Many structural changes are taking place regarding not only inflation and real rates, but also globalization and geopolitics. We are at an inflection point of world history with serious consequences for world stock markets and the global economy.
WHY IS THE SECULAR TREND OF REAL INTEREST RATES ON THE WAY UP?
1. Demographic developments.
Baby boomers have been retiring and have stopped saving; in fact, they are in their decumulation years, which reduces the supply of funds available for lending or investments.
2. This happens in the face of increased demand for capital by companies that need to embed innovation and new technologies into their production processes, as well as by governments that need to borrow to fund structural deficits.
3. To clear the demand-supply imbalance, the real interest rate trend is pushed up as suppliers of capital demand more attractive rates, not unlike what happened in the late 1970s.
WHY IS SECULAR INFLATION ON THE WAY UP?
1. We may be reaching a peak in productivity growth as experienced baby boomers retire and are replaced by less experienced workers who will nevertheless be in high demand owing to low population growth. These workers will demand higher wages.
This means higher inflation down the road.
2. Pandemic-related deficits and ballooning debts will require higher taxes. Not unlike the two world wars of the past century, the pandemic has been expensive and will require heightened taxes to deal with deficits and accumulated debts.
3. A pause in globalization may lead to higher inflation as companies, trying to guard against supply chain interruptions, will be bringing production back to North America to an environment of higher production costs.
4. Whereas, historically, central banks have acted in a countercyclical fashion, in the past 10 to 15 years they have been increasing money supply on a more permanent fashion and this will also add to long-term inflationary pressures. It is worth remembering that the rampant inflation of the 1970s was caused by monetary policies that financed massive budget deficits and were supported by political leaders.
5. During the credit crisis of 2007-08, aggressive quantitative easing did not produce higher inflation, as QE was happening while banks and individuals were deleveraging and these two were offsetting each other. But in recent years, there has been an overaggressive QE program without any offsetting effect, and this will also lead to higher inflation.
6. Years of underinvestment in the oil and gas industry, heavy regulation and the environmental, social and governance (ESG) craze have shifted not only the oil price dynamics, but also the price dynamics of all commodities.
7. Unprecedented supply chain disruptions in the face of massive monetary and fiscal stimulus, and ballooning demand along with decreased global trade are increasing prices. The labour market is incredibly tight. Wages are rising. A wage-price spiral, if it persists, will lead a further surge of inflation.
WHY HAS THE SECULAR TREND TOWARD GLOBALIZATION COME TO AN END?
There is no doubt that the world will look different in the aftermath of the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
1. Companies’ gradual transition toward more local production has been in place since 2008, with exports falling as a share of GDP.
The trend accelerated during the pandemic because of significant supply chain problems. Companies now place higher importance on having goods for manufacturing and distribution close by.
2. The invasion of Ukraine will change the world as we have known it. It will intensify deglobalization. Moreover, geopolitical tensions tend to spread – Taiwan versus China, Turkey versus Greece, South Korea versus North Korea, and so on.
Over the past 40 years, the world has experienced a bull market in stocks, bonds and real estate owing to low inflation, low real interest rates and, with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, the advent of globalization. Rising inflation, increasing real interest rates and deglobalization – with the possible erection of a Berlin-like wall in Ukraine and the start of a new Cold War – augurs a bleak outlook for the stock, bond and real estate markets. The markets have yet to discount this outlook.
The U.S. Fed may not be able to help this time as it is caught in a Catch-22. The ballooning debt issuance around the world, including margin debt, in recent years has made economies and financial markets very sensitive to interest-rate increases. The Fed could abandon the inflation mandate to support the financial system, but given the amount of debt outstanding amid all the structural changes referred to above, this may lead to financial markets – and economic growth – declining too quickly to be rescued. What happened to the Greek economy in the 2010s comes to mind. As a result, beware of buying the dips.

Government action can spur more building to address housing shortage

Full text: Scott Brison is vice-chair of BMO Capital Markets.
Michael Brooks is chief executive officer of REALPAC, a national association of commercial real estate industry leaders.
When it comes to Canada’s housing affordability crisis, provinces face many of the same problems and are increasingly arriving at the same solution.
Ontario’s Affordable Housing Task Force released a report in February that echoed the key conclusion also reached by British Columbia and Nova Scotia in similar reports: Dramatically increasing the housing supply is imperative to Canada’s growth and prosperity. The main obstacle to overcome is scarcity. Bank economists, builders and developers, real estate agents and social agencies have all raised the alarm about the low inventory of new homes at all price points and a lack of affordable rentals.
Governments now realize that stimulating demand through low interest rates or buyer tax breaks can work at cross purposes with affordability. Tax dollars toward more public and social housing can help, but the combined fiscal capacity of all levels of government won’t come close to meeting the current annual supply gap, let alone keep up with growing demand of the future. Direct government investment must target those who cannot afford market-based housing and market rentals.
Given these constraints, what is the best way to boost the quantity and pace of private home and apartment construction?
Part of the answer lies with how new construction is approved in Canada, and the role of municipal policy. All three provincial reports agreed that municipal zoning policies need to embrace densification, while sclerotic permitting processes need to be modernized, streamlined and sped up. Meanwhile, hidden high development taxes and land costs are pushing prices up.
The challenge is finding political will in the municipal sphere, where officials are vulnerable to narrow local interests and NIMBYism that can become powerful adversaries to public good. Ottawa and the provinces and territories might hope that, left to their own devices, municipal governments will take these reports seriously, and urgently act to make approval processes faster, more transparent and accountable, without compromising rigorous inspection and standards.
But hope is not a strategy. Federal, provincial and territorial governments have a responsibility to encourage, reward and support municipal governments as they implement pro-growth housing policies.
The federal government needs to leverage its policy reach and harness its fiscal levers to catalyze provincial policy consensus into specific actions at all levels of government.
The next federal budget is a watershed opportunity to tackle Canada’s housing shortage and position housing construction as a national strategic growth sector.
To that end, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. can help research global best practices for municipal housing permitting and densification policy, and bring the right private-sector partners to the table to deliver results.
The budget can provide municipal governments with a menu of pro-growth policies such as transferable development rights for homeowners and shot-clock approval deadlines. A new Housing Accelerator Fund, promised in the Speech from the Throne, can help turn words into actions by rewarding municipal governments that embrace densification. Federal transfers for housing can be conditioned to further increase the upside for municipalities approving new development.
Ottawa can also research and share digital solutions for issuing permits, ideally developing an app-based platform to manage, track and accelerate permitting processes from all levels of government – not just municipal.
Much progress has been made by policy makers in better understanding and agreeing on the problems: Canada’s housing shortage represents a direct threat and bottleneck to sustainable growth and prosperity. The next federal budget needs to prioritize housing construction as a national strategic growth sector with an action plan to unify all levels of government and business and meet the needs of all Canadians.

China eyes GDP growth near 5.5 per cent: Chinese Premier acknowledges country faces increasingly ‘volatile, grave and uncertain’ headwinds from COVID-19, Ukraine

Full text: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang set a moderate growth target of “around 5.5 per cent” for this year at the opening of the National People’s Congress in Beijing on Saturday, as the world’s secondlargest economy continues to face challenges caused by the pandemic, housing and local government debt crises, and growing repercussions from the war in Ukraine.
China’s GDP grew 8.1 per cent in 2021, above an official target of more than 6 per cent and in line with the more optimistic projections, but a slowdown toward the end of the year led to the fourth quarter seeing the slowest growth since early 2020.
In January, the International Monetary Fund predicted China’s economy would grow 4.8 per cent this year. In a report, it said “China’s recovery is well advanced, but it lacks balance and momentum has slowed.”
“The slowdown is attributed to the rapid withdrawal of policy support, the lagging recovery of consumption amid recurrent COVID-19 outbreaks despite a successful vaccination campaign, and slowing real estate investment following policy efforts to reduce leverage in the property sector,” IMF economists said.
Mr. Li acknowledged the country is facing an increasingly “volatile, grave and uncertain” external environment. But China has had “the experience of facing major risks and challenges in the past,” he told lawmakers Saturday, and the fundamental direction of a thriving Chinese economy “will not change.”
“This year, our country will encounter many more risks and challenges, and we must keep pushing to overcome them,” Mr. Li said, adding the country will prioritize stabilizing growth to cope with new downward pressure.
He said focus will be on social and economic stability to pave the way for the Communist Party’s national congress later this year. Analysts previously predicted a shift away from the more interventionist policies of last year, as China’s leaders turn their attention to the key meeting in November, at which President Xi Jinping is expected to begin an unprecedented third term.
One of the strongest headwinds facing China’s economy last year came from the housing sector, which has long been described as a bubble. With developer Evergrande teetering on the edge of default and collapse, there were fears the contagion could spread through the industry, causing a Chinese “Lehman moment,” similar to the failure of the U.S. financial firm Lehman Brothers that sparked the 2008 economic crash.
While regulators have been able to get things under control, Mr. Li indicated the more aggressive policies against over-leveraging, which had contributed to Evergrande’s sudden decline, would not be going away, emphasizing the country will maintain that “housing is for living, not speculation.”
The country will create at least 11 million new urban jobs in 2022, Mr. Li said, with the aim for an unemployment rate in urban areas under 5.5 per cent. The urban jobless rate at the end of 2021 was 5.1 per cent, but there is a growing divide between rural and urban China, with poverty and unemployment remaining problems across large swaths of the countryside.
There were no indications of a major shift away from China’s “COVID zero” policy, which has seen the country largely cut off from the rest of the world and severely dampened domestic consumption just as Beijing is trying to shift away from a reliance on exports.
“If China maintains its zeroCOVID policy, services could face extreme pressure on both the supply and demand side in Q1, with businesses closed down and customers confined at home even due to a single case in their areas,” Derek Scissors, the chief economist at China Beige Book, said in January. “Omicron’s impact on services is the single biggest threat to the bullish economic case for next year.”
While some Chinese officials have spoken of a need to evolve the country’s approach, especially after the disastrous outbreak in Hong Kong showed the risks to a “COVID zero” system when the virus breaks through, Mr. Li said the country will stick to preventing inbound infections and domestic resurgence while continuing to improve its virus measures.
The country will cope with local COVID-19 outbreaks in a targeted and science-based manner to maintain the normal order of production and life, according to a government work report released ahead of Mr. Li’s speech.
China will also step up research into the prevention of coronavirus variants and accelerate researching and developing vaccines and effective medicines against COVID-19, the report said.
Mr. Li did not focus on the war in Ukraine in his speech. China has faced blowback from the West for appearing to support Moscow’s invasion, and there are already signs that the country’s economy is experiencing side effects of the disruption to logistics in Eastern Europe and the sanctions hitting Russia.
Writing this week, Andreea Brinza, vice-president of the Romanian Institute for the Study of the Asia-Pacific, said the “image of Chinese trains crossing Eurasia and bringing Chinese goods to European consumers has been intensely promoted by Beijing,” and had become an important part of Mr. Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative.
“But almost half of those routes pass through Russia-and could be massively impacted by European sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” she said.
Mr. Li touched on the issue of Taiwan in his speech. Some have seen parallels between the selfruled island’s fate and that of Ukraine, with China similarly threatening invasion should Taipei pursue full independence from the mainland. Chinese officials reject such a comparison as it would acknowledge Taiwan is a country akin to Ukraine, rather than part of China as they insist.
“We will advance the peaceful growth of relations across the Taiwan Strait and the reunification of China,” Mr. Li said. “We firmly oppose any separatist activities seeking ‘Taiwan independence’ and firmly oppose foreign interference.”
Separately, a budget report released Saturday said China’s defence spending for this year will rise 7.1 per cent compared with 2021, on top of a 6.8-per-cent increase last year. Analysts have warned the military balance across the straits is rapidly shifting in Beijing’s favour, raising the possibility of a Chinese invasion in future.

Good looks from every angle: Aaniin Community Centre in Markham is designed to alternately soothe and stimulate the senses

Full text: You’ve got to be big if you want to stand atop Toronto. And, increasingly, places such as Vaughan, Richmond Hill and Markham north of the city have been pumping the architectural iron.
Vaughan City Hall by KPMB is a masterful composition of low-rise buildings that form one bold and balanced composition; Richmond Hill’s Oak Ridges Library by Perkins & Will mixes timber and sunlight to stunning effect; and Markham’s Wong Dai Sin Temple by Shim-Sutcliffe somehow defies gravity yet looks as if it came directly out of a foundry. Heavy stuff.
All award winners, but there’s another big-shouldered Markham building that just took to the podium: late last year, Aaniin Community Centre received the Buildings of Significance Award at the Markham Urban Design Excellence Awards.
It will no doubt receive more. Also by Perkins & Will, Aaniin – which translates to “hello/I see your light” in Ojibwe – is massive, at 11,334 square metres but somehow finds a way to stay intimate and sheltering.
“What we’re striving to do is to create nooks and eddies off of the main stream where people can feel comfortable to watch their children in swimming … or to gather before going in for afterschool basketball,” says architect Phil Fenech, the project leader. “So it’s the gathering spaces alongside the program spaces that give you that sense of intimacy.”
But perhaps we should jog around the outside, first? It’ll take a while, since Aaniin sits on its own little “island” at 14th Avenue and Middlefield Road and adjoins to a new park, Aaniin Park. This, Mr. Fenech says, meant the building wasn’t allowed to have an ugly backside full of receiving doors, recycle bins and other assorted (yet necessary) eyesores.
“It looks good from all angles,” he says.
“And it changes … the way the roof shapes, the ends, the east and the south and the west are different.”
They are different indeed, and as one jogs (okay, I drove) one is struck by how the roof undulates from seemingly too thick to too thin, from low to high, and from art object to practical shelter from the rain. This, of course, is a little trompe l’oeil, as the building’s transparency in some places means the passerby can peek inside to see the massive zigging-and-zagging timber beams continue to perform their feats of strength, while from other vantage points it looks as if only thin, red-painted metal posts hold everything up (they are not thin, but compared with the scale of the building, they look that way).
But let’s choose one of the many entrances and have a look inside.
The west side seems nice, plus it’s closest to the library. Enter here and the hustle and bustle of library patrons immediately puts one at ease. Walk inside, and the first thing an architecture aficionado will notice is how the big stair to the second floor has a mirror image on the other side of the massive glass wall.
“So it is programmed on the outside for different things or kids can just hang,” says Markham’s director of recreation services Mary Creighton. “So it’s been a really good space for the library.”
Of course, because libraries need quiet spaces, there are nooks and cubbies and lowered ceilings, too.
Leave the library, and one might feel sheltered under a bridge or a balcony; it’s a subtle nod to Frank Lloyd Wright’s idea of compression and expansion by design lead Duff Balmer. Not easy to do in a space this size.
Walk a little more and one stumbles upon a modern amphitheatre, where a very culturally diverse audience watch football matches on a big, retractable screen. Or behind that, the amazing Ojibwe artwork that represents the Seven Grandfather Teachings, a collaboration between two local high schools and artist Tessa Shank.
Across the hall there is a health club one can join.
Most impressive of all, perhaps, is the massive gymnasium – currently playong host to a COVID-19 vaccination clinic – which can support three basketball courts and a 150-metre running track above. Its neighbour is the even more massive pool area.
Here, the two pools benefit from multiple window blinds on the larger windows and much smaller slit windows above to mitigate glare, which Ms. Creighton says can be a real problem. The pools – a shallow teaching pool and a six-lane pool with a deep end of 3.5 metres – are made by Myrtha Pools, which uses a modular system of stainless steel and PVC. Ms. Creighton says Olympians prefer Myrthas since no tile means water is still and still means no drag.
But not everything is supersized at Aaniin. There are small spaces with 3-D-printing machines, lounges, creation studios, meeting rooms entrepreneurs can rent, a teaching kitchen, and perhaps most intriguing of all, a sensory room designed for autistic children. Filled with jellyfish-like fibre optics, touch screens, beanbag chairs and bubbling columns of light, it’s been extremely popular, Ms. Creighton says.
“It’s very soothing and relaxing for them,” she says.
Architecturally, Aaniin Community Centre is both soothing and relaxing in some areas and completely stimulating and forceful in others. The omnipresent warmth of wood, however, both overhead and as colour-coded siding, keeps that tension under control. The juxtaposition of smooth glass and masonry block – some of it speckled like terrazzo – keeps the eye interested and the hand reaching out to touch. The soaring, light-filled spaces might outnumber the nooks and crannies, but there are enough of those that individuals who want to curl up with a book can find their happy places as well.
It’s a big ask for one building to do all of those things, but it works here and it shows.
“I think people do feel proud of their community buildings, and it’s important that they identify with them,” Mr. Fenech says. “And as for the popular vote, I think this one would qualify.”

Full text: The Bank of Canada’s decision to raise interest rates on Wednesday is not expected to cool the country’s frenzied real estate market, with homebuyers still able to get cheap mortgages to compete for properties.
Economists said it will take multiple interest rate increases – not just Wednesday’s 25-basispoint increase to 0.5 per cent – before borrowing costs rise meaningfully. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)
“I don’t think 25 basis points alone would have much of an impact on the housing market. It will take a series of rate increases to achieve that,” said Jean-François Perrault, chief economist with Bank of Nova Scotia.
Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter said it is unlikely that Wednesday’s rate hike will have any significant impact on a housing market with as much momentum as Canada’s. “I suspect rate hikes would really begin to bite when we get to 100 basis points,” he said.
The rate was raised as home prices continue to hit record highs month after month. In the Toronto region, the country’s largest real estate market, the typical home price jumped $354,000, or 36 per cent, to $1,340,000 in the 12 months to February, according to the local real estate board. In the Vancouver region, the typical home price was up 21 per cent year-over-year to $1,313,400, according to the local board.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, home prices have climbed at a record pace, with homebuyers looking for roomy properties in the suburbs and smaller cities where home prices are somewhat cheaper.
Over the past two years, the typical price of a home in Canada is up 48 per cent to $836,300, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association’s home price index, with less populated areas, such as Cambridge, Ont., Halifax and Chilliwack, B.C., unaccustomed to dealing with unrelenting competition.
“It’s very desperate here,” said Kelli Tynes-Harrington, realtor with Royal LePage Atlantic who has sold homes in the Halifax area for nearly two decades.
Ms. Tynes-Harrington does not think an incremental increase in interest rates will deter buyers.
She said for most of the pandemic, there have been multiple bids on every property. That kind of competition was unheard of prior to the start of the pandemic.
“There’s so many buyers out there that are frustrated with just the lack of inventory,” she said.
“Many are just struggling to even find something.” In announcing its decision to raise the overnight lending rate, the Bank of Canada pointed to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a major new source of uncertainty, in addition to continuing problems caused by the pandemic.
However, with the Canadian economy continuing to grow and inflation soaring well above the central bank’s target of 2 per cent, the bank’s governing council said it expects interest rates will need to rise further.
The central bank did not indicate when it would raise rates again. It mentioned housing only once in its Wednesday press release, saying “activity is more elevated, adding further pressure to house prices.”
Scotiabank’s chief economist Mr. Perrault said “it isn’t inconceivable that a first rate hike might actually add to pressures in the market as homebuyers rush into buying ahead of even higher interest rates down the line.”
Frances Hinojosa, mortgage broker and president of Tribe Financial Group, agreed, saying Wednesday’s rate hike will likely have a “psychological impact” and “cause buyers to rush into the market.”
The rapid rise in home prices has motivated would-be buyers to quickly make offers for fear of getting priced out of the market.
Now, prospective buyers are racing to make their purchase before mortgages get more expensive.
That was the case for Sarah Grant and her husband. For most of last year, they were looking to buy a bigger property in Toronto for their family of four.
Ms. Grant said they felt pressure to buy before interest rates increased and ended up forgoing Toronto and buying a house in Kelowna, B.C., without viewing the property in person. “It was definitely one factor that was on our mind when we acted quickly,” she said.
Although fixed mortgage rates are higher than they were last year, they are still near historic lows. Wednesday’s change will not affect homeowners who are already locked into a fixed-rate mortgage. If a borrower has a variable-rate mortgage, which is typically pegged to the Bank of Canada’s overnight rate, a higher share of their payments will go toward paying interest instead of the principal.
Within hours of the announcement, most of the country’s largest banks raised their prime lending rate by 25 basis points to 2.7 per cent, effective Thursday.
The higher prime rate will bump up borrowing costs on variablerate mortgages, home equity lines of credit and other lines of credit.
The last time the Bank of Canada embarked on a series of rate increases was after the 2016 real estate boom in Toronto and Vancouver. Over the subsequent two years, the central bank raised the overnight rate five times to 1.75 per cent from 0.75 per cent. The higher borrowing costs, combined with tougher mortgage qualification rules and foreign buyer taxes, helped to calm the market frenzy in Toronto and Vancouver.

Commercial real estate sees record-breaking land rush: Sales for investment and income properties across Canada are ‘on fire,’ insider says

Full text: In Waterloo Region, in 2008, it cost $80,000 an acre to buy a vacant 28.5-acre site zoned for future industrial development.
Demand for commercial land then soared, and a decade later, similar properties were selling for between $400,000 and $500,000 an acre.
But what seems like a remarkable appreciation pales in comparison with what’s happened to commercial land prices in the past year, real estate specialists say.
The Cambridge site on Maple Grove Road, for example, was just acquired by Dream Industrial REIT for $912,000 an acre. The plot received multiple bids as soon as it hit the market, even though the plot is irregularly shaped and wraps around other non-owned properties, making development a bigger challenge than a rectangular site.
“Industrial, commercial and investment (ICI) land sales are on fire across Southwestern Ontario.
We actually can’t find enough of it for those who want to buy it,” says Joe Benninger, vice-president with commercial real estate services firm CBRE’s Southern Ontario investment team. “The volume of land deals has been huge, and the momentum is expanding to cities that didn’t see much interest in the past.”
The rush is widespread, involving tens of thousands of acres of land in regions outside the Greater Toronto Area, including the Golden Horseshoe and all the way to Windsor, he adds.
“Two years ago, we were talking between $300,000 to $450,000 per acre across Southwestern Ontario. Now, it’s $800,000 to $1.5-million per acre.
“Take Hamilton: It used to be hard to sell ICI land there. Now, there’s almost nothing left to buy, and prices are higher than ever,” Mr. Benninger adds.
The 3,679 acres worth $498million sold in Hamilton last year was an increase of 51 per cent from 2020, which was also a strong year for commercial land sales.
And the phenomenon is Canada-wide. Demand for distribution, warehousing and manufacturing sites is stripping supply and setting records, according to commercial real estate services firm JLL’s 2022 Canadian Real Estate Outlook.
Commercial space under construction across the country increased by 7.7 per cent quarterover-quarter at the end of 2021, to 39.6 million square feet, well above the average in 2015-19.
Both Montreal and Vancouver witnessed significant ground breakings on the quarter with minimal completions, and were the primary drivers of the increase. The report concludes that “2022 is expected to see even greater deliveries as developers continue to race to satisfy demand.”
Across the country, vacancy rates are at historic lows and occupancy cost registered record highs. All local markets saw rental rates increase, with Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto and Vancouver all registering double-digit annual increases. Vacancy rates also declined in all markets, except Montreal, with Toronto and Vancouver sitting below 1-per-cent vacancy.
Even Manitoba has experienced an unprecedented land rush.
“The Winnipeg market had been steady for the last 20 years, but what we have seen in the last 18 months has been insatiable demand for land and commercial space,” says Paul Kornelsen, vicepresident of CBRE in Winnipeg.
“Transactions are increasing; the number is triple what it was in 2019 and that doesn’t include owner occupiers who have small sites and build their own facilities,” he says. “We’re tracking the big institutional developers who are building on spec and finding tenants eager to lease.”
Prices per square foot in Winnipeg have gone from an average of $7 a square foot to $9 “and we’re projecting average lease rental rates to be at $10 in 2022,” Mr. Kornelsen says. New leases in new buildings are garnering up to $14.
Last year, there was a recordsetting 1.2 million square feet of industrial property absorption in the city. Amazon opened two warehouses with a combined area of more than 200,000 square feet. These are much smaller than those in the Greater Toronto Area or Vancouver, but Calgary-based Hopewell Development Corp.
alone is slated to build 300,000 square feet of new inventory in Manitoba this year. That number by itself would be a record for onspec new development in a single year, he adds.
“We’re also seeing new entrants into the market – institutional developers who are in the city for the first time because it’s hard to buy land in Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver. They’re looking at Manitoba as an affordable alternative,” Mr. Kornelsen explains. “We’re also looking at a tenant whose lease has expired in Kelowna, and they cannot get space and [are] looking at Edmonton and Winnipeg as an alternative.”
It’s simply a matter of supply and demand, says Marshall Toner, executive vice-president and national lead industrial for JLL Canada. “You can’t just flip a switch. Land takes time to be zoned and serviced to be ready to develop.”
Markets that traditionally never had a high demand are now on the radar because there’s no other place for developers to go.
Companies in Vancouver are looking in Alberta because there is not only land available, but it’s at a significantly lower price and that can be sufficient to make them decide to change locales, Mr. Toner says.
“There’s such massive demand now that buyers don’t want to wait,” he adds. “If you have a piece of land that’s ready to go, there will be multiple bidders and the price is just going to continue to rise this year.”

How climate change will change Canada: These actions can make our communities more resilient to safeguard against climate impacts

Full text: By the middle of this century, and probably sooner, Canada will look and feel like a different place because of climate change.
The question is whether we choose now to ready our people, industries and land in ways that allow us to define that landscape ourselves, maintaining – and in some cases even improving – our quality of life and economic competitiveness.
The urgency of doing so will be highlighted on Monday, when the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change releases its latest report on the impact of rising global temperatures. It will largely tell us what we should know already in a country that last year alone experienced deadly heat waves, devastating floods and an entire town burning down: Those impacts are already being experienced in a multitude of ways, and will only become stronger.
That will point to the need to minimize further climate change by as much as humanly possible, through economic transformation that reduces our greenhouse gas emissions in short order.
But even in the very best-case scenario – which, by international consensus, would contain the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, up from about 1.2 C today – we would still have to reckon with more extreme weather and disasters.
Based on current trajectories, containing the increase to 2 C is a more realistic (and perhaps still optimistic) aim. And that increase stands to be more pronounced in Canada, which is warming at twice the global rate.
There is growing acknowledgment that building resilience to climate change can no longer take a back seat to slowing it; both must happen. That was a theme at last fall’s landmark UN COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, and the federal government is in the midst of developing Canada’s first national adaptation strategy.
But it can’t just be about waiting for governments to come up with answers. Decisions foisted on communities to address future dangers – from large infrastructure projects to new rules around land use – are liable to be met with resistance if Canadians aren’t engaged from the ground up. A push strategy needs to give way to a pull strategy.
That means empowering the public to start making resilient choices. Canada’s geographic expanse and diversity means different corners face vastly different impacts. When deciding where to live or build, where to invest and what lifestyle changes they might need to make, people need easy access to forward-looking information on risks where they are.
And they need better education – from the public and private sectors – on how to safeguard against climate impacts.
At the same time, there should be an opportunity to use our imaginations about what a more climate-resilient Canada could look like.
The possibilities are many; the further we look into the future, the more creativity will be needed.
But there are also examples, in Canada and elsewhere, of resilience innovation taking root, and now is the time to start drawing inspiration from them on a broader scale.
HEALTH: ‘THINGS NEED TO BE OVERHAULED’ At the world’s greenest hospital, a low-energy ventilation system circulates air that has been warmed with modular heat pumps and cooled with natural refrigerants. Reusable uniforms are made from an antimicrobial fabric. All waste is processed on site.
Located in the Nordic region of Europe, Gronnkopingkio Hospital is a model of adaptation. By reducing its energy use and dependence on supply chains, the hospital has a better chance of getting through extreme weather events fuelled by climate change without massive disruption. Its backup power generation, for example, will last longer if the facility uses less energy to begin with.
If Gronnkopingkio seems too good to be true, that’s because it is. It’s a fictitious, digital creation, designed by the Nordic Centre for Sustainable Healthcare, headquartered in Sweden, to highlight the technologies and approaches already in use in some hospitals.
“Everybody wants a visionary,” said Daniel Eriksson, the centre’s founder. “But the fact is that there are already solutions that exist today. There are proven concepts.”
Canadian hospital executives and policy makers at all levels of government are increasingly realizing the need to not just reduce emissions from the health sector, but to adapt to the threats associated with the level of global warming that’s already baked into our present and future.
At last year’s UN climate summit, Canada was among 50 countries that signed onto a World Health Organization pledge to develop climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems. The move acknowledges the risks that climate change brings, from increases in heat-related illnesses that could overwhelm emergency services, to wildfire smoke that could shutter operating rooms, high winds that could take out power sources and flooding that could cut off supply chains.
This past year in British Columbia is a case in point.
The once-in-1,000-year heat dome that settled over the province in June jammed the 911 system and claimed the lives of nearly 600 people. It laid bare the realities of the urban heat island effect, in which artificial surfaces such as concrete absorb and reemit the sun’s heat more than natural landscapes do, causing localized warming. Increasing the tree canopy would mitigate that.
And then in November, flooding of key B.C. highways and bridges meant dozens of people had to be airlifted to receive lifesaving dialysis treatment – a consequence of the trend toward centralized health care.
“Adaptation has been neglected for so long,” said Dr. Melissa Lem, a family doctor in Vancouver and incoming president of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment.
“Things need to be overhauled.”
Extreme weather events in the recent decades have challenged health care systems around the world. Perhaps the most striking example of what can go wrong and how to adapt is the story of the Texas Medical Center in Houston. TMC is the largest medical complex in the world, comprising more than two dozen hospitals and research institutions.
In 2001, Tropical Storm Allison caused critical infrastructure to fail across multiple hospitals.
Hundreds of patients had to be evacuated. Research losses from the storm were in the order of US$2-billion.
In the two decades since, TMC hospitals have invested tens of millions of dollars to try to make sure the same thing doesn’t happen again. An on-site combined heat and power plant was installed on the campus, eliminating the dependence on the local energy grid. The power system was also elevated to reduce the chances of it getting flooded.
Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 also exposed the fragility of hospitals built decades ago. During Katrina, staff had to use furniture to break windows to let in outside air, as indoor temperatures soared. The windows were built to be operable, but they had been sealed shut decades earlier for safety reasons.
The experiences in New Orleans informed the construction of the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston. New Yorkbased health care architect Robin Guenther led the resilience planning and sustainability goal-setting for the hospital, which opened in 2013.
Several critical things were done differently at Spaulding. All the mechanicals – including backup diesel generators, boilers and air ventilation equipment – were put on the roof or on a penthouse level above the hospital floors. The building was raised higher than the once-in-500-year flood level, exceeding U.S. federal standards. And the windows, Ms. Guenther said, can be opened with a key.
One of the first things health care leaders can do to become more resilient in the face of climate change is to understand where their facilities are vulnerable. The Canadian Coalition for Green Health Care has a tool for that, called the climate change resiliency checklist. Hospitals around the world and in at least eight Canadian provinces have used the checklist, which focuses on risk assessment, risk management and building capacity.
Neil Ritchie, the coalition’s executive director and a former hospital executive in Nova Scotia, said he hopes more hospitals will use the tool and make the necessary changes. “We’re starting to understand that this is more immediate than ever,” he said.
KATHRYN BLAZE BAUM, ENVIRONMENT REPORTER AGRICULTURE: ‘THE MOST URGENT THING IS TO MAKE A PLAN’ For the past decade and a half, B.C. has led the rest of the country in adaptation planning for agriculture, with its Climate and Agriculture Initiative BC.
The program is funded by the federal and provincial governments, and brings policy makers, climate researchers and farmers together to map out the specific risks faced by each region. The program recognizes that the risks faced by farmers vary greatly depending on their region and their type of operation. Crucially, it also offers specific on-farm adaptation strategies for farms.
“It’s a good example of what needs to be done at a national scale,” said Sean Smukler, a professor in the faculty of land and food systems at the University of British Columbia.
It’s the type of detailed, longterm planning that doesn’t exist yet on a national level – at least with the urgency necessary to meet the challenge, Prof. Smukler said. “The most urgent thing,” he said, “is to make a plan.”
The B.C. program’s 2015 plan for the Fraser Valley, for instance – the area hit hardest by floods last year – had specifically warned of risks of flooding, both from extreme precipitation and snow melt. It urged farmers to prepare and to plan for the potential of crop loss, the need to relocate livestock, and the possibility of flooded roads and interruptions to supply chains.
Even so, those plans didn’t predict the severity of last year’s weather events – and the fact that they’d arrive so soon, Prof. Smukler said. “And with that the planning and investment has not been enough in magnitude, or speed,” he said.
In many cases, that means dramatic investments in infrastructure – by farmers on their properties and by governments. Everything from water storage, drainage networks, and dikes and seawalls needs to be revisited with an eye toward the long term.
“These are kinds of things farmers can’t do on their own,” he said. “This has to be a societal investment.”
Still, there has been some progress. Twenty years ago, when University of Guelph climate researcher Barry Smit gave presentations to policy makers, or to farmers about adapting to climate change, the question he often heard was: “But is there really climate change?” At the very least, the conversation he’s met with by farmers now is: “Yes, [climate change] is here. What can we do about it?” “[Back then], People were looking to go back to normal,” he said. “I think now it’s pretty obvious we’re not going back to ‘normal.’” Prof. Smukler said the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has helped to hasten that along.
The shortages experienced in early 2020 helped to illustrate to the general public the importance of building resilience into the agricultural system – preserving local food production, and protecting the country’s food sovereignty.
“When we talked [before] about agriculture, peoples’ eyes glaze over and they think it’s only a small sector of our economy,” Prof. Smukler said. “[They’d think] ‘We don’t really need to deal with this, we’ll just get our food from somewhere else.”
But the pandemic has helped people understand what happens when the “somewhere else” is affected, too.
“If we don’t deal with our own capacity to adapt, then we’re trusting that California’s going to deal with its problems,” he said.
“Otherwise, we’re going to be eating something other than the lettuce during the wintertime.”
ANN HUI, NATIONAL FOOD REPORTER FLOODING Nowhere is there a greater need to level with Canadians about the risks they face, and to strike common purpose in reconfiguring communities to avert disaster, than when it comes to climate-related flooding.
Even as catastrophes such as last year’s devastating rainstorms in B.C. offer a terrifying preview of what lies ahead – and the government-funded Canadian Institute for Climate Choices predicts a fivefold increase in flood damages to homes and other buildings by mid-century – many people facing the greatest danger have been kept in the dark. The country’s flood maps are woefully out of date and difficult to access, and data is not made clearly available in real estate listings or other places it could help with informed decisions.
Placing such information at our fingertips – which the federal government has pledged to do, through updated flood maps at least – will make for some unpleasant realizations about what the future holds and how to prepare for it.
Those preparations will certainly include expensive and disruptive renovations to safeguard our buildings and, at a larger scale, investments in critical infrastructure such as flood walls.
They may even involve relocating neighbourhoods and entire towns now on land that is becoming too flood-prone to safely inhabit.
But engaging people in at-risk areas in building flood resilience can also involve discussing how to make our homes and communities more visually appealing, improve quality of life and reduce social inequalities.
Consider the growing movement toward green infrastructure to capture rainwater.
In general, the idea is to strategically place absorbent greenery in locations where there is lots of runoff from heavy rain or melting snow. That can mean rain gardens, consisting of deep-rooted plants in shallow depressions, on public or private lands. Or greenery atop the roofs of houses and larger buildings. It can be as ambitious as changing the look and feel of entire city throughways or as modest as rain barrels outside homes.
While European countries such as the Netherlands have been at the forefront of this approach, Canadians can look south of the border for lessons about how to embrace it on a large scale.
Philadelphia is currently in the midst of spending more than US$2-billion on its 25-year Green City, Clean Waters plan, which aims to use primarily natural means to manage rainfall accumulation across 10,000 city acres.
It was launched in 2011, when the city was required by U.S. environmental regulations to address its sewer overflows – a growing problem for many cities whose sewer systems handle both storm and sanitary waters.
In an interview, Paula Conolly, who helped lead the strategy for Philadelphia’s water department and is now director of the Green Infrastructure Leadership Exchange, said the city was drawn to the green approach because it promised to be less expensive and less disruptive than just building more traditional water infrastructure. It also would bring “bonus value” to communities.
Beyond flood prevention, those bonuses include a more attractive cityscape, better air quality and mitigation of the growing threat from extreme heat. The upsides can be especially pronounced in poor neighbourhoods, which tend to have higher flood risks and less green space than affluent ones to begin with, adding a social equity dimension.
The program has been sufficiently successful thus far, at least in its most measurable goal of reducing the amount of untreated waste entering the city’s waterways, to have encouraged U.S. cities such as Washington to go down similar paths. But it’s also been a learning experience, from which others can draw.
By no accounts will green infrastructure do all the heavy lifting, in making communities more flood-resistant. But it could reduce the need for other, less enticing ways of going about that.
And alongside better informing Canadians about the risks they are facing, it could move us toward a more collective effort to tackle them.

Full text: Kelowna is the fastest-growing census metropolitan area in Canada, and it is also one of the few regions in B.C.
where the share of empty or under-occupied dwellings has increased.
Kelowna grew to 222,162 people in 2021, a 14-per-cent increase within five years, according to new census data released two weeks ago.
But the number of dwellings that were sitting empty or underoccupied is now at 7.3 per cent for Kelowna city, the highest rate of all communities over 100,000 people in B.C. – and a higher rate than in Vancouver. That’s a 39per-cent increase over the number in the 2016 census.
Dwellings not occupied by the usual residents in the census are units that are used as short-term rentals or part-time homes, or awaiting occupancy. Housing used by international students or temporary workers does not fall within the category.
In Vancouver, 7 per cent of homes are either vacant or under-occupied, which is a decline from the previous census, said Andy Yan, director of Simon Fraser University’s city program.
While Vancouver saw a drop in the number of vacant units, likely due to city and provincial taxes aimed at curbing empty homes, the Kelowna region was one of the few in B.C. to see an increase.
Nationwide, there are 1.3 million homes that are not occupied by the usual residents, or 8 per cent of all homes, according to census analysis by urban planner and housing researcher Steve Pomeroy, of Focus Consulting.
Kelowna is subject to the province’s speculation and vacancy tax (SVT). A person is exempt if the home is their primary residence, or if the unit is rented for at least six months. The tax was intended to target foreign and domestic speculators. Foreign buyers are not as active in the Okanagan as they are in the Lower Mainland. As well, foreign owners and satellite families are charged a higher tax rate of 2 per cent, while Canadian citizens and permanent residents not in a satellite family are charged 0.5 per cent.
“Empty dwellings are the result of foreign ownership, vacation properties, investment properties and seasonally occupied dwellings,” Mr. Yan said.
“It’s important to remember that the speculation vacancy tax has different rates for foreign and Canadian owners. The SVT had a different impact on each region because of the mix of foreign or domestic investor and speculator. A tax of 2 per cent on $1-million for a typical Vancouver property is a lot different than 0.5 per cent of $500,000 for a property in Kelowna. That difference likely played a role in the number of empty dwellings.”
Kelowna also has a high percentage of non-owner occupied units, which is an indicator of the secondary rental market, or mom-and-pop landlords. The percentage of homes that are non-owner occupied in the city of Kelowna is 25 per cent and 23 per cent for the region. Those figures are also getting closer to Vancouver, which is at 33 per cent of all homes.
The figures point toward an active investor market, buoyed in part by pandemic buying by Lower Mainland residents, those in the industry say. Vancouver’s real estate and development communities are tapping into that major growth occurring in Kelowna, B.C.’s version of Napa Valley, where people from the Lower Mainland, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Europe and the U.S.
are increasingly seeking the area’s semi-arid summers. Many of them are purchasing homes as secondary properties, either for part-time use, or for future retirement.
Long-time Vancouver realtor Faith Wilson made her move into the Okanagan market a couple of years ago, and the Faith Wilson Realty Group Inc., part of Christie’s International Real Estate brand, will soon be running a commercial space in downtown Kelowna. It will be the firm’s second office outside of Vancouver.
Ms. Wilson oversees a team of 35 agents and has a small office in Penticton, B.C., as well.
“We have noticed definitely an increase in people moving from the Lower Mainland to the Okanagan. Certainly there is this influx from Alberta, and Toronto and the Ontario area, lots from there. Who are they? Different demographics. Some may think it’s downsizers, but that’s changed now. You have them for sure, but people are buying multiple homes, someone who wants a second or third home – you have those folks. And you get an interest in the Okanagan from a lifestyle perspective, from the younger generation now, who want to grow their families there.”
Kelowna real estate marketer Shane Styles, president of Epic Real Estate Solutions, says his company has gone from two employees when he started a year and a half ago to 31 people today.
Mr. Styles had been working in Vancouver and then relocated to Kelowna when the market there picked up. Epic has been around for 17 years and had downsized slightly because of the pandemic, but they’d only ever needed around five employees. That’s changed owing in large part to the influx of Lower Mainland residents, the growth of Kelowna’s tech industry, and the University of B.C. presence in the downtown core, and the thousands of students that will be arriving.
Mr. Styles says his company has about 800 units coming online in the next five months, and that’s just his marketing firm. Of the 25,000 registrations of interest they’ve received, he estimates around 40 per cent are from the Lower Mainland and about 20 per cent are from Alberta. A few years ago, that ratio would have been flipped.
“People from Vancouver, Chilliwack, Winnipeg, Regina and Calgary want to get their foot in the door. They see a future for themselves, but they’re not quite there yet, so they make an investment, a future play to be in this market,” he said.
Developers are also more interested in the Okanagan than in the past.
“Five years ago, pretty much everybody was local. I would say today I feel 80 per cent of my development inquiries are from developers outside the market. A lot of eyes are on the Okanagan, and most of them know it well.
They’ve been coming here with their families, and they just never made a real estate play because it wasn’t dynamic enough. You start to put up some 20-storey towers downtown and announce UBC is coming downtown, and that started to change the interest.
“The last inquiry was a guy who is from Calgary, does work in Phoenix. I said, ‘What is your interest in the Okanagan?’ He said he was intrigued by UBC coming downtown and so he bought four houses a block away. He’ll do a 65unit, six-storey wood-frame project, and there are a dozen of those happening within a kilometre of any direction I look from my office.”
Long-time Vancouver developers Cressey pre-sold out 127 highend units in a six-storey beachfront development in the Kelowna neighbourhood of Pandosy, scheduled to complete in two years.
And long-time Vancouver developer Rob Chetner has been expanding into the Kelowna market. His Kind Development Group has sold 99 of 100 units in Phase 1 of its Lakeview Village overlooking Lake Okanagan in West Kelowna. This summer, Mr. Chetner will launch sales of 122 units in the three or four phase condo project. Most buyers are from the Lower Mainland and about 15 per cent are investors, he estimates.
“We will probably continue to draw people from the Lower Mainland. Whether they are full timers or part timers, it’s hard to say at this point.”
He also redeveloped a boutique shopping mall across the street, one of four projects he has in Kelowna, with a fifth on the way and two more after that.
“I have my eye on a few others,” he says. “I’m definitely doing a lot in Kelowna. I’d like to do more in Vancouver, but there’s the cost of admission combined with the bureaucracy. I could call the mayor in West Kelowna right now. They’re accessible, and it’s easier to navigate and the cost is more bite sized, as well.”
He estimates that land assembly around Vancouver’s Cambie Street costs about $20- to $25million for a third of an acre, while that amount buys you five or six acres in Kelowna.
“That offers developers a much different perspective and it gives purchasers a lower price, and a different lifestyle. That’s how we make it affordable.”

Hudson’s Bay proposes redevelopment to transform Vancouver flagship store

Full text: Hudson’s Bay is proposing to turn its flagship Vancouver store into a part-office tower, part-retail space, part-event space and partgreen commuter hub – the latest move in the continuing transformation of department stores and city downtowns.
Company officials announced Wednesday they will be putting in a formal application to the city to redevelop the historic nine-storey store building (three underground) by adding 12 storeys of office space, transforming the top floors of the existing building into more office and reworking the interior to create a large event space and a three-storey atrium.
The retail space will be reduced almost in half, from about 600,000 square feet to 350,000 square feet.
“Hudson’s Bay will become a discovery destination. We are fully reimagining the Hudson’s Bay experience,” said company president Wayne Drummond.
The architects for the Vancouver store are Perkins and Will, an architecture firm that specializes in sustainable building. This has transportation advocates excited, because the plan at the moment is to add no new parking for motor vehicles and instead provide space for 1,500 bicycles, as well as improve transit and pedestrian experiences.
The decision is also being enthusiastically welcomed by some city politicians and downtown advocates, who have seen the city’s central retail and business core battered by two years of the pandemic.
Downtown Vancouver Business Improvement Association president Nolan Marshall says his organization “is incredibly optimistic and encouraged by the investment.”
City councillor Sarah KirbyYung, one of several local politicians who came out to the formal announcement at the store, said she saw it as the next evolution of downtown – one that could help bring a different kind of life to the nearby Granville entertainment district.
“Having people energizing it is important,” Ms. Kirby-Yung said.
Hudson’s Bay, with its real estate development arm Streetworks Development, has been redeveloping or departing from various historic properties across the country as retailers struggle to survive in the online world, depending on the potential in each market.
The Victoria store was redeveloped almost 10 years ago, with rental apartments added. In Alberta, the Calgary store is being downsized to only three floors and the Edmonton store has been closed. The Winnipeg store has been shuttered since November, 2020, and, while the city would like to see it redeveloped, there are no takers yet. And there are redevelopment plans, with an added office tower, for the Montreal store.
The stores are often the biggest buildings in Canadian central cities – the legacy of both the grand department-store era and the trading company that is considered a pillar of colonial Canada.
The Vancouver store, with an assessed value of $222-million this year, will follow the path of two nearby buildings if the redevelopment is successful. The onetime Eaton’s, kitty corner from the Bay, was transformed in 2015 to a smaller Nordstrom department store that incorporated a restaurant and a bar into its layout. The top floors became offices.
Vancouver’s historic main post office, down the street from the Bay on Georgia, is also being restored in the Post project, but with an office tower on top.
Both have seen big tech clients such as Microsoft and Amazon move in as part of their effort to appeal to young employees who prefer to work in urban settings with lots of attractions and in spots easily reached by transit, walking or bike.
There’s hope among those planning the Bay’s transformation that the Post project, which has proceeded at an unusually fast pace for a major Vancouver building development, will encourage the public and city planners to be confident about combining heritage with new additions. One heritage expert says he believes the Bay’s current design for its new building is even better than the Post’s.
“I like it. If it’s handled well, it can be successful,” said John Atkin. “So far, it looks good. It’s not trying to swallow the building below. It’s respectful.”
In contrast, the additions to the post office and to the Hudson’s Bay in Victoria were both “lumpy,” he said.
The store’s exterior, terracotta walls with Corinthian columns, is protected by a heritage designation. The design plan is to preserve those and build a new building inside those walls.
Little of the interior has heritage value and likely won’t be saved. But Mr. Atkin is hoping that one element will be: the passageway and stairs made of Manitoba limestone on the north side of the building, which was originally designed as a memorial area for store workers who died in the First World War.
“I’d hate to see that little piece lost,” he said.

Full text: Even before the pandemic, Hungerhub.com never required its employees to come to the office. In fact, one employee works full-time from Brazil, and another is currently working virtually from Barcelona.
“The policy is, you can work from anywhere; it doesn’t matter, as long as you’re being productive,” says Sari Abdo, Hungerhub’s chief executive officer. The corporate catering company’s business more than tripled in 2021 and expanded into Vancouver and Calgary as its work force has grown to 30, most of them hired during the pandemic.
For those who prefer not to work from home, the company provides the option to lease a desk in a co-working space convenient to where they live.
“Many of the staff live in condos and don’t want to work from their kitchen counter while their partner may be working at home as well,” Mr. Abdo explains. The company provides a stipend averaging $350 a month to cover the rental of a co-working space.
It’s a much more effective remote work option than the coffee shops Mr. Abdo used when he started the company in 2017.
“There are too many distractions and background noise and there might not be enough WiFi speed. Co-working spaces are designed for focus on work and there are good WiFi and outlets everywhere,” he says.
Many companies are experimenting with remote working as the disruptions of the pandemic reach the two-year milestone, says Scott Watson, managing partner of acquisitions and leasing at Crown Realty Partners in Toronto. Nine of Crown’s 34 office buildings in Toronto and Ottawa include co-working office centres.
While there wasn’t any growth in co-working early in the pandemic, Crown is now seeing increased interest in suburban touchdown spaces where employees can work remotely and avoid commutes to a downtown head office.
“Much like the open-office work plan, co-working and remote offices can make sense for some companies but not for all,” Mr. Watson says.
Increasing numbers of employers are investigating the coworking model because hybrid work is here to stay, says Wayne Berger, CEO, the Americas for IWG PLC, whose international portfolio of shared workspace brands include Regus, HQ and Spaces.
IWG is preparing for exponential growth and will expand its Canadian footprint with five new Spaces locations in early 2022, for a total of 173,500 square feet of new flexible workspace in Toronto, Ottawa, Dartmouth, Vancouver and Surrey, B.C.
Startups and tech companies were the typical clients for hybrid and flexible workspace before the pandemic, but now it’s trending far beyond that to financial companies, banks, insurance and pharmaceutical companies, and government, Mr. Berger says.
An Angus Reid survey commissioned by IWG found once stayat-home restrictions are lifted, 27 per cent of employees would like to work in an office close to home, and another 39 per cent favoured a hybrid mix of working from home or a local office and occasionally a corporate central office.
If required to work in the office five days a week, 29 per cent said they would look for another job.
The concept of a central urban office and branch operations in the suburbs had fallen out of favour in recent years as many companies consolidated their real estate holdings, says Caitlin Turner, senior principal and director of interiors for design and architecture firm HOK Canada.
“The pandemic and the prospect of an era of hybrid work is focusing clients, as well as our company, to shift away from the mindset of one central office and one desk per employee,” she says.
At the start of the pandemic, working from home seemed like a solution, and productivity appeared to be high, “but two years later, we can see that social capital has diminished and health and productivity spikes we saw early in the pandemic have dwindled with isolation and not being inspired by colleagues. People are saying we need to go back to workplaces,” Ms. Turner says.
HOK is developing prototype designs for satellite offices in both suburban and downtown locations that typically include an arrival zone, storage for day use, casual lounge space, food vending, spaces for team meetings and outdoor space.
Anticipating a hybrid work schedule, one pharmaceutical organization built a work space within their hub, Ms. Turner says.
“They essentially created a coworking environment with meeting rooms and work stations for people coming in one or two days a week to work in the space.”
The remote office trend is an international phenomenon. A global survey by commercial real estate services firm JLL found 41 per cent of tenants expect to increase their use of desk sharing and co-working space as part of a postlockdown work strategy.
JLL’s Global Flex Space Report found that, currently, only 3 per cent of the companies surveyed around the world use flexible space for more than a 10th of their total office footprint, but it could expand to as much as 30 per cent in some countries by 2030.
However, the picture is less clear in Canada, cautions Jonathan Peretz, JLL’s executive vicepresident and managing director for office and industrial in the Toronto area. The global survey included a number of markets that have reopened more fully than Canada, which is just emerging from another lockdown.
“However, companies still want people back in the office because nurturing and growing the company culture when everyone is connecting online is a big struggle,” Mr. Peretz says.
“We’re also seeing big bets in the office market on the leasing side,” he adds.
That doesn’t mean the office model will look like it did three years ago, “but what we’re hearing from our clients is that the office is so important as a glue to keeping people connected.”

Hot ski-town market represents wider affordability woes: Rossland, like so many other small towns in B.C., is bearing the brunt of higher housing prices amid an influx of people in search of affordability

Full text: Kyra Thomspon has spent the past decade moving from community to community in British Columbia as she gets priced out of the province’s constantly growing real estate market: from Vancouver Island to the Okanagan Valley, and now the Kootenays in the BC Interior.
She first arrived in the small town of Rossland nearly two years ago and hoped to put down roots and buy a home after a few years of saving. But even in the tiny ski community of around 3,000, which is roughly an eighthour drive from both Vancouver and Calgary, the same thing is happening again: She’s getting priced out.
“It’s so discouraging,” said Ms. Thompson, who is an apprentice in the food industry and says it feels like a down payment is a financial target that keeps moving further out of reach.
“Nobody that I know has a 20per-cent down payment stashed away, especially after COVID.”
The new year is ushering in dramatic price increases for smaller communities that have already seen relentless growth in their housing markets. The average cost of a single-family home in Rossland jumped 33 per cent from $380,000 to $504,000 between July, 2020, and July, 2021, according to data released from BC Assessments in January.
That compares with a 16-percent rise in Vancouver from $1.7million to just less than $2-million for the same class of house in the same period.
Jan Morton, president of the Lower Columbia Affordable Housing Society, which works to develop and manage affordable housing in Rossland and other communities in the region, said the recent jump came as a surprise, even after previous years of intense inflation in the housing market.
“We’ve been seeing upward pressure for sure, but this is a big leap,” Ms. Morton said.
“Anecdotally what we’re hearing is that with more people being able to work remotely, folks who want to make lifestyle choices are going, ‘Hmmm, maybe I like the idea of skiing at the resort here.’ ” Local residents see it as a form of gentrification that is more common in city life. It used to be that gentrification moved from the downtown core to neighbourhoods that were further out of the way. Now, it feels like the same progression is affecting rural communities, first in cities such as Squamish that are within reach of Vancouver, and now stretching to places as far as Rossland.
Josh Swain, a local resident who works in construction and home renovations, said one of Rossland’s saving graces was how difficult it was to reach. Even if you came this far into the province’s interior, there was still the much more well-known city of Nelson just one hour north.
“It used to be ‘Thank god we have a crappy airport and we’re so hard to get to and there’s so many good resorts between us and the major population centres,’ ” Mr. Swain said.
“I don’t want to rely on that though.”
Mr. Swain moved to the town in 2005, but he wonders if his 17year-old son, who also works in the trades, will be able to stay in the community as he transitions to being financially independent.
“It’s going to be tough for him to afford a house in Rossland,” said Mr. Swain, who says many local businesses simply can’t offer the kinds of wages needed to live in the community.
“I’ve heard more than one parent say, ‘My kid’s not going to be able to afford living here,’ or kids saying, ‘I won’t be able to live here unless my parents die and leave me a house.’” He says the socio-economic makeup of the town is changing noticeably as a result. He hires entry-level workers for his renovation business, and finding people who are able to live in town with that level of income gets harder each year.
It’s starting to feel like more of a rich-person’s town, he says. It feels like gentrification.
Ms. Morton says one of the biggest challenges that small B.C.
communities face is that their housing inventories are almost entirely made up of single-family homes. That means they’re not well set up to adapt to a changing population or to provide a soft landing for people who are arriving from urban communities.
That’s why organizations like hers are trying to promote higher density developments, such as an apartment building with 37 affordable rental units that is being built above Rossland’s new City Hall.
However, Rossland City Councillor Janice Nightingale says municipalities often have their hands tied when it comes to controlling housing markets, since provinces and the federal government generally have more power to implement policies such as B.C.’s foreign buyers tax and vacancy tax in metropolitan Vancouver.
“We can control zoning and land use, and those are really the only levers we have,” said Ms. Nightingale, who said the pace of growth is similar to other smaller cities in the province.
Ms. Morton, meanwhile, points to the nearby city of Castlegar as a prime example of what local governments in B.C. can do to fight a housing market that can escalate beyond a city’s control.
Castlegar is in a unique situation in the region. It’s 30 minutes north of Rossland and Trail, which have a wealth of tourism and industrial jobs. It’s also 30 minutes south of Nelson, one of the biggest tourism centres and most sought-after cities in the Kootenays. And a short drive from town are other industrial sites with ample job opportunities.
As intense demand drives up pricing in places such as Nelson and Rossland, home buyers have started spilling into Castlegar as a community that’s close enough to the action while being cheaper.
So when Chris Barlow became the Castlegar’s chief administrative officer four years ago, he moved with city planners to get a robust understanding of available land in town, purchase underutilized private land, create a housing strategy around exactly the types of developments needed and better communicate information on available land with organizations such as Habitat for Humanity to forge ahead with projects.
“In the past we’ve let the developers set the trend of what occurs in a community,” Mr. Barlow said, adding that the new direction was a marked change.
So far, Castlegar hasn’t been hit as hard as other cities in the region. The city’s year-over-year growth in property assessments for single-family homes was 21 per cent, compared with Rossland’s 33-per-cent growth.
In fact, Castlegar had the thirdlowest percentage growth in assessed value of any city in the Kootenay-Columbia region, besides Kimberly and Fernie, which had lower rates of growth because of historically sky-high property valuations, owing to their reputations as desirable communities for Albertans to looking to own a second home.
In Rossland, however, new developments with higher density are met with disdain from some locals, who believe more housing will lead to more city folks discovering the town, its quiet ski resort and extensive bike trail network.
Mr. Swain isn’t in that camp though, and he says the onus is also on the people who’ve already established themselves in these towns to make them more livable.
He says he wants to keep his money in the local economy and invest in something that’ll be good for the community, so he plans to use his expertise in construction to build a rental building on a lot he purchased. It won’t have that many units, but in a town of just 3,000 people, every bit helps.
“The only way out of the housing crunch is more housing because we’re not going to have less people coming to town – the lid’s off that can, it’s happening,” Mr. Swain said.
He said the way forward is to provide housing that will benefit people who are being financially squeezed.
“I want to build in a way where I can create long-term rental opportunities and work-force housing.”

What will happen to Canada’s housing market?: It could crash or soar, but there’s a more likely third option that nobody is talking about – stagnation

Full text: Canadian home prices have been climbing for two decades, but the past two years have broken all records.
The 28-per-cent surge in Canadian home prices during that stretch reflects a pair of key policy choices. Each is worthy in itself, but a problem when taken together.
The first is Ottawa’s desire to rejuvenate Canada’s aging work force by expanding immigration.
The second is the Bank of Canada’s determination to cushion the pandemic economy with ultralow interest rates.
“When you can borrow money for 1.5 per cent a year and invest it in an asset rising 20 per cent a year, you have to be an idiot not to sign up for that deal,” says John Pasalis, a real estate researcher and owner of Realosophy Realty Inc., a Toronto real estate brokerage.
The problem comes when the tsunami of demand unleashed by rapid population growth and low rates smashes into a supply of homes that isn’t growing nearly as quickly as it should. Across Canada, new homes are being added only slowly, at a pace well below what the market could absorb, because of impediments ranging from faulty population forecasts to determined resistance from homeowners in established neighbourhoods.
“Policy makers should have thought about these issues 10 years ago,” Mr. Pasalis argues.
“They should have thought about how they would meet the housing demands of a rapidly increasing population. Instead, they did the opposite. They accelerated population growth without any thought about how to address the housing issues that would be created.”
The mismatch of supply and demand is nearing crisis proportions. Canada now has the lowest number of housing units per capita of any Group of Seven country, according to Jean-François Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia. He calculates the country would need an additional 1.8 million homes simply to reach the average housing-to-population level common in other advanced economies. Looking across the country, it will require “years and years” of determined building to bring supply back into line with demand, Mr. Perrault says.
That suggests today’s lofty prices have solid long-term support – something that should cheer the hearts of both home owners and real estate speculators. In the short and medium turn, though, other factors are also going to play a role in shaping Canada’s housing market.
The most important force to watch is interest rates. The nearzero rates that have helped fuel the massive run-up in Canadian home prices over the past two years are finally on the verge of turning higher. If the Bank of Canada tightens policy as expected, today’s red-hot real estate prices could soon face the cooling impact of higher borrowing costs.
Everyone can spin a scenario about how this clash of forces will turn out. But one possibility that gets surprisingly little attention is the prospect that the market could do something it hasn’t done for a long time – sit still.
As hard as it may be for today’s real estate speculators to believe, Canadian home prices didn’t always soar or swoon. From 1975 to 2000, residential property prices were remarkably steady, climbing barely half a per cent a year in after-inflation terms, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), a global financial watchdog.
Could we be in for a repeat of that long slumber? Before considering the possibility, it might help to remember how we got to this point.
Housing mavens like Mr. Pasalis draw a distinction between the Canadian housing market pre-2015 and post-2015. “There was a very big shift in house price dynamics around that point,” he says.
This isn’t to deny that Canadian home prices shot up enthusiastically between 2000 and 2015. But much of the Canadian market’s gains between 2000 and 2015 can be chalked up to three simple factors – inflation, rising real wages and falling interest rates.
Inflation is the easiest factor to get a handle on. While prices in Canada’s 11 major cities soared an average of 146 per cent from 2000 to 2015, according to the Teranet House Price Index, a good chunk of that increase reflected generally rising prices on everything.
Strip out the cumulative effect of inflation and “real” home prices – that is, after inflation – were up only 90.3 per cent, according to the BIS. That is still a whopping increase, of course, but it is not nearly as large as the unadjusted numbers would suggest.
The rise in real home prices looks even smaller if you set it against the rise in real incomes over the same period. Median after-tax incomes, in inflation-adjusted terms, climbed 18.7 per cent from 2000 to 2015, according to Statistics Canada. Those rising incomes allowed Canadian families to spend more for housing while keeping their shelter spending constant as a proportion of their incomes.
Finally – and crucially – there was the impact of falling interest rates. Tumbling interest rates steadily pushed down borrowing costs and had a bigger effect than most people realize.
In a 2019 research paper, Bank of England researchers David Miles and Victoria Monro looked at the effect of interest rate moves on British home prices. They concluded that “if the risk-free rate [of interest] moves by just 1 per cent, this can result in real house prices ultimately moving by roughly 18 per cent in the opposite direction.”
It may seem odd that small changes in interest rates could have such a big effect, but similar effects are common in other financial markets. Bonds that mature 20 or 30 years in the future, for instance, are notoriously sensitive to tiny increases in interest rates. This is because their value depends on putting a price on payouts that lie far in the future.
A slight fall in interest rates can radically boost the present value of those distant payoffs.
Similar logic would seem to apply for homes, which also dispense their benefits over decades. If so, and we estimate that real interest rates fell by at least three percentage points in Canada between 2000 and 2015, the Bank of England model suggests home prices would be expected to go up about 54 per cent.
Put together inflation, income growth and falling interest rates and you can explain most of the increase in Canadian home prices between 2000 and 2015. To be sure, this high-level view leaves out lots of interesting elements – the possible role of foreign money, for instance, or the state of local politics in Toronto and Vancouver – but it suggests you don’t need to put a lot of weight on those additional factors to explain the broad contours of the Canadian housing market circa 2015.
At the time, well-informed experts thought supply was running pretty much in line with demand. A Parliamentary Budget Officer report in 2016 acknowledged that construction of new housing units had fallen behind the number of new households between 2012 and 2015. However, it saw the relatively modest shortfall as merely cutting into the existing surplus of houses.
“We estimate that there was still some excess supply in terms of the overall stock of housing units in 2015,” the report declared.
It added that it expected the housing stock to return to balance over the years ahead.
So what went wrong? Since the start of 2015, Canada’s housing market has been anything but balanced. Home prices in Canada’s 11 major cities jumped 73 per cent during that seven-year stretch, according to the Teranet House Price Index. Moreover, they did so in erratic fashion, spiking more than 20 per cent between 2016 and 2018 and again during the pandemic.
Two explanations stand out for this disturbing behaviour: disjointed planning and pandemicera interest rates.
The planning problems had their roots in moves by the governments of both Stephen Harper and Justin Trudeau to attract more international students to Canada. That was followed by the Liberal government’s moves to radically boost immigration targets, from around 260,000 newcomers annually before 2015 to more than 400,000 a year post-2020.
These population-boosting initiatives arguably make good sense, given Canada’s aging work force. However, the rapidity of the population increases took planners by surprise, especially in Ontario, the epicentre of the housing crisis.
Planners in that province severely underestimated population growth from international sources, especially in the Toronto to Hamilton area, according to a recent report from the Smart Prosperity Institute, a think tank based at the University of Ottawa.
The province’s population, which had been growing by 120,000 persons a year, suddenly started expanding by an average of 200,000 people a year between 2015 and 2020. The influx consisted of more international students, more immigrants, and more Canadians moving to Ontario after the oil price collapse of 2015.
Ontario was simply not ready for such a surge. Faulty forecasts led communities across the province to underestimate the need to build crucial infrastructure, which in turn put a cap on developers’ ability to build homes, especially in Toronto. Young families started flooding out of the metropolis in search of affordable housing, driving up prices across a broad stretch of Southern Ontario.
“We don’t have policies or systems in place, either at the municipal or provincial levels, to account for rapid population growth, especially if that growth is unexpected,” says Mike Moffatt, senior director of the Smart Prosperity Institute.
In an ideal world, policy makers and builders may have devised ways to grapple more aggressively with this challenge. But then the pandemic intervened.
Central banks slashed rates to help locked-down economies after the coronavirus struck in early 2020. The abrupt and unexpected fall in rates was followed by a boom in home prices, not just in Canada, but across a broad swath of the developed world.
In the United States, the S&P/ Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index jumped 29 per cent over the past two years, pretty much in line with the 28-per-cent gain in Canada’s Teranet House Price Index. Home prices in Australia and New Zealand rocketed ahead by similarly astounding amounts. In the third quarter of 2021, global house-price growth hit a record high, according to the Economist magazine.
The international evidence suggests the latest wave of home prices increases owes a lot to the mechanical effect of crisis-era interest rate cuts, combined with a pandemic-inspired surge in second-home buying and a shortage of building supplies. But it also raises concerns about what will happen as interest rates rise and life returns to more normal conditions.
A good place to start thinking about what comes next is to focus on what Mr. Perrault at Scotiabank calls the single most important fact about the Canadian housing market – the huge imbalance between supply and demand.
“None of this is rocket science,” he says. “We simply have not been building enough homes.”
It is difficult to argue with his logic. An Ontario task force report this month argued that 1.5 million more homes must be constructed in that province alone over the next decade to meet demand. It will take years, though, for any new rules and new construction to have a material effect on home prices.
That brings us to the other undeniable fact of Canada’s current housing market: its unaffordability. Mr. Pasalis, the Toronto real estate broker, points out that only about 10 per cent of low-rise homes in Toronto now sell for under $1-million. “Most people simply can’t afford it,” he says.
This is true across much of the country. Home prices jumped 31 per cent over the past year in Halifax, 15 per cent in Montreal and 21 per cent in Victoria. Nationwide, the housing affordability measure compiled by Royal Bank shows ownership costs as a percentage of median household income are now at their highest level in 31 years. And those ownership costs are only going to grow if interest rates rise, as expected over the next year.
What happens when galloping demand meets unaffordable prices? Perhaps a long period of stagnation for home prices. It is difficult to see how home prices can plunge given the underlying demand pressures. It is also difficult to see how they can continue to gallop ahead when they have already raced well beyond the grasp of many buyers.
Stagnation doesn’t have to mean absolute steadiness, of course. It could merely mean a long period in which prices remain stuck in a narrow corridor, while salaries edge ahead to the point where homes are once again affordable. In some ways, this would resemble the 1975 to 2000 period, when home prices bobbed up and down but only inched ahead in real terms over a quarter century, For homeowners and speculators, a return to such a sleepy dynamic would be a shock. They would have to adjust their expectations for rapid gains and settle for once again seeing homes as shelter, not a financial investment. But after two decades of real estate frenzy, a prolonged slumber could go a long way to restoring national sanity.

Full text: DONE DEAL 67 Hagey Ave., No. 15, Fort Erie, Ont.
FORT ERIE Asking price: $299,900 (October, 2021) Selling price: $370,000 (November, 2021) Taxes: $1,067 (2020) Days on the market: 21 Listing agent: Michael St. Jean, Michael St. Jean Realty Inc.
THE ACTION This three-bedroom townhouse near the Peace Bridge to the United States got attention from locals and investors intrigued by a below-$300,000 price tag.
Over a three-week period, about two dozen house hunters made an in-person tour before one visitor made an offer, which prompted one other to make their bid. The better of the two set the sale price at $370,000.
“It’s pretty affordable because there aren’t a lot of opportunities out there on the market any more in that price bracket,” agent Michael St. Jean said, “even taking into account [the Niagara region] is more affordable than Hamilton or Halton.”
“There’s definitely a different dynamic in Fort Erie, so we had a bit of a slower start, but the activity caught up with it.” WHAT THEY GOT This townhouse is part of a roughly 50-yearold rental complex that was recently converted into condominiums.
The standard two-storey layout provides 1,225 square feet of living space and has been recently remodelled with laminate flooring, two updated bathrooms and a kitchen with stainless-steel appliances and access to a private deck.
There are open-concept living and dining areas on the main floor, while the bedrooms are upstairs.
The basement is unfinished.
Surface parking is included.
Monthly fees are $320.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It showed really well and was renovated,” Mr. St.
Jean said.
“To get a condo like that – basically brand-new and ready to go, for that price – I don’t know where else you’ll find something like that anywhere around there.”

Full text: 52 St. Georges Cres., Edmonton OLD GLENORA Asking price: $2,198,800 (February, 2021) Previous asking price: $2.225-million (November, 2020) Selling price: $2.05-million (December, 2021) Previous selling price: $2.2-million (2019); $700,000 (1991) Taxes: $16,301 (2020) Days on the market: 381 Listing agent: Clare Packer, Re/Max Excellence THE ACTION In 2019, a buyer paid $2.2-million for this nearly 100year-old house across from MacKinnon Ravine, but only lived in it for a year before being transferred elsewhere for work. It was put back on the market in late 2020 priced at $2.225-million but failed to sell. The price was revised downward to $2,198,800 in February, 2021.
“Luxury homes in Edmonton take time to sell,” agent Clare Packer said. “So, we believe if we’re at the right price – even if we’re not getting offers and even if it takes several months – it doesn’t mean we need to keep reducing it to draw in an offer.”
In this case, it took more than a year for a bid to materialize, though somewhat below the asking price but still enough to crack the $2-million level.
“We’ve got referral partners in both Vancouver and Toronto, so those are the two main areas where we get out-of-town buyers for this price range,” Ms. Packer said. “But ultimately, it went to a local buyer with some ties to Toronto.”
WHAT THEY GOT This house with 3,721 square feet of living space has an L-shaped design, with formal living and dining rooms, a separate study, five bedrooms and a hidden loft accessed by a spiral staircase.
The sky-lit eat-in kitchen has stone countertops and stainless-steel appliances, with doors opening out to the patio.
A two-sided fireplace divides the kitchen and sunken family room.
There’s also a partly finished basement and a double garage.
The house sits on a pie-shaped lot measuring 143 feet deep and 28 feet wide out front.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “Some of the most expensive real estate in Edmonton is on that single crescent,” Ms. Packer said.
“It faces a natural river valley and ravine area, so nothing can be built to obstruct that view.”
The house marries new and old elements, such as arched doorways and alcoves. “The property is a good example of how to keep Edmonton’s historic and charming, character homes instead of demolishing them,” Ms. Packer said.

Could the city get a big park from a grand compromise?

Full text: ARCHITECTURE The railway corridor that slices through downtown Toronto is wide and grim, a canyon that slashes the fabric of the city. But the space above the tracks is now full of dreams. Will it become a park? Or a new highrise neighbourhood?
Or both? The developers who own the air rights say the city can split the difference. At a public meeting next week, they will unveil their idea to partner with the city and build as many as 6,000 homes, a sizeable percentage at below-market pricing, and 4.5 hectares of parkland.
That is half the 8.5 hectares that Toronto’s government had imagined as Rail Deck Park. But it comes with a lot of housing (which the city needs) and truckloads of private capital to make it happen.
Does Toronto want to dream big? Or compromise and start building something?
“There’s a tremendous opportunity here to create a collective vision,” said architect Drew Sinclair of SvN, who is working with the development team. “The city and the owners had difficulty coming to terms on their misaligned objections: park versus development. Now there’s the possibility to deliver both.”
The story has changed in the past two years. In May of 2021, the developers, led by the littleknown firms Craft and Kingsmen, won a major victory. Ontario’s Local Planning Appeal Tribunal ruled that their development proposal was “good planning,” effectively giving them the right to build.
This left the city on the back foot in its attempts to create a park; it would now have to buy the developers out at a higher price.
And the Rail Deck Park idea was already expensive. In 2017 the city estimated its cost at $1.7billion for construction alone.
Which brings us to the present day. The developers have added financial backing from the regional pension fund of the Labourers’ International Union of North America and Fengate Asset Management. They’ve also staffed up for the moment with architects Sweeny & Co. and SvN, among the city’s most sophisticated design firms.
In short, they’re positioning themselves to actually build this massive and complex project.
Choices need to be made to coordinate with planned rail construction, but the developers can’t build anything without the co-operation of the city and they want to play nice.
“We 100 per cent believe that public and private objectives can be met here in an exciting way,” says Jim Ilkay of the development group.
For this they want a sizeable contribution from the city: $765million to help build the deck that would hold up the neighbourhood. The developers say this would be partly balanced by payments for city land. Expect haggling.
In physical terms, they’re rethinking last year’s badly flawed development scheme, designed by Moshe Safdie. That would have placed much of the public space up above a shopping mall.
The developers say their new scheme – which they wouldn’t show me yet – folds in some pieces of public land to create more gradual slopes, and eliminates much of the parking garage space that made the Safdie scheme so bulky and impenetrable.
Mr. Sinclair said it achieves many of the city’s design objectives, above all bringing the park space down near street level.
Lynda Macdonald, a top city planning official who is overseeing the file, said the city is waiting for drawings to see if the claims bear out.
What does all this mean? It depends on your view of the public realm, and what sort of a city Toronto is. City planners and leaders have argued Rail Deck Park is a crucial asset to a dense downtown and the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. It would be Toronto’s Central Park or Millennium Park: a showcase public space where the region comes together.
The Rail Deck story has been framed as a morality play. The city government (hurray!) wants to built a beautiful public amenity (ooh!), while real-estate developers (boo!) want to build condos (hiss!).
The reality is more complicated. For one thing, the developers came first; they started acquiring air rights from the railways in 2013. For another, Rail Deck Park is wildly expensive. For a quarter century, Toronto’s political leadership has refused to make big new investments in public goods. Parks are often designed on the cheap and poorly maintained.
Will that change? Maybe. Joe Cressy, the city councillor who represents the rail corridor area, is still dreaming big. “To build a truly great city, you need to imagine its potential 50 years from now – and you need to be willing to invest to build it,” he said. “And on that corridor, what the future Toronto deserves is a grand central park.”
Maybe so. But would this penny-pinching, politically fractured city actually build one? Or would it do nothing here for 50 years, as the trains keep running and the city keeps growing?
There is a related question: Is it worth spending $2-billion on these particular 8.5 hectares?
Compare the University Park proposal, which would turn four hectares of University Avenue into park space and cost far less.
Nobody dreams about compromise. But a compromise here – if it comes with the design choices that create a truly public space and a truly excellent neighbourhood – might be how a new piece of the city gets built.

Vacant homes may be on the rise in Toronto, but not Vancouver, analysis of census data shows

Full text: An indicator of vacant homes is on the rise in Toronto and on the decline in Vancouver, according to a new analysis of census data.
The number of housing units not occupied by “usual” residents – defined as Canadians and permanent residents living in their usual place of residence – rose by 40 per cent in the city of Toronto to 92,346 over the past five years. Meanwhile, the level fell by 10 per cent in the city of Vancouver to 23,011 over the same period, according to calculations by Andy Yan, director of Simon Fraser University’s city program, who is known for his research on empty homes in Vancouver.
The 2021 census does not break out whether homes are sitting vacant in Canada, but it provides the total number of housing units in the country and the total number of housing units occupied by “usual residents.”
The difference in the two figures includes homes that are vacant, as well as short-term rentals and homes that are temporarily occupied by foreigners or Canadians with a primary residence elsewhere.
Mr. Yan’s review found the divergence between Toronto and Vancouver was striking and said it showed that Vancouver’s empty-home tax, stricter Airbnb rental rules and anti-real estate speculation measures are working to ensure fewer homes are sitting vacant.
“Public policy matters. I strongly attribute this change to a combination of local policies like the vacant-home tax and short-term rental policies,” he said. “The difference between Vancouver and Toronto was remarkable in terms of how different their trends were.”
The pandemic-related shutdowns and travel restrictions have likely influenced the home occupancy numbers when Statistics Canada started collecting the census data in May, 2021.
In the city of Vancouver, homes not occupied by usual residents accounted for 7 per cent of the housing units last year compared with 8.2 per cent in 2016, according to Mr. Yan’s analysis.
The drop in both the number and percentage marks the first decline in two decades.
Vancouver has long had to contend with a lack of affordable housing, low rental vacancies and rampant real estate investor speculation.
Vancouver first introduced its empty-home tax in 2017 during the country’s previous real estate boom. The tax of 1 per cent on the assessed value of a property was designed to compel real estate investors to make their homes available to rent long term. Vancouver’s empty-home tax has since tripled to 3 per cent.
Meanwhile, in the city of Toronto, homes not occupied by usual residents accounted for 7.4 per cent of all private dwellings last year, compared with 5.6 per cent in 2016. That was the first increase since 2006, according to Mr. Yan, who used population and private dwelling data from the 2021 census, which was released last week.
Toronto is also grappling with worsening housing affordability and low rental vacancies. The typical home price is 52-per-cent more expensive than January, 2020, and monthly rental costs are also climbing.
Toronto’s 1-per-cent emptyhome tax went into effect in January and the city has also tried to make it harder for homeowners to put their entire homes on Airbnb and other short-term rental sites.
“Making empty housing stock available for long-term renters is an immediate way to stimulate supply,” said Heather Tremain, chief executive with Options For Homes, a non-profit developer that provides shared-equity mortgages for low-income earners so they can buy a home.
“Anything that helps to create some additional housing in the current market is a step in the right direction,” she said.
The federal government has also introduced a proposed 1per-cent tax on empty homes, but it only applies to foreign owners of real estate not domestic owners.
The census does not provide specific data on empty homes.

Full text: DONE DEAL 5834 Dalgleish Rd. NW., Calgary DALHOUSIE Asking price: $469,900 (January, 2022) Previous asking price: $435,000 (June, 2021) *under previous agent Selling price: $515,000 (January, 2022) Previous selling price: $390,000 (2016) Taxes: $2,562 (2021) Days on the market: Eight Listing agent: Kamil Lalji, CIR Realty THE ACTION This semi-detached bungalow had sat on the market for two months last summer priced at $435,000 but had received no offers. When agent Kamil Lalji took over the listing in January he gave the house a light makeover, including a new paint job, that he hoped would make a better impression on buyers. He was surprised to receive 13 offers, the top three of which were more than $500,000.
“What set it apart was definitely its legal basement suite,” Mr. Lalji said. “However, that alone was not enough to account for the unprecedented number of legitimate interest and offers within the first week of listing.
“A lot of those 13 offers were not from Calgary [buyers] so that was quite interesting because why, all of a sudden, are people in a huff about Calgary and wanting to put their money here?” Mr. Lalji suspects the surge is fueled by strong local industries and housing affordability. “Maybe part of it is oil prices are going up and turned a corner, and we have a lot of tech here now,” Mr. Lalji said.
“From what I hear, a couple of different brokerages are also having these online seminars targeted towards Toronto and Vancouver buyers, proclaiming Calgary is the new real estate mecca with the average price being only $450,000 while Toronto is over $1-million.”
WHAT THEY GOT This 50-year-old house sits on a 31-foot-by-110-foot lot and has updated roofing and windows, as well as new vinyl plank flooring, kitchen appliances and bathroom tiles on both floors.
The main house has 1,029 square feet of living space, including three bedrooms, an open dining area and a living room with a wood-burning fireplace.
The self-contained 957square-foot basement suite has two bedrooms, an office and a recreation area.
Two-car parking is off a laneway.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s a semi-detached house, but a legal up and down duplex,” Mr. Lalji said.
“It’s close to a CTrain line and a university, so overall, you’re close to good, long-term infrastructure.”

Full text: Brash, unfiltered and with a deep, infectious laugh, Sonya Biddle was at once a performer and a politician, a scion of Montreal musical royalty who loved to talk, loved even more to listen and always got people to laugh along with her, no matter what she did.
Once, while passing a collection basket at a Montreal Blues Festival fundraiser with a wealthy audience, she caught the eye of the Dalai Lama, who was in attendance, ostentatiously picked out a cheque, folded it in two and mimed sticking it down her bra.
“The Dalai Lama burst out laughing,” said Ms. Biddle’s long-time partner, Allan Patrick. “Sonya was laughing and everyone else around them began to laugh, too. She was that good, up front and unapologetically in your face.”
Walking down a street in the west end of the city with Ms. Biddle was always an adventure, too, Mr. Patrick continued, for she would stop to talk and giggle with passersby as if they were all her best friends.
“Who was that?” Mr. Patrick was wont to ask.
Often, the answer was “No idea.”
It didn’t matter, not to Ms. Biddle, who was driven throughout her life by an interest in people, full-stop. As an actor in the eighties and nineties, she took on stage roles that resonated with her sensibility, including the Black Theatre Workshop’s For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf. Before she entered politics, Ms. Biddle lobbied hard for everything from water parks for kids to getting the city to purchase a long-vacant, ornate theatre in her neighbourhood and transform it into a cultural centre for the English-speaking community.
As a fledgling local politician in the late 1990s, she fought hard to provide support for marginalized, disadvantaged communities throughout the city – a program that became known under then-mayor Pierre Bourque as Quartiers sensibles, or At Risk Neighbourhoods.
“She was really a fighter for the underdog, with passion, heart and courage,” said Mr. Patrick, whom she met more than 35 years ago when both were working in theatre. “Her kids called her the supernova because she lit up and warmed so many lives.
“Everything is going to be okay, she always insisted. You just have to believe.”
Surrounded by her family, Ms. Biddle died on Jan. 19 at the University of Montreal Hospital Centre after a bout with intestinal cancer. She was 63 years old, and joking, positive and trying to make everyone else feel better right up to the end.
Sonya Biddle was born on Dec. 31, 1958, the eldest of Charlie Biddle and Constance Marchand Biddle’s four children. Her father was a jazz bassist from Pennsylvania who moved to Quebec for the music scene after serving in a Black U.S. army regiment during the Second World War and studying music at Temple University. Her French-Canadian mother met Mr. Biddle at the hotel her father owned in Asbestos, Que.
Sonya described her childhood as “blessed,” yet not without challenges. Her father, who was involved in the founding of Biddle’s Jazz and Ribs in downtown Montreal, moved the family around a lot as he established his career, from Sainte-Thérèse to Chateauguay to Montreal. The way Mr. Patrick tells it, whenever she started at a new school, other children were fascinated by her, touching her hair and telling her she was “cute” the next day, after they had gone home to tell their parents about the new girl, they’d come back using the N-word.
At the same time, the family’s home was filled with people and song, with talk of jazz, racism and civil rights. Young Sonya, who had two sisters and a brother, met the stars of the day, from Tom Jones to Cat Stevens and Oscar Peterson.
After attending the theatre and arts program at Dawson College in the heart of Montreal, Ms. Biddle became a familiar stage presence in her own right, and had supporting roles in a number of films, including The Bone Collector, which starred Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie.
Mr. Patrick described the two of them moving in tandem in their careers, most definitely not 9-to-5ers. “We worked as producers in music, in TV, in theatre and in comedy. We organized fundraisers and oversaw communications, following our own drumbeat so that we never had time to get bored,” he said.
When Mr. Bourque came calling before the municipal election in 1998, they were both recruited – Mr. Patrick to act as the mayor’s adviser for anglophones and Ms. Biddle to run in NotreDame-de Grâce (NDG) under Vision Montreal’s banner against long-time city councillor Sam Boskey. She won by 68 votes.
An attempt at a second term in 2001 ended in defeat, as did a run to become mayor in 2005 of the Côte-Des-NeigesNDG borough. She lost to Michael Applebaum, who would later be sentenced to a year in prison and two years of probation for extorting $60,000 in bribes from real estate developers during his tenure.
Montreal City Councillor Mary Deros, who first met Ms. Biddle when they both ran for city council in 1998, never saw her friend unhappy, not even when she disagreed vehemently with a position.
“Instead, she’d always laugh and smile and try to get her way,” Ms. Deros recalled. “There were always solutions as far as Sonya was concerned, and she said it as she felt for she wasn’t a typical politician, not at all.”
Mr. Bourque, who remained close to Ms. Biddle long after both left politics, said he was inspired by how she lived her life: one day at a time, but never losing sight, not of what she wanted, but what was needed.
“I think of Sonya first and foremost, not as a politician, but as a great citizen, which is the most important thing of all.”
Along with Mr. Patrick, Ms. Biddle leaves her mother, Ms. Marchand Biddle; her sons, Charles Biddle Williams and Callum Biddle Patrick; and her siblings, Stephanie and Tracy Biddle, and Charles Biddle Jr.

Full text: In the classic February battle between frigid air and warming sun, the sun has won. In Toronto’s Upper Beaches neighbourhood, clustered around Main and Gerrard streets, folks are out for a stroll, takeout coffees in one hand and dog leashes in the other.
As one well-dressed couple walks along Swanwick Avenue admiring the collection of fine, gabled, red-brick houses, they slow down at No. 12. Clearly, something has been added to this early-20th-century home, but it’s what looks to be a second front door that has caused the mini-debate. Is this home a semi-detached? Or are the homeowners eccentric types who have a propensity for doorways?
Craig Race is happy to enlighten. A resident of the left half for less than two weeks, Mr. Race is also the architect who transformed the single-family home into a semi-detached. His new neighbours will be moving in beside him in just more than two weeks.
“You have to have a good site, for sure,” says the affable Mr. Race, who did his master’s degree at the University of Oregon. “A really wide lot, unusually wide for the street, so that the two lots you end up with are still in character with the neighbourhood … and then just know how to navigate the process.”
Since No. 12 was already about 40 feet wide, it was possible to create two houses. And had the welldressed walkers been paying close attention, they would have noticed that semis already exist on the street, and indeed, on Swanwick east of Main Street, there is a row of narrow worker’s row houses.
“The side-yard setbacks didn’t change, the front- and rear-yard setback didn’t change,” Mr. Race continues, “we just added a third floor, essentially and simplified the shape.”
Mr. Race says “we” because, in addition to practising as Craig Race Architecture Inc., this project is the first he’s completed with his younger brother, Steve Race, an electrician, and his father, Phil Race, a real estate investor. And despite some neighbourhood opposition and long pandemic delays, the trio says they enjoyed the experience so much, they’ve decided to look for similar projects to tackle.
The key, says the youngest Race, is to “make sure we [don’t] destroy a neighbourhood.”
“There was a lot of misinformation about this project,” his older brother elaborates. “People thought it was going to be an apartment building, and have eight units, so a lot of the letters of objection were [based on] crazy rumours.”
Luckily, the Race clan had the support of immediate neighbours who understood the project and built bridges to the rest of the community. And it is a community, Mr. Race says, where unscrupulous developers have erected small apartment houses next to “old stately houses,” so he certainly understands why feathers were ruffled.
“Not everyone respects the neighbourhood in the same way,” he says.
“We were very careful about the construction site,” his father adds. “Craig was very, very careful to contain the site, both visually and physically.”
So what have the Race men created? Well, other than the two front doors – now addresses 12A and 12B – a passerby might notice the thoughtful landscaping, which picks up on the neighbour’s wavy hedge pattern and continues it, or perhaps that a series of raised rocks stitch the two yards together. They might notice that the two new front porches are simple, elegant and understated.
The most obvious things, of course, are the wings that jut from the new third storey and add a distinct fin down the building’s east edge; not only do these black beauties provide shelter to the two decks, they are, in essence, the only modernist intervention to the heritage façade. The new third storey might even be shorter, the architect says, than the peaked attic space that it replaced.
If one is lucky enough to be invited inside one side or the other, one will discover a very thoughtful floor plan. In each half (essentially mirror images of each other), the visitor steps from a small front porch into a generous dining room. From there, a galley kitchen doubles as a corridor to the rear family room. On either side of the kitchen are staircases – one to the basement, and one to the second floor.
“The kitchen is where the design had to work,” Mr. Race says.
“This is a kitchen and a hallway and a stair corridor, all in this 12-[foot]-by-10-[foot] space.”
The second floor is shaped like a “barbell,” Mr. Race says. Bedrooms on either end are connected by a long hallway that contains a three-piece bath, a laundry room and the mechanical room.
The third floor is a little different: Three-quarters of the space is dedicated to the principal bedroom, an ensuite with a double sink, and a generous walk-in closet; at the rear is a small bedroom that might work better as a home office.
The principal bedroom, Mr. Race says with a laugh, even sports a small coffee nook so that one’s morning cuppa won’t get cold should they choose to take it onto the deck.
“My clients always ask for those things and I always tell them, you’re never going to use them, don’t waste the money. … I’d be surprised if we use this more than a couple of times a year.”
While the coffee nook might be a frill, a keen eye will soon determine that these two units are not ostentatious. They are handsome and well built, yes, but flourishes are few. That, the Races say, is by design: “This is an exercise in infill housing, not ultra luxury design,” confirms Mr. Race, who will be paying market rent for his unit.
“We knew the size of the units we were creating were not going to be competing with … houses in Rosedale.”
Population projections show Toronto at more than seven million residents by 2050. To house everyone, it will take small moves such as this, a great many more laneway and garden suites, and much larger moves such as midrises and high-rises where they make sense.
By then, however, it’s a safe bet that no one will stop in their tracks when they spot two front doors on what was once a singlefamily home.

Why can’t the Flames and Calgary seal an arena deal?: City should follow Seattle, New York’s lead: both built new facilities and brought in experts to make them profitable

Full text: Former chief planner of Calgary, where he also led three city departments. He previously led planning efforts in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, worked as the head city planner for the mayor of St. Louis and spent 21 years in Toronto’s planning department.
Last fall, two new NHL arenas hosted their first hockey games: The Seattle Kraken played in the Climate Pledge Arena, and the New York Islanders took the ice in the UBS Arena. It took just five years for both arenas, each costing US$1.1-billion, to move from development proposal to opening day.
At the same time, the Calgary Flames and the City of Calgary were skating in circles over who would pay for a new $608-million arena. With the Flames’ recent announcement that last summer’s arena deal to split the cost between the city and the owners is off the table, both parties have retreated to their benches.
How did the Seattle and New York efforts succeed, while the Flames and Calgary have failed to seal the deal?
Flames ownership attributed the cancellation of the deal to the millions of dollars in cost of adding solar panels and other green initiatives. Yet, Seattle’s Climate Pledge Arena is 100-per-cent powered by renewable energy, and the hockey players skate on ice made from rainwater collected from the roof. Further, the naming rights purchased by Amazon, who then named the facility the Climate Pledge Arena, is a marketing bonanza for them and the other sponsors.
This proves that the private sector can finance new arenas that comply with the NHL’s green initiative. So it’s not these costs that are at the root of the problem.
Rather, it’s a question of whether the owners can find suitable partners in the private sector, if municipalities make clear that they will not put money into building these facilities. Local governments may have the land and be willing to split ownership, but they may demand that the venue be built privately.
Requests by team owners for public financing have long been a part of constructing professional sports arenas. How much a city should contribute can drag on for years. In Seattle and Nassau County, N.Y., residents quickly nixed any discussion among elected officials about subsidies, voting overwhelmingly in ballot measures against providing millions of tax dollars for the new arenas.
In those communities, if sports teams wanted new facilities, they would have to find private-sector financing. In Seattle, the vote led to the move of the NBA’s Supersonics to Oklahoma City.
In response, the owners of the two U.S. sites decided to seek privately-funded proposals to build and operate new arenas. Oak View Group – a global sports and entertainment company that bills itself as offering a full slate of venue management and eventprogramming services – won the rights to build and manage both arenas.
OVG manages 15 arenas, convention centres and university sports and entertainment venues.
The company oversees all aspects, from bookings to food and hospitality services, to create a “visitor experience” beyond just watching live sports. Their co-ordinated-management approach promises to boost revenue through media exposure, merchandising and licensing and real estate opportunities.
Consider this diverse set of experiences: In its first full month of operation last November, the Climate Pledge Arena played host to 20 events, including seven concerts featuring such names as Andrea Bocelli and the Eagles, nine NHL hockey games, and four university events. This March, there are 13 events, including two concerts by pop star Billie Eilish.
Meanwhile, the UBS Arena played host to 15 events in December.
Five of those were concerts, including Genesis. There were also assorted college sports, World Wrestling Entertainment and eight hockey games.
This full-service approach stands in stark contrast to the way Calgary manages the Saddledome: In November, it played host to six NHL games, four WHL games, and one lacrosse game.
James Taylor did perform, but that was in September.
OVG’s management style is based on economies of scale, innovation, technology, climate awareness and community partnerships, all of which lead to bigger, higher priced and more frequent events – ultimately resulting in increased ticket sales. OVG also maximizes its global reach by creating multiple bookings for a star act across its arenas.
Any savvy partner knows that the value of a sports team is largely about the local market potential to support a range of arena experiences. Calgary needs to learn that modern venues require a topshelf professional management structure that taps into entertainment trends quickly, and has the connections to book a range of events with repeat showings. A well-managed arena that can attract big-ticket events, beyond hockey games, can make a team more valuable.
For example, OVG paid the final installment on its US$650million NHL expansion fee for the Kraken last April. By December, Forbes magazine estimated the franchise was worth US$875-million. The owners had realized a 35per-cent rise in value before their team had even put skates on the ice, in part because of other events that OVG has been able to draw to the arena.
Forbes estimates the Flames are worth US$680-million, up 42 per cent in one year, a return any investor appreciates. Yet the Edmonton Oilers are estimated to be worth US$1.1-billion based on their revenue potential. The Oilers’ large fan base, which translates into strong ticket sales and television viewership, has helped boost its value. But Edmonton’s Rogers Place, built in 2016, also contributes to that greater revenue potential.
The payoff in a modern arena is in revenue from entertainment bookings, premium seating prices, concessions, merchandising and parking. In Seattle and New York, the managing partners clearly believe future revenue streams are worth the private investment. While Calgary’s population is small compared with Seattle, market size should not turn off Calgary decision-makers from considering a venue management partner. Consider the fact OVG is also building a new 11,500-seat arena for the Kraken’s WHL-affiliate in Palm Springs, and intends to make it profitable by bringing in the same events they are booking into the bigger market venues they operate.
Does the City of Calgary need a new arena in order to support event experiences that would attract an operator like OVG? Current Saddledome events are below the calibre and number other cities’ venues are holding. It’s a strong indicator the facility is lacking in amenities and perhaps management.
A timeout is needed. Elected officials are not experienced in the marketability of sports arenas.
Calgary should follow Seattle and New York’s lead in first, asking the public whether or not they want to subsidize a new arena, and second, seeking – as owners of the land – proposals from partners whose business it is to operate profitable event spaces.
Any responses to that request would establish if a new event centre can sufficiently attract the size and number of events, aside from hockey games, that are needed to make the facility profitable.
In the meantime, the Flames owners need to consider: Do their revenue predictions justify the investment needed to build a new arena, and can they attract investors to operate it successfully? Or are the owners more interested in selling or moving the team, regardless of whether the city or investors build a new arena?
Perhaps all involved should skate to the penalty box and use that time to state their intentions.
Or better yet, let the taxpayers and hockey fans of Calgary decide.

Pandemic drove demand in untethered living: People are increasingly drawn to homes off the grid or in remote parts of B.C., but there are harsh realities that can come with seclusion

Full text: When Pascal Janine bought a lot in a remote abandoned mining town in the B.C. Interior two decades ago, it cost just $300. But it embodied the French immigrant’s favourite qualities of Canada: space, freedom and an expansive wilderness.
He was the only full-time resident in the area at first, with a cabin that had no running water, electricity or gas heating. It was completely off the grid.
“When I bought the place, it was like a no man’s land,” says Mr. Janine, who bakes pastries for a heli-skiing operation for a living.
Today, there are nearly two dozen cabins in the small area of Ferguson, B.C., and a plot of land has skyrocketed in price from a few hundred dollars to as much as $20,000. If you drive up the snowcovered roads to the tiny outpost, it still feels deserted, although striking new wood cabins in the town show much has changed in two decades.
The freedom to do whatever you want is changing as well: With so many people developing homes that are off the grid or in remote parts of the province, local governments are enforcing more permits and building codes to ensure structures are built sustainably. Many of these regulations bother Mr. Janine.
“The more people, the more the [regional government] puts their nose in things,” Mr. Janine says. “That changes the way that we are used to. We have a little less freedom as more people come.”
Real estate agents, local governments and residents across British Columbia say interest in off-the-grid living has exploded during the pandemic, as housing costs rise dramatically and people in urban centres are drawn to the idea of having their own piece of nature.
Wayne Germaine, a broker and owner of Valhalla Path Realty in Nelson, says there has been a huge rise in inquiries about offthe-grid and secluded lots.
“It’s been the busiest two years that I’ve seen In 35 years in real estate,” Mr. Germaine says. “[The pandemic] was kind of a catalyst to get people to do what they’ve been thinking about already, because there’s also a generational change of a lot of younger people moving to smaller areas.”
He says much of the demand is being driven by people from B.C.’s Lower Mainland and other big cities such as Calgary.
But people from cities don’t always realize what they’re getting into, he says.
He constantly gets calls about one beautiful lakefront property across the lake from Nelson, which has a large home, more than 50 acres and a hefty price tag of more than $1-million. But people start to back off when they find out the property is boataccess only, with a seasonal road that would require a lot of maintenance in the winter.
“I get a lot of calls from people that don’t really understand what that type of living involves,” says Mr. Germaine, who adds off-thegrid living entails things such as operating a bulldozer just to clear snow, constantly minding a wood-burning stove and being able to fix things around the house on your own.
Sometimes, he says, it’ll be days before snow clearing crews get to the road outside a lot, meaning you can effectively be trapped for days.
“It’s kind of dreamy to live like that. But it’s work.”
Despite the harsh realities of off-the-grid life, the district governments that preside over them say purchases and developments on the land are skyrocketing.
The Columbia Shuswap Regional District governs a massive swath of land from Salmon Arm to the Alberta border, including Ferguson where Mr. Janine lives.
The district says there were 208 building permits issued in its region with a construction value of around $40-million in 2019. That grew to 352 building permits issued in 2020, and then 546 permits with a construction value of more than $78-million in 2021.
“There’s a lot of people that either already owned a place here, but it was kind of a recreational residence, or they visited here and decided because of what’s happening with the pandemic to make it a more permanent place to live,” says Gerald Christie, manager of development services for the district.
He said much of the undeveloped land is owned by individuals who have held the title for decades. But many are selling to new owners because of the exponential growth in price.
“The level of construction that we’re seeing out in our rural areas is absolutely unprecedented.”
Districts are worried about uncontrolled ‘rural sprawl,’ says Mr. Christie, as well as making sure they are working toward building long-term sustainable communities.
There is also the question of emergency services, especially when wildfires and flooding are becoming increasingly common with climate change.
“Those hazards themselves can be the defining factor as to whether or not additional growth can occur in a particular area,” Mr. Christie says.
He points to one area in the district called Swansea Point, where a nearby body of water can create debris flows, similar to a mudslide – causing extensive damage and cutting off communities.
People who already live in these areas often accept the risk that the environment poses, such as Mr. Janine, who jokes that he wouldn’t make it to hospital if he had a serious medical emergency, since it would take an ambulance an hour to reach him, and then another hour to reach a medical facility.
Despite the reasons for more regulation, people like Katrina Kloppenburg, a long-time resident of Rossland, B.C., worry the rules create barriers for less wealthy people to be able to live off-the-grid.
Ms. Kloppenburg says she’s wanted to live in her own secluded lot since she first moved to the B.C. Interior town 10 years ago.
Her plan was to first live in a trailer on a lot, while slowly building the home of her dreams.
She looked into buying a lot, but was dismayed first when she saw the increasing prices, and again when a real estate agent told her she wasn’t allowed to live in a trailer on the lot because of local regulations. “I think off-thegrid is becoming something only rich people can do, because even if you have money to buy land, you can’t really live on it unless you have money to like build a house to code on top of that,” says Ms. Kloppenburg.
Back in Ferguson, Mr. Janine says he believes it is still possible to make off-the-grid life work, even on a budget, but it is definitely becoming more difficult. Some people are getting creative by building on land that is so hard to access that inspectors don’t bother checking in, he says.
There are some silver linings for him when others move to the area, he says.
When city folk first move in, they’ll occasionally pay him to help them gather wood, gravel or other supplies. Sometimes he’ll sell them pastries or serve dinner, since the nearest restaurant is 60 kilometres of rough driving away.
But one of the best things is the dump.
“The stuff that we find at the refuse station is of way better quality,” says Mr. Janine.
“I go to the dump every Sunday, not because I have refuse, but because that is when the city folks get rid of what we locals call treasures.”

Full text: New York-based columnist for The Globe and Mail Like thousands of parents, the guy with the famous hockey name is doing what he loves the most this time of year – coaching kids on the ice.
But Ryan Sittler is doing it in a place that might give some Original Six purists the willies – an arena ringed by palm trees, bathed in tropical sunshine and a stone’s throw from the beach.
And he’s busier than ever. As director of youth hockey for the Palm Beach Breakers program in West Palm Beach, Mr. Sittler is at the centre of a hockey boom in South Florida that is the product of a unique alignment of factors, including side effects of the pandemic.
“Hockey is exploding here,” Mr. Sittler said, showing off the pro-quality features of the Palm Beach Ice Works arena where his 175-player program is based – the gym, the warmup rooms, the cushy seats with cup holders and, some say, the best popcorn around.
One factor filling up programs from Miami to Palm Beach is the success of the Florida Panthers this year. As Tampa experienced with the Lightning, the Panthers have learned that there’s nothing like a winning team to please the faithful and attract curious newcomers to their palm tree-studded arena on the edge of the Everglades in Sunrise. The Panthers’ homegame attendance, once fairly sparse, has been at or near capacity this season.
But there is a more fundamental structural demographic shift driving the growth – northerners are migrating in droves to Southern states such as Florida to take up permanent residence, and they are taking their love of hockey with them.
“The growth in Florida hockey has been tremendous,” said Mimi Sellian, travel director for the Palm Beach Hawks. It’s an organization serving 500 kids on 11 travel teams, in a recreational league, and through learn-to-skate and learn-to-play programs at the Palm Beach SkateZone arena in Lake Worth, Fla. “Every day now there’s hockey around.”
Ms. Sellian said she gets “a constant and steady flow of calls and e-mails” from northern families looking to relocate to Florida and curious about programs for their hockey-playing children.
The reasons for the flight south are many. Remote work driven by the pandemic means many people can work from anywhere, and more are choosing warm climates. The low-tax, business-friendly environment of Florida has attracted northern businesses, including big companies such as New York-based Goldman Sachs, which has plans to open offices in West Palm Beach.
And Florida’s open policies on COVID-19 precautions, including banning vaccine and mask mandates, has drawn many from more-restrictive states, including those who got a taste of Florida hockey when their rinks at home were closed.
“They’re calling this part of Florida the Wall Street of the South, and as people move down here, there’s definitely been a greater interest in hockey,” Mr. Sittler said, adding that he gets regular calls from families in New York and Connecticut looking to relocate and asking for information on the program he has overseen for nine years.
Debbie Freitas, who manages the Hawks program with her husband, Carlos, said the organization is working with several local real estate agents who are using the youth hockey leagues as enticements to northern buyers.
“Realtors want to work with us – they are looking for a way to sell hockey as a part of their relocation packages,” Ms. Freitas said, adding that she has had inquiries from Montreal families as well as those in the U.S. northeast. “It’s unusual.”
Her husband, a Toronto transplant who has been involved in Florida youth hockey for three decades, said the quality of the youth programs in Florida is a key consideration for hockey families looking to relocate.
“It’s a priority, no question about it,” Mr. Freitas said. “A big part of our job is educating people who don’t know what Florida hockey is. It’s well-developed and growing.”
The influx of young hockey-playing northerners is making it even better, he said, as kids with higher skill levels integrate into local programs. Higher-calibre hockey is also attracting high-level coaches.
“They see the potential of what’s going on down here,” Mr. Freitas said. “That’s very good for us.”
Mr. Sittler agrees. And he knows something about pro-level instruction. A firstround draft pick with the Philadelphia Flyers in 1992, the London, Ont., native played in the AHL and ECHL. He is the son of Toronto Maple Leaf great and Hockey Hall of Famer, Darryl, and brother of Team USA forward, Meaghan. Two of his sons, Luke and Bradyn, played in the Breakers program.
But there’s a downside to the boom as well: capacity. Mr. Sittler said his biggest limit to growth is that he has only one sheet of ice to use for his nine travel teams.
Mr. Freitas can relate. “We have three sheets of ice. Most days, I could use four.”
Despite the pinch, both agree it is a good problem to have – and a good omen for the future of tropical hockey.

Full text: How tough was it for TV series and films to rent production studios in Toronto last summer? It was a fullon space race. Fifty-one projects were under way concurrently in Ontario – the most the province had ever played host to at one time – and the majority of those were in the Greater Toronto Hamilton Area (GTHA).
Forget about finding an established, purpose-built sound stage – those were booked up by the likes of Netflix, HBO and Apple, for series including The Umbrella Academy, Station Eleven and See. Instead, many productions were renting raw warehouse spaces – even on airport flightpaths – and spending extra money retrofitting offices and sound walls. (Hearing a plane roar overhead ruins a movie take.)
The aptly named Disney+ series The Hot Zone and other productions rented space in convention centres in Etobicoke and Mississauga, even though those centres were also COVID testing and vaccination sites. One shoot rented a building literally at Pearson Airport (although they weren’t recording audio). The CBS series Good Sam retrofitted a warehouse in Oakville, Ont., which is outside the GTHA zone for film unions, and then negotiated with the unions to make an exception. But the craziest space used as a stage was a warehouse in Brampton, Ont., with a glass roof – not exactly conducive to the hypercontrolled filming environment.
Welcome to today’s Toronto, Studio City Extraordinaire. Five years ago, Ontario had 2.1 million square feet of stage space (square feet is the industry standard measurement), and any production that wanted to shoot here could find a venue. Today, the province has 3.7 million square feet, and everyone has a tale about a production that was squeezed out and had to decamp to Atlanta, New Orleans, Los Angeles or New York – the North American production hubs most frequently compared with Toronto.
Yet, Toronto is far from finished growing – it’s racing to add more space. Pinewood Toronto Studios already boasts 250,000 square feet just southeast of downtown, including North America’s largest purpose-built sound stage; this year, it will add another 225,000. In 2023, TriBro Studios will add 270,000 square feet in Pickering, Ont., and Studio Bottega will add half a million square feet in Mississauga. Even Sudbury is hot: In 2023, the Freshwater Production Studios will open 116,000 square feet for productions seeking a northern feel.
This past November, the City of Toronto partnered with Hackman Capital (a Los Angelesbased real estate investor) on the Basin Media Hub, a $250-million, 8.9-acre complex in the Port Lands district with half a million square feet of studio space and offices; and the Downsview Park Studios, which will be a whopping million square feet. Both are scheduled to open in 2024. Add everything up and you get 2.6 million new square feet, a 70-percent increase over today.
Also in November, the U.S.
company TPG Real Estate Partners bought Cinespace – which has 23 production stages spread across Toronto and 33 more in Chicago – for a reported US$1.1billion; it plans to expand in both cities.
Cinespace is the granddaddy of Toronto’s studio scene. In 1988, the late Nick Mirkopoulos converted an old steel mill on Eastern Avenue into the then-largest studio in Canada. The Canadian dollar was worth 68 U.S. cents, and productions flocked north.
That created a flywheel effect: Productions needed local crews, so people got on-the-job training; as their skills grew, more productions sought them out.
Local suppliers continually upgraded their equipment, and directors such as Guillermo del Toro and Peter Berg came to play with the new toys – the technocranes, the Russian arms, the highest high-end cameras.
“Now every department is strong in Toronto,” Eoin Egan, Cinespace’s co-managing partner and COO, said in an interview.
“Special effects, carpentry, hair, makeup. Our set designers, unbelievable. A few years ago, you wouldn’t see Toronto crews being recognized at the Emmys and the Oscars. Now we have The Handmaid’s Tale and The Shape of Water. Del Toro is from Mexico, he lives in L.A., but he shoots in Toronto every year. For Nightmare Alley, all the departments will do Oscar campaigns. You know what you’re getting when you come to Toronto.”
“Five, six years ago, productions would hire local crews, but they’d bring their department heads – the lead costumer, the director of photography – in from the U.S.,” Toronto producer Chris Hatcher says. “Now, a director will say, ‘My colleague just worked with,’ and name a local department head. ‘Are they available?’ Same with actors – a production might bring in 10 actors, but the rest of the cast is filled out locally.”
Then the streaming services arrived, with viewers who demand constant content because they inhale entire series in threeday bursts, and that took Toronto from booming to beyond.
In 2019, the Ontario film and TV industry was host to 340 projects, poured a record-breaking $2.16-billion into the province’s economy, and created 44,540 jobs, many of them union and blue-collar. (Even in the pandemic-hushed 2020, the industry brought in $1.5-billion. The 2021 figures are still being tallied.) Atlanta rakes in about US$4-billion annually, and Ontario is on track to catch up. Productions also spread around money like it’s butter – Uber drivers, florists, restaurants, stores, hotels and home rentals all benefit.
“We love shooting in Toronto,” Amy Reinhard, vice-president of studio operations for Netflix, says. “We just opened an office there. Our talent wants to go there. You can shoot a wide range of budgets, with expert creatives at every level. You have robust urban and rural locations.
There are animation services, postproduction services, an incredible amount of talent and creativity.”
And don’t forget: Canadian networks still shoot here, too. According to Justin Cutler, the Ontario Film Commissioner, 50 per cent of production in the province remains domestic, what he calls “Ontario-owned IP,” or intellectual property.
“Filmed entertainment is an ecosystem,” Jacob Muller, managing director at TPG Real Estate, says. “You can’t just pick a place and make a TV show. You need 700 to 1,000 trained people.
You need crew bases that take years to build up. You need drivers, accountants, caterers. Plus, TV series shoot for five months at a time, year after year, so you need a city where actors want to live long-term. There aren’t a lot of those ecosystems in the world, and very few are as established as Toronto.”
The lower Canadian dollar (compared with U.S. currency) doesn’t hurt. Nor do Ontario’s tax incentives. Non-Canadian productions get a 21.5-per-cent break provincially and 12.5 per cent federally on eligible labour and spend. That gives Toronto an edge over other Canadian cities, and helps explain why its production surpassed Vancouver’s in the past seven years.
“Montreal has that European feel,” Egan says. “But Toronto can double for anywhere. Slumberland [Netflix] shot here; that was meant to be PEI. Combat Hospital [ABC/Global] shot here, standing in for Kandahar.”
Sensing the Toronto boom – if not outright creating it – Netflix struck a deal early to rent eight stages at Pinewood and Cinespace on an ongoing basis. That’s not the norm – most productions can’t afford to rent space they’re not actively using just to reserve it. But Netflix filled those stages and more with one production after another, as many as nine at a time: Sex/Life, Ginny & Georgia, Locke & Key, Cabinet of Curiosities.
“We knew competition was coming and we wanted to make sure we had resources available,” Reinhard says.
Similarly, CBS struck a longterm rental agreement with a studio in Mississauga.
And in 2015, when he was looking for space to shoot the ABC Family series Shadowhunters, Hatcher partnered with the owners of a former wood-pallet factory on Dixie Road and converted its 250,000 square feet into Dixie Studios.
“Once I helped the owners understand the film industry – that it’s a series of short-term projects that add up to long-term use – it was such a benefit to always have the space,” Hatcher says. “I’ve been able to roll one project into the next,” from Kiefer Sutherland’s Designated Survivor to the forthcoming Netflix series Painkillers. “In six years, I haven’t had one month of downtime.”
Toronto real estate agent Alan Potts, who specializes in finding warehouse spaces for productions – his clients have included The Boys, Good Witch, Clarice and Nurses – wishes more warehouse owners understood that. “In the industrial market, a short-term lease, even a continuous series of short-term leases, reads on their balance sheets like unrented space,” he says. He works regularly with four warehouse owners who are willing to chance it, and he’s always on the hunt for more.
Five years ago, a decent converted warehouse rented for about $9.50 per square foot a month, plus utilities. “Now it’s $20 per square foot,” Potts says.
“Rates have doubled.”
Purpose-built stages can rent as high as $46 a square foot.
That’s why companies such as William F. White are pivoting to studio ownership. For 50 years, White rented film equipment to productions across Canada. In 2018, its main competitor, Sim, started leasing warehouses in Vancouver and upgrading them to studios – and stipulating that if you used their space, you had to use their equipment.
So when a U.S. company, Sunbelt Rentals, bought White in 2019, the company’s goal became, “take on as much converted space as possible,” Alex Godfrey, vice-president of studios for White, says.
In just two years – during a pandemic – the company jumped from 177,000 square feet to 1.4 million, with more than half in Toronto. (White continues to provide services and equipment, and two of its stages feature state-of-the-art wraparound LED screens, for special effects.)
So is there a downside to all this production? Can Toronto overbuild? A strike could stop the industry in its tracks. The governments could change their tax-credit policies. The dollar could go through the roof. Continued lockdowns could impede cross-border travel. Might we end up with wind whistling through empty stages?
Nah, says everyone.
“We have a long way to go before supply will meet demand, for studio space, equipment or labour,” Hatcher says. “Toronto needs more of all of it.”
Perhaps some of the converted spaces, the ones with lower ceilings situated on flight paths, won’t always be full, but spaces with great sound and 30-foot ceilings will be fine.
“TPG invested in Cinespace because they aren’t tied to GDP or economic cycles,” Avi Banyasz, partner and co-head of TPG Real Estate, says. “People are going to watch content regardless of GDP.”
Already, Toronto 2022 is heating up. “Right now, we do have space available for spring and summer,” Cutler says. “But it’s low.”

Proposal to move Amsterdam’s red-light districts stirs debate: Mayor leads drive to bring in more upscale attractions, while sex-trade workers decry idea of relocating to industrial parts of town

Full text: Down tiny cobbled laneways, men of all shapes and sizes, ages and dress, peer into red-lit windows. Behind the glass, women in lingerie – or less – beckon would-be clients with seductive hand gestures and blown kisses.
It is midday on a Saturday. The pungent smell of marijuana hangs in the air. A door opens and a young man ducks inside. The curtain quickly zips shut.
This is a classic scene in De Wallen, the largest and most popular of Amsterdam’s three redlight districts. Millions of tourists come here each year to gawk at the out-in-the-open sexuality, and the glowing bulbs have become as synonymous with Amsterdam as bicycles, canals and van Gogh. But they may soon be turned off for good.
The city, overwhelmed with drunkenness, noise and other anti-social behaviours in or around its red-light districts, wants to relocate hundreds of sex workers to a yet-to-be-built “erotic centre.”
Taking their place in these innercity buildings – now worth millions of euros – would be hip art galleries, plus fashion and design shops. It’s all part of a plan to improve Amsterdam’s image and tourist demographic.
The idea is spearheaded by Mayor Femke Halsema, who, since her June, 2018, election, has introduced a raft of measures, such as bans on alcohol and guided tours in De Wallen, meant to clean up the area while weighing competing interests.
“We aim to reduce the dominance of cheap nightlife and make the city a better balance for visitors and locals,” her spokesperson, Marloe Boon, said.
Like other popular European destinations struggling with overtourism, Amsterdam – a relatively small city of about one million residents – is a victim of its own success.
In 2019, it had almost 22 million unique annual visitors, according to statistics provided by amsterdam&partners, which oversees marketing and tourism.
(The pandemic provided some relief: Visitor numbers dropped to a little more than eight million in 2020, and similar figures are expected for 2021 and this year.)
As Amsterdam grapples with globalization and gentrification, accelerated by the advent of lowcost flights and cheap accommodation websites such as Airbnb, city officials see it as necessary to remove one of its major drawing cards: the red-light district.
In 2000, the Netherlands was the first country in the world to legalize prostitution. The country’s open policies toward sex work, combined with its progressive approach toward soft drugs – use by persons 18 or older is not a criminal offence – helped earn Amsterdam a reputation as an “anything goes” entertainment hub, a kind of theme park for adult fun and transgression.
City officials said tourists head to De Wallen, situated in one of the oldest parts of the port city, if not to use its services, then just to experience the atmosphere.
“It is unique, it is understandable why people go there, but it was not meant to be a party place, or an attraction,” said Geerte Udo, chief executive officer of amsterdam&partners.
Official tourism campaigns focus on Amsterdam’s high-end and diverse cultural offerings, whether they be architecture, green-living options or museums. When it comes to visitors, the city prefers a quality over quantity approach. “We don’t want sleaze consumerism,” Ms. Udo said. “We want visitors to appreciate all of Amsterdam, not just one small part of it.”
Some of the red-light district’s sex workers see that as wishful thinking. “If they get rid of us, the tourists won’t come,” said one woman with waist-length blond hair. (The Globe has agreed not to use the sex workers’ names.)
“I could write 10 books about Amsterdam’s red-light district – I’ve worked here more than 20 years. I don’t think we’re going anywhere,” she added as her chihuahua, wearing a pink sweater, did its business.
It’s not clear how large the sex industry in Amsterdam actually is, and estimates of the number of sex workers vary. Advocates paint a moderate picture of 500 selfemployed business women, while Christian activists claim there are as many as 8,000 women who are being exploited.
Sex workers’ safety is one reason behind the erotic centre, the mayor says.
“The aim is to improve the position of sex workers, combat illicit activity and reduce the nuisance caused by large crowds in the red-light district,” Ms. Boon said regarding the proposed erotic centre.
But a previous attempt to clean up De Wallen using a similar approach failed. In 2007, Amsterdam launched Project 1012, named after the area’s postal code. The public-private partnership bought a number of multimillion-euro properties where sex work was conducted, in what the city called an effort to tackle human trafficking and crack down on associated crime. But according to Dutch news media and several reports a decade later, the scheme failed, partly because of the 2007 global financial crisis reducing the city’s finances.
A woman who identified herself as Iris, and who acts as the coordinator of Amsterdam’s Prostitution Information Centre, said sex workers are regularly typecast as victims, or as vulnerable to violence and trafficking.
“But there is safety in being in the city,” she said. “It’s close to where people live. Not in some industrial zone where the council wants to move them to.”
In November, 2020, Ms. Halsema suggested eight possible locations for the erotic centre, but where it will end up remains to be decided. All of the proposals call for it to be in or near an industrial zone to the north or south of the city. And that, some sex workers say, is the real heart of the matter.
“All this is about property and inner-city real estate,” said Brenda, a former nurse who is now a sex worker for clients with physical or psychological conditions.
Housing costs in the Netherlands have risen well above the European average over the past decade, according to Eurostat, the EU’s statistics agency. Buying residential property in 2021 costs 40 per cent more than it did in 2010, and renting was up more than 30 per cent in the same time period.
The central location of de Wallen, with its 700 years of history and architecture, makes for highly desirable property, well above the Amsterdam’s average price.
Brenda said locals can no longer afford to live in their own city.
“You need to be a millionaire to live here now – and when the new residents complain, the officials listen,” she said. “Last decade, they wanted to shut the windows because we were victims of violence. Now it’s because sex workers are blamed for bringing the nuisance and bad behaviour.”
Ilse van Liempt, a professor at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, has written about the changes to Amsterdam’s red-light districts. Her fear is that the city is trying to erase its history and overlook sex workers’ hardfought political struggles.
“The city wants to upgrade its image under the umbrella of diversity, of making it a more family-friendly place,” she said. “They want to move it away from a masculine space, while at the same time exclude its working class or sex workers from the area.”
But, some sex workers argue, the red-light district is essential to Amsterdam’s true identity.
“Amsterdam is known for its sex, drugs and rock and roll,” Brenda said.
“Why change that?”

Full text: 252 Queen St. E.
ST. MARYS, ONT.
Asking Price: $1.35-million Taxes: $8,188.74 (2021) Lot Size: 97.22 feet by 150 feet Listing Agents: Paul Maranger and Christian Vermast, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada THE BACKSTORY For more than 100 years the house at 252 Queen St. E. in St. Marys wasn’t just a family home, it was also the home base of the publishing family that would run the local newspaper until just before the turn of the millennium.
“It’s been the Eedy house for 120 years,” owner Richard Lorne Eedy said. “I feel it’s time for somebody else.”
Family patriarch John Wolfe Eedy moved to town in the late 1800s to buy the St. Marys Journal, later merged into the Journal Argus community newspaper. J.W.
Eedy Publications Ltd. would expand their small-town news empire throughout the 20th century until Richard Lorne, the fourth-generation publisher, exited the business with the 1999 sale of 10 local newspapers to a subsidiary of Torstar.
At the time of sale the company had newspapers in such small Ontario towns as Exeter, Walkerton, Wingham, Fergus, Listowel and Mount Forest. “We had a really nice little business on the go. The problem was while we were interested in buying more, we were priced out of the market,” Mr. Eedy said. “I thought maybe it’s time to be a seller rather than a buyer. … I did very well at the time.”
Unfortunately, several of the family’s newspapers have since ceased operations, including the St. Marys Journal Argus, which was closed in 2017 after a controversial business arrangement whereby Postmedia and Torstar swapped 37 local news publications for no financial considerations and then shut most of them down.
“It was sad, we took a huge pride that people liked the newspaper. … My mom wrote a cooking column forever,” Mr. Eedy said. Local residents would ask what was to become of things such as wedding pictures and other documents connected with the newspaper’s history, and as it happened Mr. Eedy had a trove of documents in his possession, which he donated to the local museum.
St. Marys – and no, there is no apostrophe – is a small town of about 7,000 people located between the larger nearby communities of London and Stratford. It gained the nickname “Stone Town” because of local deposits of limestone that were quarried for dozens of homes in the town, including the Eedy house. Recently, there’s been signs of newcomers to the community, and heightened interest in stately heritage homes.
“With the pandemic, and people working from home – and that we just added GO train service – it’s really drawing a lot of people here,” said Nancy Eedy, Lorne’s wife.
THE HOUSE TODAY The house sits on a corner lot on Queen Street, the town’s main road, just past the historic limestone water tower (which looks positively medieval) on the way to the downtown high street.
The Queen Street side of the house is lined with a stone wall topped with a wrought-iron fence, beyond which a formal entryway with arched windows and elaborate woodwork stands next to a veranda with intricate gingerbread trim. But don’t be surprised if no one answers a knock on that door. “Nobody comes in any more through the front,” Mr. Eedy said. “I never shovel it.
As kids, we walked through the garage [around back] to get into the house. When Nancy came into my life she said, ‘I won’t live in this house with people walking through the garage.’ “From the back of the lot there’s a driveway that curves into the property and the two-car garage (which connects to the house). There are walkways on both sides, one to the backyard pool deck, the other to the entryway Nancy wanted.
The rear entrance opens into a mud– room, part of the addition Mr. Eedy added 20 years ago. A flagstone pathway outside turns into flagstone flooring inside, and there are lots of hooks and cabinets for storage in this L-shaped room that connects to the garage and to the breakfast room in the new kitchen.
Another door opens into the oldest part of the building. This first structure was built in 1849 by lumberman John Sanderson, one of the early St. Marys colonial arrivals. There have been several additions over the years, the first in 1869 when the two-storey limestone main house was built. The single-storey stone wing has a utility room off the mudroom, and also a tiled laundry room and a three-piece bath (the tub here is the same one Mr. Eedy used as a child).
Just beyond this is a formal dining room, with a door to the side veranda and the first sign of the cherry strip hardwood flooring found in much of the rest of the original house. To the right is a doorway to the new kitchen (past a butler’s pantry tucked between the original exterior limestone wall and the new construction) and straight ahead is a family room, but might as well really be called the showcase (more on that later). There’s a beautiful Victorian fireplace with wooden mantle and antique tile inlay on the firebox in this room. Behind this space is Mr. Eedy’s office filled with more windows and a wall of audiovisual equipment.
Stepping further into the house finds the front hall and foyer (connected to that little-used front entryway) with wooden staircase that curves upstairs. A stainedglass transom window above the door at the end of the hall leads in to the kitchen, on the left is a second formal living room with another Victorian fireplace and a baby-grand piano that’s also available to come with the house.
The kitchen is where Mr. Eedy really put his stamp. The footprint of the original kitchen is still there, now with a central island across from a bank of cabinets on the wall facing the pool deck. The counter is a dark stone quartzite with a leathered texture, with induction range, stove, double sink and fridge sharing the wall.
A short step up into the breakfast room is like a totally different type of grandness: the ceiling vaults up two storeys and castiron grates line the railings of the upstairs loft. Sun pours in through two columns of windows that fill the outside corner walls, they rise to the second floor and are topped by arched stained-glass rescued from a church demolition.
Original stone and block walls from the old exterior are also preserved in this room, which has a walkout to the pool. The 10foot deep pool was installed by Mr. Eedy’s mother, but the cedar pool house and sauna was all him.
Upstairs, the original house has three bedrooms and the new loft formed by the kitchen addition. The first, opposite the stairs, is more office than sleeping quarters with a wall of built-ins cabinets complete with closet and desk. Next to that is the primary bedroom, with three windows facing Queen Street and the side yard, and a wall of closets. The last also faces Queen Street and is the smallest but does have the door to the small balcony above the formal entrance.
There’s no ensuite bathroom in the primary bedroom, but stepping down into the loft are two spaces that try to make up for that. The first is the three-piece bath with glass-walled shower and vanity, and the second is a dressing room with sink and makeup table just next to the bathroom.
The rest of the loft is huge, L-shaped around that opening to the breakfast room below, with no fewer than four skylights.
The original limestone exterior wall is preserved, and this space is carpeted except for a tiled area set up as a workout and yoga station. Tucked away in the corner is a space made for kids: a raised platform with soft-pile carpet that ramps up toward a triangular window. Mr. Eedy said this was made to be a retreat for the readers among the children.
FAVOURITE SPACE Mr. Eedy is a collector. “I collected marbles at six years old, then it was army shoulder bands, for the last 20 years I’ve been on to the toys,” he said. At a certain point, the collecting may have gotten out of hand, to the point where he’d filled his basement with curios. “It was a sickness,” he quips.
He believes that at one time he had one of the largest collections of tin lithograph (or stamped metal) ray guns from the 1930s, 40s and 50s, and part of getting the house for sale meant de-cluttering some of this collection, and he shipped more than a dozen boxes to specialty toy auctions.
These days, his specific interest is in Star Wars toys made between 1977 and 1985 by Ohio-based Kenner and distributed by Irwin toys in Toronto, and he’s particularly keen on those marked with the Frenchlanguage translation “Guerre des Etoiles” (GDE). The first-floor family room is a shrine to part of his collection featuring figurines, vehicles and games based on the original space opera trilogy. Children of the eighties will recognize some of the items they drooled over at the toy store (or the toy section of departed retailers like Zellers) though these days some of the items sell for thousands of dollars at auction.
The couple owns a smaller house in Quebec, and is hoping to come out of the pandemic into more travel, so if you’re a collector looking to acquire a heritage home and heritage toys, it might be the right time to make Mr. Eedy an offer he can’t refuse. “It’s time we let go of the collection,” he said.

Full text: Imagine the views you might get from a 48-storey apartment building on the north side of Brampton, Ont. You might be able to see the lake from up there, and there’d certainly be nothing to obstruct your view.
A proposal by Solmar Development Corp. to build a pair of 48-storey towers in Brampton at 199 Main St. to be called Bristol Place is still awaiting approval from the city’s planning department, but it’s probable that soon these will be among the first high-rise towers to spring up in the city northwest of Toronto better known for sprawl and basement apartments.
Brampton, among Canada’s fastestgrowing cities, already has at least two other projects offering preconstruction contracts for apartments in 40-storey towers.
The pace of development in the city is growing so fast that even those in the industry are astonished.
“We don’t want to say it’s the tallest in Brampton – things can change,” said Kassaundra Dobson, of the 40-storey Stella condominium tower (Hurontario Street and Steeles Avenue West) over which she managed preconstruction sales starting in October of last year. Ms. Dobson is vicepresident of operations and broker of record for Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Advisory Realty and found strong interest from locals looking for affordable homes. The project will sit right on the future Hurontario LRT line, which will run from Port Credit in Mississauga to downtown Brampton, with an expected opening in 2024.
“There’s a low-rise area to the south of us; prices there are getting into milliondollar homes,” she said. “We saw a large amount of local population buying [in Stella] as an investment for themselves, or more for the future for their children.”
Jason Pantalone, president and managing partner of National Homes, is looking at the same group of buyers as his company prepares to start selling the 40-storey Phase 2 of its Duo Condos project (near the Stella, at Malta Avenue and Steeles Avenue West).
“When I look at across the GTA, we feel Brampton has the best value for product across all GTA markets,” he said. By comparison, he said, a new unit at Yonge and Bloor in Toronto might cost $2,000 a square foot, and $1,500 at Yonge and Eglinton. He expects Duo will sell for somewhere under $1,000 a square foot, since average prices in Brampton hit the $850 a square foot mark a year ago. “There’s projects in Mississauga selling at $1,200 a square foot,” he said, numbers that even five years ago would have seemed pitched above most buyers’ heads.
Since 1992, National has built more than 1,850 homes in Brampton, but until about eight years ago, when a new generation took over the family business, they had mainly been building townhomes and mid-rise retirement facilities.
The company has a corporate goal of being 50-per-cent high-rise on urban infill sites and 50 per cent on low-rise buildings, but land prices are making that low-rise goal increasingly difficult. “It’s been challenging to find low-rise land where we can develop over 200 units, and typically it’s around 100 units,” he said, adding that in recent years the prices for even lower-cost ground housing such as townhomes became unaffordable for most buyers. By contrast, even though an urban infill highrise site requires much more capital and expertise to build on time and on budget, it’s becoming the safer route even in oncesprawl-friendly 905 communities. “We really feel like there’s less opportunity and more risk” in greenfield land, Mr. Pantalone said.
The trend of building higher-density and taller buildings in the 905 has been accelerating in recent years.
“There are a number of projects at 50 storeys-plus in Mississauga city centre that sold extremely well by offering small units, lots of building amenities, good design and targeting investors,” said Shaun Hildebrand, president of real estate analytics firm Urbanation Inc. For these buyers, price matters more than building scale.
“Buyers and investors are scouring the market for good value at this point.”
Between 2016 and 2021, more than 78,000 condominium apartments were built in the City of Toronto, according to Urbanation (in addition to almost 11,000 purpose-built rental apartments). The building market in the area around Toronto, known as the 905 region, has also exploded. Ten years ago, less than 15,000 condo apartments were in development in Toronto’s regional neighbours; today, more than 46,124 units are proposed, under construction or soon to be occupied.
In its year-end 2021 Condominium Market Survey, released Tuesday, Urbanation reported that prices for new GTA condos were up 18-per-cent year over year, led by a 23-per-cent growth in the 905 regions where prices hit an average $1,050 a square foot.
Brampton’s 2040 Vision building plan imagines a thicket of towers and 15-minute communities along new transit hubs. But the city could be at risk of duplicating Toronto’s “tall and sprawl” housing landscape; tall towers on transit nodes, with the remainder of the city zoned to allow for little other than single-family housing.
“I think it’s a trap we’re falling into, of suddenly responding to a perceived shortage of housing – which is real – but we have to do it at these hyper-densities in very few locations … as opposed to dispersing it to the hundreds of opportunities on transit,” said Ken Greenberg, author, urban designer, planner and co-founder of the City Building Institute at Ryerson University.
“There is a place for taller buildings,” he said. “What is not a good thing in a lot of municipalities such as Brampton is where you have random tall buildings arriving almost like tent poles that stick up here, there and everywhere, without having context.”
Mr. Greenberg has been working with Brampton (and other cities) on planning that pushes for more of the social infrastructure needed to support a highly dense neighbourhood: schools, daycare and walkable retail … all of which he argues will make for better places to live. “There’s so many places in Brampton along those transportation corridors to spread that density out. One tower in isolation does not a neighbourhood make.”
But according to Ms. Dobson, there can be appeal in being first to plant your flag in a mostly low-density area.
“We see a lot of parallels to what we saw in the [Vaughan Metropolitan Centre],” she said. “Developers are wanting to build legacies. They’d rather build out a community instead of being one amongst many.
They can create these hubs.”

Toronto’s average home price hits record: New figures show city reached new high in January, but growth could slow as Bank of Canada prepares to raise interest rates

Full text: Toronto’s average home price set another record in January, nearing $1.3-million and marking the sharpest monthly price increase since the region’s previous real estate boom in 2017. But the local real estate board expects price growth to slow this year as the Bank of Canada gets set to hike interest rates and raise the cost of borrowing.
Last month’s seasonally adjusted price of $1,290,297 was 7 per cent higher than in December, the biggest monthly jump since the 8-per-cent gain of February, 2017, during the region’s last real estate boom, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board or TRREB.
January’s price is 29 per cent higher than the same month last year when homebuying kicked into a higher gear and started pushing the typical home price in the city of Toronto and its surrounding areas of Durham, York and Peel above $1-million.
The typical home price in Durham, to the east of the city, jumped 45 per cent year-overyear to $1,056,300 in January, according to the board’s adjusted home price index. In York, to the north of the city, the home price index spiked 38 per cent to $1,409,500 and in Peel, which is northwest of the city, the home price index was up 38 per cent to $1,196,500.
Home prices in the suburbs are nearing the same level as prices in the city of Toronto.
(Home price indexes are an industry measure of prices that adjust for higher-priced properties.)
But the real estate board predicts home prices will not continue to rise at the same pace, especially as more buyers are getting priced out of the market.
“There will be a bit of a ceiling on affordability – not only rising prices, but also higher borrowing costs over time,” the board’s chief market analyst Jason Mercer said on a call with reporters.
If interest rates rise, the board said that means some prospective homebuyers will put their purchases on hold. As well, the pool of buyers will likely be smaller because of record resales during the first two years of the pandemic. And homeowners are reluctant to put their homes up for sale because they are nervous they will not be able to find another place to live with prices soaring.
“You can’t buy what’s not available for sale,” Mr. Mercer said. “It is possible we could see month-over-month dips in average selling prices throughout the year,” he added.
TRREB forecast yesterday this year’s average selling price to reach $1,225,000, about 12 per cent higher than last year but lower than January’s level. The board predicts resales of about 110,000 this year, which is 10 per cent lower than in 2021.
In January, new listings fell 16 per cent year-over-year and resales were down 18 per cent over the same period.
According to a poll that looked at buyer intentions, detached houses in the suburbs remain the most popular type of property. The poll, conducted for TRREB by Ipsos, showed that a higher share of would-be buyers plan to focus on condos, which are generally cheaper than houses.
The poll also found that over all, the share of first-time homebuyers will likely decline, which mirrors what has been occurring across the country as homes become more unaffordable.
However, that may be offset by the number of new permanent residents who indicated that they intend to buy and at a higher price point.
As for new listings, the Ipsos poll found that fewer homeowners intend to put their homes up for sale. “There still exists a vicious circle where homeowners will decide not to list because they fear they will not be able to find another home that meets their needs,” said the TRREB-Ipsos report.
The near-zero interest rates, lack of properties for sale and desire to own larger properties has driven most of the resales and prices during the pandemic’s real estate boom.
Although interest rates are expected to increase this year, borrowers have had to prove they can make their mortgage payments at an interest rate of 5.25 per cent under federal rules.
TRREB said this could “mitigate the impact” of higher mortgage rates.

Why it’s time to retire ‘NIMBY’: Some say the term, often used to blame baby boomers for the affordability crisis, has been weaponized to silence legitimate debate

Full text: In the housing world, there might not be as politically charged a term as NIMBY, the acronym for “not in my backyard.”
The term has become the goto for people who advocate for more housing supply as a way to address the affordability crisis, and who believe resident opposition is thwarting the process.
Others believe it sows the seeds of division, a counterproductive attempt to silence one side of a crucial debate. There’s also a concerning air of ageism in the word, an acceptance that it’s okay to blame people of boomer age for the affordability crisis.
“There seems to be a universal scapegoating of baby-boomer homeowners going on, here and elsewhere – scapegoating them for what is clearly a problem of the global financialization of housing,” says Patrick Condon, a professor of urban design at the University of British Columbia.
“This exact same thing is happening everywhere in the world on the same time cycle. This is a worldwide crisis and thus has very little to do with what the grey hairs in our own little Point Grey or Dunbar do or don’t do.”
Arny Wise, urban planner and retired developer, takes issue with wealthy property owners who have formed organizations and successfully shut down projects that might affect their property values.
“NIMBY associations have become the worst kind of complainers,” he said in an e-mail.
“Concerned about safety, density and immigration, with only a selfish, self-interested focus to protect their own property values. Neighbourhood associations have fossilized from their bottom-up progressive liberal ideals of democracy into their new topdown right-wing conservative dogmas, opposing change of any kind, in order to protect what they have.”
A special advisory panel on housing appears to share a similarly negative view, that the NIMBY is self-involved and out of touch. As the panel’s government-funded “Opening Doors” paper puts it, these “white, older, more educated” homeowners had been in their homes for longer and “hold different policy priorities than the general population.”
In the 2021 report, a funding collaboration between the federal government and the province, there is a page devoted to NIMBYism, which says that both renters and homeowners “stand to benefit” from an increased supply of housing. It says the problem is neighbourhood opposition, particularly from homeowners.
The authors of the report give volunteer neighbourhood groups special mention: “There are invariably vocal groups of residents – particularly neighbourhood associations – that can make it politically difficult for local governments to implement such changes.”
UBC graduate student Zakir Jamal Suleman was surprised to see the comments.
Mr. Suleman, 28, grew up in the Commercial Drive neighbourhood and lives there with his parents. He has joined many community groups in the past decade, so he falls into the NIMBY camp.
“I’m not white or older. I don’t own a home. I used to be the vice-president of Grandview Woodland Area Council. So I resent that,” Mr. Suleman says of the report’s categorization.
He says he knows self-interested NIMBYs exist, but he also knows older white people who are desperately trying to find secure housing on limited incomes.
“I think that’s an incredibly prejudiced thing to say.”
And he also took issue with the report where it states: “A growing number of homes available for purchase or rent will reduce the upward pressure on prices and give renters and buyers more options.”
The statement is made without the support of data, he said.
“That’s actually an active debate being stated as fact, and a bit concerning in a government document. It’s concerning it’s being brought up in such a clearly ideological way.”
Mr. Suleman became active in the community when he was a teenager and heard about a development being proposed at a local Safeway site. The transit-oriented proposal for the site at East Broadway and Commercial Drive is for three residential towers, 24 to 29 storeys, above retail, including a bigger Safeway store.
Mr. Suleman wants to stay in the neighbourhood where he’s lived his whole life, but he doesn’t believe he will ever be able to afford to purchase a home. Because he is opposed to the current iteration of the Safeway site development plan, he would be called a NIMBY, he says.
So, too, are the people who care about denser housing types that aren’t towers, or non-market rental rather than market-rate housing, he says.
“Anybody who questions the paradigm of whether we should keep building in order to bring down the cost can get labelled with this. So I’m a young person, I care about my neighbourhood and my community. I see people who are not as able to participate in organizing who are going to get bulldozed by this thing and get moved out of a place they’ve lived their whole life.
“I have two options. I can either engage in the process put forward by the city, or oppose it and be called a NIMBY. And really, what’s being done there is a disregarding of people’s opinions … a way to disregard actually listening to people whose neighbourhoods they want to build in.
“Really, what you are saying when you label somebody a NIMBY is, ‘I am not going to listen to you; I don’t have to listen to you.’ ” Former city-planning director, planning consultant and instructor Larry Beasley says he never uses the word NIMBY and discourages his UBC students from using it.
“I do this for the simple reason that it is a way to discount people’s opinions in a disrespectful way. … The use of the word puts people off before one even begins a discussion.”
One of the most famous examples of Vancouver citizen activism is in the late 1960s, when the residents of Chinatown fought against a freeway, several lanes wide, that was to go through their low-income neighbourhood. They fought long and hard against what was then perceived as progress, and they won.
Shirley Chan’s family lived in Chinatown and she spent many years of her youth petitioning against the project. Ms. Chan wouldn’t call their fight an act of NIMBYism because the plan was to wipe out an entire neighbourhood. She thinks of a NIMBY as someone who would oppose a group home for teens, for example. But she says the term is pejorative, and not useful for broader discussions.
“We don’t work with neighbourhoods to address the sticking points. It’s easy when everybody agrees. When you have conflict, it takes a while for everybody to understand how they might come to an agreement. That’s the problem – the failure of the city processes today to really address differences in perspectives, and differences in impacts and outcomes.”
The Grandview Woodland Area Council (GWAC) formed as a response to the Chinatown freeway fight, says the non-profit group’s president, Craig Ollenberger.
“They stopped a freeway in the sixties. Can you believe that? And the thing is, it was a bunch of NIMBYs who wanted their neighbourhood to stay, fighting the current dogma, and now it’s lauded as maybe the best decision made for the city,” he says.
Mr. Suleman and Mr. Ollenberger are not concerned about the height of the towers planned for the Safeway site. They are more concerned about gentrification and a revised proposal that they feel excludes the community.
“Often the voices that get lost are the folks who don’t have money and racialized groups trying to live there,” Mr. Ollenberger says. “Our neighbourhood, Grandview-Woodland, is historically low income, and those are the people facing the sharpest end of the sword. They don’t need luxury condos built so people can buy investment properties.”
Like Mr. Suleman, he is opposed to the new plan for the tower project because of a lack of public amenities. He understands towers are part of the deal, but it could have become a focal point for the neighbourhood, he says.
Mr. Suleman said he would be on board with a 60-storey tower if it were all non-market, truly affordable rental. He just wants to be fairly heard, and not called names, or conveniently categorized by those who don’t share his views. “If you actually believe in community – and it isn’t a marketing or branding term for your building – then you are going to need to listen.”

Full text: Harry Steele, who used the discipline and tactics of a military commander to become one of Newfoundland’s most prolific entrepreneurs, died in St. John’s on Jan. 28 at the age of 92.
Mr. Steele began his business career after serving more than 20 years as an officer in the Royal Canadian Navy. He retired in 1974 as a lieutenant-commander, and his business colleagues always referred to him as the Commander.
While he was away at sea, his wife, Catherine (née Thornhill), worked on small real estate transactions and managed the Albatross Hotel they owned in Gander, N.L. It was a true partnership.
After his retirement from the navy, Mr. Steele used the small nest egg they had from real estate and stock market profits, to buy the floundering Eastern Provincial Airways from the Crosbie family in 1978.
“Mum was willing to let him put all his chips on the table when he had to,” their son, John Steele, said, referring to the money used to buy the airline. He added his mother kept his father focused during a high-flying business career.
“Even when he had the wind in his sails, she could keep him tethered to reality.”
Eastern Provincial’s advertising campaign called it “The Little Airline That Could.” Mr. Steele expanded its routes from Atlantic Canada to Toronto despite opposition from the existing big carriers, Air Canada and Canadian Airlines. Eventually, he sold EPA to Canadian Airlines for $20-million and joined its board.
That deal provided the basis for the growth of Newfoundland Capital Corp. It held Clarke Transport; Halterm, a company with container operations in the port of Halifax; a trucking company; a firm providing ferry service on the St. Lawrence River; and Oceanex, a shipping company serving ports from Montreal to St. John’s and Halifax. NCC had operations on land, at sea and in the air.
On top of all that, Mr. Steele personally owned Universal Helicopters, hotels in Newfoundland and fishing camps in Newfoundland and Labrador. Friend and business associate Seymour Schulich said Mr. Steele fished for business as much as he did for salmon.
Mr. Steele served on the boards of many Canadian companies, including the Southam newspaper chain, Dundee Bancorp and many others. His family says Mr. Steele’s business success was based on his character, which was the same in business as it was at home.
“He always did what he said he was going to do, whether that was closing a business deal or if he promised to pick you up at the airport,” John said.
Although he started in business relatively late in life, once he started on his quest, he succeeded in a hurry. In fact, Joey Smallwood, the first premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, once said of Mr. Steele, “I never knew anyone to come so far so fast.”
His start was as modest as they get. Harry Remington Steele was born on June 9, 1929, in Musgrave Harbour, an outport on Newfoundland’s Atlantic coast with one of the province’s most beautiful beaches.
This out-of-the-way spot is sought after by tourists today, but when Harry was a child, the village’s remoteness meant that the only way in was by boat. Times were rough in the 1930s, and the community lived on fishing and work in the woods. The school there had two rooms, one upstairs and one downstairs, and taught everything from the first grade to the last year of high school.
When Harry left his hometown, he walked out through the bush that surrounded the village to the railway tracks, which he picked up in the nearby town of Lewisporte. Not only was there no road into his village, there was no direct rail line into Musgrave Harbour either.
His first job outside Musgrave Harbour was digging ditches on the roads in Deer Lake in western Newfoundland. Then Mr. Smallwood came to the rescue. The premier created a scholarship program for aspiring teachers. Mr. Steele seized the opportunity and enrolled in Memorial University. He also joined the University Naval Training Division (a program set up to develop officers for the Royal Canadian Navy). He needed both scholarships to survive. Although he did graduate from the teacher training program, Mr. Steele never did teach school. Instead, he joined the Royal Canadian Navy full time as a junior officer.
He and his wife went to England, where Mr. Steele trained as a communications specialist at a Royal Navy school. He learned about codes and radio frequencies, the foundations of military intelligence. He also learned about secrecy: He never gave details, even to his family, of exactly what he did, except to say: “I read other people’s mail.”
He spent time at sea on a variety of warships: a large cruiser, an aircraft carrier, frigates and other types of vessels. He travelled the world, taking in many sights and different cultures. He saw poverty in West Africa and the opulence of diplomatic life in Washington, D.C., where he worked in naval intelligence.
Mr. Steele’s last posting with the Royal Canadian Navy was as commander of the base at Gander, where he served for 4½ years. Gander was a key NATO base during the Cold War. Among other things, the base there kept an eye on submarine traffic in the North Atlantic and intercepted and deciphered radio messages from the Russian vessels in the nearby ocean.
Around this time, Mr. Steele became fascinated with the stock market, and he began to make investments, pooling knowledge and money with his brother-in-law Roland Thornhill. Mr. Steele was an astute student of markets, a natural. And his wife, Catherine, had a sharp eye for real estate.
She discovered the Albatross Hotel in Gander and, together with Mr. Steele, bought it and made a success of it.
Mr. Steele left the navy in 1974, riled by the amalgamation of Canada’s armed forces, an action that led to the loss of many military traditions. The end of Harry’s military career led to a new chapter in his life.
Mr. Steele began his civilian career working for Eastern Provincial Airways, whose head office was in Gander. However, he worked only briefly at the airline, leaving after a year. His decision to depart seemed a good one since EPA was on the ropes. Shortly after that he had a change of heart about the airline. He learned that the Crosbie family, who owned the company, was looking for a way out. The airline’s stock price was in the basement and the Crosbies wanted to cut their losses. Mr. Steele had been picking up a sizable number of shares since he joined the company, and at this point, he decided that he could turn the airline around. Mr. Steele mortgaged everything he and Catherine had and bought the airline. He was 49 years old.
“EPA Changes Hands … But It’s Still a Newfoundlander” screamed the St. John’s Daily News headline on Nov. 22, 1978, when Harry bought the company.
He ran the airline the same way the former naval commander would run a ship or a military base: keeping operations tight.
He found a way to reduce the fuel burn of EPA’s Boeing 737s by 10 per cent, saving $1.5-million a year.
The company’s other cost-cutting measures were less obvious. One example: Eastern Provincial Airways was the first airline in Canada to become non-smoking.
It was healthier, but it also meant that the ashtrays didn’t need to be cleaned after short hops.
Mr. Steele didn’t like smoking.
“There were a few smokers in the office, but they knew not to smoke at work,” said Veronica Brown, Mr. Steele’s executive assistant for 42 years. “He was always at work before anyone else in the morning. He loved work. Work to him was more like a hobby. He enjoyed salmon fishing, but his mind was always on work.”
Along the way, Mr. Steele invested in newspapers, magazines, and radio stations. In the 1990s, however, there was a total rethink and reorganization of NCC.
Clarke Transport, Halterm, Oceanex and all the related transportation businesses were sold. The newspapers and magazines went too. That left a pure media play, 101 radio stations across Canada. Newcap Radio was sold in 2018.
On April 29, 1992, then governor-general Ray Hnatyshyn invested Harry Steele as an officer of the Order of Canada. In his comments during the ceremony, Mr. Hnatyshyn remarked: “Although he remains modest about his career achievements, this Newfoundlander had a distinguished naval career before becoming one of the leading entrepreneurs in the Maritimes. He is a generous employer and communityminded citizen whose support of various local causes in the areas of education, health care and the arts is well-known.”
Mr. Steele’s many other honours include Memorial University of Newfoundland’s Alumni of the Year Award.
He leaves his wife, Catherine; sons, Peter, Rob and John; seven grandchildren; and two great-children.

Full text: Toronto's average home price set another record in January, nearing $1.3-million and marking the sharpest monthly price increase since the region's previous real estate boom in 2017. But the local real estate board expects price growth to slow this year as the Bank of Canada gets set to hike interest rates and raise the cost of borrowing.
Last month's seasonally adjusted price of $1,290,297 was 7 per cent higher than in December, the biggest monthly jump since the 8-per-cent gain of February, 2017, during the region's last real estate boom, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board or TRREB.
January's price is 29 per cent higher than the same month last year when homebuying kicked into a higher gear and started pushing the typical home price in the city of Toronto and its surrounding areas of Durham, York and Peel above $1-million.
The typical home price in Durham, to the east of the city, jumped 45 per cent year-overyear to $1,056,300 in January, according to the board's adjusted home price index. In York, to the north of the city, the home price index spiked 38 per cent to $1,409,500 and in Peel, which is northwest of the city, the home price index was up 38 per cent to $1,196,500.
Home prices in the suburbs are nearing the same level as prices in the city of Toronto.
(Home price indexes are an industry measure of prices that adjust for higher-priced properties.)
But the real estate board predicts home prices will not continue to rise at the same pace, especially as more buyers are getting priced out of the market.
"There will be a bit of a ceiling on affordability - not only rising prices, but also higher borrowing costs over time," the board's chief market analyst Jason Mercer said on a call with reporters.
If interest rates rise, the board said that means some prospective homebuyers will put their purchases on hold. As well, the pool of buyers will likely be smaller because of record resales during the first two years of the pandemic. And homeowners are reluctant to put their homes up for sale because they are nervous they will not be able to find another place to live with prices soaring.
"You can't buy what's not available for sale," Mr. Mercer said. "It is possible we could see month-over-month dips in average selling prices throughout the year," he added.
TRREB forecast yesterday this year's average selling price to reach $1,225,000, about 12 per cent higher than last year but lower than January's level. The board predicts resales of about 110,000 this year, which is 10 per cent lower than in 2021.
In January, new listings fell 16 per cent year-over-year and resales were down 18 per cent over the same period.
According to a poll that looked at buyer intentions, detached houses in the suburbs remain the most popular type of property. The poll, conducted for TRREB by Ipsos, showed that a higher share of would-be buyers plan to focus on condos, which are generally cheaper than houses.
The poll also found that over all, the share of first-time homebuyers will likely decline, which mirrors what has been occurring across the country as homes become more unaffordable.
However, that may be offset by the number of new permanent residents who indicated that they intend to buy and at a higher price point.
As for new listings, the Ipsos poll found that fewer homeowners intend to put their homes up for sale. "There still exists a vicious circle where homeowners will decide not to list because they fear they will not be able to find another home that meets their needs," said the TRREB-Ipsos report.
The near-zero interest rates, lack of properties for sale and desire to own larger properties has driven most of the resales and prices during the pandemic's real estate boom.
Although interest rates are expected to increase this year, borrowers have had to prove they can make their mortgage payments at an interest rate of 5.25 per cent under federal rules.
TRREB said this could "mitigate the impact" of higher mortgage rates.

Full text: Imagine the views you might get from a 48-storey apartment building on the north side of Brampton, Ont. You might be able to see the lake from up there, and there'd certainly be nothing to obstruct your view.
A proposal by Solmar Development Corp. to build a pair of 48-storey towers in Brampton at 199 Main St. to be called Bristol Place is still awaiting approval from the city's planning department, but it's probable that soon these will be among the first high-rise towers to spring up in the city northwest of Toronto better known for sprawl and basement apartments.
Brampton, among Canada's fastestgrowing cities, already has at least two other projects offering preconstruction contracts for apartments in 40-storey towers.
The pace of development in the city is growing so fast that even those in the industry are astonished.
"We don't want to say it's the tallest in Brampton - things can change," said Kassaundra Dobson, of the 40-storey Stella condominium tower (Hurontario Street and Steeles Avenue West) over which she managed preconstruction sales starting in October of last year. Ms. Dobson is vicepresident of operations and broker of record for Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Advisory Realty and found strong interest from locals looking for affordable homes. The project will sit right on the future Hurontario LRT line, which will run from Port Credit in Mississauga to downtown Brampton, with an expected opening in 2024.
"There's a low-rise area to the south of us; prices there are getting into milliondollar homes," she said. "We saw a large amount of local population buying [in Stella] as an investment for themselves, or more for the future for their children."
Jason Pantalone, president and managing partner of National Homes, is looking at the same group of buyers as his company prepares to start selling the 40-storey Phase 2 of its Duo Condos project (near the Stella, at Malta Avenue and Steeles Avenue West).
"When I look at across the GTA, we feel Brampton has the best value for product across all GTA markets," he said. By comparison, he said, a new unit at Yonge and Bloor in Toronto might cost $2,000 a square foot, and $1,500 at Yonge and Eglinton. He expects Duo will sell for somewhere under $1,000 a square foot, since average prices in Brampton hit the $850 a square foot mark a year ago. "There's projects in Mississauga selling at $1,200 a square foot," he said, numbers that even five years ago would have seemed pitched above most buyers' heads.
Since 1992, National has built more than 1,850 homes in Brampton, but until about eight years ago, when a new generation took over the family business, they had mainly been building townhomes and mid-rise retirement facilities.
The company has a corporate goal of being 50-per-cent high-rise on urban infill sites and 50 per cent on low-rise buildings, but land prices are making that low-rise goal increasingly difficult. "It's been challenging to find low-rise land where we can develop over 200 units, and typically it's around 100 units," he said, adding that in recent years the prices for even lower-cost ground housing such as townhomes became unaffordable for most buyers. By contrast, even though an urban infill highrise site requires much more capital and expertise to build on time and on budget, it's becoming the safer route even in oncesprawl-friendly 905 communities. "We really feel like there's less opportunity and more risk" in greenfield land, Mr. Pantalone said.
The trend of building higher-density and taller buildings in the 905 has been accelerating in recent years.
"There are a number of projects at 50 storeys-plus in Mississauga city centre that sold extremely well by offering small units, lots of building amenities, good design and targeting investors," said Shaun Hildebrand, president of real estate analytics firm Urbanation Inc. For these buyers, price matters more than building scale.
"Buyers and investors are scouring the market for good value at this point."
Between 2016 and 2021, more than 78,000 condominium apartments were built in the City of Toronto, according to Urbanation (in addition to almost 11,000 purpose-built rental apartments). The building market in the area around Toronto, known as the 905 region, has also exploded. Ten years ago, less than 15,000 condo apartments were in development in Toronto's regional neighbours; today, more than 46,124 units are proposed, under construction or soon to be occupied.
In its year-end 2021 Condominium Market Survey, released Tuesday, Urbanation reported that prices for new GTA condos were up 18-per-cent year over year, led by a 23-per-cent growth in the 905 regions where prices hit an average $1,050 a square foot.
Brampton's 2040 Vision building plan imagines a thicket of towers and 15-minute communities along new transit hubs. But the city could be at risk of duplicating Toronto's "tall and sprawl" housing landscape; tall towers on transit nodes, with the remainder of the city zoned to allow for little other than single-family housing.
"I think it's a trap we're falling into, of suddenly responding to a perceived shortage of housing - which is real - but we have to do it at these hyper-densities in very few locations ... as opposed to dispersing it to the hundreds of opportunities on transit," said Ken Greenberg, author, urban designer, planner and co-founder of the City Building Institute at Ryerson University.
"There is a place for taller buildings," he said. "What is not a good thing in a lot of municipalities such as Brampton is where you have random tall buildings arriving almost like tent poles that stick up here, there and everywhere, without having context."
Mr. Greenberg has been working with Brampton (and other cities) on planning that pushes for more of the social infrastructure needed to support a highly dense neighbourhood: schools, daycare and walkable retail ... all of which he argues will make for better places to live. "There's so many places in Brampton along those transportation corridors to spread that density out. One tower in isolation does not a neighbourhood make."
But according to Ms. Dobson, there can be appeal in being first to plant your flag in a mostly low-density area.
"We see a lot of parallels to what we saw in the [Vaughan Metropolitan Centre]," she said. "Developers are wanting to build legacies. They'd rather build out a community instead of being one amongst many.
They can create these hubs."

Full text: 252 Queen St. E.
ST. MARYS, ONT.
Asking Price: $1.35-million Taxes: $8,188.74 (2021) Lot Size: 97.22 feet by 150 feet Listing Agents: Paul Maranger and Christian Vermast, Sotheby's International Realty Canada THE BACKSTORY For more than 100 years the house at 252 Queen St. E. in St. Marys wasn't just a family home, it was also the home base of the publishing family that would run the local newspaper until just before the turn of the millennium.
"It's been the Eedy house for 120 years," owner Richard Lorne Eedy said. "I feel it's time for somebody else."
Family patriarch John Wolfe Eedy moved to town in the late 1800s to buy the St. Marys Journal, later merged into the Journal Argus community newspaper. J.W.
Eedy Publications Ltd. would expand their small-town news empire throughout the 20th century until Richard Lorne, the fourth-generation publisher, exited the business with the 1999 sale of 10 local newspapers to a subsidiary of Torstar.
At the time of sale the company had newspapers in such small Ontario towns as Exeter, Walkerton, Wingham, Fergus, Listowel and Mount Forest. "We had a really nice little business on the go. The problem was while we were interested in buying more, we were priced out of the market," Mr. Eedy said. "I thought maybe it's time to be a seller rather than a buyer. ... I did very well at the time."
Unfortunately, several of the family's newspapers have since ceased operations, including the St. Marys Journal Argus, which was closed in 2017 after a controversial business arrangement whereby Postmedia and Torstar swapped 37 local news publications for no financial considerations and then shut most of them down.
"It was sad, we took a huge pride that people liked the newspaper. ... My mom wrote a cooking column forever," Mr. Eedy said. Local residents would ask what was to become of things such as wedding pictures and other documents connected with the newspaper's history, and as it happened Mr. Eedy had a trove of documents in his possession, which he donated to the local museum.
St. Marys - and no, there is no apostrophe - is a small town of about 7,000 people located between the larger nearby communities of London and Stratford. It gained the nickname "Stone Town" because of local deposits of limestone that were quarried for dozens of homes in the town, including the Eedy house. Recently, there's been signs of newcomers to the community, and heightened interest in stately heritage homes.
"With the pandemic, and people working from home - and that we just added GO train service - it's really drawing a lot of people here," said Nancy Eedy, Lorne's wife.
THE HOUSE TODAY The house sits on a corner lot on Queen Street, the town's main road, just past the historic limestone water tower (which looks positively medieval) on the way to the downtown high street.
The Queen Street side of the house is lined with a stone wall topped with a wrought-iron fence, beyond which a formal entryway with arched windows and elaborate woodwork stands next to a veranda with intricate gingerbread trim. But don't be surprised if no one answers a knock on that door. "Nobody comes in any more through the front," Mr. Eedy said. "I never shovel it.
As kids, we walked through the garage [around back] to get into the house. When Nancy came into my life she said, ‘I won't live in this house with people walking through the garage.' "From the back of the lot there's a driveway that curves into the property and the two-car garage (which connects to the house). There are walkways on both sides, one to the backyard pool deck, the other to the entryway Nancy wanted.
The rear entrance opens into a mud- room, part of the addition Mr. Eedy added 20 years ago. A flagstone pathway outside turns into flagstone flooring inside, and there are lots of hooks and cabinets for storage in this L-shaped room that connects to the garage and to the breakfast room in the new kitchen.
Another door opens into the oldest part of the building. This first structure was built in 1849 by lumberman John Sanderson, one of the early St. Marys colonial arrivals. There have been several additions over the years, the first in 1869 when the two-storey limestone main house was built. The single-storey stone wing has a utility room off the mudroom, and also a tiled laundry room and a three-piece bath (the tub here is the same one Mr. Eedy used as a child).
Just beyond this is a formal dining room, with a door to the side veranda and the first sign of the cherry strip hardwood flooring found in much of the rest of the original house. To the right is a doorway to the new kitchen (past a butler's pantry tucked between the original exterior limestone wall and the new construction) and straight ahead is a family room, but might as well really be called the showcase (more on that later). There's a beautiful Victorian fireplace with wooden mantle and antique tile inlay on the firebox in this room. Behind this space is Mr. Eedy's office filled with more windows and a wall of audiovisual equipment.
Stepping further into the house finds the front hall and foyer (connected to that little-used front entryway) with wooden staircase that curves upstairs. A stainedglass transom window above the door at the end of the hall leads in to the kitchen, on the left is a second formal living room with another Victorian fireplace and a baby-grand piano that's also available to come with the house.
The kitchen is where Mr. Eedy really put his stamp. The footprint of the original kitchen is still there, now with a central island across from a bank of cabinets on the wall facing the pool deck. The counter is a dark stone quartzite with a leathered texture, with induction range, stove, double sink and fridge sharing the wall.
A short step up into the breakfast room is like a totally different type of grandness: the ceiling vaults up two storeys and castiron grates line the railings of the upstairs loft. Sun pours in through two columns of windows that fill the outside corner walls, they rise to the second floor and are topped by arched stained-glass rescued from a church demolition.
Original stone and block walls from the old exterior are also preserved in this room, which has a walkout to the pool. The 10foot deep pool was installed by Mr. Eedy's mother, but the cedar pool house and sauna was all him.
Upstairs, the original house has three bedrooms and the new loft formed by the kitchen addition. The first, opposite the stairs, is more office than sleeping quarters with a wall of built-ins cabinets complete with closet and desk. Next to that is the primary bedroom, with three windows facing Queen Street and the side yard, and a wall of closets. The last also faces Queen Street and is the smallest but does have the door to the small balcony above the formal entrance.
There's no ensuite bathroom in the primary bedroom, but stepping down into the loft are two spaces that try to make up for that. The first is the three-piece bath with glass-walled shower and vanity, and the second is a dressing room with sink and makeup table just next to the bathroom.
The rest of the loft is huge, L-shaped around that opening to the breakfast room below, with no fewer than four skylights.
The original limestone exterior wall is preserved, and this space is carpeted except for a tiled area set up as a workout and yoga station. Tucked away in the corner is a space made for kids: a raised platform with soft-pile carpet that ramps up toward a triangular window. Mr. Eedy said this was made to be a retreat for the readers among the children.
FAVOURITE SPACE Mr. Eedy is a collector. "I collected marbles at six years old, then it was army shoulder bands, for the last 20 years I've been on to the toys," he said. At a certain point, the collecting may have gotten out of hand, to the point where he'd filled his basement with curios. "It was a sickness," he quips.
He believes that at one time he had one of the largest collections of tin lithograph (or stamped metal) ray guns from the 1930s, 40s and 50s, and part of getting the house for sale meant de-cluttering some of this collection, and he shipped more than a dozen boxes to specialty toy auctions.
These days, his specific interest is in Star Wars toys made between 1977 and 1985 by Ohio-based Kenner and distributed by Irwin toys in Toronto, and he's particularly keen on those marked with the Frenchlanguage translation "Guerre des Etoiles" (GDE). The first-floor family room is a shrine to part of his collection featuring figurines, vehicles and games based on the original space opera trilogy. Children of the eighties will recognize some of the items they drooled over at the toy store (or the toy section of departed retailers like Zellers) though these days some of the items sell for thousands of dollars at auction.
The couple owns a smaller house in Quebec, and is hoping to come out of the pandemic into more travel, so if you're a collector looking to acquire a heritage home and heritage toys, it might be the right time to make Mr. Eedy an offer he can't refuse. "It's time we let go of the collection," he said.

Full text: In her autobiography, Comrade Editor, Namibian journalist Gwen Lister writes, “Just before I reached my teens, apartheid hit me right between the eyes.” This political awakening was no mere abstraction – for it was soon followed by action.
The year is 1966. Life in South Africa is defined by the colour of one’s skin. Thirteen-year-old Gwen is travelling on a double-decker bus in Cape Town. In keeping with the country’s punitive laws ensuring strict racial segregation, the seats on the upper level are reserved for Black people while white people must sit below. An elderly Black woman gets on the bus, laden with parcels. What happens next is best left to Ms. Lister to describe.
“I see she won’t make it up the stairs, and so I get up to give her my seat. She takes it, and white passengers explode with abuse towards both of us. The hurt in her eyes strikes me like a bolt of lightning,” Ms. Lister writes. “In that instant, my life changed irrevocably, my conscience was fully awakened, and my passion ignited. I resolved never again to remain silent in the face of injustice in general and the oppressive reality of apartheid in particular.”
Let us pause and examine what she has written. First, there is the language that is forceful, direct, unequivocal. “Hit between the eyes,” “struck like a bolt of lightning” – descriptors like these leave the reader in no doubt as to the gravitas of what has taken place.
Language, however, is only the messenger. It is the message that is more remarkable by far, for it is coming from a young girl whose moral compass has been already set. Can a 13-year-old resolve never to remain silent in the face of injustice and then hold herself to that high bar over the course of half a century?
In Ms. Lister’s case, the answer is yes.
What the child could not know at the time was the career path that would give her the means, in a very public and influential way, to follow the high moral ground. A precocious sensibility thankfully does not include clairvoyance – for the struggle that lay in wait would prove supremely taxing.
The year of Ms. Lister’s “aha moment,” 1966, also saw the assassination of Hendrik Verwoerd, the prime minister of South Africa and the ideological architect of apartheid. Verwoerd’s stabbing in Parliament shocked the nation, but never shifted the granite resolve of his Nationalist Party. This meant that by the time Ms. Lister graduated from her bachelor of arts degree at the University of Cape Town, racial segregation remained deeply entrenched in South African society.
While she was impatient to help dismantle it, Ms. Lister also rejected violence and did not join Umkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of Nelson Mandela’s banned African National Congress. Instead, she settled on journalism and applied for a vacant position at the Windhoek Advertiser, a daily newspaper in the neighbouring territory of South West Africa – now known as Namibia. A former German colony, South West Africa had been placed under South African administration by the League of Nations after the First World War. Despite the United Nations revoking this mandate in 1966, South Africa continued to govern the country.
To Ms. Lister, a move to the territory was strategic and practical. Imbued with a strong sense of urgency, she reasoned that if apartheid were to be defeated, it would occur first in a mandated territory like South West Africa, rather than in South Africa, its ideological home. And if her contribution to achieving this would be through journalism, obtaining her political column with a beginner’s résumé would be easier and quicker in South West Africa than in South Africa – where the only position open to her was that of cub reporter.
She arrived at the Advertiser midmorning for her interview to find the editor, Johannes Marthinus Smith, known by all as Smittie, already drunk. “Women belong barefoot in the kitchen or naked in bed,” he yelled at her.
Recounting this episode in her autobiography, Ms. Lister writes with remarkable restraint that she had “never come across someone like him before.” It says much for her strength of character that she not only withstood the abuse but was hired by Jurgen Meinert, the paper’s owner, despite Smittie’s chauvinistic objections.
She soon learned that behind the editor’s bullying bluster was a fiercely independent journalist, prepared to stand firm against the pressures being exerted on the Advertiser by the South African government. In time, an unlikely friendship would develop between the two.
Ms. Lister was moving to a country also roiled by racial tensions. The South West African’s People’s Organization (SWAPO), considered by the United Nations as the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people, had taken up arms against the occupying South African military.
Compounding the situation, neighbouring and newly independent Angola was being torn apart in a civil war fuelled by Cold War enmities that pitted the Soviet Union against U.S.-backed South Africa. Against this backdrop of superpower rivalries and local internecine feuds, the South African administration was working assiduously to demonize SWAPO and exclude it from the political discourse – a policy that the Windhoek Advertiser strongly criticized.
Smittie, despite his misogynistic misgivings, threw Ms. Lister into the deep end of Namibian politics. Her first political assignment was a SWAPO rally in Katutura, a racially segregated district reserved for Black people outside Windhoek. The name Katutura in the Herero language means “the place where people do not want to live” – a poignant encapsulation of what apartheid had brought to Namibia. In her memoirs, Ms. Lister remembers the rallies as “intimidating experiences … massive gatherings which often ended in violence as police would move in to tyrannise the attendees and disperse the crowds.”
Ms. Lister’s sympathetic coverage of SWAPO policies did not fit with the government’s narrative of demonizing the organization. The Advertiser was censored, and when that heavy-handed approach could not silence her voice, the government used a slush fund to buy out the paper and ensure the new owners followed the prescribed script. Smittie and Ms. Lister were given an ultimatum to do likewise. Smittie’s response was to resign and use his savings to start a new paper, the Windhoek Observer. It was a gamble, and he took Ms. Lister with him.
The Observer launched on May 4, 1978, the day South African forces attacked SWAPO’s Cassinga Camp in southern Angola, killing 600 people, many of whom were refugees.
The escalating armed conflict was accompanied by more stringent media restrictions: Ms. Lister’s military accreditation was revoked. Her home was searched by security police. She was increasingly shunned by the white population in Namibia, who regarded her as a “dangerous communist.” Her social circle dwindled to a handful of colleagues and a few progressive lawyers. People would cross the street to avoid her. She was mocked and caricatured in cartoons in government-friendly papers.
On her return to Namibia from a 1983 United Nations-sponsored conference in Paris in support of Namibian independence, where she met SWAPO’s exiled leader Sam Nujoma for the first time, she was charged under the Publications and Customs and Excise Acts and the feared Internal Security Act. She faced up to 20 years in jail. Her crime? Having SWAPO publications in her possession.
Ms. Lister’s trial was held in South Africa. The fear of a guilty verdict and a jail term, and the effect it would have on her three-year-old son, weighed heavily
on her. A stellar legal team ensured her acquittal. But there was no letup in the harassment. Single editions of the Observer were banned followed by a total ban on the paper in 1984. Smittie was ready to quit, but Ms. Lister, with funding from the U.S.-based Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, travelled to South Africa and had the ban overturned.
Politics, however, influenced the purse strings and the Observer’s political stance had driven away advertising revenue from the predominantly white business sector.
With the paper in severe financial trouble, Smittie decided to adopt a more conservative political stance. To bolster finances, he also brought on board a wealthy real estate agent, Thurstan Salt, who had aggressively importuned Ms. Lister for sex. A knee to the groin made a vindictive enemy. She was removed from her political beat. Nine staff members of the paper resigned in protest. Ms. Lister joined them.
Three months after leaving the Observer, Ms. Lister was arrested under the Official Secrets Act and jailed for exposing mail tampering by the government. While the case against her soon collapsed, she had reached a professional and personal nadir. She was out of regular work. She and her former Observer colleagues were blacklisted by the government, which meant no local jobs were open to them.
She had very little money. She was dependent on Bishop James Kauluma of the Anglican Diocese of Namibia for a lowrent house. And her husband had walked out on her. It would be the first of two failed marriages: As Ms. Lister told me, both husbands had been attracted to her for who she was, but once married, they could not adjust to the pressures that came with it.
The adversities Ms. Lister had had to contend with thus far steeled her for what came next. With the help of donors, she started a new paper, The Namibian, employing ex-Observer colleagues. The paper was established as a not-for-profit Trust, the first of its kind in Africa. It belonged to the public it served, immune to outside commercial interests, a fate which had undermined Smittie’s Observer. The first edition hit the stands on Aug. 30, 1985.
She now had editorial freedom, but that also meant that she was more firmly in the crosshairs of a belligerent government. She knew that late-night calls generally meant death threats, but what if they were work-related? She was so pivotal to the fledgling paper’s survival that the ringing couldn’t be ignored.
New dangers surfaced as well. The paper’s offices were fire bombed. The bombproof glass that was installed was soon bullet-scarred. Tear gas was placed in the air conditioning. A triple-grenade attack, which included phosphorous, destroyed the office and most of the equipment.
When I asked Ms. Lister how she coped with it all, she told me she was too busy fighting battles to allow time for her emotions to get in the way.
“I did not have time to say, I am hurt, I am afraid,” she said. Given the magnitude of the struggle, she regarded introspection “as something of a luxury.” She would go to bed wondering if a hand grenade would be lobbed into her garden. As a result, she slept brokenly, peeping through the curtains on the lookout for assailants.
“I became used to it,” she told me.
“They would not get me down; they were the cowards.”
And then there was the gender factor.
In the deeply patriarchal society, a woman’s character was smeared as soon as she showed independence. “I had to forget I was a woman. I could not let myself give in to my emotions, what people called ‘women things.’ I could not show weakness as a woman!” Ms. Lister told me.
An intense commitment to a cause generates its own gravitational pull. “The deeper I was in, the harder it was to give up,” Ms. Lister recalled. “Threats had a paradoxical effect.” She asked herself if she was prepared to die, and her answer was yes. “If it had to be, it had to be,” she concluded, but she hoped that those threatening her would have a conscience and spare her children.
When her friend Anton Lubowski, a charismatic lawyer and SWAPO supporter, was assassinated outside his home, a man calling himself White Wolf telephoned The Namibian with a chilling message: “Tell Gwen Lister she’s next.”
To Ms. Lister, the murder, emotionally devastating, added another layer to her resolve: Now there were “just a handful of whites opposed to the government,” she recollected. “Our work became even more important.”
“The most perilous moment for a bad government is one when it seeks to mend its ways,” observed Alexis de Tocqueville.
Mr. Lubowski was killed three days before the South African government relented and sanctioned Mr. Nujoma’s return to Namibia after 39 years in exile. Five months later, Namibia was independent, with a democratically elected SWAPO government led by Mr. Nujoma as president.
At long last, Ms. Lister could openly let go of some of her emotions. She “wept unashamedly” as the Namibian flag was raised just after midnight on March 21, 1990.
But the story does not end here, although it could have with a lesser person.
The political transition vindicated Ms. Lister’s belief that “really good journalism” was defined by its ability to bring about change.
To the victors go the spoils of war and the new SWAPO government came bearing gifts: She was offered the post of Minister of Information and Broadcasting. She declined – as she did for other offers, including ambassadorial posts in Sweden and the U.K. and director-general of the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation.
From then on, Mr. Nujoma and some in SWAPO viewed her with suspicion. They could not understand her refusal, which was driven by her conviction that “for a journalist to be feted in the halls of power meant you were too close to where you shouldn’t be.”
It may come as a surprise to realize that Ms. Lister was only 37 years of age when Namibia became independent. Having kept her distance from SWAPO, she could hold the government and an increasingly authoritarian president accountable for their failings. When they attacked her for her criticism, she felt vindicated. At a 2003 UNESCO-sponsored seminar, she was one of the architects of the Windhoek Declaration, which enshrined a free press as an essential pillar of democracy.
Today, Namibia ranks first in Africa for press freedom.
In 2011, Ms. Lister stood down as editor of The Namibian. “I felt I had amputated one of my limbs,” she told me. The intensity of this reaction may be understood in the context of another admission – that she reacts better under fire than to compliments. So, mindful of her sensitivities, I will shy away from encomiums and let the facts speak for themselves. What a story they tell.
They also beg a question, put to her by Ismail Mahomed, former chief justice of South Africa and Namibia: “What made a little white girl like you do what you did?” “Stunned” by the question, Ms. Lister struggled to answer it other than to say it came from deep within her.
So, let us return to that fateful bus ride in Cape Town, half a century ago, the year the architect of apartheid is knifed to death in Parliament. A child witnesses the humiliation of an elderly Black woman and is morally outraged. That indefinable thing she alludes to deep within her is her moral code that has been transgressed.
Doing nothing other than give up a seat on a bus in response to this morally injurious event would be an act of omission that only exacerbates the shame, guilt and anger that apartheid and other forms of injustice foster. A fierce moral courage is needed to assuage these emotions – one that must surmount being vilified, ostracized, fire-bombed, denigrated as a woman and feeling the pain of loss of a close friend’s assassination and two marriages that could not survive the vortex of a liberation struggle.
This précis of Gwen Lister’s life is, however, incomplete. It fails to acknowledge the sunlit uplands of moral courage reached by a temperament that does indeed thrive under fire. For she has raised two children as a single mother; forged intense bonds of lifelong friendships amidst shared adversity; started and sustained a newspaper that played a pivotal role in ending apartheid in South West Africa and the birth of Namibia; and laid the foundations for a free press that nourishes her country’s democracy.
There it is: the balance sheet of an extraordinary life; the pain of moral injury and rewards of moral courage laid out; the debit and credit columns interacting synergistically; the spur to action. And the answer to the chief justice’s probing question.
MORAL COURAGE: ABOUT THE SERIES Journalists are key to civil society, keeping readers, viewers and listeners informed of events both local and international. At times, this work entails exposure to grave danger. The factors that motivate journalists to continue this work despite these threats are many and complex, but central to it all is moral courage. Simply put, to some journalists, doing nothing in response to the egregious behaviour of corrupt or genocidal politicians, human traffickers and drug cartels is worse than the repercussions that come from exposing such crimes. These journalists are driven by a moral imperative to risk their own safety and psychological well-being for the story – and the price paid for this steely determination is invariably steep.
Anthony Feinstein, a psychiatrist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto, is an authority on the psychological effects of conflict on journalists.
Together with Dr. Feinstein, The Globe and Mail is running Moral Courage, a project that will feature frank and intimate interviews between Dr. Feinstein and a journalist working in hazardous situations around the globe. Each story showcases the work of these journalists, the factors that explain why they feel compelled to pursue such an all-encompassing mission, and the personal consequences their work entails.

She was increasingly shunned by the white population in Namibia, who regarded her as a "dangerous communist." Her social circle dwindled to a handful of colleagues and a few progressive lawyers. People would cross the street to avoid her. She was mocked and caricatured in cartoons in government-friendly papers.
On her return to Namibia from a 1983 United Nations-sponsored conference in Paris in support of Namibian independence, where she met SWAPO's exiled leader Sam Nujoma for the first time, she was charged under the Publications and Customs and Excise Acts and the feared Internal Security Act. She faced up to 20 years in jail. Her crime? Having SWAPO publications in her possession.
Ms. Lister's trial was held in South Africa. The fear of a guilty verdict and a jail term, and the effect it would have on her three-year-old son, weighed heavily
on her. A stellar legal team ensured her acquittal. But there was no letup in the harassment. Single editions of the Observer were banned followed by a total ban on the paper in 1984. Smittie was ready to quit, but Ms. Lister, with funding from the U.S.-based Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, travelled to South Africa and had the ban overturned.
Politics, however, influenced the purse strings and the Observer's political stance had driven away advertising revenue from the predominantly white business sector.
With the paper in severe financial trouble, Smittie decided to adopt a more conservative political stance. To bolster finances, he also brought on board a wealthy real estate agent, Thurstan Salt, who had aggressively importuned Ms. Lister for sex. A knee to the groin made a vindictive enemy. She was removed from her political beat. Nine staff members of the paper resigned in protest. Ms. Lister joined them.
Three months after leaving the Observer, Ms. Lister was arrested under the Official Secrets Act and jailed for exposing mail tampering by the government. While the case against her soon collapsed, she had reached a professional and personal nadir. She was out of regular work. She and her former Observer colleagues were blacklisted by the government, which meant no local jobs were open to them.
She had very little money. She was dependent on Bishop James Kauluma of the Anglican Diocese of Namibia for a lowrent house. And her husband had walked out on her. It would be the first of two failed marriages: As Ms. Lister told me, both husbands had been attracted to her for who she was, but once married, they could not adjust to the pressures that came with it.
The adversities Ms. Lister had had to contend with thus far steeled her for what came next. With the help of donors, she started a new paper, The Namibian, employing ex-Observer colleagues. The paper was established as a not-for-profit Trust, the first of its kind in Africa. It belonged to the public it served, immune to outside commercial interests, a fate which had undermined Smittie's Observer. The first edition hit the stands on Aug. 30, 1985.
She now had editorial freedom, but that also meant that she was more firmly in the crosshairs of a belligerent government. She knew that late-night calls generally meant death threats, but what if they were work-related? She was so pivotal to the fledgling paper's survival that the ringing couldn't be ignored.
New dangers surfaced as well. The paper's offices were fire bombed. The bombproof glass that was installed was soon bullet-scarred. Tear gas was placed in the air conditioning. A triple-grenade attack, which included phosphorous, destroyed the office and most of the equipment.
When I asked Ms. Lister how she coped with it all, she told me she was too busy fighting battles to allow time for her emotions to get in the way.
"I did not have time to say, I am hurt, I am afraid," she said. Given the magnitude of the struggle, she regarded introspection "as something of a luxury." She would go to bed wondering if a hand grenade would be lobbed into her garden. As a result, she slept brokenly, peeping through the curtains on the lookout for assailants.
"I became used to it," she told me.
"They would not get me down; they were the cowards."
And then there was the gender factor.
In the deeply patriarchal society, a woman's character was smeared as soon as she showed independence. "I had to forget I was a woman. I could not let myself give in to my emotions, what people called ‘women things.' I could not show weakness as a woman!" Ms. Lister told me.
An intense commitment to a cause generates its own gravitational pull. "The deeper I was in, the harder it was to give up," Ms. Lister recalled. "Threats had a paradoxical effect." She asked herself if she was prepared to die, and her answer was yes. "If it had to be, it had to be," she concluded, but she hoped that those threatening her would have a conscience and spare her children.
When her friend Anton Lubowski, a charismatic lawyer and SWAPO supporter, was assassinated outside his home, a man calling himself White Wolf telephoned The Namibian with a chilling message: "Tell Gwen Lister she's next."
To Ms. Lister, the murder, emotionally devastating, added another layer to her resolve: Now there were "just a handful of whites opposed to the government," she recollected. "Our work became even more important."
"The most perilous moment for a bad government is one when it seeks to mend its ways," observed Alexis de Tocqueville.
Mr. Lubowski was killed three days before the South African government relented and sanctioned Mr. Nujoma's return to Namibia after 39 years in exile. Five months later, Namibia was independent, with a democratically elected SWAPO government led by Mr. Nujoma as president.
At long last, Ms. Lister could openly let go of some of her emotions. She "wept unashamedly" as the Namibian flag was raised just after midnight on March 21, 1990.
But the story does not end here, although it could have with a lesser person.
The political transition vindicated Ms. Lister's belief that "really good journalism" was defined by its ability to bring about change.
To the victors go the spoils of war and the new SWAPO government came bearing gifts: She was offered the post of Minister of Information and Broadcasting. She declined - as she did for other offers, including ambassadorial posts in Sweden and the U.K. and director-general of the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation.
From then on, Mr. Nujoma and some in SWAPO viewed her with suspicion. They could not understand her refusal, which was driven by her conviction that "for a journalist to be feted in the halls of power meant you were too close to where you shouldn't be."
It may come as a surprise to realize that Ms. Lister was only 37 years of age when Namibia became independent. Having kept her distance from SWAPO, she could hold the government and an increasingly authoritarian president accountable for their failings. When they attacked her for her criticism, she felt vindicated. At a 2003 UNESCO-sponsored seminar, she was one of the architects of the Windhoek Declaration, which enshrined a free press as an essential pillar of democracy.
Today, Namibia ranks first in Africa for press freedom.
In 2011, Ms. Lister stood down as editor of The Namibian. "I felt I had amputated one of my limbs," she told me. The intensity of this reaction may be understood in the context of another admission - that she reacts better under fire than to compliments. So, mindful of her sensitivities, I will shy away from encomiums and let the facts speak for themselves. What a story they tell.
They also beg a question, put to her by Ismail Mahomed, former chief justice of South Africa and Namibia: "What made a little white girl like you do what you did?" "Stunned" by the question, Ms. Lister struggled to answer it other than to say it came from deep within her.
So, let us return to that fateful bus ride in Cape Town, half a century ago, the year the architect of apartheid is knifed to death in Parliament. A child witnesses the humiliation of an elderly Black woman and is morally outraged. That indefinable thing she alludes to deep within her is her moral code that has been transgressed.
Doing nothing other than give up a seat on a bus in response to this morally injurious event would be an act of omission that only exacerbates the shame, guilt and anger that apartheid and other forms of injustice foster. A fierce moral courage is needed to assuage these emotions - one that must surmount being vilified, ostracized, fire-bombed, denigrated as a woman and feeling the pain of loss of a close friend's assassination and two marriages that could not survive the vortex of a liberation struggle.
This précis of Gwen Lister's life is, however, incomplete. It fails to acknowledge the sunlit uplands of moral courage reached by a temperament that does indeed thrive under fire. For she has raised two children as a single mother; forged intense bonds of lifelong friendships amidst shared adversity; started and sustained a newspaper that played a pivotal role in ending apartheid in South West Africa and the birth of Namibia; and laid the foundations for a free press that nourishes her country's democracy.
There it is: the balance sheet of an extraordinary life; the pain of moral injury and rewards of moral courage laid out; the debit and credit columns interacting synergistically; the spur to action. And the answer to the chief justice's probing question.
MORAL COURAGE: ABOUT THE SERIES Journalists are key to civil society, keeping readers, viewers and listeners informed of events both local and international. At times, this work entails exposure to grave danger. The factors that motivate journalists to continue this work despite these threats are many and complex, but central to it all is moral courage. Simply put, to some journalists, doing nothing in response to the egregious behaviour of corrupt or genocidal politicians, human traffickers and drug cartels is worse than the repercussions that come from exposing such crimes. These journalists are driven by a moral imperative to risk their own safety and psychological well-being for the story - and the price paid for this steely determination is invariably steep.
Anthony Feinstein, a psychiatrist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto, is an authority on the psychological effects of conflict on journalists.
Together with Dr. Feinstein, The Globe and Mail is running Moral Courage, a project that will feature frank and intimate interviews between Dr. Feinstein and a journalist working in hazardous situations around the globe. Each story showcases the work of these journalists, the factors that explain why they feel compelled to pursue such an all-encompassing mission, and the personal consequences their work entails.

Full text: Open the nondescript door of 1305 Dundas St. W., and one is greeted, warmly, by a little sign: "Welcome home, Wanderers," it reads. "Stay a while." A little arrow prompts the wanderer to trot up to the second floor, find his or her doorway - one of 24 over two floors - and flop down on the very comfortable bed, or, perhaps, whip up some scrambled eggs in the tiny kitchen.
But will wanderers respond to something that dwells in the twilight zone between AirBnB and hotel? A very luxuriously furnished something, yes, but will they pay a premium - room rates start at $2,000 a month - to be shoehorned into less than 400 square feet? Or, in some cases, less than 200 sq. ft.? Will the onemonth minimum stay make them run screaming?
Laleh Rouhani of Luloo Boutique Homes is betting they'll run right to her front door, smiling.
"There's a new trend that people don't want to be tied down to one place," she says. "They don't have homes, they just travel from one city to another, and they live in one place for two or three months."
Ms. Rouhani is perched on a long, turfed grey sofa in the generous common space of "Numbers Residence," which might very well be Toronto's first microsuite, short-term, furnished rental concept to hit the market.
To her left is business partner (and older sister) Pouneh Rouhani, and, sprouting from the wall to her right, a friendly-faced, sculptural giraffe holds a chandelier in its mouth. Both sisters throw the term "nomad" around while describing the project, so it's no surprise that, across the corridor, an extremely large photograph of a grizzled, woolcapped and baggy-panted nomadic gentleman takes up an entire wall over the coffee station.
While the clothing may not be the same, the 21st century seems to have produced a whole new type of roamer: able to carry their job(s) around in their laptops and armed with both wanderlust and a disgust for the out-of-control housing market, these new Romani are citizens of the world ... as long as there's WiFi available. And as Toronto grows ever larger, they'll arrive on our shores too, needing a place to set up their "tents."
Or, they'll come from right here: Although Numbers has only accepted tenants since mid-December, most hail from within the Greater Toronto Area.
"There was some research saying that people are happier in less clutter," says Ms. Rouhani, who came to Canada from Iran in 2004 with her older sister and parents.
"Minimalism, you know?" her sister interjects.
The younger woman continues: "It backed up the idea of micro-units, so it was always on our mind looking for the next project, and then this building came up."
It was certainly front-and-centre in Pouneh's mind, since she had done her masters thesis at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management on that very subject.
Of course, because COVID-19 hit, it took the duo twice as long - two years to be exact - to finish bringing this bricks-and-mortar test case to life. And since the original 24 units they inherited had building-code issues - some "dwelling rooms" didn't have kitchens while others had makeshift (and probably illegal) ones - and a dangerous, antiquated HVAC system throughout, it became a gruelling two years to boot.
However, with the help of architects Ja Studio, interior designers Commute Design Studio and general contractor Dazz Group, the end result is spectacular.
Even in the smallest units, the high ceilings, herringbone floors and the option of having more than one place to sit turn what could have been a sad dorm room into a happy nook for writing one's screenplay.
In some of the larger units, a few stairs carry one to an arched opening containing the bedroom "wing," enormous windows look down onto the hustle-and-bustle of Dundas Street, and built-in furniture maximizes dining space.
And all rooms are tied together by the same materials and colour palette: warm grey kitchen cabinets and countertops; sleek black faucets; and latticework screens in natural wood or paint cover closet doors, whole walls, or even, cleverly, the ductless minisplit systems.
And because the sisters have a keen eye for decorating, there are thoughtful and tactile details as well, such as blobby little flower vases, kettles with wooden handles, and ceiling moulding to give the eye a place to rest.
In all, the micro-units of Numbers Residence are warm, inviting spaces that any nomad would be happy to call home.
Of course, a concept such as this would not work in suburbia.
As Pouneh Rouhani points out (and what her thesis substantiated), a big part of what tenants are paying for in a micro-suite is what's not in it at all, but rather just outside the front door. And here on Dundas Street West near Dovercourt Road., all within a quick sprint when it's -15 C, are restaurants, bars, flower markets, cheese shops, hipster cafés, butchers and hair salons.
Speaking of which, before the sisters tackle their next Luloo project, they'd love to find the right retail/commercial tenants for the two large spaces on the ground floor. "We would love to have a local [business] that goes with the image of the building, of the street," Laleh Rouhani says.
While the pair were hoping for a spin studio or gym - the spaces are too large for a mom-and-pop coffee shop - recent events suggest those operators might be gun shy. So, with this writer's help, a few ideas are run up the flagpole: how about a coffee roaster, a microbrewery, or a small supermarket?
The Rouhani sisters have built it ... so will they come? They'd be foolish not to.

Self-storage boom is irritating the neighbours

Full text: Are they urban dead zones, employment engines or a new form of vertical garage for cities with a profusion of tiny apartments?
For many years, self-storage facilities were low-slung and vaguely dodgy, places situated in suburban industrial parks, their garageformat lockers filled with grandma's junk and god knows what else.
But thanks to a confluence of factors - among them real estate investor interest, Marie Kondo's cultural impact and the surge of the entirely virtual e-commerce businesses - the City of Toronto has seen a surge of development applications for such projects, a growing number of which are now multistorey affairs situated much closer to the core.
According to the city's planning department, there are currently 66 self-storage facilities in Toronto, but nine new development proposals have received their initial planning approvals, and a further 19 are under review, together representing a potential 38-per-cent increase in locations.
One in particular, slated for a slice of land near Dupont and Bathurst, has opened up a bit of a Pandora's, well, locker, and triggered an intriguing debate about what kinds of buildings belong on a stretch of former industrial land that was rezoned in recent years to allow for the development of mid-rise condos.
Talus Capital Corp., a Toronto firm, wants to erect a nine-storey self-storage facility on a sliver of land south of the rail corridor, with access off Bathurst Street.
The building will have 1,290 units, about two-thirds of which will be less than 75 square feet. The development application, which requires a zoning amendment, is due to go to council later this spring.
The property, currently a selfserve car wash with a parking lot that opens onto Albany Avenue, sits behind a row of two-storey buildings with apartments and retail spaces, including the iconic Vesta diner. One of Tridel's newest tapered mid-rises, Bianca, is next door, with several other such projects planned or going up elsewhere along Dupont between Spadina and Ossington.
The size of the proposed facility quickly drew the attention of residents' groups both north and south of the tracks. Some homeowners to the north are definitely not pleased about the project, and in particular the sight of its blank rear wall protruding over the rail corridor.
Robert Levy, who heads the Casa Loma Residents Association, says the proposal is too large and too high, and may produce traffic back-ups on Bathurst. "How can this even work?" he asks, predicting that the building's size will make it impossible to redevelop the Dupont-facing side of that block with a mid-rise apartment building, as the 2014 Dupont regeneration study envisioned.
"Part of this process is the developer trying to steamroller this application."
However, the Annex Residents Association (ARA), whose members live immediately to the south, has been far less exercised about the prospect of a new selfstorage neighbour. The ARA's planning committee pushed Talus to tweak its design to include a façade that looks more like a brick warehouse, as well as stepped-back massing similar to what's typical for mid-rises.
The ARA also commissioned an architect to see if the Dupont side would, indeed, be sterilized, as the residents' groups north of the tracks contend, and concluded the answer is no.
Mike Layton, the local councillor, says the whole block is zoned for nine storeys anyways, and adds, "It's probably got some value to the neighbourhood as a selfstorage."
Yet Peter Obradovich, Talus's vice-president of acquisitions and development, points out that 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the units are likely to be leased for warehouse space for small or virtual businesses operating in the downtown. The trend toward the use of self-storage facilities for these commercial purposes is widespread, and there are some local projects, including one downtown, where as many as three-quarters of the tenants are companies or non-profits.
He says the units are popular with photographers, who use them for their equipment, and pharmaceutical company sales reps, who rent the lockers to store samples. Some self-storage facilities also offer receiving services.
Mr. Layton adds that Talus has promised to include on-site bike parking and the use of a cargo vehicle for tenants.
Mr. Levy argues that the city and the developer have under-estimated the traffic that will be generated by commercial tenants.
"We know what's happening with the pressures of e-commerce," he says. "The owner told me himself that this will create employment because it's going to have businesses going in and out of this thing, obviously by cars or trucks."
Given that the site has been an active car wash for decades, it's unlikely there will be a significant change. Yet the broader planning question of the evolving role of the self-storage warehouse in a downtown neighbourhood is certainly worth exploring.
The city believes Toronto's 66 self-storage facilities employ just 200 people, or three for each location. But Mr. Obradovich notes that if 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the units are rented for commercial purposes, that means the proposed Bathurst/Dupont project alone will support about 300 to 400 small businesses - hardly an insignificant number in terms of local employment.
There's a further irony to this application, which is that Dupont had been zoned for commercial and industrial uses - among them self-storage facilities - for decades. In more recent years, with the decline of manufacturing and developer demand for condo sites, council changed the zoning designation along Dupont from employment lands to mixed-use residential.
As the city's stats about the pipeline of self-storage applications suggest, these kinds of projects may become much more visible in the coming years.
Mr. Obradovich says the Canadian market has been traditionally underserved. However, investor and private equity interest in Canada and Toronto appears to be gathering steam. He adds that one of the largest U.S. players, Life Storage, with 2019 revenues of US$574-million, is looking to buy a site in Toronto.
With a long-term decline in employment lands and the dramatic uptick in e-commerce, it seems the self-storage industry's presence in Toronto will soon cease to be self-contained.

Full text: DONE DEAL 1990 Fulton Ave., West Vancouver WEST VANCOUVER Asking price: $5.5-million (June 4) Selling price: $5.1-million (Oct. 15) Taxes: $9,192.42 (2021) Days on market: 131 Listing agent: Trent Rodney, West Coast Modern THE ACTION The agent showed the house to more than 300 parties and received three offers. "The purchaser was a local downsizer who was living in a condo in Coal Harbour and sold it in order to get the Orchard House," listing agent Trent Rodney says.
WHAT THEY GOT The two-level, 4,049-square-foot, three-bedroom house also has a legal twobedroom basement suite.
The contemporary house, designed by Burgers Architecture and built in 2017, sits on a 9,317square-foot lot and has 22-foothigh ceilings.
Known as the Orchard House, it is surrounded by a working orchard of 20-plus fruit trees and is walking distance to the Oceanside village of Ambleside. The house was included on the 2021 West Coast Modern Home tour.
THE AGENT'S TAKE The contemporary Dutch farmhouse style home was the personal residence of the late West Coast Modern architect Robert Burgers. It represents the highest sale price for a nonocean-view property, and the highest price for Fulton Avenue.
Most Northshore buyers who pay millions expect an ocean view, but Mr. Rodney made the architecture the selling feature. The sale completes mid-January.
"We were shooting for the stars in terms of price. We knew it would take some time to find that special buyer," Mr. Rodney says.
"There is no comparable for a house like this."

Full text: While some kinds of retail property have fared better than others during the pandemic, one retail type has proved a clear winner.
Stand-alone retail properties, occupied by a corporate client such as a major bank, grocery store or big pharmacy, "have always been a preferred asset for investors, but now we are seeing a notable increase in buyers searching for this type of property," according to Curtis Leonhardt, vice-president of investments at commercial real estate firm Marcus & Millichap in Vancouver.
The appeal, Mr. Leonhardt says, is the security and stability offered by the strong covenants and long, triple-net terms that commonly govern the leases of these properties.
Triple-net leases usually cover 10 to 20 years, with annual rent increases, or escalators, built in.
The tenant is provided near-total autonomy of the property and pays not just rent and utilities, but three additional categories of property expenses: property tax, insurance and most maintenance costs, such as landscaping and snow removal.
"They are virtually a hands-off investment," says Mr. Leonhardt, who specializes in the niche market. "In many cases, owners are literally just collecting a cheque."
Last year, in British Columbia, Marcus & Millichap completed 23 single-tenant property transactions with a total volume of more than $104-million. The company's previous three-year volume averaged $81-million.
Mr. Leonhardt notes that "demand for quality assets continues to outpace supply." With investors keen to capitalize on low interest rates in anticipation of higher borrowing costs in the latter half of 2022, "bidding wars" are not uncommon.
For example, Marcus & Millichap listed a CIBC bank property in Maple Ridge, B.C. In the first week, the sale drew multiple offers, with the winning $7.29million bid dealt by a local, private investor.
And recently, in North Vancouver, Marcus & Millichap listed a block of newer commercial strata units occupied by national tenants, including Bank of Nova Scotia and Pharmasave drugstore. Each unit was secured by a triple-net lease; prices ranged from $1.4-million to $4.3-million.
Within days of the properties going to market, a single buyer purchased the entire offering.
With lower listing prices than multitenant buildings, standalone retail properties are a strong draw for private investors, says Mike Grewal, vice-president at Colliers' Surrey, B.C., office.
Challenged by the acute supply shortage of industrial property and intensive management required for residential investment, "a lot of investors are chasing these single-tenant retail buildings," Mr. Grewal says.
A specialist in investment sales, Mr. Grewal speaks also from personal experience. As the owner of a couple of residential homes, he found the demands from the tenancy board so frustrating, he got to a point where he was "done with these investments."
"So, I cashed out and now I'm looking for a commercial investment to plug my money into."
According to CBRE, 2021 may turn out to be a record-breaking year for the number of "smaller commercial real estate" transactions. Figures are still being tallied, but the total is expected to reach 9,500 - surpassing the previous record by 2,000 transactions. Canadian investors continue to be the most active buyer group, accounting for nearly half of all acquisitions. Foreign investors accounted for nearly 15 per cent.
Gordon Beattie, president of Surrey-based Intercity Properties Ltd., is a long-time investor in single-tenant retail properties.
Since the mid-1970s, the chartered tax adviser has built a 40building portfolio that extends from Ontario to B.C., of muffler shops, 7-Eleven and Mac's convenience stores, Pizza Hut and KFC restaurants, and other largely single-tenant properties.
Most recently, a Shoppers Drug Mart in Brandon fit the requirements he insists on when buying a single-tenant retail property.
"It's like a points system," explains Mr. Beattie, who is "constantly combing" commercial real estate websites in search of suitable properties. "I give points for location. Is it a corner? Is it in a populated centre?" In the case of Shoppers Drug Mart, it is surrounded by seniors complexes and a regional hospital: It isn't about to go out of business.
"Then there's the tenancy," he says. "Is it a national tenant?
What are the terms? I look at the character of the building from an architectural standpoint. Does it have a degree of utility for subsequent tenants?" A crucial score point is capitalization rate, "the basis for valuing these properties," he says.
"The cap rates are no different for single-tenant properties than they are for multitenant properties. And you don't have the management headaches. If [tenants] run their business to be successful, they make sure their building is well maintained."
While Mr. Beattie owns properties on several main streets, such as Yonge Street in Toronto and Granville Street in Vancouver, he also favours secondary markets - "the Cranbrooks and the Kamloops of the world: There's less competition and you can get better cap rates."
Smaller markets are riskier, though. "It might be more difficult to maintain the rental value if you lose the tenant."
Mr. Beattie maintains that land-value speculation isn't a key factor in his purchasing rating system.
But in Metro Vancouver's constricted market, Colliers's Mr. Grewal says, many single-tenant retail property buyers are "speculating on the continuing increase of land value."
It's a bonus, he says. The finale of a carefree, income-generating investment in a bank or drugstore building "could potentially be an up-zoning for higher-density development" - followed, most assuredly, by the sale of it.
As he puts it, "who needs the headache?"

Full text: The organizers: Andrea Florian, Laura Gill, Barb Cote, Erin Coté, Kathy Maksuta The pitch: creating the Burlington Cares Food Drive Like many small enterprises, Andrea Florian's real estate business in Burlington, Ont., dried up when the pandemic hit in March, 2020.
"I just didn't want to sit there feeling sorry for myself and everybody on the team sort of said, ‘well, what are we going to do?
How can we help?' "Ms. Florian recalled.
Her team of four sales representatives - Laura Gill, Barb Cote, Erin Coté, Kathy Maksuta - had been involved in charity work before and they'd run an annual drive for the local food bank.
They decided to increase that commitment to a weekly service called the Burlington Cares Food Drive.
Every Thursday e-mails come in from people with items to donate. The team organizes pickups the next day and makes deliveries to the food bank and other organizations.
The food drive has been operating each week since March, 2020, and Ms. Florian said some Fridays the group receives donations from as many as 70 families. They've also branched out and delivered diapers, face masks and personal hygiene products to a women's shelter as well as coats to the Salvation Army and school supplies for children in need. And they've helped a single mother with hampers of food.
"This particular lady was on her own with a newborn baby and she couldn't get out to get food and she couldn't get baby formula. She couldn't get anything," said Ms. Florian, 47, who is also a musician. "In those moments you just just want to cry."
Ms. Florian and her team plan to keep the drive going even after the pandemic. "We think that we'll just do the food drive every week forever," she said. "We've made some really beautiful connections with people and heard their stories and it's inspiring for us as well."

Calgary's high-end market sprouts new leaves

Full text: Last summer, Mark Erickson and his partners at Calgary design-build firm Studio North decided to sell the Withrow House, an award-winning heritage property the team renovated in the northwest of the city.
Dissatisfied with traditional methods of listing real estate, they decided to market the house themselves.
"When we sold the Withrow House, we really put out the story," Mr. Erickson says. "We put our blood, sweat and tears into building and designing that property, [so] we had this really rich, meaningful story that we could convey to the market."
And it worked.
After only two months in the market, the $1.6-million house sold. And although Mr. Erickson believes this was a result of the remarkable storytelling of the studio's brand manager, Brendan Kane, it was not the only reason.
In late 2021, the detached segment in Calgary showed strong signs of recovery, and a tight market drove up sales even in the $1-million-plus price range, a niche that had been struggling since the 2014 downturn.
"What we've seen through the pandemic is a complete turnaround," says Ann-Marie Lurie, chief economist of the Calgary Real Estate Board. "Sales are on pace to hit a record level for $1-million-plus, [showing] an exceptional strong level of sales activity."
On Jan. 4, the CREB reported that 27,686 homes were sold in 2021, nearly 72-per-cent higher than 2020, and more than 44 per cent higher than the 10-year average.
The recovery was driven in part by the low lending rates, Ms. Lurie explains, as well as price growth in the lower end of the market.
Today's reduced supply "does reflect that conditions are much tighter, even in the higher end," she says, adding that "early in the pandemic, the tightest was definitely in the affordable sector of the market, but it's been shifting all the way up."
Indeed, in December, the supply of homes in the $1-millionplus segment was at four months, a record low. Even before the 2014 downturn, supply would sit at around seven months for this segment, Ms. Lurie says. Moreover, according to CREB, the share of $1-million-plus homes in the Calgary market increased from 3 per cent to 4 per cent in 2021.
While this growth was likely driven by rising prices across the board, Ms. Lurie thinks another factor could be that sellers are putting high-end properties back in the market, as seven years after the downturn, million-dollar homes are moving again - and they're moving quickly.
This is an opportunity Studio North wants to capitalize on.
After their experience selling the Withrow House over the summer, Mr. Erickson says it was clear there was a gap in the city's luxury real estate market.
"When you're buying something like a house, it's a really big investment," he says. "So in order to really convey what that house is all about, it's important that the designer is involved."
In his view, the narrative behind a house's design is often missing from traditional real estate listings. It is difficult for a realtor to convey the subtle nuances of an architecturally designed home.
"Typically, a realtor just looks at the house, crunches the numbers, and does a pretty simple write-up that is really a superficial evaluation of the house," Mr. Erickson says.
In this context, Mr. Erickson and his Studio North partners, Matthew Kennedy, Damon Hayes Couture and Heath Williamson, identified an opportunity to expand the scope of their services and provide a supplementary marketing service to cater to an exclusive niche of the high-end market.
"I think when we're talking about luxury, we're also talking about architecture, not just a building, [and] there should be a higher level of design that comes with it," Mr. Erickson says.
Conceived as an organization parallel to Studio North, Arch House aims to fulfill the needs of buyers who value the quality, attention to detail and higher design standards of a custom-designed home with a story.
"Once you get over that million-dollar mark, you're buying more than just brick and mortar," Mr. Erickson says. "You're buying a lifestyle. You have more expectations for the quality of design and the quality of the attention to detail."
Architects think about natural light, views and composition of space, Mr. Erickson explains.
"Those are all things that are critical ... and there's no better person to talk to that than the architect or designer behind it."
And as this niche gains steam, Arch House could be just what Calgary needs.
According to Ms. Lurie an influx of professionals attracted to the city's relative affordability can be expected in the coming years.
"We are seeing much more job growth in professional and technical services, which tend to be a higher-paid industry," she says.
"So in terms of supporting growth in some of the higher price ranges, that is a positive development."
Currently, Arch House is marketing two high-end homes located in Calgary's city centre. Priced at just more than $1-million, the value of these properties includes much more than what buyers can find in cities such as Vancouver or Toronto in a similar price range.
Built in the past five years, both houses are more than 3,000 square feet plus a laneway suite, and feature carefully crafted finishes and state-of-the-art amenities designed by local architects.
But not just any luxury home will make the cut to be marketed by Arch House.
"Because we're working with a pretty niche market, we want to make sure that the house fits our criteria and meets our standards for an architecturally designed house," Mr. Erickson says. "It's going to be a small handful of sales that we do every year, and it's going to be a very curated handful of listings."

Populations fall in Toronto, Montreal as urban exodus accelerates

Full text: The populations of Toronto and Montreal declined over a portion of the pandemic as immigration waned and more residents fled those cities for cheaper housing markets.
Over the year ending July 1, 2021, Toronto's population dropped by about 16,600 and Montreal's by roughly 46,700, according to estimates published on Thursday by Statistics Canada.
When surrounding cities are included, the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Toronto managed to grow - albeit at its slowest pace in at least two decades - while the Montreal area still declined.
Over all, the population in Canada's metro areas grew by just 0.5 per cent and was outpaced by expansion in rural areas (places with fewer than 10,000 residents in their most densely populated parts) for the first time on record. Statscan noted that net international migration to Canada dropped by more than half from before the pandemic, making it "the leading factor" behind the slower growth of cities.
The figures appear to confirm the anecdotes: Over the pandemic, a sizable number of Canadians have fled larger cities, whether to ride out the health crisis in safer locales or because home affordability has worsened.
Moreover, the embrace of remote work has redrawn the boundaries of where employees can live, unlocking new options for homeownership. But that shift has also brought volatility to remote communities that were once immune to bidding wars and six-figure price gains.
"These estimates, the first to give us a look at a subprovincial level for an entire year of the COVID-19 pandemic, tell of an accelerating trend in migration from large urban centres, leaving their continued growth largely supported by international migration," Statscan said on Thursday.
The urban exodus is acute in Toronto and Montreal.
Over the most recent year, the Toronto area had a net intraprovincial outflow of about 64,100 - meaning, 64,100 more people left Toronto for other parts of Ontario than moved in. Meanwhile, Montreal saw a net intraprovincial outflow of nearly 40,000.
The Toronto and Montreal areas have always had annual intraprovincial losses over the past 20 years. (Their population growth is largely driven by immigration.)
However, those outflows have accelerated in recent years to record levels. And there's an uptick in departures of children and thirtysomethings, which suggests young families are getting priced out of homeownership.
"They're looking for somewhere that's big enough to raise a family," said Mike Moffatt, an assistant professor at University of Western Ontario's Ivey Business School and a senior director at the Smart Prosperity Institute.
"So they're basically driving until they qualify for a mortgage, to places like Woodstock and Thorold" in Ontario.
Fuelled by rock-bottom mortgage rates, the real estate market ignited during the pandemic, with sales and prices jumping to record heights in many places. In the Toronto area, the average sale price of about $1.2-million in December was up 38 per cent from two years earlier. The benchmark home price in the Montreal region has climbed 21 per cent over the past year.
Conversely, some areas are notching sizable gains in residents. The population of Kelowna, B.C., grew 2.6 per cent (or nearly 6,000) over the most recent year, the quickest pace out of Canada's 35 CMAs. Oshawa, Ont., grew 2.3 per cent and Halifax by 2 per cent.
Among smaller cities and towns, population gains were particularly sharp in Collingwood and Wasaga Beach, about a two-hour drive north of Toronto; Langford, B.C., which is part of Greater Victoria; and several places within driving distance of Montreal and Quebec City.
"Having this out-migration to smaller communities across Southern Ontario has revitalized a lot of Main Streets," Mr. Moffatt said. But there are costs, he noted: more infrastructure to support commuters and more school capacity.
As well, home prices are rising quickly in former havens of affordability. The benchmark home price in Bancroft, Ont. - about a three-hour drive northeast of Toronto - has jumped 47 per cent (or about $150,000) over the past year alone. In the Moncton area, the typical home price is up 37 per cent over that span.
For much of the past two decades, Hamilton has attracted a net inflow of Ontarians, with those numbers swelling in the 2010s as Toronto became increasingly unaffordable. Now, the average price of a detached home in the city is nearing $1million - up 28 per cent over the past year.
"You have Hamilton buyers that now go to Brantford or Paris or Niagara Falls, or out towards the [U.S.] border. They've been displaced monetarily by buyers from east" of Hamilton, notably those from Toronto, said Drew Woolcott, a long-time realtor in the area.
"Rural areas or smaller towns that were typically way beyond the reach of the power of the Toronto dollar [have] now been impacted by it," Mr. Woolcott added.
Carol Lotz, a realtor in St. Catharines since 1990, recently sold a house that received 17 offers - and only five were from local agents. Nowadays, she said, buyers come from all over Southern Ontario: Hamilton, London, Toronto and beyond.
"Buyer agents are really struggling" because of low inventory of available homes, Ms. Lotz said.
"Every time they're putting an offer in, there's so much competition."
Bank of Nova Scotia published a report on Wednesday that delved into the country's chronic shortage of housing.
It found that housing stock was especially low in Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario on a percapita basis. Ontario would need more than 650,000 additional housing units for its per-capita supply to match the average in other provinces, Scotiabank estimated.
Compared with the G7-country average, the housing shortfall was even greater.
"There's not going to be a silver bullet" to the housing shortage, Mr. Moffatt said.
"A lot of it's going to be changes to how we zone, changes to the approval process [for building] - a lot of unsexy stuff, but vitally important."

ARCHITECT BROUGHT A BAUHAUS SENSIBILITY TO A BURGEONING TORONTO: EBERHARD ZEIDLER BUILDER, 95

Full text: It was 1968, and Eberhard Zeidler was missing $9-million.
The architect was working on plans for a new Ontario cultural centre, located in the lake off downtown Toronto. He had imagined a set of buildings on stilts above the water. But this idea, it turned out, required massive foundations that would cost $9-million - almost the entire budget for the project.
Mr. Zeidler pondered the problem while taking a Caribbean vacation with his young family. And in a glass-bottom boat, he found it. A coral reef broke the waves of the sea, leaving water as smooth as glass.
This gave him the idea for a lessexpensive solution to address the forces of the lake. He and his colleagues designed a set of barrier islands for Toronto, which would shelter their forward-looking modernist architecture and also create a waterfront park.
The result was Ontario Place, a seminal place for two generations of people in the Toronto region. It reflected the themes of Mr. Zeidler's career, blending technical innovation, creativity and an emphasis on the public realm. Over 70 years of practice, he and his colleagues also designed Canada Place in Vancouver, Toronto's Eaton Centre and the influential McMaster University Health Sciences Centre in Hamilton.
Mr. Zeidler died Jan. 7 in Toronto after a long illness. He was 95.
Eberhard Zeidler was born Jan.
11, 1926. in the eastern German region of Silesia into an affluent family. He recalled his childhood milieu as a melting pot "where German, English and Russian backgrounds fought in different armies and visited each other between wars," as he recalled in his 2013 autobiography. "I had good friends and we did all the things boys do, like going on hikes through the mountains," Mr. Zeidler wrote. "But my real fascination was buildings."
Mr. Zeidler volunteered for the German Navy in 1943, at age 17, and trained as an officer. After surviving the war - one of only 22 sailors in his flotilla to make it, he recalled - Mr. Zeidler returned to his love of architecture.
He enrolled at the Bauhaus, the design and art school that was one of the crucibles of modernism in Europe, during its shortlived postwar revival in Dessau.
"I was taught that the only acceptable architectural forms are those derived from the function of a building and its structure," he recalled later.
But soon the authorities in Soviet-occupied Germany became suspicious of the school and its free-thinking faculty and cracked down. In 1948, Mr. Zeidler escaped to Allied-occupied Germany, laboured in construction, and found a job with Emanuel Lindner, one of his Bauhaus professors who had also escaped. In his early 20s, Mr. Zeidler was leading the design of factories, warehouses and medical buildings In 1951 he was drawn by the opportunity to move to Canada, believing "that an architect here would be very busy and very well paid," his wife, Jane Zeidler, recalls, "which turned out to be not entirely true." Mr. Zeidler came for a job at the firm of Blackwell & Craig in Peterborough, Ont.
The job offer turned out to be a misunderstanding, but after Mr. Zeidler showed up for his interview wearing a dark suit and carrying a cane - "in the proper German manner," his wife recalls - the firm took him on. Colleagues nicknamed him "the Duke."
Peterborough was hardly a hotbed of modernist architecture, but Mr. Zeidler helped make it into one. Through the next decade he worked as an architect and an engineer, drawing on his multidisciplinary German training, and completed more than 30 buildings around the region, including Peterborough Memorial Centre, high schools, the Beth Israel Synagogue and a dozen churches.
In 1954 with Blackwell & Craig, he finished Grace United Church.
In his design, curving beams of glue-laminated wood supported a high pointed roof that protruded above the nave. It was modest for Germany but radical for Canada. Robertson Davies, then editor of the local newspaper, came to his defence, and the building was realized. It remains in use today.
His time there brought another milestone: he met his future wife. Jane Abbott, he recalls in his memoir, was "the most beautiful woman I had ever seen." After four years of courtship, they married in 1957. The Zeidlers would have four children, Margie, Robert, Kate and Christina, over the next decade, and remain married nearly 65 years.
Jane Zeidler became a public-art consultant, and the two collaborated professionally for decades as well.
Within a few years the couple moved to Toronto, where Mr. Zeidler's career was taking off.
They found their first house in Rosedale for about $25,000, and soon moved into a nearby house on a ravine. Mr. Zeidler redesigned it with large windows facing the ravine. "It was many people's first experience of a modern house," Christina recalls.
"The adults would sit on the edge of their chairs, and children would just run out into the valley and back in" - exactly as the architect intended.
Decades later, the artist Peter Doig would paint a major canvas depicting the house.
The family's home life was busy and, his wife and daughter recall, very happy. "He was a relentlessly positive person," Jane says, "and he never said a bad word about anyone."
The kids often accompanied him to construction sites. Christina recalls a favourite family picture: The Zeidlers and their older kids were standing with hard hats at the Ontario Place construction site in the dead of winter, the infant Christina "a ball of fluff in Margie's arms."
Mr. Zeidler's work in the 1960s and 1970s was mostly on a large scale, and included an important role for him in Toronto politics and planning.
For Ontario Place, he and the office picked up the optimism and technical ambition from two things at Expo 67: Buckminster Fuller's geodesic domes and Frei Otto's German Pavilion, with its expansive textile roofs. "All these buildings had one thing in common," Mr. Zeidler wrote in 1971: "The technological possibilities of their day were used with a clear understanding of their potential and were crystallized in a form that finally became an expression of their time."
The pavilion buildings, intended to hold an exhibition about Ontario's people and culture, also drew on the Japanese Metabolist movement and the British High-Tech style. Ontario Place's exposed structure and mechanical services are "a triumphant display of high-tech virtuosity," according to the architect and critic George Baird.
They are a bold expression of the form-follows-function tenets Mr. Zeidler had learned at the Bauhaus. So did another Zeidler project of the same era: the McMaster University Health Sciences Centre. For this 1.7 millionsquare-foot complex, the firm of Craig, Zeidler & Strong developed an innovative approach: the floors were suspended from a network of columns, allowing walls to be moved at will, while between the floors were sandwiched low "interstitial spaces" that carried all the building's complex mechanical requirements.
"Its enormous grid of columns punctuates an endless landscape of medical departments, differentiated only by colour coding and carved-out courtyards," wrote Annmarie Adams, a professor at McGill University's school of architecture and an expert on hospitals. Prof. Adams views McMaster as the most important Canadian building of the past half-century, and says its main ideas have been widely imitated across Canada and globally.
For all Mr. Zeidler's aesthetic and technical ambition, he thought of his work as part of a larger whole. "More than anything, he believed that architecture was for people," Jane recalls.
"That sounds simple, but for him it was fundamental."
That mix of modern architecture and humanist values helped shape Toronto in the 1960s and 1970s. In that period, a group of young politicians, planners, architects and activists worked closely together. This "Reform group" included Jane Jacobs, whose husband, Bob, was an architect at the Zeidler office.
"Our common goal was to make the city a livable place, and not just one where people could make money," says David Crombie, mayor of Toronto from 1972 to 1978. Mr. Zeidler and some architect colleagues "were the street urchins, the troublemakers trying to make the city better."
The planning of the 1950s and 1960s (in Toronto and elsewhere) aimed to sort cities into separate areas for housing, industry and offices, remaking older areas along the way. The Reform group, following the intellectual lead of Ms. Jacobs, pushed back against this tendency. Mr. Zeidler "absolutely believed in mixed uses," Christina says. "That was a fundamental aspect of what cities were about."
Mr. Zeidler played an important role in shaping Toronto's 1976 Central Plan, which aimed to bring housing into the city's office-heavy downtown core. His colleague Ken Greenberg, a former City of Toronto planner, said Mr. Zeidler's approach had "a heavy dose" of Ms. Jacobs's influence. "He looked askance at some of the things architects were doing at the time which were monumental but sterile."
These issues came to a head with the planning of the Eaton Centre, the downtown mall on a large site owned by the Eaton's company. Their initial plan to construct the mall was roundly criticized as an imposition on the historic fabric of the city.
"They essentially would've taken a suburban mall and dropped it into downtown," Mr. Crombie recalls. Mr. Zeidler, along with Ms. Jacobs, engaged with the developers and their architects to make the building less hostile to the city.
In the end the Zeidler firm collaborated on its design. The result was inspired by Milan's famous Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, with a central 900-foot-long passageway - which Mr. Zeidler described as "an interior street" - topped with a continuous arched skylight. The result "was much less destructive to the city than it might have been," Mr. Crombie says.
The Zeidler office continued to grow through the 1970s and 1980s, although Mr. Zeidler chose to keep it at a moderate size in order to control design and maintain a sense of connection with colleagues. "The office really was like a family," Christina says. "I knew almost everyone who ever worked there." Later work included academic, residential and commercial projects as far afield as Dubai and Beijing.
Mr. Zeidler's family carried on his sensibility. In the 1990s, his daughter Margie, who trained as an architect, led the family's efforts to purchase 401 Richmond, a large brick-and-beam factory building in downtown Toronto.
The building had little commercial value at the time, but Margie saw an opportunity to turn it into a hub for artists and creative enterprises; it still is today, in the family's ownership. Mr. Zeidler collaborated with Christina on a renovation of the historic Gladstone Hotel in Toronto. Meanwhile, Kate is an interior designer and Robert is a real estate executive.
In his 80s, Mr. Zeidler stepped back gradually from the work of the Zeidler office, which remains active. His last decade was marked by Alzheimer's dementia, and he received care at home. He died there, just before his 96th birthday, in a bed with a view of the Toronto skyline and a mature forest - a view that, Jane says, he loved deeply.
Mr. Zeidler leaves his wife, their four children and five grandchildren.

Full text: One can blend fully. One can stand out. Or one can try to walk a line between the two. A line? No, a tightrope, really, since the winds of ego and the gravity of tradition almost always combine to disrupt one's balance.
Architects designing for older city neighbourhoods walk that tightrope every time. And many fall because of ego, creating neighbourhoods that are irreparably damaged in the process. It's one thing to make a bizarre-angle-and-slit-window statement at the corner of Queen's Park and Bloor Street West, but quite another to do it in a quiet, residential enclave with big trees shading street-hockey nets.
Thank goodness architects Gina Schafrick and Colin Grant - who work under the name "these architects inc." - know how to walk the line. Elegantly, even, as a recent addition to the North Toronto home of Vivek and Susan Bakshi proves.
"Susan and Viv said, ‘We really want to retain the old, cottage style' ... so when we went out to gain support from the neighbours," says Ms. Schafrick as she looks over at her clients, "you were saying that a lot of people were quite pleased that it wasn't getting demolished, that you were retaining the old character of the house."
That character has much to do with the gable. Stroll the streets tucked between Yonge Street and Mount Pleasant Road near Eglinton Avenue, and there are sidegables, front-gables, dormer-gables, and even tiny little gables on top of the free libraries on front lawns.
The problem, says Ms. Bakshi, who grew up in North Toronto, is that the three-bedroom house wasn't large enough when their family of three became a family of five. Their first thought was to transform the un-insulated attic into a bedroom. But would there also be enough room for another bathroom? And what about storage? When these architects toured the space, hunched over, all agreed it just wouldn't work.
"So off the roof went," Ms. Schafrick says with a smile.
"And we really just created a new roof, but carefully inserted within the old, original gable."
Viewed from the side - which is easy since the house sits on a corner lot - the gable is still king: the boxy addition pokes out, rather symmetrically, from either side of the gable's peak. And although the addition becomes more dominant, visually, when viewed from the front or rear, that it is clad in black steel helps push it into the background ... plus it sports its own gable to keep the street's rhythm intact.
Inside, that new gable provides a more interesting, trapezoidal shape for the tall windows in the cozy bedrooms, or the rich, creamy-white bathroom; a bathroom that sports not only the requisite egg-shaped soaker tub, but also quirky handmade, colourful Mexican sinks and some fine welding work from the Bakshi's oldest son, Jack. And speaking of do-if-yourself projects, the couple built a Japanese-style screen for the bathroom window to celebrate their years living in Tokyo (Mr. Bakshi is from London, England, but his work took them there).
A window at the rear of the addition took inspiration from a 1970s window at the front of the home, which is now clad in shou sugi ban (charred wood siding which originated in Japan). To explain: forty-five or more years ago, an architect had owned this home and he had enclosed the front porch to create his studio.
After installing a massive, commercial window he'd taken home from a jobsite, he installed a secondary window on a portion of wall that he angled outward - think of door swung partly open - to provide an edited, more private view while seated at his drafting board. To honour that architectural move, Ms. Schafrick and Mr. Grant pulled a window inward in the third-floor's home office.
"Let's do sort of a push, like a force that goes through the house," Ms. Schafrick says. "So it's sort of the reverse, the yin and yang."
It also provides a little spot for birds to take a rest.
"It's like being in a tree house," says Ms. Bakshi, now viewing the large tree from the master bedroom window, which faces the street. "No one can see us, and every morning the birds come in [to the tree], we get, like, 10 different species ... it is just lovely."
Birds, as well as squirrels, are easily spotted from the new kitchen. Here, in what was once two small rooms, a repositioned back door is made up of mostly glass, and a long window replaces a good chunk of the backsplash, which, incidentally, now features groovy, starburst tile. These architects designed sexy banquette seating to cradle the mid-century modern dining set, local shop Irpinia Kitchens did the millwork, and Knotty's Woodwork in Mississauga provided the oiled, American walnut countertops.
"We didn't realize how much we like wood until we started this," Ms. Bakshi says. Speaking of wood, the new, open-tread staircase to the third floor is both sculptural and practical, as it allows light to rain down onto the generous landing and hallway.
Overall, Attic House (as these architects inc. have billed it) should be a lesson to other tightrope walkers as to how to provide more space in a way that doesn't overpower the rest of the neighbourhood. It shows reverence for old architectural styles without being handcuffed by them. It shows, finally, that these architects are very good architects indeed.
"Gina did a fabulous job interpreting what we wanted," Ms. Bakshi says with a smile.
"People always ask, ‘What would you do differently' ... and, honestly, I can't think of anything."

Full text: 18 Paul St.
PICTON, ONT.
Asking Price: $1,799,000 Taxes: $4,114 (2021) Lot Size: 62 feet by 132 feet Agent: Faye Moxam, Century 21 Lanthorn Real Estate Ltd.
THE BACKSTORY Kevin and Sarah Reid-Morris are design and innovation consultants who were living in Oakville, Ont., when the world moved to remote working at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March, 2020.
The couple were quick to seize on the opportunity to escape the city and its lofty real estate prices. Their property search led them to a circa 1890 red-brick house listed for sale in Picton, Ont.
The small town about two hours' east of Toronto is set in bucolic Prince Edward County, where the couple often spent time unwinding. The headland jutting into Lake Ontario offers a laid-back lifestyle in the midst of rolling farmland, beaches and wineries.
The house needed extensive work to bring it up to date. But the two were drawn to the sizable lot and the original details in the Victorian-era house. There was also a stand-alone garage with space above for a spacious studio.
After they took possession, Mr. ReidMorris began to delve into the home's history. He discovered that the first owners were grocers Ellen and Thomas Reid, who purchased a parcel of land from the descendants of a United Empire Loyalist in 1868.
The Reids continued to live above their store on Main Street even after the sturdy house was built. They leased the house to Picton residents - including a merchant and a tailor - and never lived in it themselves.
Over the years, the house belonged to a series of owners, including a former blacksmith, retired farmers and a school teacher.
"It was really well-maintained over the course of its life," Mr. Reid-Morris says, "but the design choices were dated. There was no light making its way into the house because there were three or four layers of velvet curtains." As soon as the couple picked up the keys and walked through the door of 18 Paul St., Mr. Reid-Morris tore down the curtains and packed them into a box. Then the couple got down to work.
They were married on the front porch six weeks later.
"It's an important life milestone," Ms. Reid-Morris says. "It's not only a special house but it's our wedding venue."
THE HOUSE TODAY The work continued long after the wedding as the couple bolstered the insulation and sealed up cavities to make the house more energy efficient.
Today the house has five bedrooms and three bathrooms in 3,000 square feet of living space.
The footprint on the main floor remains much as it was when the home was first built.
There's a front parlour, a grand foyer, the original staircase with a wood banister leading to the second floor and another staircase in the kitchen.
The two loved the rear staircase and quickly decided it needed to be preserved at all costs.
"For someone who have never owned a house, we not only had a home but one with two staircases," Mr. ReidMorris says with a laugh.
The couple kept a 1,000square foot addition at the rear and created a family room with an office above.
The space also doubles as a guest suite with a private bathroom. The addition, built sometime in the last century, lacked the ornate woodwork and plaster of the original house so the two added trim and other details to blend the two parts together.
"That made that space so much more cozy and intimate," Ms. Reid-Morris says.
Upstairs, the primary bedroom has large windows with views of landmark Macaulay Mountain and an ensuite bathroom with soaker tub.
The 800-square-foot double garage at the rear of the house stands where a coach house likely stood, Mr. Reid-Morris says.
During the renovation, it became a workshop below, while Mr. Reid-Morris set up his office above.
"The saw was always going out there with something we were working on," he says.
The backyard provides a spacious patio under the canopy of a massive maple tree.
Mr. Reid-Morris is a photographer who sits on the board of OCAD University. He put his arts background to use when he became much more hands-on with the reno than he planned.
The couple ran into many of the challenges that contractors and homeowners faced while trying to build during the pandemic: lumber was in short supply, stores were closed and artisans were hard to get.
"You realize the importance of leveraging the skills you have," he says.
When Mr. Reid-Morris was trying the match the home's 130-year-old trim, he spent hours searching trim profiles online.
If he'd been able to walk into the local lumber yard with a sample, he would have been done in an afternoon, he points out.
For Ms. Reid-Morris, painting the intricate woodwork of the front porch - and the 38 shutters on the home's exterior - was a daunting task.
The couple found a photo taken in 1912 which showed a black-and-white trim and shutters on the red brick house. They loved that the classic scheme honoured the house while also feeling very contemporary.
"We went in over-confident of the time it would take to repaint," she says with a laugh.
Despite the challenges, the couple feels ready to put their newly acquired skills to work restoring another old house.
"It was definitely blood, sweat, tears and gut - and some frustration - but also a sense of tremendous satisfaction," Ms. Reid-Morris says of the project.
The couple have enjoyed living in the house, which is a short stroll from the restaurants, bars and theatres of Picton, but now they are heading back in the direction of Oakville to be closer to family. They've already purchased a 1904 dwelling in need of an overhaul.
The house at 18 Paul St. sold after a few days on the market for $1.76-million.
THE BEST FEATURE The kitchen was an epic challenge, Mr. Reid-Morris says, because there were five additional layers of flooring beneath the surface. He spent weeks stripping the materials.
"There was lots of stuff you had to do just to get to the starting line."
The couple laid a new floor, painted the cabinets and brightened the room with new quartz countertops. Instead of an island, they added a slab of marble that sits on a cast iron base. The vintage light fixture is also reminiscent of a French bistro.
"You don't want to insult the house but you also do not want to be restricted by seriousness," Mr. Reid-Morris says. "We wanted to add fun and quirkiness."
Mr. Reid-Morris says the vintage finds add character but the kitchen provides the conveniences of the 2020s, such as a 36inch gas range.
"We are so proud we were able to have something appropriate for the house but also suitable for modern life."

Full text: Quebec's Crees are taking a big step into real estate development with plans for a 25storey tower in Old Montreal, an investment they hope will lead to others as the First Nation expands its asset base.
Eeyou Eenou Realty Properties, the real estate arm of the Cree Regional Economic Enterprises Co. Inc. (Creeco), will partner with local developer Cogir on the $100million, mixed-use project. The tower will instantly become one of the most recognizable buildings in Montreal when complete, with a canoe shape several storeys high sculpted into the corner of its southfacing facade.
The project, known as Odea Montreal, is momentous for the Cree Nation, said Creeco president Derrick Neeposh. The building's unique design will be an immediate attention-getter in a high-traffic area, making a physical statement of sorts in Canada's second-largest city, he said. It is also a major investment outside traditional Cree territory and represents a new revenue model, Mr. Neeposh said.
The Cree people have funnelled "a lot of funding" over four decades from their financial settlements with governments toward professional services in Montreal, such as legal advice and consultants, Mr. Neeposh said. That money has flowed in one direction with little return to Cree communities, he said.
"It's time to reverse that trend," Mr. Neeposh said in a recent interview. "Time to generate money from the South so that we can bring it back to the North."
The move highlights the kind of wealth creation opportunities being pursued by Indigenous nations across Canada, from the Tahltan First Nation partnering with Skeena Resources Ltd. on a gold project in British Columbia to a coalition of Mi'kmaq First Nations taking an ownership stake worth $250-million in Halifax's Clearwater Seafoods in 2020. It also exposes the disparities between well-organized Aboriginal groups pushing ever-more-sophisticated revenue options and communities still struggling to provide basic necessities like potable water.
The Crees bought the Montreal property on the site of the soon-to-be-built tower back in 1995 when it was a luxury car dealership, Mr. Neeposh said. Back then, the site was located on what was known as Duke Street. The thoroughfare has since been renamed Robert-Bourassa Boulevard after the late Quebec premier.
The irony of a potent new symbol of Cree power sitting on a street named after one of their biggest historical antagonists is not lost on Mr. Neeposh.
It was Mr. Bourassa's government that initiated an era of massive hydroelectric development on traditional Cree territory in the 1970s without consulting the First Nation.
The Crees sued the government over the development and won, forcing Quebec to negotiate a $225-million settlement with Indigenous groups in 1975 known as the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement. When Quebec announced plans for another hydroelectric megaproject in the North, the Crees again launched legal challenges, saying the federal and provincial governments hadn't fulfilled their treaty obligations.
In 2002, another deal was struck called the Paix des Braves that gave Quebec's Crees a $3.5billion financial package over 50 years, as well as a share of the profits from future natural resources development on their ancestral land.
The Cree Nation Government's Board of Compensation was set up to manage the James Bay agreement funds. It holds public market investments, whose gains are distributed to Cree communities, and also controls economic development holding company Creeco.
In turn, Creeco has a portfolio of wholly and partly owned assets that include regional carrier Air Creebec, a facilities management company called Gestion ADC, and a builder called Cree Construction Development Co.
The construction business, one of the largest Indigneous construction firms in Canada, has built schools, clinics and air terminals in Cree communities.
It also counts as a major client Hydro-Québec, the very Crown corporation whose development it once opposed.
"We do a lot of work for Hydro," Mr. Neeposh said. "I think it's just a way of being mature and saying, you know, the past is the past. Let it be and build on to the future. ... Instead of fighting, we want to become a partner and make sure that our future generations can benefit from these partnerships."
Mr. Neeposh declined to provide any financials for Creeco, citing the need to protect confidentiality. But he said the company is aiming to develop more real estate in the years ahead. It also owns property in Laval.
Quebec's Crees have built a substantial economy through tough political situations while staying committed to their nationhood, said Miles Richardson, a Haida leader who is chairman of the University of Victoria's National Consortium for Indigenous Economic Development.
"When I see that project in Montreal, I just look at that with a fair bit of optimism and pride and just saying, ‘I like how they roll.' They're leading the way here."
The new tower was designed by Quebec-based architectural firm Lemay with the help of Indigenous architect Douglas Cardinal, who is best known for his designs of the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, and the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington. It will house 435 residential units, including 264 rental apartments and 171 condominiums, in addition to office and retail space.
Site preparation is under way with a view to opening in the spring of 2024.

Full text: In one of the first arrangements of its kind in the country, an Indigenous police force has taken over policing of a small non-Indigenous town in Alberta - a move leaders from both communities say could become a model for both reconciliation and rural policing in the province.
The Tsuut'ina Nation Police Service, known in the Tsuut'ina language as Tosguna, took over policing in Redwood Meadows, a community 20 kilometres west of Calgary, from the RCMP in November.
The nation has described the change as a reclamation of its historic authority to police its traditional lands. The arrangement may also, according to Tosguna Police Chief Keith Blake, give the local force a chance to demonstrate how First Nations can contribute to rural policing, and how they could supplement the Alberta government's efforts to build its own provincial police force.
"We hope this is used as a model," Chief Blake said. "There's a pride that we are policing the traditional lands."
Redwood Meadows, a townsite of 1,000 residents, sits within the boundaries of Tsuut'ina Nation, on land leased from the nation, but operates as a partly independent municipality. It shares its administration with Tsuut'ina's council, but also has its own mayor and council.
The decision to transfer policing from the RCMP to Tosguna came as part of lease negotiations between the nation and the townsite. At the end of 2020, Redwood Meadows finalized an agreement to lease the land from Tsuut'ina for another 75 years.
"Having those discussions over the lease, the relationship grew with the nation. So we looked at what else is possible," said Redwood Meadows Mayor Ed Perkins. "It starts with an acknowledgment that we are on traditional territory of Tsuut'ina Nation."
Chief Blake said the police force held discussions with Redwood Meadows' town council, the RCMP, Tsuut'ina Nation's leadership and the provincial government. "We all felt it would be beneficial," he said. "This is the first time that this has been done, where a First Nations force is policing a non-Indigenous community."
Tosguna has existed for more than 30 years. It started as a tiny operation that patrolled the nation's borders.
In 2004, it gained full policing authority for Tsuut'ina Nation, under Section 5 of the Alberta Police Act, which governs the establishment of local police forces in the province. Tosguna now has 26 police members - 65 per cent of whom identify as Indigenous. Another 85 per cent of the force's civilian staff identifies as Indigenous.
Tsuut'ina has a lot to oversee on its lands. The nation is involved in the construction of a ring road that forms part of a 100-kilometre east-west trade corridor around Calgary. It is also managing one of the largest First Nations development projects in North America - a business, retail and real estate development known as Taza, which spans 1,200 acres.
"We wanted to be able to patrol and take care of the nation, our assets and our people," said Emmet Crowchild, a Tsuut'ina Nation councillor.
Growing Tosguna was the vision of Mr. Crowchild's cousin, Councillor Vincent Crowchild, who died in January, 2021. "To take over the policing of Redwood Meadows - it just felt right because it's part of our community and is on our land," Mr. Crowchild said.
Mr. Perkins said expanding Tosguna's purview to include Redwood Meadows will allow the townsite to facilitate reconciliation with Indigenous peoples by reestablishing First Nations policing of traditional lands. "It's about taking things beyond a land acknowledgment - it's about deeds, not words," he said.
In the past, policing in Indigenous communities in Canada was often imposed from the outside. Indigenous people in Canada are still disproportionately likely to be incarcerated, compared with members of other racial and ethnic groups.
This meant Tosguna had to take a community-centred approach to policing, Chief Blake said.
"It's about relationship building and listening," he said. "There is an unfortunate past when it comes to First Nations policing. We have to understand the truth before we can begin reconciliation."
Tosguna has taken on the policing of Redwood Meadows without any additional funding from other levels of government or from the Redwood Meadows council. The importance of policing the land outweighed the potential costs, Chief Blake said.
The nation hopes to receive additional provincial and federal funding in the future, which Chief Blake said would help rectify longstanding inequalities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous police forces in Canada.
Tosguna's existing funding agreements with the provincial and federal governments are often year-to-year, while nonIndigenous police funding agreements are typically multi-year. Chief Blake said the annual funding model makes it difficult for his police service to plan. His officers and staff are paid less and have smaller pensions than other Canadian police officers. Tosguna officers also have no union or collective bargaining power.
Tosguna, like all members of the First Nations and Inuit Policing Program - a Public Safety Canada program that allows Indigenous communities to run their own police forces or contract out policing to provincial or federal governments - has not been designated an essential service under federal legislation, despite operating under the same regulations as other Canadian police services.
The federal government in December announced a $43.7-million plan to work with the Assembly of First Nations on legislation to recognize Indigenous policing as an essential service, which advocates believe would give First Nations police services access to increased funding.
Leaders from Redwood Meadows and Tsuut'ina Nation say they see the new policing arrangement as the next step in building a mutually respectful relationship.
"We are an example of what's possible," Mr. Perkins said. "The relationship we have with Tsuut'ina is very unique and progressive. I'm honoured to be a part of it."
"Taking this on is pretty huge to us," Mr. Crowchild said. "We take great pride in doing it. We're very proud of Tosguna and Chief Blake. It's very important to have this representation in the community."
"Reconciliation has a lot to do with it as well. We weren't trying to prove anything, but it just makes perfect sense to have our police throughout our community and on our lands. It's a huge opportunity to work hand in hand and try it."

Full text: Habib Haghjoo cannot look at the only two photographs in his living room at his east Toronto home. But he cannot bring himself to take them down.
Nothing else hangs on the walls in that room of his impeccably clean home.
The photographs show his daughter, Saharnaz Haghjoo, 37, and his eight-year-old granddaughter, Elsa Jadidi, smiling broadly as they embrace.
The pair were aboard a Ukrainian International Airlines flight that was shot down by Iranian forces two years ago, on Jan. 8, 2020. More than 100 of the 176 people killed in the crash had ties to Canada.
Habib Haghjoo says he feels stuck in time, hoping he can have just one more minute with his girls, as he calls them.
"I'm dying to see them," he says, tears falling from his eyes as he grips an empty cup of tea. "If I look at the picture, or bring any memory to my mind, it starts to hurt deep."
The 65-year-old cannot watch videos of them or leaf through old pictures, saying to do so would hurt too much.
Family, friends and strangers sent him photographs of his daughter and granddaughter after their deaths. After a while he tossed them all except for the two that remain.
"Maybe one day I will put them away, but not right now," he says.
He's still stuck in the throes of his grief.
"I am stuck in the anger stage, I am just so angry," he says. "The regime murdered them, murdered them in the worst possible way."
Lately, he's also been stuck inside his home. Ontario's latest round of pandemic restrictions has left him without access to his beloved pool at the local YMCA.
The exercise helped him in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, he says.
"I was crying and swimming ... it helped a lot," Mr. Haghjoo says. "Then the pandemic came and shut everything down."
Two years later, the pool is closed again. He's lost the only way he can really exercise with his bad back. And he lost the community there, he says.
"It's tough," he says.
Mr. Haghjoo, a computer programmer, left Iran in 1987 for Ireland. One day, while waiting for a meeting, he visited the Canadian embassy.
He read a copy of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and fell in love. After four years in Ireland, he, his wife and his four daughters left for Canada. They settled in Richmond Hill, Ont.
He landed in the middle of a recession and it was difficult to find work in his field, so he took a job at a car dealership.
In 1997, his wife, Shahnaz, died of a rare case of meningitis at 37, the same age his daughter was when she died.
"I tried to be the best father and the best mother I could be," he says.
By 2009, exhausted from his job at the car dealership, he left and became a real estate agent, which afforded him more flexible hours.
He hasn't worked since the plane crash. He says he isn't ready.
"I'm not rich, but I can pay my bills," he says.
He's depressed and anxious.
He forgets what he was saying.
He eats little.
But he has managed a few things in the past two years.
He and Siamak Jadidi, Saharnaz's husband, helped build an elementary school in Elsa's name in a poor part of Iran, in Lorestan province.
"I believe when people are educated, they won't get fooled by rulers and taken advantage of," he says. "Building a school and educating children, that's what will win eventually. That is how I will get revenge."
He also helps translate news articles to English for a website started by another family who lost loved ones in the tragedy.
The site, Rissmaan.com, highlights human-rights abuses in Iran.
Mr. Haghjoo used to practise Islam but gave up religion. He visited his daughter and granddaughter's graves twice after the plane crash but then stopped going. This past summer, however, he found himself drawn back to the cemetery and has since visited a handful of times.
"When I finish my visit, I cannot open my eyes because I'm crying so much," he says, "but it does help, it does."
Two years after the tragedy, Mr. Haghjoo says he tries to focus on his family - he has four daughters and eight grandchildren, and he'll never stop counting Saharnaz and Elsa among them, he says.
His partner of 15 years is also a tremendous help.
And he tries to focus on the good memories of his daughter and granddaughter.
"Saharnaz was my little one, she was very small, very petite, she was like a small pepper that's very hot, she was very active," he says. His daughter worked as a program manager at the YWCA, helping new immigrant women adjust to the country.
"And Elsa, she was a helper just like her mom, she was going to be a fierce, strong woman."
He smiles at those memories.
Then his face changes.
"Sometimes I feel my daughter hugging me," Mr. Haghjoo says, his voice catching. "I can feel her squeezing me, hugging me. The good memories are also sometimes very painful."

How credit unions influenced architecture

Full text: Most Quebeckers are familiar with Desjardins Group's vital role in the economic development of the province. Not as many people may realize that the financialservices co-operative's network of Caisses populaires, or credit unions, also had a direct hand in the emergence of bold architectural statements in the modernist vein and helped nurture a cohort of promising homegrown architects.
Several Caisses, some of which got their start in parish church basements, gave carte blanche in the 1960s and 70s to forwardlooking architects for the design of new branches. Not coincidentally, it was a time of significant socio-political transformation, secularization and economic emancipation of the francophone majority - what's known as the Quiet Revolution - in an era notorious for domination by the Roman Catholic Church and anglo business.
Caisse branches presenting strikingly vanguardist designs - too jarring, even ugly, for some - appeared in modest workingclass neighbourhoods, sometimes next door to, or across the street from, the local church.
Their style tapped into the school of modernism but with a distinctive homegrown twist.
These days, the legacy of this intriguing chapter in Quebec's architectural history is under pressure. As customers continue the great retail migration to the internet, financial institutions everywhere are compelled to shut branches in a move to consolidate and streamline operations.
In Quebec, Caisses are closing at a rapid clip, leaving many architecturally significant branches vulnerable to outright demolition or the loss or alteration of their unique features in modification for other uses.
"The Caisses populaires had a major influence on the development of modern architecture in Quebec," Taïka Baillargeon, assistant policy director at Héritage Montréal, said in an e-mail.
"Caisses built from the 1950s to the 1970s are truly wonderful sites highlighting the evolution and modernization of a pioneering institution in Quebec's history."
The founding Caisse populaire was opened in 1900, in Lévis, Que., by former journalist Alphonse Desjardins and his wife, Dorimène; it was the first credit union in North America. The primary goal at the time was to provide non-usurious loans to French Canadian farmers, who were routinely shut out by the banks.
Caisses were for decades closely aligned with the Catholic Church.
"The architecture of the years 1960-1970 carries the memory of the Quiet Revolution so it's not very consistent to collectively praise this period and then go about demolishing these buildings that enshrine this golden age in our built environment," Luc Noppen, professor of urban studies and heritage at the University of Quebec at Montreal, said in an e-mail.
A quirky structure from 1965 whose exterior, at least, has so far been spared complete erasure, is the Caisse populaire du SudOuest de Montréal in the formerly working-class district of SaintHenri. Known at the time as the Caisse populaire Saint-Zotique, it is a retro-futuristic two-storey edifice - created by architect Henri Brillon - boasting a steeply pitched accordion roof resting on two massive reinforced concrete crossbeams. The overall effect is highly sculptural.
"At the time, the intent was to project a sense of dynamism," said Jean Damecour, an architect who oversaw renovation work on the Caisse several years ago that involved modifications of the original design.
Jean Bélisle, a retired Concordia University art-history professor, has lived in Saint-Henri, not far from the Caisse, for more than 40 years. Saint-Zotique's daring design was very much a conscious decision to shake things up a bit and send a message of modernity and progress, he said.
"The Caisse populaire wanted to get away from the image of a bank." There was, too, a desire to go against the grain of SaintHenri's reputation as a poor, scruffy area, he added.
Mr. Brillon, now 85, says he had fun conceiving of the project as "like a hyphen between the two buildings on either side of it: the church and the funeral parlour."
He laments the bland, boxy style of most Caisses built after the period of exuberant experimentation in the sixties and seventies. "The Caisses have abandoned publicly minded architecture for a functional style."
Predating the Saint-Zotique Caisse by a couple of years is Quebec City's Caisse populaire NotreDame-du-Chemin. Designed by the fresh-out-of-school architect Jacques Racicot, the well-preserved four-storey building is unashamedly inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum in New York. Like Saint-Zotique, it makes extensive use of white reinforced concrete, the circular bands of the exterior alternating with generous fenestration on each floor. The upper levels were apartment units that could be transformed into office space.
On its heritage webpage, the city describes the project, located in the residential Montcalm neighbourhood, as "ambitious and costly" for its time.
Not everyone today is exactly enthralled. "It's so ugly and above all it breaks the homogeneity of the district," one reader says on the Société historique de Québec's Facebook site that features an article about the Caisse.
Less flamboyant is Bernard Dépatie's Caisse populaire SaintJean-Vianney in the RosemontLa-Petite-Patrie borough of Montreal. The architect worked with artist Jordi Bonet, who contributed an eye-catching grid of ceramic-tile squares to the exterior upper portion of the structure and more ceramic treatment on the ground floor. The fruitful collaboration is one of several between architects and artists in the design of Caisse populaires during that era; integrating artworks - notably murals and sculptures - into the planning of new structures was also a key element in the construction of Montreal's Métro stations in the 1960s.
Sadly, Mr. Bonet's Saint-JeanVianney ceramics suffered from neglect over the years and subsequent renovations completely masked the original artwork. The Caisse branch has been replaced by an outlet of the provincial liquor-store monopoly, Société des alcools du Québec.
For Georges Adamczyk, an architecture professor at the University of Montreal, "It's not hard to see that the national affirmation movements inspired the architects recruited to design the caisses populaires." He adds: "Generally speaking, the style of these buildings distances itself from the dominant styles of the banks," whose look was traditionally neoclassical and later international.
In his eyes, the culmination of this innovative period of Caisse design is the Complexe Desjardins in downtown Montreal, a mixed-use retail, office and hotel facility that is home to Desjardins Group and provincial government operations; it was inaugurated in 1976.
The concrete-clad brutalistinspired project consists of four towers of varying heights resting on platforms and a spacious, light-filled glass-atrium indoor square. The venture's team of designers and builders included noted urbanist Jean-Claude La Haye.
Architect Jean-Claude Marsan argues in his 1981 book Montreal in Evolution that Complexe Desjardins represents the arrival of French Canadian architecture at parity with the rest of North American architecture.
One major event that helped spur the development of a more free-spirited architectural approach in Quebec during the Quiet Revolution - indeed in all of Canada - was Montreal's wildly successful Expo 67 and its eclectic mix of national and themed pavilions in a riotous range of forms.
Also of note, ironically, is the direct role the Catholic Church played at that time in commissioning new places of worship that dramatically broke the mould of the traditional 19th-century European-style church by emphasizing sculptural forms and unadorned interior spaces.

Full text: 9 William St., Georgetown, Ont.
GEORGETOWN Asking price: $899,000 (October, 2021) Selling price: $1.1-million (October, 2021) Previous selling price: $501,000 (October, 2012); $230,000 (July, 1991) Taxes: $4,208 (2021) Days on the market: Two Listing agent: Scott Hanton, The Weir Team THE ACTION Agent Scott Hanton was concerned this semi-detached house would be in less demand than the detached variety more typical in Georgetown, Ont., which is about 60 kilometres west of downtown Toronto. Those fears quickly evaporated when two offers came in within 48 hours of listing, one of which was $201,000 over the asking price.
Mr. Hanton was astonished by the rapid escalation in prices.
"Last year, the seller had this appraised, and it was about $200,000 or $300,000 less than what it sold for a year later," Mr. Hanton said.
"All of these smaller markets - like Georgetown - are seeing these one-off sales like this that are phenomenal for the sellers and increasing all the values for the neighbours -but are also making everything out of balance for what local markets are used to."
WHAT THEY GOT This 100-year-old, 11/2-strorey house has been gradually renovated and expanded, and now has about 2,000 square feet of living space with an attached garage.
There is a formal kitchen and dining room and two entertaining areas on the main floor, plus one bedroom and one of two bathrooms.
Upstairs, there is a second bedroom, a den and open sitting area with skylights.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "To see a semi-detached property in this historical neighbourhood is rare because typically they're all detached," Mr. Hanton said.
"It's a bit dated in spots, but it's all immaculately maintained, and it's on a corner lot, so the back, side and front yards were also excellently cared for by the current resident."
The 78-foot-by 51-foot lot is also close to the town's centre and farmer's market. "You can walk in two minutes to a historic downtown, which is super charming and quaint," Mr. Hanton said.
"People wait and hover for the perfect opportunity to get into this quadrant of Georgetown."

Full text: THE LISTING U rban thinkers have hailed recent moves by the City of Toronto to eliminate bylaw requirements that forced developers to provide a parking space for most of the new homes they build, which could reshape the kind of homes that can get built in the city.
However, some say the politics of parking are far from dead.
"This decision means that developers will no longer be required to build parking spaces that home buyers don't want, making it easier for residents who live without a car to purchase a home," Mayor John Tory said when the policy was announced in December.
A key nuance in the new policy is that council may still vote to require some parking in a new project. "We've gotten rid of parking minimums, not gotten rid of parking," said former chief planner Jennifer Keesmaat, who did some of the early work on relaxing parking minimums more than eight years ago. In part, the changes finally harmonize the patchwork of parking policies from the six separate municipalities that were welded together in 1998 to form the Toronto boundaries we know today. "The amount of parking you need in North York - the transit infrastructure, the needs of people living in those homes and the density - is different than in downtown, and yet we had one minimum parking standard for the whole city."
The policy change isn't simply about who gets a parking spot; it could change the math on what makes financial sense to construct in the city's neighbourhoods. "In many sites in the city the parking minimum made it very difficult for a project to be viable," Ms. Keesmaat said. In the past, projects such as a "missingmiddle" six-plex might need to have a lot size big enough for six or more parking spaces.
But even though council has voted to break the iron link between new planning and parking, local councillors still have some tools available to them to force parking where they decide it's needed.
A small infill project owned by Alex Sharpe, chief executive officer of Spire Capital, was on the receiving end of one of the tactics that has been increasingly applied to everything from mid-size to large-scale projects. Mr. Sharpe is adding three apartments to an existing threeapartment building on Boothroyd Avenue - which has five existing parking spots. If not for a variance obtained under the old regime he might have needed to add three new spots plus some visitor spaces. Under the new policy, he could have avoided adding any parking spots.
However, on Oct. 14, 2021, the Toronto and East York Community Council adopted a motion to ban residents of his building from applying for monthly on-street parking permits in the local street parking area.
In a report to the community council, Transportation Department staff said that in April it received a request from Ward 14 councillor Paula Fletcher, "on behalf of local residents," asking to "realign Permit Parking Area 8B, to exclude the development located at 17 Boothroyd Avenue." The report stated that while Area 8B has 2,367 parking spaces and only 1,814 permits, and the demand for on-street parking has never outstripped the supply of permits, it was nevertheless a good idea to block Mr. Sharpe's future tenants from on-street parking in the area.
"I live in the ward, I invest in this area ... why am I fighting?" Mr. Sharpe asked. He said he was furious about the impact the street parking permit ban could have on future residents and the viability of his project. He suggested that it might have been easier - and more profitable - to simply follow the usual pattern of infill builders. "This has become a less desirable product," he said. "What I could have done is sever the thing in two, and stuffed in two McMansions - that would make me more money than what I'm doing. But why would I blow up a perfectly good cinder block triplex?" Urban planning experts such as UCLA professor Donald Shoup have urged municipalities to get smarter about parking policies, and have noted the old parking minimums were often an extension of exclusionary zoning rules aimed at deterring new development in existing neighbourhoods. Banning new residents from street parking could be another way to deter building applications.
"I'm often asked to do it by people in the community and I don't ... I don't want to create two classes of Torontonians," said Ward 4 councillor Gord Perks, who has not applied a parking ban in his ward but has voted with other councillors to enforce bans in theirs. In recent years, though, the tactic has been adopted by several other downtown councillors and new parking bans have been proposed and won with increasing frequency.
Mr. Perks said he trusts his colleagues have done the work to ensure those bans are necessary, but he'd like to see the bans become less permanent. "Where I'd like to land is where the city evolves some mechanism where the exclusion is time limited," Mr. Perks said.
"I think that's a shameful practice," said Ms. Keesmaat, now a private housing developer and planning consultant. "When I see those types of behaviours, I ask, what's the bigger problem? It's that we haven't properly priced parking," she said. "Inexpensive parking has a terrible costs in urban environments."
There are almost 40,000 monthly permitted parking spaces in Toronto, and the annual fee for on-street parking (first vehicle, with no private spot available) is about $233 (that includes HST) or about 63 cents a day. A second parking spot is pricier, closer to $724, which equates to just under $2 a day.
Some say those rates are so low that they effectively act as a public subsidy for private car ownership.
"It's far too low," Mr. Perks said, but he said there's little support on council to raise the rates closer to the actual value created by handing over a piece of public land for private use.
A combination of lowered parking requirements and a more hostile street-parking environment could lead to flashpoints, but Ms. Keesmaat is confident that private parking spaces will still be built in new developments where they make sense. "If you're in a very caroriented culture or environment, they don't want to build no parking; they won't be able to sell those condos," she said. "I sort of trust the market - they are inherently, incredibly conservative."

Full text: The assessed value of houses rose in nearly every community on Canada's West Coast during the second year of the pandemic, but new official estimates show smaller communities - not the province's largest cities and their suburbs - had the biggest spikes.
BC Assessment, a provincial Crown corporation, announced Tuesday that new market values for detached houses increased more than 40 per cent as of July 1, 2021, in Hope, on the eastern fringe of the Fraser Valley, and in the small Vancouver Island towns of Port Alberni and Lake Cowichan.
Meanwhile, its deputy assessor Bryan Murao said, Vancouver's values rose 16 per cent so that a typical single-family home had a value of just under $2-million, while assessments rose roughly 20 per cent in its pricey suburbs of Richmond, Burnaby and North and West Vancouver.
Mr. Murao, who has worked at the agency for 15 years, said the closest analogue to these massive spikes in value are the 2016 assessments, in which prices in and around Vancouver rose substantially before the provincial government began bringing in demand-side measures such as a tax on foreign buyers to cool the market.
These larger jumps in many smaller communities across the province were driven by some people leaving these supercharged urban markets looking for cheaper real estate or retirement options, he said.
"Let's say you sold a property in Vancouver or you could suddenly work from anywhere, where are you going to live in a place that's enjoyable?" he said Tuesday.
BC Assessment estimates values on behalf of B.C. municipalities, which use the data to determine how much homeowners will pay in property taxes. The agency says the total value of real estate in B.C. is about $2.44-trillion, an increase of nearly 22 per cent in 2021 from the year prior.
These assessments don't take into account the flurry of sales activity that occurred in the last half of 2021, Mr. Murao added, which proves the provincial real estate market remains resilient and that homeowners around the province can expect even higher assessment values for 2022.
Housing experts say this wave of new residents may offer a welcome boost to these smaller local economies, but their purchases are also hurting affordability for those already living in these communities.
Kishone Roy, the former president of the B.C. Non-Profit Housing Association who consults for government and nonprofit agencies, said this once-a-year shock of massive property value increases underscores the inequality in a system whereby the average house owner saw their property gain $200,000 to $300,000.
"As a society, there's this massive exponential increase in wealth, but the divide between the haves and have nots is perhaps creating a bigger gulf than at any point I can remember," said Kishone Roy, who prefers the gender-neutral pronoun they. "What's occurred is everybody is getting stuck in their current housing type: If you are a homeowner you may see this increase in equity - but not be able to buy anything different housing-wise.
"But if you're a renter, that gap between home ownership is now increasing faster than all of your earnings from all of your work combined."
Meanwhile, they said, the increase in home values leads to rising rents and that unaffordability trickles down to make life more difficult for homeless people.
Port Alberni Mayor Sharie Minions said it is exciting that people are choosing to move to the Vancouver Island community that weathered past downturns in the forestry sector and had a reputation for petty crime. Still, Ms. Minions, who is also a mortgage broker, said it is tough to balance this increase in home values with the dream of owning in their hometown becoming increasing more difficult.
"I really prided ourselves on being a community where someone in their 20s with a decent job - but not coming from wealth or anything like that - would be able to own a home and that is really changing now," Ms. Minions said.
She said before the pandemic, a decent detached home cost around $200,000.
Now, it is hard to find any of these houses for less than $500,000, Ms. Minions said.
Rents have also been affected, whereby a couple could find a lease on a two-bedroom unit for $800 before the pandemic but now would be lucky to find similar housing for $1,500, she said.

Tech companies slowly revitalizing Calgary's hollowed-out downtown

Full text: In the nearly two years since the COVID-19 pandemic forced workers out of Calgary's downtown towers and into home offices, the city's core has changed.
Many of the changes are subtle.
On 4th Avenue SW, the 1980s-era Sun Life Plaza building is now the Ampersand - revamped and modernized by commercial landlord Aspen Properties in an effort to attract startups and companies of the future.
In the revitalized East Village area, the massive $80-million parkade opened by the city last spring is home not just to car and bike stalls, but to Platform Calgary, a non-profit organization that will offer incubation space for startups and programming for entrepreneurs.
On 1st Street SE, 79,000 square feet of space in First Tower is now occupied by local software company Symend, which shot to prominence in 2020 after receiving $73-million in a funding round.
But perhaps the most significant change Calgarians will notice if they return to the office in 2022 is the composition of the downtown work force itself. For the first time in Calgary's history, a city core that was once almost solely the domain of the energy sector and the various companies that service it is home to a small but growing contingent of technology workers.
According to commercial real estate firm CBRE, Calgary has seen its ranks of technology workers grow by 17.9 per cent between 2015 and 2020 - an increase of 46,700 workers. Calgary also moved up six spots last year to No. 28 on CBRE's 2021 Scoring Tech Talent report, which ranks 50 North American markets according to their ability to attract and grow tech talent.
"We used to have a few tech companies, but they occupied, I would suggest, less than 250,000 square feet of the downtown core. Which is a drop in the bucket," said Greg Kwong, Calgarybased regional managing director for CBRE. "Now they represent anywhere from between 5 and 8 per cent of the occupying space in the downtown core. That still pales in comparison to the oil patch, which occupies about 80 per cent, but it's not bad."
Calgary has been working hard in recent years to diversify its oiland-gas-based economy and boost its burgeoning tech sector.
It's also been trying to tackle its downtown vacancy rate problem, which has served as a dramatic illustration of the city's economic fortunes in recent years.
Between the end of 2014 and the first quarter of 2020 - a period defined by low oil prices, corporate downsizing and economic stagnation - Calgary's downtown commercial vacancy rate increased from 9.8 per cent to 26.6 per cent. That rate has since ticked higher because of the impact of COVID-19 and 2020's sharp downturn in the price of oil. (The price of crude has since recovered to seven-year highs, but energy companies remain far below their 2014 numbers in terms of employee head counts.)
The city's downtown commercial vacancy rate sat at an eyepopping 32.9 per cent in the third quarter of 2021, according to CBRE. That amounts to 43 million square feet of space available to rent, and is by far the highest downtown vacancy rate of any major city in the country.
But as oil and gas tenants have moved out of downtown, it's created opportunities for tech startups to move in. Prime commercial real estate that was once leasing for $30 a square foot is now going for closer to $10.
"Among major markets, Calgary is now one of the lowest cost alternatives for tech companies," Mr. Kwong said. "Far lower than Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal. If you compare us to Kitchener-Waterloo, which is a hotbed of tech activity, it's kind of on par."
Calgary-based financial technology company Neo Financial, which has swelled to 400 employees since its founding in 2019, is one of those placing its bet on a future in the downtown core. The company plans to formally announce in January that it has leased 60,000 square feet of office space (the exact location is yet to be disclosed).
Neo Financial co-founder Andrew Chau (who also co-founded Winnipeg-based food delivery giant SkipTheDishes), said being downtown makes it easier for talent-hungry tech companies to attract young workers who want to live in an urban environment and have access to transit and amenities. At the same time, he said Calgary's tech sector wants to play a role in helping to bring life back downtown and solving the city's economic challenges by creating jobs and filling vacant real estate.
"The more that we can get that critical mass of exciting, fastgrowing startups and tech companies into downtown, the better," Mr. Chau said. "Because that's how we're going to sort of chip away at that 30-per-cent vacancy rate. Obviously, we won't fix it overnight, but we can continue to sort of build up and gradually sort of get back to where we were before."
City officials have suggested it will take decades, not years, to solve Calgary's empty office-tower crisis. But Susan Thompson, insight manager for Alberta with commercial real estate firm Avison Young, said there are reasons to be optimistic - not the least of which is the City of Calgary's decision last year to approve $200million in spending on downtown improvements.
Ms. Thompson also pointed out that the "trophy buildings" in downtown Calgary - the Class AA real estate that represent a third of the total office market, have a combined average vacancy rate of 7.7 per cent, proving high-quality space in a downtown location remains attractive. "We've seen a number of these buildings try to kind of reinvent themselves to attract a different type of tenant - particularly the tech sector versus the old school oil and gas sector," she said.

Come on downtown: How to reimagine Calgary's city centre

Full text: Jocelyn Phu was an urban studies student researching plans for Calgary's new East Village neighbourhood - a dense, mixed-use community on the fringes of the city's downtown - when she realized it checked a lot of boxes on her personal wish list.
It would be a quick walk into the downtown core and to the city's light-rail transit system, which would mean she could ditch her car. There would be businesses - such as a dental office, a massage therapist and, eventually, a grocery store - a stone's throw from her front door. Calgary's new central library would soon be open, and there were other amenities planned, including a community garden and a dog park.
She and her partner moved into a newly built condo tower in the East Village about six years ago. Before that, they were living in Riverbend, a suburban community in southeast Calgary.
"I was really interested to see if Calgary had appetite for higher density and for a lifestyle that wasn't oriented around a car," said Ms. Phu, 32, as she walked to the East Village dog park with her Shiba Inu, Ruby.
"I just have a soft spot for what it's like to live and work and play exclusively in a footprint where I can get anywhere I need to go in 15 minutes on my feet."
The East Village development transformed an area just east of City Hall. It has been held up as a model for how to persuade more people to live in and around downtown Calgary, which has a well-earned reputation for being a staid collection of office towers.
The push to increase the residential population in the core and reimagine the area has intensified as Calgary grapples with a downturn in its main industry, oil and gas. The fossil fuel market's gyrations have led to a downtown office vacancy rate of 30 per cent, which has eviscerated commercial property values and wreaked havoc on the city's finances.
City council approved the Greater Downtown Plan last year, which envisions luring tens of thousands of new residents in the coming decades by building new developments such as the East Village, and by converting office space into residential units.
Before the oil downturn hollowed out its office towers, Calgary had the largest gap of any major Canadian city between the number of jobs located in its downtown core and the number of people living there, according to Statistics Canada data. There were about 3.5 times more jobs in downtown Calgary than people living nearby in 2016, compared with 2.1 times in Toronto and 1.4 in Vancouver.
About 40,000 people live in downtown Calgary and adjacent neighbourhoods south of the Bow River, including just 7,500 who live in the commercial core itself, according to data from Statistics Canada and the city.
"We are hostage to a model that really was about bringing people into downtown from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., maybe staying for dinner, and then spitting them back out to their residential areas," said Deborah Yedlin, president of the Calgary Chamber of Commerce.
"But if you really want to have a vibrant downtown, you need to have people working and living there, as well. That means amenities, that means walkability, that means being able to really feel like you're as welcome on the street as you are in your home."
She argued that transforming Calgary's downtown into a place where people want to live and spend time will be key to attracting talented workers as the city attempts to diversify beyond oil and gas.
Calgary Mayor Jyoti Gondek said the city must do more than just add residential units downtown.
"It's not just residential - it's all of the accompanying uses that are there as well," she said.
"I think we get so caught in what our downtown used to be that we're missing the bigger picture. Think about every great city you've ever been to, and the number of things you can do downtown. That's what we're aspiring to."
The East Village project was driven by the Calgary Municipal Land Corp., or CMLC, a city-owned corporation that was created more than a decade ago to oversee the redevelopment of a large area known as the Rivers District, where the Elbow and Bow rivers converge. CMLC put $400-million into the East Village development, and private investors provided another $3-billion. The public money funded preparatory work such as land remediation and road building.
The next major phase of the Rivers District plan involves a large mixed-use development in and around Stampede Park that would include housing for about 8,000 people. The redevelopment plan was originally centred on a new hockey arena that would have replaced the Saddledome, but the new arena's future is now in doubt after the Calgary Flames' owners announced in late December that they were walking away from the project.
It's not clear what the arena plan's possible death could mean for the Rivers District - nor is it clear whether the Flames and the city are prepared to return to negotiations.
Sheryl McMullen, the program manager of Calgary's downtown strategy, said that while new construction projects in the Rivers District will bring more people to neighbourhoods just outside of the core, converting or knocking down existing office towers would allow people to live right downtown.
The city has set aside $45-million to provide incentives for developers to convert office space into residences, and added another $55-million because of strong demand. The city plans to announce agreements with 11 developers in early 2022. Next fall, the city will begin studying older office towers that could be knocked down for redevelopment.
Ms. McMullen said the city and CMLC will need to assess what the apparent failure of the new arena means for the Rivers District plan, though she pointed out that there are other planned amenities, such as a new convention centre and a new arts centre, that are also intended to draw residential development.
Greg Kwong, vice-president and regional managing director for commercial real estate company CBRE, is skeptical that there is significant demand in Calgary for residential units downtown, particularly in the middle of an economic downturn.
"Office space is cheap, but once you start building brand new residential, they're not going to want cheap rents or sell these condos cheaply. They're going to want top dollar," he said.
He added that new downtown residences won't sell unless the city solves its economic problems. The vacant office space in the downtown core is enough for an estimated 90,000 workers.
"Why are we building residential when there's no one to move into them?" he said. "We need to focus on getting people back to work."
Mr. Kwong stressed that he supports office-to-residential conversions and improving the downtown with things such as new arts infrastructure, but he doesn't think those things will cure what's ailing Calgary's central core.
Beverly Sandalack, an environmental design professor at the University of Calgary, said the character of the city's downtown is a result of decades of urban planning that was focused almost entirely on building up office space during oil booms.
"One-way streets were put in, instead of two-way streets. Street trees were ripped out, and it was really turned into this efficient machine," she said.
"It worked I guess okay, economically, for decades, but it's not very resilient in times like this, when the economy is really different and people's appetite for a different kind of city is also different."
Dr. Sandalack said urban planners working for the city came up with an ambitious redesign of downtown in the late 1970s that envisioned a functioning neighbourhood, with urban pathways fronted by cafés and businesses, along with building height restrictions to ensure sunlight reached the streets. City council eventually killed the exercise.
Then-mayor Ralph Klein, who went on to become the populist Progressive Conservative premier of Alberta, declared: "Sunlight does not turn the wheels in our factory."
Mary Rowe, the president and chief executive of the Canadian Urban Institute, said any part of a city that is designed for a single use - whether that's housing or office work - can't adapt when the world changes around it.
While the problem is especially acute in Calgary, she said, the issues that made its downtown vulnerable to an economic downturn exist in cities across the country.
Ms. Rowe said the type of dramatic change envisioned in Calgary requires local government to adjust zoning and other rules to encourage new developments, while provinces and the federal government have a role in providing funding.
"Otherwise, what are you going to do? Are you going to let Calgary turn into a kind of oldfashioned western ghost town?
Of course not."

Full text: Mark Shieh understands the power of transformative spaces - he started his career working as an Imagineer for the Walt Disney Company, designing theme parks. "I still have a little of that pixie dust in me," he says, recalling how transfixed he was by the magic of Disney's parks and how they felt like the happiest places on Earth.
In his current role as a real estate developer, he thinks about how the places we live in shape us and enrich us too. But he's older now, so he's considering different questions, like what are the most sustainable spaces to live in? How can we live more efficiently in smaller spaces? And how can we live well together, as thriving, supportive communities?
The answer he and his business partner, his sister Leslie Shieh, hope to unveil by the end of 2022 is a pioneering project called Tomo House, a shared housing development in Vancouver that offers private living spaces alongside plenty of communal spaces and amenities that are designed to reduce expenses and foster a sense of community.
Co-housing projects aren't new - there are more than 40 such communities in Canada already, according to the Canadian Cohousing Network - but what makes Tomo House different is that it's developer-driven. So instead of the aspiring homeowners paying the upfront costs of purchasing land together, hiring contractors, managing construction and navigating permit and approval processes - a cumulative workload that can defeat would-be co-housers - Mr. Shieh's development company, Tomo Spaces, is doing the work.
So far, eight of the building's 12 units have sold. The buyers have helped shape the design and decided on things like layout and shared parking spaces. Mr. Shieh and the co-housers call their development model "co-housing lite" because it makes shared housing accessible to more people. And while the cost of individual units isn't cheaper than regular market housing, he hopes that prices will come down as more developers and home-seekers embrace the concept.
As more do, he thinks they'll discover the pleasures of community living that he has experienced in his own life: His current home is in a restored Vancouver schoolhouse he developed that includes units for his sister, his mother-in-law and two other families. A shared walkway connects their backdoors, he says, and "that's where the serendipity happens." The families see each other and connect, he says, and act as a community. When it snowed in Vancouver this December and he was out of town, he knew he could depend on his neighbour to shovel his mother-in-law's walk.
"That's what we want Tomo House to be about," he says, noting that Tomo stands for "Together, more."
"We want to expand what it means to be neighbours - expand that into friends, into chosen families. It's all about encouraging small, local, everyday actions that are about taking care of each other."

Full text: Canada's Housing Minister says the federal government plans to take a tougher stand on investment properties to help cool housing prices.
The broad strokes of the agenda were outlined in the mandate letter the Prime Minister gave to Housing Minister Ahmed Hussen.
Among the marching orders to Mr. Hussen was to dissuade Canadians from snapping up income properties by reviewing rules around down payments and policies to curb "excessive profits."
Mr. Hussen says tamping down on the rush for investment properties and flipping, as well as discouraging foreign investors from holding on to vacant homes, is also part of a push to rein in rising home prices.
He says the government would draw a line between mom-and-pop-style landlords and large real estate trusts that own hundreds of units as a passive investment vehicle and may not care whether they are occupied.
"The point is to reduce the speculative demand in the market and help cool these astronomical increases in prices," Mr. Hussen said in an interview Tuesday.
The Canadian Real Estate Association projected in a report this month that the national average home price will have risen by 21.2 per cent year over year to $687,500 by the end of 2021.
The high cost of housing, particularly in major urban centres such as Toronto and Vancouver, drove political parties to promise multiple measures to address housing affordability concerns.
The government's economic update last week included a 1-per-cent tax on foreign-owned vacant homes, which the Finance Department estimates will bring in $200-million in the 2022-23 fiscal year.
Mr. Hussen says other measures the Liberals have in mind are beyond the reach of the federal government and will require negotiations with provinces and territories.
Among these are a promised ban on blind bidding - when sellers opt not to reveal the details of competing bids - or the right to a home inspection prior to purchase.
Mr. Hussen is familiar with such negotiations, having been part of the federal push to sign child-care deals with provinces before getting a new ministerial mandate after the Sept.
20 election. But he is equally no stranger to going around provinces directly to municipalities with funding, and may do so with a proposed $4-billion fund to accelerate the development of affordable housing projects.
The money could help offset the cost of land to build new projects, help local governments hire more planners to speed up approvals, or let cities rewrite zoning rules to push builders to add affordable units to a proposed development.

Laneway houses can lower some Vancouver home values, UBC study says

Full text: When Rory O'Flynn started building laneway houses in Vancouver soon after they were first permitted in 2009, his crews had a particularly hard time when they built near Jericho Beach or the University of B.C. - two highend west-side neighbourhoods.
"There was a lot of confrontation. They would treat you like some kind of streetworker. So I said, ‘We won't go out there any more,' " said Mr. O'Flynn, the owner of TSL Homes Ltd.
Instead, he stuck to the Main and Cambie Street areas, where "people were warm and fuzzy - they're talking to our workers."
That difference in how people in different neighbourhoods think about laneway houses - the popular infill form of housing that Vancouver has become a North American leader in - was underscored in a recent academic study from UBC's Sauder School of Business published in the Journal of Urban Economics.
Released in November, the study attracted a lot of press and local attention, since it provided additional information about the role that's being played in the city by increasingly numerous but still novel laneway homes.
Such homes, which are built at the backs of single-family yards in sizes from 600 to 1,200 square feet depending on the dimensions of the lot, account for about 5,000 applications to the city since they were legalized in 2009. Homes with laneway houses now account for 4 per cent of all sales in Vancouver, up from 1 per cent five years ago.
In looking at data about laneway homes and house sales near them between 2012 and 2017, the academic research found that laneway houses had no effect on the eventual sale prices of homes in most of Vancouver.
But in west-side neighbourhoods with more expensive homes, there could be significant differences, with homes within 100 metres of a lot with a laneway house selling for as much as 5 per cent lower than a similar house nearby that had no laneway home in the vicinity.
The researchers determined that laneway homes decreased neighbouring property values in more affluent areas because people may be concerned the additional density will put more pressure on amenities such as parking and schools, while others don't like the fact that laneway homes tend to look into their backyards, which they believe may limit the enjoyment of their outdoor spaces.
"There seemed to be more willingness to pay to avoid the intrusion on privacy," said Thomas Davidoff, one of the two University of B.C. professors who did the study, along with a colleague from Simon Fraser University.
Prof. Davidoff said the study results indicated that the city should perhaps expend less effort on trying to insert "missing middle" housing to those kinds of neighbourhoods, since it was affecting property values.
But others familiar with laneway homes - real estate agents, builders and owners - say that they have some doubts about whether that effect still holds true. And, even if it does, it could be a positive one.
"It's remarkable that they've been able to find a social cure for the rapid rise of housing costs," Jake Fry, the founder of Smallworks, the company that championed the idea of laneway houses, said jokingly.
On a more serious note, he added that the idea embedded in the study that it's a bad thing to reduce the value of housing in upscale neighbourhoods betrays a perspective that not everyone shares.
"When you get this type of discourse, it shows how much the consolidation of wealth is acting against community-building."
Beyond that, he and many others say that the negative perceptions of laneway homes is something that seems to have evaporated everywhere, even on the west side.
That's something that University of B.C. sociology professor Guy Stecklow found when he had a laneway home built behind his house near 20th Avenue and Wallace Street.
"I haven't had anybody complain. We've had no reaction," said Prof. Stecklow, who had the house built a year and a half ago for his mother. "In a lot of cases, it's turning an old lot into something more attractive." He's hoping for even more so that the laneways will become engaging mini-streets, rather than garbage-filled alleys.
Realtor Marty Pospichil, whose agency sells homes all over town, said he's seen no price differential for a property near another lot with a laneway house. In fact, on the west side, where lots are larger, laneway homes are less noticeable than on the east side, he said.
Greg Birch, whose company Silvercrest Custom Homes began including laneway homes in its portfolio as of 2015, said he's found that people are very receptive to them in their neighbourhoods.
"I haven't had any abuse - I had people come out and ask me about the pricing," Mr. Birch said.
If there's a question that people have about laneway homes, it's whether building one will affect their property values and financial well-being.
Prof. Davidoff said the research shows that building a laneway house pays for itself on the east side - through an increased price when the property sells - but doesn't on the west side. There, people who want the whole yard to themselves will pay as much for that as another buyer will for a house with a laneway.
Mr. Pospichil said his sales records show that houses with laneway homes sell for more than comparable ones without, "but the added value is less than the cost of building."
The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver hasn't done any analysis on the effects of laneway homes, except to track what proportion of total sales they represent.
But builders firmly believe there is a healthy financial return. They say that a property that adds a laneway home will see an increase in its eventual sale price that exceeds the construction cost.
The financial benefits can start even before the sale. One laneway home Mr. Birch built, in the Dunbar area, is pulling in $3,100 in rent for the owner of the main house - a healthy return on the approximately $350,000-plus-GST cost of construction. (Almost all laneway homes in Vancouver are rentals - because that's all the city would allow originally, wanting to provide additional rental stock rather than more purchase options.)
TSL Homes' Mr. O'Flynn is also an ardent believer in the value of laneway homes. For the $350,00 to $450,000 a laneway house costs to build, the rent that can be charged is significantly more than the mortgage payments on that investment.
"And that's an investment that will never go sideways - it will always go up," he said.
In spite of that potential, his company stopped building laneway houses two years ago because the city's permitting system was bogged down to the point that he couldn't deal with it any more, Mr. O'Flynn said.
That appears to be a common sentiment within the sector, as building permits for laneway homes have dropped from a high of 736 in 2018, to just 293 in 2021 (as of mid-December).
But there is still a steady stream of interest, partly because many people get them built not strictly for financial reasons, but to help with housing for either parents or children.
In spite of that, owners looking to build laneway homes are not in the majority, realtor Mr. Pospischil said.
"It's not common in Vancouver. The laneway is great for people who want that, but what per cent of buyers are in that category? Most people purchasing a home want the outdoor space."

Full text: In a disadvantaged part of Toronto teetering on the edge of major redevelopment, a new construction company that is majority-owned by a local nonprofit is hoping to the tip the economic scales in favour of residents.
Aecon-Golden Mile, a partnership between the construction giant Aecon Group Inc. and the Centre for Inclusive Economic Opportunity (CIEO), an umbrella organization of community groups, intends to take on a variety of building projects in the city's Greater Golden Mile neighbourhood at Eglinton Avenue East and Warden Avenue.
The neighbourhood will be a stop on the yet-to-be-completed Eglinton Crosstown light-rail line. The city expects the improved transit access to drive land development and lure about 40,000 additional residents to the Golden Mile within the next 20 years. There are currently 12 development applications for sites in the area. Together, they propose about 28,000 new housing units.
Aecon-Golden Mile's stated mission is to direct some of the wealth from all that new construction back to the neighbourhood's residents, who have been affected by decades of inequality.
The company is 51-per-cent owned by the non-profit CIEO, meaning local residents will have a majority say over decision making. More than half of the company's revenue will flow directly back into the neighbourhood. Aecon will train locals in both administration and trades.
The pandemic has worsened poverty over the past two years in the Golden Mile, where many residents cope with food insecurity, lack of internet access and isolation. Locals have long expressed concerns about being pushed out by gentrification.
The new construction company could be a lifeline for many residents, said Joshua Adedamola, an executive committee member for the project.
"This is life changing. It's empowering. It will help us build a better world for our children," he said.
During the 1940s, the Golden Mile was an industrial milieu. At first, its factories produced munitions - then, consumer goods.
Later, as industry fled the neighbourhood in search of cheaper real estate, the factories were replaced by big box stores - a retail format that now dominates the neighbourhood.
Today, many residents leave the neighbourhood for work, often in precarious or front-line jobs. Despite a higher-than-average education rate, income and employment rates in the Golden Mile are below average compared with the rest of the city, according to the United Way.
A 2018 survey by the city found the median household income in the area was $57,552 before taxes, nearly $10,000 less than the city average.
Those hired by the construction company could see their incomes raised to $100,000 a year, and they will receive pensions, Mr. Adedamola said. He expects the company to employ 100 people, and to provide workers with opportunities to enter the trades industry for the first time, or train as students.
Mr. Adedamola expects the company will start taking on projects in January.
The venture began in 2018 after United Way Greater Toronto launched Inclusive Local Economic Opportunity, a joint initiative with the Bank of Montreal aimed at tackling growing inequality in Toronto. The construction company is just one of five projects taking place in the Golden Mile neighbourhood under the initiative. If successful, the company's business model could be expanded to other Toronto communities.
"We realized that the demographic of this Greater Golden Mile, who are disproportionally newcomers and immigrants, people living in poverty, racialized communities, have been disproportionately impacted by the lack of local economic opportunities," said Daniele Zanotti, United Way president for the Greater Toronto Area.
BMO president Darryl White said the Inclusive Local Economic Opportunity initiative is unique in the way it brings together locals, business leaders and local government.
"We all bring such different skills and leverage to this equation. I didn't realize how much more leverage you could have when you convene your resources," he said.
While corporations are often well-intentioned, Mr. White said, having local community members, non-profit agencies and urban planners at the same table has been key to making meaningful progress that is focused on the needs of residents, within the bounds of what is possible.
According to Laura Hammond, a Golden Mile resident and executive director of a local tenant association called the Birchmount Community Action Council, the construction company will benefit not just those who work directly for it, but also the rest of the neighbourhood.
"Whether they're given training for new jobs, business incubation opportunities or affordable commercial spaces, people will be able to work close to where they live and really foster community," Ms. Hammond said.
With stable employment, she said, residents could have opportunities to move out of subsidized housing and start building wealth through home ownership as the neighbourhood's property values rise.

Full text: The signs of a labour shortage are everywhere in this town of 4,500 in southern Manitoba.
Billboards pleading for help pop up often by the side of Highway 75, which runs from Winnipeg to Altona, and then to the U.S.
border. One pitches a night-shift premium. Another company counters with the perk of no night work.
And then there's the straightto-the-point sign from Elmer's Manufacturing Ltd., on the northern edge of Altona: "Great welders wanted." That missive has stayed planted by the highway for the entire fall season.
The agricultural equipment maker has 25 welders, but enough business to employ 35. Experienced welders are in short supply, however - like pretty much every kind of worker in Altona. Local businesses are all scrabbling for staff, from the region's largest employer, the printing firm Friesens Corp., to the smallest.
That was true even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Since early 2020, however, the combination of rising agricultural commodity prices and a shift of consumer dollars from services to tangible items - including real estate - has created intense competition for skilled industrial tradespeople, says Mike Friesen, Elmer's chief executive officer.
"Everyone is running at 110 per cent," he says.
Mr. Friesen said other companies have begun to offer hiring bonuses, and initial wages being advertised in the area have jumped by 20 per cent to 30 per cent.
Elmer's hasn't fully followed suit - at least not yet - though Mr. Friesen says his company has bumped up its starting wages somewhat.
Poaching has become rampant, he says, but ultimately selfdefeating. What's really needed, Mr. Friesen adds, is more workers to add to Altona's shallow labour pool - a local problem that's also being experienced on a national scale.
On that front, Altona benefited from lucky timing, becoming one of 11 communities across Canada to take part in a federal pilot program that gives skilled foreign workers a fast track to permanent residence.
Altona began accepting applications under that program in November, 2019, with an allotment of 175 spots for the first two years. But the pandemic disrupted the immigration process for overseas candidates.
By early November, 2021, 14 applicants - many with spouses also eligible to work - had arrived from countries including South Korea, Nigeria, the Philippines and Poland. Another 25 applicants have been approved, but have yet to arrive.
The town is no stranger to greeting newcomers, with a wave of Mennonite emigrants from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America arriving a decade ago, reinforcing the Mennonite roots of the community. More recently, Altona welcomed an influx of refugees from Syria.
The latest arrivals have added to the growing multicultural feel of the town, with a Filipinothemed restaurant opening not long ago, Mayor Al Friesen says.
"It's been a real positive thing, it's broadened our horizons."
Indeed, the pandemic has left Altona with fewer new faces than it had hoped for. Stephanie Harris, Altona's economic development officer, estimates another 120 full-time jobs could be filled immediately under the program, given enough applicants to match to local businesses. As is the case nationally, immigration has not proven to be a panacea for a persistent and growing labour shortage.

Full text: There's an old house in Fort Severn, Ont., that has sat abandoned for decades.
The windows of the single-storey building are long gone, but the weathered silver tamarack siding is a reminder of how homes were once built with locally available materials in Ontario's most northern community.
These days, customized housing kits of vinyl siding and asphalt shingles are shipped hundreds of kilometres on a flatbed truck by winter road to the remote community, situated along the southern coast of Hudson Bay. A barge delivers goods and supplies in summer when the bay isn't frozen over.
The community is trying a new housing type, designed by Indigenous architects who worked with Fort Severn as part of an initiative by the National Research Council of Canada called Path to Healthy Homes.
They say they have come up with a better solution to the inadequate housing program provided by the federal government, which is responsible for on-reserve infrastructure such as housing.
Called the Resilient Duplex for Fort Severn First Nation, it is one of four new housing types designed by four First Nations architects to meet the specific needs of four different Indigenous communities.
David Fortin is the Métis architect who co-ordinated Path to Healthy Homes, an initiative that evolved from the work of the First Nations National Building Officers Association. The association developed a technical guide for Northern housing to help communities that were "resorting back to previous ways of building that were flawed, and causing a lot of problems" under the federal government's on-reserve housing program.
The guide provides straightforward solutions, Mr. Fortin said. "If you live in this region, these are the walls we recommend. And here's how you can build them."
Mr. Fortin said Indigenous communities have their own specific housing requirements and needs that should be factored into design plans.
"You can't take a catalogue housing approach to Northern communities," he said. "Communities need to be consulted with and we need to know each community's needs before we go make assumptions."
Mr. Fortin looked to four First Nations architects to consult with the communities, including Brian Porter from Two Row Architect in Ohsweken, Ont., who had already struck up a partnership with Shirley Blumberg from Toronto-based KPMB Architects to address the disparities of First Nations housing.
Ms. Blumberg said current suburban-type designs of singledetached houses aligned along roads are "completely inappropriate for Northern communities in every way ... without any real thought about the community."
"There's a real challenge building housing," in the North, she said. "Particularly when it's overcrowded, as it tends to be in the smaller communities of the North because of the extreme climate and humidity. And as you know, humidity creates mould," she said.
Mr. Fortin said ventilation units often don't work in Northern climates for a number of reasons, including poor location within the house and not being cost effective.
The challenge also includes the bureaucracy of the Ministry of Indigenous Services, the department responsible for on-reserve housing, said Mr. Porter, who spent several days in Fort Severn learning from the leadership and its housing department.
"You can't take this prototype response that [Indigenous Services] has been doing for decades and just rubber stamp these prototypical houses across Canada. It's not the right thing to do," Mr. Porter said.
Ms. Blumberg said the current system is "appalling" and results in "completely and utterly inappropriate" housing that will make people sick from mould within five years.
Mr. Porter said coming up with a community-based solution meant thinking outside the traditional architectural box.
"How do you get materials into the communities, whether it's winter ice road or barge? Then once you get to the communities, what's the capacity there for them to build their own?" What Mr. Porter's team discovered was that Fort Severn was "doing a lot of things right," including establishing its own housing work force with plumbers, electricians and carpenters.
The community, which must build on unstable muskeg terrain, also uses "adjustable spaceframe technology" in the foundations, which involves laying down gravel pads about six feet below ground level and backfilling with gravel and sand. This evenly distributes the weight of the houses, helping to prevent any shifting that occurs over time that could cause foundation leaks and splits.
The process makes sense, said the architects, but the gravel also ends up above ground, making the outdoor area less than ideal for children playing.
Mr. Porter said they were able to offer improvements to Fort Severn's local housing team, including insulation that can withstand the humidity and moisture.
Two Row/KPMB's Resilient Duplex design employs an engineered stick-frame envelope, similar to those used in Passive Houses, which the designers say combines "high energy performance with ease of construction and maintenance. A lightweight space-frame foundation eliminates the need for concrete and can be hand-adjusted as the ground shifts."
The houses can be configured as a combination of small and large units to accommodate the growth of families with elders and young people, the groups identified as most in need of housing during community consultations.
"One side was a fairly large unit that had a flexible loft that could be converted into extra bedrooms or ... a family-run business," Mr. Porter said. "They could kind of fine-tune the dynamics of their own household, and then attach to it with a small apartment that had its own its own bathroom."
Built in a cluster of six, the multigenerational duplex units are connected through raised walkways centralizing an outdoor gathering and play area to host traditional activities such as smoking fish and wild game that keep community members connected to the land and culture.
A separate work area outside the unit's main entrance allows space for vehicles such as pickup trucks and snowmobiles, and the mechanical work that goes along with them. The design factors in small details significant to the local conditions, such as livingroom windows that are positioned to get the most daylight and entry doors that minimize snow drifts.
On Monday, the Resilient Duplex for Fort Severn First Nation won Canadian Architect's 2021 Award of Excellence.
Fort Severn First Nation Chief Paul Burke said they plan to start building the new housing type in the spring, which will be an improvement to existing conditions that often see multiple families living under one roof.
"Historically, we've always focused on let's go big, let's go with four- or five-bedroom homes here. But we don't need four- or five-bedroom homes," he said, adding that smaller families are the ones in need right now.
Mr. Burke said regular housing funds from Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) get eaten up by maintenance and renovations to existing homes that are decades old, and that the community is short about 40 houses.
Indigenous Services recently agreed to funding to build two new houses, which Mr. Burke will try to spread out for three, using the Two Row/KPMB design.
Mr. Burke said other funding they received from ISC, for mental-health supports, for example, is pointless when people don't have the space they need to be healthy and thrive.
"A lot of the mental-health issues derive from overcrowded housing," Mr. Burke said. "So you put somebody through mentalhealth counselling and all that stuff and say, ‘You got your stamp of approval, you're sane.' And then you dump them back in the same situation again.
What does that solve? To me, it's just a whole lot of a waste of money."
Fort Severn is currently completing a new subdivision with a six-plex unit and five four-bedroom duplex units. They are working to ensure they have the infrastructure to support the new Resilient Duplex units.
Mr. Burke says he's looking forward to adding the Two Row/ KPMB design to the First Nation's housing mix. "It's real simple to add to the house as a family grows," Mr. Burke said.
"We looked at the the best features of all the houses that were built here. We like this, we like that, this works, this doesn't work. And that's how we came up with the design," Mr. Burke said.
Other housing designs from the Path to Healthy Homes project were led by First Nations architects Alfred Waugh, Eladia Smoke and Kelly Bapty, and include a large nine-bedroom multigenerational home with a huge kitchen in Manitoba, tiny homes for elders and single males in the Northwest Territories, and log construction using fire-ravaged trees in Northern B.C.
"They very much wanted to connect to the land," Ms. Blumberg said.
"Because we're wasting a hell of a lot of money and making people sick. And you can't solve any other problems until you've solved housing," she said.

Full text: Even before the pandemic, main streets faced challenges owing to competition from malls and rising real estate costs. Add the lockdowns, shifts to hybrid work and online shopping, and today nearly every retail block is likely to have at least one vacant storefront.
But with the economy opening up, some experts are saying the tough lessons learned in the past two years may be just what was needed to start up a main street revival.
"COVID could be a positive for smallscale businesses. It is forcing a rethink of the way that people shop and use public space," says Mary Rowe, chief executive officer of the Canadian Urban Institute, which has launched a national campaign called Bring Back Main Street.
Businesses and main streets have been assisted with unprecedented policy changes and large-scale programs, including commercial rent relief, wage subsidies, emergency financing and a wide array of other programs initiated by federal, provincial and city governments, Ms. Rowe says.
"Among the bold steps that city governments have taken that would have been difficult to contemplate prepandemic are rapid sidewalk and patio expansions, repurposing of roads, major realignments of services, widespread property tax deferrals and other financial support measures."
WHAT IS MAIN STREET?
The definition of main street is not just historic downtown high streets, Ms. Rowe says. "It can be a strip mall, or four corners with a beloved corner store and restaurant that have attracted other businesses. I think main street is just a code for gathering place, and we want to encourage providing these places the resources to rebuild what local people need and want."
The lockdowns created an unprecedented sense of urgency, says Rino Bortolin, city councillor for the City of Windsor, Ont. "The BIA that represents downtown Windsor was extremely responsive during the pandemic and one of the biggest successes was the way [we] were able to reduce the bureaucratic red tape that had built up over decades." For example, in a matter of weeks, they were able to change the complete process in which hospitality outlets could apply for patio licences, Mr. Bortolin points out.
"That may not be a big deal in the private sector, but in the public sector that is a game changer, and it helped many restaurants expand their clientele."
There's still a lot of work to do, as debt accumulated during the shutdowns threatens business survival. More than 40 per cent of Canadian restaurants could not pay October rent in full and on time.
That's up from 38 per cent in September and 32 per cent in August, according to a survey of 3,181 small-business owners conducted by Alignable, an online referral network for small businesses. It found 33 per cent of retailers and 47 per cent of beauty salons have also fallen behind on rent.
A big factor is the continued lack of foot traffic in retail districts as many people continue to work from home and shop online, says Frank Magliocco, national real estate leader for PwC Canada. However, as the economy begins to rebound, foot traffic will likely increase, he adds.
A new PwC Consumer Insights survey found Canadians want great in-store experiences again and will be actively seeking them.
Some retail landlords are accelerating efforts to evolve their properties by seeking zoning changes to incorporate other uses into the mix, such as condominiums or multifamily rentals in place of parking lots, which will provide more local customers for retailers, Mr. Magliocco adds.
Financial cores remain a challenge.
"First and foremost, the financial institutions have to go back to work, and that one change will see at least a 50-per-cent improvement in the viability of downtown retail in major cities across Canada," says Stan Krawitz, vice-chairman of Savills Canada. "It's the financial-services companies that have been the slowest to return to the office and they are also the largest employers in downtown cores."
There is also a fall-off of retail along the high streets, but these are often fashion retailers affected by the fact that many shoppers have turned to e-commerce, he says. "The successful retailers will have to adopt a hybrid model that includes e-commerce and create incredible experiences to lure customers back into the physical store."
The best examples are the high-end fashion retailers in Toronto's Yorkville, and while there are vacancies, the stores that survived have incorporated "wow factors, the newest, the latest, the greatest on display," Mr. Krawitz says. "They've introduced different types of music and design, kept up with pop culture and made it interesting for their clients, particularly the younger generation who are most apt to go into the stores."
OPPORTUNITIES POP UP FOR ENTREPRENEURS The pandemic's disruptions of workplaces also appear to be stimulating entrepreneurial spirit, says Linda Farha, founder of popupgo.com, which arranges short-term leases of vacant store space. She says inquiries from startups, as well as landlords and brands, have accelerated in recent months.
"With the holidays coming up people are shopping earlier than they normally would, so retailers and brands are trying to establish a presence earlier," Ms. Farha says.
"There's still a bit of hesitancy because no one is certain if there's going to be another lockdown, but what we're seeing is that people are attracted to physical shopping, specifically pop-ups. And the millennials, who are most people's targets these days, don't want to buy online - they want to see and experience before they buy."
Not only do pop-ups reanimate vacant space, but if they succeed, they may become permanent tenants, she adds.
A resurgence in demand after a series of restrictions and lockdowns and nightly curfews is already apparent on the main streets of Montreal, says Luciano D'Iorio, regional president of commercial real estate brokerage firm CDNGlobal Québec.
Montreal retail sales increased by 22 per cent to date this year compared with 2020 and more than 5 per cent compared with prepandemic 2019, according to recent data from Statistics Canada and CoStar.
"Following the pandemic, the need for merchants and business associations is even higher because programming and activities that bring people back are in high demand - everything from parades and festivals to sidewalk sales," he says.
This is working in Montreal.
"Along Sainte-Catherine Street, between Saint-Urbain and Atwater streets, you're looking at an 11-per-cent vacancy rate. That compares very well with other major shopping streets across North America. I have seen stats in New York that show Fifth Avenue at 26-per-cent vacancy and Times Square at 31 per cent."
Since September, the return of in-person classes at Concordia and McGill universities, both located downtown, have added thousands of pedestrians to the core and merchants around the schools are starting to recover.
Currently, there is still about 55 per cent of office employees working from home, leaving 45 per cent actually heading into a commercial setting," Mr. D'Iorio says.
"Now we need to work on getting those numbers up. Additionally, the missing piece for a resurgence in foot traffic at a shopping destination like Sainte-Catherine Street West is still tourism, and hopefully we can make that happen."
"We are in an interesting moment that is forcing a rethink of the way people shop and use public space," Ms. Rowe says. "I think we're going to see more cultural spaces evolve and smaller-scale businesses that make a neighbourhood more complete. I also expect some vendors will share spaces, so they don't need to have their own storefront."
The more appealing and mixed-use a neighbourhood is, the more resilient it will be, she adds. "I don't think anybody has any idea yet what is going to catalyze from this experience."

Full text: As ski season launches in Canada, resorts are facing a critical labour shortage and the industry is asking the federal government to speed up visa approvals for workers from abroad.
Executives say the shortage is a result of immigration delays. Thousands of jobs are open, but Canadians aren't biting; locals say the wages are just not adequate in expensive ski towns. The COVID-19 variant concerns and, for those in British Columbia, the devastation of recent flooding are compounding the challenges.
Ski resorts typically rely on seasonal employees on working holiday visas, often through the International Experience Canada program, an agreement with 35 countries - including Australia, New Zealand and Britain - that facilitates the hiring of young seasonal workers.
Many are between 18 and 25 and taking a break after high school or university. They fill the bulk of the roles on the ski hills, as well as the retail, service or hospitality jobs in the surrounding villages.
But the pandemic has made travelling uncertain and even impossible. For Australians, who make up a large number of foreign workers at Canadian ski resorts, national travel restrictions were only lifted at the end of October.
According to Canadian Ski Council president Paul Pinchbeck, the situation is dire. After a near-record-breaking 2020 season - Quebec, for instance, exceeded its 10-year visitor high - he expects another busy winter.
Without more staff, the surrounding businesses such as restaurants, which faced tight restrictions all summer, will be forced to close or reduce their operating hours, further hampering the economic recovery of the industry.
"We know we have employees from all over the globe who want to come and work in Canada," Mr. Pinchbeck said. "If we can get this unravelled as quickly as possible at the federal level, we can still benefit and make up time."
On Nov. 15, the Canadian Ski Council, which represents 236 ski areas across the country, called on Ottawa to expedite its visa process, saying as much as 30 per cent of jobs risk going unfilled this winter.
In a statement to The Globe and Mail, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada said it was prioritizing visas for workers serving essential sectors and that the processing time for International Experience Canada visas is currently eight weeks, which means workers who applied only recently won't be arriving for at least two months. The portal closed to new applicants for this ski season on Nov. 12.
Michael Ballingall, senior vicepresident at Big White Ski Resort Ltd. near Kelowna, B.C., said his resort would typically hire more than 500 seasonal workers. This year, despite interest from abroad, just 15 potential employees have had their holiday permits accepted.
With so many jobs available, resorts are instead trying to attract more Canadians, with little success.
"We are increasing wages, we are increasing offerings to try and attract people, but at this point, there just doesn't seem to be people who are ready to work," Mr. Pinchbeck said.
In early November, Blue Mountain Resort in Ontario said it would raise entry-level rates to $16.50 an hour from $15.20.
"Right now, people have a lot of choice," said Lesley Biffin, vice-president of human resources at Blue Mountain. "Businesses are coming out of the pandemic and they are ready to open and ready to go full steam ahead. So increasing our minimum wage, that just helps us be a little bit more competitive."
The competition has extended past the slopes.
Parks Canada closed Miette Hot Springs, one of its three hotsprings locations in the Canadian Rockies, this fall because of a shortage of lifeguards. According to spokesperson James Eastham, first aid, CPR and courses to obtain National Lifeguard certificates were cancelled for 18 months, limiting the pool of potential employees for this season.
Parks Canada expects to open Miette in May, 2022.
Local businesses, too, are in search of employees. Christina Antoniak, who owns three restaurants in the Kelowna area, said she is having a hard time holding on to staff - currently, just 60 of her 90 available roles are filled. She said she has had to reduce operation to three days in one of her restaurants as a result.
For a company that only operates during the winter, it's a significant blow.
"It's a really challenging time.
These jobs are not attractive to Canadians no matter how much money we're offering. Not a lot of Canadians choose to have a fivemonth position, even with increased wages," Ms. Antoniak said.
The five-month gigs are attractive to foreign workers looking for fun experiences, and minimum wage is acceptable for the short term, but many locals say the offerings are unappealing.
The lack of affordable housing in ski towns is another off-putting problem. Resort real estate is notoriously expensive, and prices shot up as Airbnb rentals proliferated and, more recently, as Canadians moved to rural areas during the pandemic.
Some resorts offer discounts to employees, but they are not always available to everyone.
Liam Harknett, who has worked at Big White in B.C. for the past three years since graduating from high school, said the housing situation has made working in ski towns unattractive for many young people.
"Landlords won't give you a single room - they'll try to squeeze as many people as possible. Last year, I was living in a storage room that was being used as a double room. There was no ventilation and no windows - this is during COVID. It was totally illegal. I complained, but nothing ever came of it," he said.
At Big White, as with other ski resorts, international employees can expect to pay as much as $800 a month for a quad room with bunk beds. That may be acceptable to someone looking for a new experience, Mr. Harknett said, but for locals hoping to save up money, minimum wage won't do in an expensive town. This is especially so during a pandemic, when physical distancing and health are top of mind.
When asked about accommodation, Mr. Ballingall of Big White said his company offers discounted housing for 408 employees on a week-by-week basis.
While housing problems are common to many ski hills, Carla Campbell, who has worked at several resorts including Big White, said the situation is not as grim at other ski towns, especially those close to larger cities. At SilverStar Mountain Resort in B.C., for instance, all staff who want rooms can get one this year, as the company booked additional hotel rooms in nearby Vernon, said Ian Jenkins, the company's director of accommodation.
However, not all resorts have this advantage of urban proximity. Ms. Campbell points to another issue plaguing villages: accessibility. Ski towns are often rural and isolated, meaning that, for those not living locally, getting to work can be a problem.
Typically, young Big White employees could depend on a shuttle, she said, but this year it is not running because of the pandemic. The drive from the city to the slopes can reach an hour long in snowy conditions, and for young drivers who are new to the roads or don't have their own vehicles, this makes getting to work difficult.
Mr. Ballingall said there is a shuttle service available for housekeeping staff, as well as internally organized carpools from local cities. In addition, he said, staff receive a free ski pass, a year-end bonus, 40 per cent off food, free lessons and discounts on retail and rental equipment.

Full text: Environmentalists are claiming a victory against sprawl after Hamilton City Council voted not to designate more farmland for housing over the next 30 years, defying warnings from Queen's Park that this would further restrict the supply of needed new homes.
It's an example that activists in some of Toronto's outer suburbs hope their municipal politicians could be persuaded to follow, even as Ontario's Municipal Affairs Minister says he could overturn Hamilton's move.
Local governments are scrambling to update their own official plans in the coming months to conform with the Progressive Conservative government's changes to its predecessor Liberals' land-use planning policies for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, which curls around Toronto from Niagara to Peterborough.
The government says its aim is to get more much-needed housing built and keep up with rapid growth. But environmentalists say by lowering minimum density requirements, extending municipal plans out to 2051 and relying on inflated population projections, Ontario is forcing communities to earmark too much land for development, and locking in sprawl. It's a windfall for land speculators in the short term, they say, and a white elephant for municipal budgets in the long term, as spread-out housing results in fewer taxpayers.
Hamilton's decision last week came after months of campaigning by both environmentalists and developers. City council voted 11-3 against its own planning department's recommendation, which would have designated 1,310 hectares on the city's outskirts for development.
Phil Pothen, a lawyer with the group Environmental Defence, says the city's move is a "transformative template" for other places looking to resist the province and build more compact communities that can be served by public transit.
That's because Hamilton council not only froze the city's builtup urban boundary, it told planners to look at how to allow enough housing - an expected 110,300 units - inside the city to still hit the province's targets, a tall task that calls for a massive rewrite of zoning and planning policies. Hamilton city planners had warned it would be impossible to hit the province's growth targets without expanding the urban boundary, and that doing so would mean stuffing as much as 80 per cent of Hamilton's growth inside its built-up area, more than double its current intensification rate.
This would result in more apartments and too few singlefamily homes, the city's planners said in their report to council, missing targets set by a consultants' report done to conform with the province's new "market-based" land-needs assessment process.
Ontario Municipal Affairs Minister Steve Clark, who warned in an op-ed in The Hamilton Spectator last month that the move would further drive up home prices, would not rule out overriding the city's plan.
"In Ontario, we've got a housing crisis," he said. "We don't have enough supply to meet demand. So we can't sit back and do nothing."
Hamilton city Councillor JohnPaul Danko said it will be harder politically for the province to block his city's anti-sprawl plan if others follow suit: "It's kind of a watershed moment for growth planning in Ontario, whether other municipalities will see this as, well, ‘Hamilton did it, so we can take that bold step as well.' " Halton, Durham and Peel Regions are still debating their own official plans, ahead of a July 1 deadline that Environmental Defence lawyer Mr. Pothen notes is after the June 2 provincial election, when a new government could change direction. Last month, York Regional Council rejected pleas from environmentalists and endorsed a plan that opens up 80 per cent of the region's remaining agricultural land outside the protected Greenbelt.
Opposition NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, the MPP for Hamilton Centre, said she supports Hamilton's decision to beat back sprawl, and called the minister's intervention "bullying."
Economic consultant Frank Clayton, co-founder of Ryerson University's Centre for Urban Research and Land Development, warns that Hamilton will fail to produce enough detached singlefamily homes to meet market demand and that buyers - including those fleeing Toronto house prices for Hamilton - will end up feeding real-estate booms in places farther afield such as Woodstock or Brantford.
"People will go someplace else if they can't find the housing they want," Dr. Clayton said.
Critics say sprawl is more than an environmental concern - it also costs more. Earlier this year, Ottawa City Council approved the details of a 1,281-hectare boundary expansion. But city Councillor Shawn Menard said being forced to expand puts cities in a financial straitjacket. Low-density development is simply too expensive to maintain, with more roads and pipes but fewer taxpayers to foot the bill.
He points to an analysis, done by Hemson Consultants, that shows Ottawa spends $465 annually per person to service low-density homes on the periphery. Meanwhile, infill homes in the core contribute $606 more each year, per person, than they cost to service.
"Expanding the urban boundary is extremely expensive," Mr. Menard said. "It's not sustainable over time."
As a result of the imbalance, residents in the core end up subsidizing the suburbs. But the resulting pressure on municipal bottom lines becomes more onerous as cities grow.
"Maybe the development charges in suburban neighbourhoods really need to be rethought to actually make them represent the true life-cycle cost," said Toon Dreessen, president of Architects DCA.
Victor Doyle, a retired senior planner with the Ontario government and an architect of its Greenbelt and previous growth plan, said the province's new "market-based" land-needs assessments has prompted many municipalities to hire consultants who rely on patterns from previous decades for their forecasts.
This overestimates the future demand for new single-family homes, he said, and underestimates the need for what planners call "missing middle" housing, such as townhouses and duplexes or low-rise apartments. Hamilton in particular will need to build more densely along its planned light-rail line, he points out.
"They're looking forward, and not looking backward to Leave It to Beaver times," Mr. Doyle said.
"People don't want to live in faroff communities. They're happy to live in more ‘missing middle'type housing forms along a transit corridor."

Full text: It's Saturday afternoon in downtown Toronto and Mariza Gaspar and Isaac Fernato are cutting windows into the shrink wrap that envelops their home, a vintage 1967 48-foot steel Chris Craft Roamer with wood superstructure docked at a marina near the CN Tower. The couple, along with their four-year-old son, Vasco, and rescue dog, Daisy, have been living on their boat year-round since the spring of 2018.
Aside from being an alternative to high rent prices and an out-of-reach housing market for young professionals, they feel most at home on the water. Ms. Gaspar and Mr. Fernato met in 2014 working as a service staff and engineer on Canada's largest passenger sailboat, 200-foot schooner and tall ship the Empire Sandy, which happens to be docked around the corner from their current residence. They both come from nautical backgrounds, working on and travelling with various ships over the past 10 years and more.
In 2015 they took the plunge of owning their first boat, a 31-foot sailboat that they renovated and treated as a summer home for a few seasons, living in a Toronto apartment in the off-season.
They found out about Ms. Gaspar's pregnancy while sailing out on the lake one day. They would give their son his first taste of the nautical lifestyle at three months old, which would be followed by moving with him onto the boat that they now call home when he turned 1.
They bought the boat in Fort Erie in 2018 and have been slowly renovating it while living seasonally between Toronto Island and downtown Toronto.
The young family spends late spring to early fall on Toronto Island, moving around and spending the majority of their days outside. Come November, they migrate to a berth in downtown Toronto and install shrink wrap over a wooden frame built on top of the boat in order to insulate their home until the worst of the weather has passed in spring.
"‘Oh, that's some nice shrink wrap!' is something I never would have guessed I'd be saying or caring about in my life," Ms. Gaspar says in admiring a neighbour's seamless shrink-wrap installation.
They use electric heaters and have installed backup diesel heaters that they have yet to need. By now, Ms. Gaspar and Mr. Fernato have found their rhythm, becoming proficient in winterizing their boat and keeping very warm throughout the harshest of conditions. But it didn't always come easy. During their first winter spent living aboard, their bubbler, used to prevent ice buildup by continuously moving water around the base of the boat, failed on them. Thick ice formed quickly and attached to the hull of their boat, causing their home to tilt. The family was faced with an obstacle that only a chainsaw could remedy; Mr. Fernato picked up the tool, walked onto the ice wearing a floatation suit and began cutting, sending chunks of ice out into the water.
He laughs, remembering the local reaction to his unconventional methods.
"Our neighbours yelled, ‘You can't do that!' But I had no other choice. How was I supposed to get rid of this ice?" For this family, maintaining a strong sense of community on the water is a key to a comfortable life as boaters. While a neighbour walks by with an infant in a stroller, another one on a scooter and more walking their dogs, Mr. Fernato points out the people whom they have come to know as family, helping hands and inspiring friends.
Ms. Gaspar jokes about the weekly meal gathering that their little family partakes in.
"We call it Spaghetti Wednesdays - each boat takes a turn in making a pasta dish for the group. Sometimes it's 10 people or more. It started on a Wednesday but can fall on any day of the week!"
Spaghetti Wednesday fell this week on a Saturday, and they were cooking what they dubbed a Surf N Turf Fettucini on a single burner. Ten boating friends would be joining them, all of whom they have met in the waters that surround Toronto Island.
Resourcefulness is key when it comes to tight quarters, and Ms. Gaspar admits that cooking on a single-burner stove is a challenge, but it can be fun and rewarding. The boat is equipped with a full-size fridge, stove, barbecue, espresso machine, washer, two bathrooms, a tub, two bedrooms, a salon lounge and combined living room and kitchen.
The boat slightly rocks from side to side, but Ms. Gaspar says that they no longer notice the movement.
The family owns a motorcycle, a motorized self-balancing board and bikes to commute for any necessities such as groceries. They spend their free time at a local park, the Music Garden, which is effectively their backyard. There is a nearby playground for their son and the skating rink at Harbourfront in winter.
"We wanted to create a lifestyle in which our family could live in the city but our child has all the benefits of what it can be to grow up in the country," Ms. Gaspar says. "We are constantly surrounded by nature and spend most of our time outdoors. We get to move our boat as we please. We have beaches just metres away from us. We cook many of our meals by campfire.
Our son runs barefoot all summer! "Living on a boat makes you very aware of your surroundings, what you bring into your space and what you consume in terms of energy.
"Everyone is always helping each other out. It's very much a lend some sugar, open door policy. I wanted [Vasco] to grow up in a community where he would feel safe, loved."

Full text: After years of construction, delays and squabbles with local government, the developers of the Champlain Towers gathered at a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the project's completion.
Mitchell Kinzer, who was then the young mayor of Surfside, Fla., still remembers the day well, even 40 years later. The town commissioner, some of the engineers and architects, and a smattering of locals showed up for the dedication.
Afterward, a group - including him - was invited up to a penthouse suite owned by one of the developers.
"It was first class luxury. It had these big windows ... You could see every marking on the floor of the ocean," he said. "I literally went home, put on a bathing suit and went swimming. That's how impressive it was."
This past June 24, Mr. Kinzer woke up to the sound of helicopters overhead. When he went outside to investigate, neighbours told him about the partial collapse of Champlain Towers South.
He thought about that day in the penthouse and later walked three blocks to see for himself.
"The sight of that building, with part of it just literally sheared away, and the giant pile of rubble ... It was hard to process that what I was seeing was real," he said. Just under 6,000 people live in Surfside. Mr. Kinzer figures there's not a person in town who doesn't have some connection, either directly or through a friend, to one of the 98 people who died.
A federal investigation by the U.S.
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is under way. The original design, construction process, building maintenance, as well as potential environmental and geotechnical issues, are all factors the institute will examine.
And while answers are still likely months or even years away, a myriad of irregularities about the building have come to light since the tragedy.
First, a 2018 consultant's report surfaced that suggested parts of the high-rise had fallen into disrepair. The document flagged "abundant cracking" in some parking garage columns, beams and walls as well as "major structural damage" to the concrete slab below the entrance drive and pool deck. The report said the original design of the slab was a "major error," as it was not sloped to allow water runoff.
Expert analysis, and reporting by some U.S. media, has flagged other possible shortcomings with the design and construction of the tower.
Scrutiny has also fallen on the people involved in the project. A confounding number of them appear to have checkered pasts, including an architect who had his licence suspended for incompetence and an engineer who oversaw a potentially deadly design flaw in a different building.
Then there were the developers themselves: Nathan Reiber, Nathan Goldlist, Isadore Goldlist and Roman (Abe) Blankenstein.
All of these men died before the Champlain collapse. But The Globe and Mail has drawn on hundreds of business records, property documents, court files and archived newspaper stories, plus interviews with friends, family and former business partners, to piece together their paths to Surfside, as well as the many problems that plagued the doomed building.
Each man immigrated to Canada from Europe and ultimately settled in Toronto. They were scrappy entrepreneurs who struck gold in the housing boom after the Second World War, making small fortunes building the kind of boxy, utilitarian apartment towers that remain ubiquitous in many Canadian cities.
Isadore Goldlist's brothers ran a poultry shop, but he bucked the family business and became a builder. His cousin, Nathan Goldlist, initially settled in New Jersey on a chicken farm before joining his family in Canada.
Mr. Blankenstein and his longtime business partner, Joseph Fialkov, started out as electricians who grew their company, Falco Electric, into a property developer. They went on to build more than a dozen apartment towers.
(Mr. Fialkov is listed as a director on companies involved in the Champlain, but it's not clear whether he was involved in the development at the time.)
But the leader of this group was Mr. Reiber, a gregarious, smooth-talking lawyer, who seemed to live his professional life dancing on the edge of right and wrong. (Members of Mr. Reiber's immediate family did not respond to interview requests.)
Mr. Reiber permanently relocated to Florida in the late 1970s, shortly before the Canadian government charged him with tax evasion. As he quietly dealt with his legal issues, Mr. Reiber emerged as a philanthropist and fixture of local society. He once hosted a cocktail party on his 80foot yacht - the Rye-Bar - as part of an AIDS fundraiser organized by Elizabeth Taylor. By 2004, Mr. Reiber and his second wife, Carolee, had amassed an estimated net worth of more than US$43.3million.
Beneath the glitz, however, a Globe investigation has uncovered a career littered with allegations of deception and unethical practices, including accusations of fraud and misleading sales tactics.
Collectively, the Champlain developers built or managed dozens of buildings in Canada before turning to Surfside, including houses, townhomes, subdivisions, motels, apartment complexes and high-rise condos.
Lawsuits are not unusual in the development world. But little compares to the drama that encircled Mr. Reiber and many of his projects. (In one instance, one of his condos had to be reclad because bricks began falling off the exterior.) To the extent that Mr. Reiber's character, or any of the developers' histories, played a role in the tragedy of Champlain Towers is not known and may be impossible for investigators to determine.
Experts consulted by The Globe said it would be unlikely for a developer in Canada or the U.S. to be responsible for a building's collapse. Developers don't pour concrete or draft designs. They hire architects and contractors, who are beholden to strict regulations, conservative building codes and inspections. If major errors are made with a design or load calculation, they're typically revealed during construction, when most collapses occur.
Yet Champlain South fell, decades after it soared into the Florida sky, and no one knows why. This is the story of the controversial man who built it.
When Nathan Reiber died in July, 2014, an obituary in the Miami Herald suggested he had moved to Florida after retiring from a successful legal career. But shortly after his arrival, the writer was told, he took a stroll along West Avenue in Miami Beach and spotted a vacant lot. Inspiration struck and Mr. Reiber discovered a second calling as a builder.
Except this wasn't true. Mr. Reiber was involved in real estate for almost his entire working life, as a developer, investor, lender and property manager. His portfolio included mortgage businesses, a motel company, subdivisions, townhouses, at least nine apartment buildings and a condo tower - and that's just in Ontario.
In Florida, he was involved in building at least six condominium towers and part of a subdivision, seven projects to convert existing apartment complexes to condos, co-owned three other apartment complexes, and had ownership stakes in at least three other pieces of land.
Mr. Reiber worked with some of the day's most prominent Toronto area developers, including Mendel Tenenbaum, George Goldlist at Goldlist Construction (a distant cousin of Isadore and Nathan) and New Style Construction.
As for his legal career, this ended in disgrace. Mr. Reiber became a U.S. resident in 1980, around the time he was charged with three offences under Canada's Income Tax Act. He had been implicated in a coin-laundry skimming scam and was also accused of issuing $120,000 worth of cheques for construction work that was never done, The Hamilton Spectator reported. According to a disciplinary summary from what is now the Law Society of Ontario, Mr. Reiber and others had made "false or deceptive entries" in company record books to avoid their tax exposure. He agreed to resign his law licence rather than be disbarred.
He also eventually pleaded guilty to tax evasion and paid a $60,000 fine, the Spectator reported.
Mr. Reiber, who was born in Poland and moved to Edmonton with his parents as a child during the Great Depression, graduated law school from the University of Alberta. He was called to the bar in 1953 and within two years, had moved to Toronto with his first wife, Florence.
Toronto in those postwar years was an uninspired place. Apart from a few streets in the core, the skyline consisted of church spires piercing through treetops, overlooking rows of single-family homes. The city was still relatively small. Many neighbourhoods in midtown today were still farmers' fields.
But Toronto was on the cusp of a major evolution. A thriving economy, new immigration policies and a cultural shift that saw young, unmarried adults living alone for the first time, created a massive demand for affordable "non-family housing" - townhouses and apartment buildings - as it was then called.
The building boom began in the late 1950s, and then took off in the 1960s and 1970s. Some of Canada's most famous development firms made names for themselves, including Cadillac Fairview, Greenwin and the Tenen Group. Even so, much of Toronto's postwar stock was built by small-time entrepreneurs.
And as a young lawyer, Mr. Reiber saw the opportunity.
Mr. Reiber had partnered with an already well-established barrister named David Newman. The pair rented a modest office for Newman & Reiber above a tailor shop on Spadina Avenue. Old classified ads show Mr. Reiber did work such as legal name changes, but by 1958, both lawyers were looking to real estate.
That's the year they incorporated a side venture, Newrey Holdings, to invest in properties.
Mr. Reiber took on builders as clients and then began investing in their projects, which was common at the time.
Many of his early deals also involved a man named Max Citron.
Mr. Citron made his money in the stock market and then real estate, said Claire Zur, whose husband, Moshe, worked with Mr. Reiber and Mr. Citron on deals in Florida in the 1970s.
"Max Citron was the one with the money and he got them hooked into real estate," Ms. Zur said. It was her understanding that Mr. Citron was related to Mr. Reiber's wife, Florence.
One of Mr. Citron and Mr. Reiber's early projects involved buying a large stake in two Ontario motel chains, Tops Motor Hotel and Carousel Inn.
In 1965, engineer Alex Tobias sued the chains, alleging Mr. Reiber hired him for numerous jobs, but once the work was done, refused to pay $12,140 worth of invoices - the equivalent of more than $100,000 today.
Under questioning, Mr. Reiber claimed he never had conversations with Mr. Tobias about any work. After Mr. Tobias's lawyer suggested an outside architect may have been aware of the agreement, the court transcripts stop. Mr. Reiber and the others agreed to settle for almost the full amount.
Just a year later, Mr. Reiber, Mr. Citron and Mr. Newman were sued again in connection with Tops locations in Peterborough and Belleville, this time by some of their partners, Sam Mandle, Charles Wener and Macks Pearlman. The trio alleged that Mr. Reiber, Mr. Citron and Mr. Newman had defrauded them out of at least $64,147 - the equivalent of around half a million dollars today. The case was settled out of court for an unknown amount.
As some of these motel loca-
tions began to struggle financially, reams of litigation followed, which exposed other owners, including the involvement of New Style Construction, a major builder run by developers Sam Bojman, Michael Finkelstein and Irving Naiberg.
These names appear alongside Mr. Reiber's projects throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In Toronto, there's a cluster of buildings near Bathurst Street and Sheppard Avenue West. Another is at the north end of Regent Park. There's one on Thorncliffe Park Drive, one off Yonge Street downtown and another tower in London, Ont.
Most share a similar look. They are unfancy rectangles with large balconies, ranging from around 12 to 24 storeys in height. Today, most are still affordable rentals.
"As a kid, all these guys would show up at my house and we'd go to Florida," said Deborah Bojman, the daughter of Sam Bojman.
She remembers Mr. Reiber as charismatic, funny and someone who commanded attention.
Physically he was a large man, tall and broad.
"Nathan was very stylish, the way he dressed. He seemed to have sophisticated taste ... he seemed to be polished," she remembered. "Nathan Reiber was someone who always talked a lot.
A good talker. Smooth ... he was always very nice to us kids."
It was with the New Style owners that Mr. Reiber encountered his first public scandal.
In 1966, the group had plans to build a townhouse-apartment complex in Toronto's west end.
They signed options to buy 62 houses and in March, the developers notified about two dozen of those residents the project was going ahead and they had to be out by early June. A number of those residents put down deposits to buy new homes. Others signed long-term leases elsewhere.
But as the closing date approached, some of the residents grew nervous because they hadn't heard anything else. Their lawyers tried to contact Mr. Reiber - who they understood to be the developer's lawyer - but he wouldn't answer the phone. Mr. Reiber was called to appear before the city's building and development committee to explain.
He was greeted by a room full of tearful and angry residents. Mr. Reiber told the city councillors his "client" - he did not disclose he was also an owner - had decided in May that the project wasn't financially feasible. He claimed all of the residents' solicitors had been notified.
"That's a lie," shouted resident Stanley Moczulski, The Globe reported at the time.
Mr. Reiber clarified that he told every solicitor who phoned him about the developers' decision.
He denied he had been "hiding or unavailable," the Toronto Star reported. Then alderman Charles Caccia asked Mr. Reiber why he didn't think he had a duty to make sure everyone knew about the change. "I'm a solicitor and I have to have one thing in mind and that is the protection of my client. That is my sole duty," Mr. Reiber said.
In the 1970s, the newly legislated concept of a condominium took off in Toronto. The introduction of rent control and a restructuring of the tax system made rental apartments less appealing to developers. Many, including Mr. Reiber and his partners, switched to condos.
They had initially envisioned Canyon Towers as an apartment building but it registered in 1974 as a condominium. Roughly a decade later, the building's board hired an outside architect, E. Ronald Hershfield, because the brick facade had begun to fall off.
Mr. Hershfield, 74, says the wrong type of brick had been installed for that type of building and Canada's winter climate. He designed a cladding system to envelop the structure. "I think they had, as a group, received some kind of a settlement from the developer," he said.
Asked if he felt the developers may have cut corners, Mr. Hershfield said it's possible, but not necessarily the case. "It's not always deliberate. It could have been an honest mistake at the design specification [stage] or a mix-up at the supplier end," he said.
Speaking generally about many buildings and developers from this era, Mr. Hershfield said the product differed based on the prospective buyer and price point. "These buildings, they're utilitarian. They meet code. They are acceptable from a safety point of view, but they do not offer anything extra."
Mr. Reiber and his partners were also sued by the same condo corporation over another matter.
After the building registered, the new board discovered the developers had maintained ownership of the superintendent's suite.
Mr. Reiber and the others offered to sell it to the residents, or lease it for $300 a month. A judge ordered the developers to hand over the suite and the case became a commonly cited precedent in instances in which a condo developer has been accused of breaking the trust of purchasers.
Because of the way property records are maintained in this country, it's impossible to trace all the buildings Mr. Reiber helped develop, but The Globe located 11 projects in Canada alone.
And by 1970, Mr. Reiber was pursuing real estate interests in the Miami area.
Florida was in the midst of its own housing boom, thanks to an influx of immigrants from Cuba and Latin America, changes in federal financing rules that made it easier for developers to build apartment buildings, and the state's emergence as a vacation hot spot.
Altogether, The Globe identified at least 16 condo and apartment complexes in Florida Mr. Reiber was involved with, from waterfront towers to suburban two-storey walkups.
Although Mr. Reiber had shifted his focus to Florida, in many ways it was not a fresh start. He imported the sort of dodgy business practices of which he'd been accused in Canada.
His first efforts in Florida appear to have begun around 1970, when he registered two companies to develop two different condo projects, including one with Mr. Citron.
A few years later, he was part of a Canadian consortium that bought three apartment complexes on the south side of Miami. Mr. Reiber and his partners paid top dollar in a hot real estate market.
Unfortunately for them, the boom ended in 1974 and rental revenues plummeted. The following year, they were forced to sell off one complex, Kendall Village, at a foreclosure auction after missing mortgage and tax payments. An attempt to sell another, Wellington Manor, in 1976, fell apart after the prospective buyers accused the Canadians of refusing to show them proof of the building's rental revenue, the Miami Herald reported at the time. The buildings sold in 1977 at a loss.
By the end of the 1970s, Mr. Reiber and his partners had their eyes on Surfside, a quiet community of single-family homes with a few modest motels along the beach.
Mr. Reiber bought up parcels of land along Collins Avenue, partnering with Mendel Tenenbaum, and Nathan and Isadore Goldlist. The first site they planned to develop was the former location of a demolished art deco hotel called the Coronado.
They dubbed their proposed building Champlain Towers South.
Florida State business records show that 15 companies with overlapping ownership formed the partnership in 1979.
Mr. Reiber appears to have controlled companies that collectively owned 50 per cent of the development. A man named Stephen Gonda is listed as a director alongside Mr. Reiber.
Mr. Gonda, who immigrated from Hungary, was a long-time family friend of Mr. Reiber. His nephew, Lou Gonda, believes his uncle may have sold some real estate at one point, but he was not a particularly wealthy man. (Additional reporting by The Globe supports this assessment.)
Over the coming years, the Canadians plowed through several obstacles to get the project off the ground.
First was a building moratorium, imposed on Surfside by county officials concerned the town's sewer system was too small to accommodate new development.
Mr. Reiber cut a deal in which he agreed to pay US$200,000, about half the cost of upgrading the system, to get around the moratorium.
The next hurdle was a town council-imposed height restriction that limited buildings to 12 storeys.
"Champlain Towers circumvented the code. Residents did not want to increase any building in Surfside at that time," recalled Eli Tourgeman, then a councillor.
"The town didn't approve 13 floors, the developers did it and then said it wasn't really a 13th storey because it's not really a full floor. But ... it wasn't done according to policy."
At first, officials ordered the builders to stop construction. But the council, fearing a lawsuit, voted to let the project proceed.
Advertisements at the time said the condos were selling for US$148,000 to US$302,500, about US$450,000 to US$920,000 in today's dollars. They described generously sized units: A one-bedroom had 1,600 square feet of space.
But apparently unbeknownst to early residents, Champlain South already contained at least one serious construction flaw.
The waterproofing under the deck surrounding the outdoor pool was designed to lie flat, rather than being sloped to drain.
This caused water to accumulate, seeping into the concrete slabs in the parking garage below, corroding the rebar and putting hairline cracks in concrete support columns.
Frank Morabito, an engineer who discovered the problem in 2018, laid the blame squarely on the architects and engineers Mr. Reiber's consortium had hired: William M. Friedman & Associates and Breiterman Jurado & Associates.
Both companies already had erratic pasts by the time they worked on Champlain South in the early 1980s.
William Friedman once had his licence suspended for "gross incompetence," according to documents from the state's Board of Architects.
In 1965, he was accused of designing faulty sign pylons for two Miami commercial buildings, and a faulty roof for a duplex home.
The board found that Mr. Friedman's plans for the buildings were not up to code. Mr. Friedman was convicted of professional misconduct and sentenced to a six-month licence suspension.
On at least three occasions in the 1960s, Mr. Friedman was also accused of a practice called "plan stamping," the file says.
This involves an architect rubber-stamping a developer's plans without ensuring they are sound. Nothing in board documents indicates the outcome of these allegations. Mr. Friedman died in 2018, at the age of 88.
Breiterman Jurado & Associates, meanwhile, was accused of overseeing a potentially deadly design flaw in a different building just a few years before going to work on Champlain.
According to a January, 1976, Miami Herald article, a parking garage attached to the new police and fire department headquarters in Coral Gables, Fla., had started to show cracks in the parapet walls on the third and fourth floors just seven months after opening. City officials discovered the builders had used only half the amount of rebar they were supposed to. If a vehicle hit the wall, the city manager said at the time, it could crash through to the street below.
Breiterman Jurado & Associates had been hired to ensure the building followed plans. But Sergio Breiterman, the company's principal, shrugged off the problem. He told the Herald he could not remember whether he had even bothered to inspect the walls because, he claimed, they were not really "a basic part of the structure like slabs and beams."
Mr. Breiterman died in 1990. Manuel Jurado, his former business partner, turned down The Globe's interview requests.
Mr. Reiber himself faced a barrage of lawsuits related to Champlain. Three came from contractors, one from Champlain's realtor, one from the building next door and one from Isadore Goldist. The details of all of these are unclear because Miami-Dade's courts destroy their records a few years after cases are closed.
Whatever the difficulties at Champlain, Mr. Reiber and his partners - including Mr. Gonda and sundry Goldlists - immediately made plans for several more beachfront buildings in Surfside. A row of condo towers, many of them almost identical to Champlain, soon populated the beachfront. Mr. Reiber was involved in at least two of these, and Isadore Goldlist was behind three more.
During this time, Mr. Reiber was living large. There was that charity cocktail party on the Rye-Bar in 1988. There was a home on Star Island, a celebrity-filled enclave across the water from Miami Beach.
And there were the black-tie balls and galas, including for the ballet and the Miami Art Museum.
In 2004, Mr. Reiber and his second wife, Carolee, listed assets of US$49.3-million and liabilities of just under US$6-million, for a net worth of more than US$43.3-million in a financial statement provided to Ocean Bank as part of financing for a real estate project. In 2005, the couple listed their adjusted gross income as nearly US$2.2-million.
To woo real estate agents and financiers for one project in 2006, Mr. Reiber and his partners threw a "Holiday Champagne Yacht Party" aboard a 115-foot boat.
But he was soon headed for yet another legal and financial morass.
In 2009, amid the real estate crash, two banks sued Mr. Reiber and his partners for US$30-million after they allegedly failed to pay back the financing they had received to convert three sprawling, lowrise suburban apartment complexes into condos.
Then, in bankruptcy proceedings related to one complex, the Village at Dadeland in Miami, the bankruptcy trustee accused Mr. Reiber and his partners of improperly funnelling more than US$7.8million out of the development, leaving it unable to pay its debts.
These accusations were never tested in court. A lawyer for two of Mr. Reiber's partners said that the trustee made an "abatement agreement" with Mr. Reiber.
The court record does not specify details of this agreement.
It was a messy career capstone for a developer who never seemed to stay out of trouble.
At 1:18 a.m. this past June 24, Adriana Sarmiento, a guest at the hotel next door to Champlain South, videoed water pouring from underneath Champlain's pool into the parking garage below. In the footage, posted to TikTok, chunks of concrete could be seen littering the garage floor.
Within minutes, the entire pool deck caved in.
Then, the building began to shake, letting out loud bangs and flashes of light.
The centre of Champlain South imploded, a moment captured on surveillance footage from a nearby building. The wing of Champlain closest to the ocean remained upright for a moment, then fell, too. Only the westernmost part of the structure stayed standing, a tangled mass of rebar protruding from apartments cut in half.
The implosion took less than 15 seconds.
For the next month, rescuers combed through a rubble pile, itself four-storeys tall, in the rapidly-vanishing hope of finding survivors. Their work was frequently hampered by the sudden thunderstorms typical of South Florida in summer. Ultimately, crews blew up the rest of the building to prevent it crumbling.
Ninety-eight people were killed, including four Canadians. Thirty-five survived in the uncollapsed part of the building. Just four were pulled alive from the rubble, including one who died in hospital.
Philip Zyne, 71, a lawyer who lives in Champlain North, built by the Canadian consortium around the same time as Champlain South, wondered if his home was safe. "They call it the sister building.
It has a similar design, architects, engineers, drawings," he said. "It could be having similar issues."
Champlain South residents also pointed to other decay in the building in recent years.
Matilde Fainstein, who lived in a ground-floor unit next to the pool deck and was not at home when the building collapsed, sued the condo association in 2015 after she alleged it failed to deal with leaks in her apartment. The case was settled out of court.
Daniel Wagner, her lawyer, told The Globe that the same problem happened again just this past April. A portion of stucco had peeled off the building's external wall, revealing cracked concrete and rusting rebar below.
Right behind, the concrete support looked like it was blown out and you could see some corroded steel," said Mr. Wagner, of the firm I Lawyer Up. "The building was in substantial disrepair."
Allyn Kilsheimer, a veteran Washington-based engineer investigating the collapse for the town of Surfside, said the original design and construction of Champlain South would be the first thing he would look at.
"Our focus is, first, on the original design of the building. Then, our focus is on the materials used in the building, maintenance, then possible outside issues that could have caused something like this," he said.
He said he would also look at whether adding the penthouse, which wasn't in the original plan, played a part in the collapse. And Mr. Kilsheimer said he has been inspecting Champlain North to see if any of Champlain South's problems are present there.
One problem is that much of Champlain North doesn't appear to have followed the architectural design. Many construction decisions were made on the fly.
"Not everything is built to the drawings. There were not a lot of details on a lot of things - they were worked out while you were building the building," he said.
"For instance, we don't know who the concrete subcontractor was, or the steel suppliers."
Whatever the cause, the NIST said earlier this month that its investigation could take more than two years.
Mr. Kilsheimer said he doesn't know when he will be able to report his findings because the county and the courts have allowed him little access to evidence. He has been allowed only one visit to the collapse site so far, and has not seen any of the debris that was hauled away and put in storage. For the most part, his investigation has involved reviewing the original engineering drawings.
As for the other Surfside buildings constructed by members of the Champlain South consortium, Mr. Kilsheimer says he has not seen anything in Champlain North that indicates it is in "imminent danger of collapse."
But he said the building had commissioned another engineer to do a fuller evaluation. He said he has not been allowed into Champlain East, save for a onehour tour of the parking garage.
Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said the town has asked all buildings older than 30 years to do their 40-year building recertifications early and he believed most were complying. But even so, he worried that without knowing exactly what caused the collapse, it is impossible to be certain the same problem is not present in other buildings.
"How do you know how to diagnose the disease if you don't know what the disease is, or where it is, or what caused it?
And why is it okay to wait years to get that answer?" he said.
He said the town is growing frustrated.
"It's very unclear to me whether we'll ever get a definitive answer on why that building fell down, and it appears to me that we'll probably end up with some sort of homogenized answer along the lines of ‘bad design, bad construction, and bad maintenance,' " Mr. Burkett said.
"However, buildings in America just don't fall down like that.
And in my opinion, based upon my conversations with all the experts that I've talked to and the hours and hours of time I've spent at the site, there is something very, very wrong that happened at that building."

Full text: NATHAN REIBER Mr. Reiber came to Canada from Poland as a child with his parents during the Great Depression. He grew up in Edmonton, and graduated with a law degree from the University of Alberta in 1951.
For almost his entire legal career he had a foot in the development world. In 1960, he was described in the Canadian Jewish News as a "lawyer with interests in building."
In addition to his law practice with Newman & Reiber, Mr. Reiber had side ventures for his real estate deals, including Newrey Holdings, Reiber Estates, Jeff-Mar Holdings, Bath-Shep Apartments and Reiwen Holdings.
Florida business records show Mr. Reiber served as a director on dozens of other companies in that state.
His career was pocked with lawsuits and allegations of fraud, and in the late 1970s, he relocated to Florida, shortly after the Canadian government charged him with tax evasion. He resigned his law licence to avoid being disbarred. As he quietly resolved his legal issues, Mr. Reiber became a fixture of local Miami-area society and was known as a philanthropist.
He died in 2014.
NATHAN GOLDLIST After surviving the Holocaust, Mr. Goldlist left Europe and settled in New Jersey on a chicken farm, before moving to Toronto to join his cousins.
Toronto city directories show he worked as a "builder" and appears to have run a company called Goldfield Holdings, which was involved in apartment towers.
Sarah Senior grew up next door to Mr. Goldlist in north Toronto. She remembers the family fondly: "If anything needed fixing, my father would say, ‘Okay, let me go over and ask Nathan. He'll have contacts."
By the time Champlain Towers registered, just two companies were listed on the paperwork: Mr. Reiber's Can-Fla Developments and Sannat Investments, which was controlled by Mr. Goldlist and his wife Sara. Isadore Goldlist and Roman Blankenstein are also referenced in the condo declaration.
ISADORE GOLDLIST Mr. Goldlist's brothers, Harry and Eric, and cousins ran Goldlist Poultry in Kensington Market, but Toronto city directories show that Isadore Goldlist identified as a builder as of the 1960s. His projects include towers on Goldfinch Court in Toronto.
Jerry Kaufman partnered with Isadore to build the Mirage condo, a building five doors down from Champlain South. He remembered "Izzy" as a frugal businessman, deeply shaped by his experience as a Holocaust survivor.
"If Izzy could drive a car that didn't have tires, he would. He was very conservative. The refugee mentality was: negotiate hard, but live by that deal," he said. "Izzy always wanted to do things the right way. Izzy didn't believe in shortcuts."
Mr. Goldlist died in 2000.
ROMAN BLANKENSTEIN Mr. Blankenstein was also a Holocaust survivor who immigrated to Canada. He and his long-time business partner, Joseph Fialkov, started as electricians and founded Falco Electric, which evolved into a prominent development company.
According to a biography posted on the website of Mr. Blankenstein's son's company, Falco built more than a dozen apartment high-rises, "as well as millions of square feet of industrial and commercial space in the GTA."
Both Mr. Blankenstein and Mr. Fialkov are deceased.
(Mr. Fialkov is listed as a director on four of the companies involved in Champlain South, alongside Mr. Blankenstein, but it is not clear whether he was involved in the tower's development.)
Mr. Blankenstein's son, Lawrence, who is a successful developer in Canada, declined an interview request from The Globe. He said his parents kept a unit in the building for many years, and he knew some of the people who died in the Champlain South collapse.
"There were some very good neighbours who used to check on my parents and it's very hard. I just don't want to talk about it."
STANLEY JOEL LEVINE Mr. Levine, who died in 1999, was the Miami lawyer who represented the consortium. He is listed as the vicepresident of all 15 partnership companies, although this appears to have been done for administrative reasons.
"He got into real estate law because his mother was a realtor," said Mr. Levine's son, Randy. When she went blind from diabetes, Mr. Levine became deeply involved with the Fight for Sight charity.
In 1969, Mr. Levine was accused of brokering a US$8,000 bribe for one of his clients to a Miami Beach councillor over a zoning variance. The charges were dropped after an issue arose with the case against the city councillor.
"Those allegations were not true and they were retracted," Randy said, but being falsely accused deeply affected his father. "He was a good dad. Did a lot for the community."
STEPHEN GONDA Mr. Gonda is listed as a director of Champlain companies alongside Mr. Reiber, but his involvement is a mystery to the people who knew him.
"He was not a wealthy man," said Mr. Gonda's nephew, Lou, a successful businessman based in California. "I think maybe he was a real estate agent." (Records connected to Mr. Gonda's personal condo in Mississauga refer to him as a realtor.)
The Gondas and Reibers were family friends. Lou's first job as a teenager - which his father arranged - was at Mr. Reiber's Carousel motel in London, Ont.
Mr. Gonda, who died in 1999, grew up in Hungary and immigrated to Venezuela before moving to Canada. As a child, he trained as a gymnast, and he occasionally popped into handstands as an adult. Unlike the other Canadians, Mr. Gonda's name does not appear in connection to any development projects in Canada.

How Chinese developer DDI bet big on Canadian commercial real estate - and failed

Full text: The path to Crystal City is a muddy all-terrain-vehicle trail that leads away from the ocean and deep into the woods. But Neil Partington, who keeps the key to unlock the chain at the entrance, doesn't understand why anyone would want to go up there.
In his view, this 2,850-acre plot isn't good for much; it's difficult to access, soggy and remote. When Chinese developer DongDu International (DDI) began buying this land on Nova Scotia's eastern shore in 2014, announcing a grand vision for a resort called Crystal City, he and many other locals wondered why.
"It's just a huge chunk of useless bogland. Who would want to put a resort on that?" said Mr. Partington, whose vegetable farm backs onto the property, which can only be accessed through his family's land.
"They didn't even bother to build a road to get in there."
Eight years ago, DDI had big plans to build luxury getaways for Chinese investors in this hard-to-reach corner of rural Nova Scotia. Central to the plans was a proposed vacation resort near the community of Indian Harbour Lake, with 1,000 villas, tennis courts, horse stables, swimming pools and replicas of the Eiffel Tower and Leaning Tower of Pisa.
The company promised billions of dollars in spending, and bought nine properties in Nova Scotia - including more than 3,300 acres in Guysborough County alone - totalling 6,500 acres across the province.
DDI's ideas were as ambitious as they were unusual, including docking two cruise ships in Halifax that would function as floating film studios.
Provincial and local leaders were excited, including then-premier Stephen McNeil and Halifax Mayor Mike Savage.
Nearly 300 people - touring DDI executives, politicians, business leaders and more - attended a splashy launch in Halifax in 2014.
The hope was that it was the beginning of a wave of Chinese investment, development, tourism and immigration, and the jobs the wave would create.
Almost none of it happened. Today, most of DDI's land, including the site for Crystal City, is still undeveloped woodlots.
The company owns a golf course outside of Halifax, but apart from that has no public presence in the province.
The DDI saga in Nova Scotia, with the grand promises the company made and then failed to fulfill, was an early warning sign for the problems now facing other large Chinese real estate companies and their holdings around the world.
In 2016, Chinese buyers spent a record $3.9-billion on Canadian commercial property, according to research from the commercial real estate firm CRBE. By last year, that amount had plummeted to $181.5-million, a 95-per-cent drop.
Much of the growth of Chinese real estate companies over the past decade was fuelled by huge amounts of borrowing. But now, that debt, and the push by Beijing to rein it in, is crippling large property developers.
This past week, one of the largest, Evergrande Group, nearly defaulted on interest payments on some of its US$300-billion in loans.
Evergrande's creditors are beginning bankruptcy proceedings, and the crisis is roiling global markets and has sparked stock selloffs and credit downgrades among other big Chinese property companies trying to raise badly needed cash - including several with large projects in Canada.
As those companies try to unwind their debt, at least one major holding in Canada has been sold and the future of ambitious new developments is uncertain.
In the years up to 2016, China had been making it easier for the country's private sector companies and state-owned enterprises to invest abroad. Firms were allowed to get bank loans for foreign purchases and they no longer needed government approval for overseas acquisitions worth less than US$1-billion.
As a result, companies such as DDI and Anbang Insurance Group made high-profile commercial property purchases in Canada.
In 2016, total Chinese foreign investment around the world reached nearly US$200-billion - a record.
But the exodus of money worried Beijing, and the country started to tighten some of its foreign investment rules. This included restricting purchases of overseas commercial real estate, causing companies to re-evaluate their plans and some projects to grind to a halt.
When the Chinese government seized the heavily indebted insurance conglomerate Anbang in 2018, it was another warning sign that debt problems were taking hold - and would have far-flung impacts. To try to get Anbang back on sound financial footing, Beijing started selling the insurer's overseas properties, including the Bentall Centre office complex in Vancouver in 2019, for an undisclosed price.
"Many companies are used to economic system in China and they are not quite prepared to go into a foreign market," said Jia Wang, interim director of the China Institute at the University of Alberta, which tracks all Chinese investment in Canada. "It takes time to learn and understand how a foreign market works," she said.
The known value of all Chinese investment in Canada - not just commercial real estate - also declined after capital controls were put in place. In 2016, it was $7.6-billion; the following year it was $9.9-billion; but then investment dropped to $2.3-billion in 2018. Last year, it was $2-billion, according to the China Institute, though it cautioned this was the sum of known values and underrepresents actual investment amounts.
Today, China's domestic property market is slowing, and the government is clamping down on developers and requiring them to reduce their debt.
Several major companies are struggling with large debt loads. They include Greenland Holding Group and China Aoyuan Group Ltd., which are both constructing condo skyscrapers in Toronto. Both have suffered multiple credit downgrades and today their debt is considered speculative, which will make it harder for them to raise funds.
Greenland is a Shanghai-based real estate giant and, like DDI, it pursued aggressive expansion into North America. But in September, Greenland sold its King Blue Hotel in downtown Toronto. Aoyuan, which has projects in the Vancouver suburbs of Burnaby and Surrey, said in November that one of its divisions is in preliminary talks to sell some of its property management services.
In 2014, DDI was in the middle of a buying spree in Nova Scotia, snapping up huge swaths of cheap land while wining and din-
ing Canadian politicians. In Guysborough County, a three-hour drive east of Halifax, municipal leaders embraced the new Chinese developers. As a rural county where unemployment hovers around 20 per cent, any potential outside investment was considered a good thing.
Among DDI's Nova Scotia acquisitions was the five-storey Pacific Building in downtown Halifax. But tenant businesses soon complained to local media about neglected repairs, and said DDI allowed the building to deteriorate. The company sold it in June, 2020.
That followed a pattern similar to DDI's purchase of three iconic downtown buildings in Detroit for US$16.4-million in 2013.
The Chinese company left the buildings with unpaid property taxes and in need of significant renovations prior to their sale to Bedrock, the U.S. real estate firm that bought the properties from DDI two and three years later.
Within three years of DDI's expansion into Nova Scotia, the company's plans appeared to have stalled. In 2016, DDI told Nova Scotia Business Inc., a government agency with which it had signed a memorandum of understanding, that it would not proceed with Crystal City and other development plans in the province. DDI did not offer an explanation.
The company said it had "decided to hold off on developments in Nova Scotia and was shifting its investment focus to acquiring assets in the USA," according to a statement from Nova Scotia Business president and chief executive Laurel Broten.
DDI's Canadian liaison said even he was kept in the dark as the plans abruptly changed and the developments stopped before advancing to the construction phase.
"The nature of a lot of these companies and their relationship to the People's Republic of China is somewhat opaque, and so you never really truly know what's happening, and you never will," said Stephen Dempsey, who was DDI's man on the ground in Nova Scotia. Mr. Dempsey said he is still a consultant for DDI.
He believes DDI's land holdings around Granite Springs Golf Club, about a half hour's drive west of Halifax, has potential for future development. The formerly neglected course on Shad Bay has returned to profitability. But Mr. Dempsey concedes it's unlikely the rest of DDI's properties, which were acquired during an aggressive period of debt-fuelled growth, will ever be developed by the company.
"I think they misunderstood the market, and they didn't have enough experience outside of China," he said. "They know large-scale developments and high-rises in Shanghai, but they had less experience with townhomes in rural Nova Scotia."
In the Municipality of the District of St.
Mary's, the community of 2,200 people where most of DDI's developments were planned, some locals still hope the Chinese projects can be revived.
But others say they're not surprised the plans didn't materialize.
"For the folks who live here, it was so farfetched, it seemed ridiculous," said Len Archibald, treasurer for the Port Hilford United Baptist Church, a whitewashed church near the proposed development, where congregants hold lobster suppers to celebrate local fishing crews. "It almost seemed too good to be true, and a little scary, to be honest."
DDI's ambitious expansion into Nova Scotia caused a stir in part because Atlantic Canada remains relatively unknown territory for Chinese property buyers.
But across Canada, large state-backed Chinese corporations and institutional investors are no longer pouring capital even into commercial real estate markets they favoured before.
Today, the investors are smaller: highnet-worth families from Hong Kong and mainland China looking for a safe place to park their wealth. They are interested in commercial real estate, but don't want to do high-profile deals. Nor do they want to draw attention to themselves.
"Institutional capital is few and far between. That tap is shut off now," said David Ho, a CBRE executive who leads a team in charge of bringing Asian capital to Vancouver, Toronto and other major North American cities. "Now, it's the average Joe who has a net worth of $5-million. And there are a lot of them."
It is too early to say whether the influx of smaller investors will offset the loss from the big companies. Many deals today are not captured in any statistics because they are private and too small. CBRE, for example, only keeps track of deals worth more than $10-million.
On the residential side, Toronto has been the top destination for Chinese buyers in Canada for at least seven years, according to Juwai IQI, an international real estate company that caters to Asian clients.
Juwai measures the volume of enquiries each city receives on its website and via its realtors. The firm says the locations with the most enquiries also usually have the most transactions. In addition to Toronto, other cities that are consistently popular with Chinese buyers are Vancouver, Montreal and Ottawa - but never a city in Atlantic Canada.
"The reality is that most Chinese property buyers have very little awareness of Atlantic Canada or its investment potential.
They know Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. But Halifax? Not so much," said Juwai co-founder Georg Chmiel.
Juwai and Canadian-based realtors say Chinese buyers typically buy real estate so their kids have a place to live while studying in Canada. That has driven the interest in Hamilton, where McMaster University is located, as well as Waterloo, Ont., home to two major universities and a growing tech hub.
After British Columbia imposed a foreign-buyers tax in 2016, Chinese buyers shifted away from Vancouver and made more enquiries and purchases in Montreal, but not Halifax or anywhere else in Atlantic Canada, according to Juwai data.
"For Chinese buyers, Montreal offers the next best combination of affordability, accessibility, investment potential and lifestyle. Montreal is relatively well known in China compared to the cities of Atlantic Canada," Mr. Chmiel said.
One Halifax realtor, however, said she has seen an increase in Chinese buyers over the past five years.
"When they first started coming into the area, they were looking for dwellings for their children to inhabit. Subsequent to that, we are seeing it spread much further outside the city as the moms and dads came," said Donna Harding, a broker with Engel & Volkers who has sold homes in the Halifax region for nearly two decades.
The average home price in Nova Scotia is up 27 per cent from prepandemic levels, but is still considered affordable at around $366,000.
Ms. Harding credits the low price points in the region as one reason for the demand.
"The sustained price appreciation gives Asian investors confidence that if they secure assets here their money is safe," she said.
She also said sales could be stemming from the Atlantic Immigration Pilot, a program introduced in 2016 to boost immigration levels to Atlantic Canada.
Ms. Harding said her real estate brokerage has helped many Asian buyers purchase multiple rental units for an investment.
But it's a different story in Guysborough County, where much of DDI's plans were focused. Realtor Marilyn Sceles said she and other agents in the area have little contact with Hong Kong or mainland Chinese buyers.
"I have not had any interactions whatsoever," said Ms. Sceles, who has worked in the area for 25 years.
Ms. Sceles lives in Boylston, about an hour's drive north of DDI's properties near Indian Harbour Lake. She said she never believed the Chinese company would develop the land.
"We never believed it was a true story.
How much checking did they do before they bought it?" she said.
But when DDI first announced its projects in Nova Scotia, there was broad and enthusiastic political support for them.
At the DDI launch event at Halifax's historic Pier 21 waterfront complex in 2014, the nearly 300 guests included officials from the province's business development bodies, Nova Scotia Business and the Greater Halifax Partnership.
On a trade mission to China later that year, then-premier Mr. McNeil visited DDI's elite Shanghai Town & Country Club.
But one Nova Scotia academic says the support for DDI may have been more about making nice with potential Chinese investors for other sectors, notably seafood exports. Jill Grant, a professor of planning at Dalhousie University, says the company's plans for Crystal City were so out of touch with the realities of rural Nova Scotia they seemed doomed to fail.
"The bigger question is how can politicians be so naive?" Prof. Grant asked. "I've never thought this was much more than a pipe dream. The scope of their project, and the location, never made much sense."
Mr. Partington, the vegetable farmer in Guysborough County, said no one has asked for the key to access the DDI property behind his farm in more than four years.
When he thinks about the Chinese company's failed plans for his rural community, he just shrugs.
"We've been promised a lot of things that never came. We're still waiting on high-speed internet," he said.

Full text: Finding the site - a large 50by-135-foot lot with a stately Victorian home and a rear laneway - was something akin to a planetary alignment, according to developer Matthew Cohen, given what he and his business partner, Brian Torry, have in mind for it.
Through a new venture called InCommon Projects, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Torry want to transform 44 Wilson Park Rd., in Toronto's Parkdale neighbourhood, into a missing-middle-type cluster of six condos. They'll do this by adding a floor to the main house, creating seven units, an internal courtyard and a laneway suite.
"We got a little lucky in the sense that there's many elements about the lot, and the building itself, which really lends itself beautifully to our proposal," Mr. Cohen says.
As important, however, was the polyglot nature of the neighbourhood's housing stock - a quirky, very "Parkdalian" confection of detached homes, rooming houses, walk-ups and apartment buildings. The mix, at least in theory, should make the project an easier sell with the City of Toronto's planning division, which polices new projects to ensure they conform with the "character" of the neighbourhood.
The InCommon proposal is definitely not garden-variety infill, but the partners say this kind of small-scale intensification fills a need. "The idea is introducing a new scale of housing to the city that we feel is necessary in bringing more families and households into established downtown neighborhoods," says Mr. Cohen, whose father, Howard, owns Context Development, one of the city's biggest builders.
The Wilson Park Road application lands at an opportune moment in terms of how the city is thinking about intensifying neighbourhoods. For years, lowrise residential areas in Toronto were basically off-limits to any kind of redevelopment except teardowns. Even more modest ventures, such as replacing a single-family home with a triplex, could face high hurdles.
In the postwar suburbs, preamalgamation zoning rules expressly forbids anything except detached homes. In older areas in the core, the mish-mash of housing types in some pre-Second World War neighbourhoods such as Parkdale - where duplexes, triplexes or walk-ups may share blocks with single-family homes - was grandfathered into postwar zoning rules.
But rising land prices, investment trends, gentrification and neighbourhood opposition generally conspired to prevent the construction of more small-scale multiunit projects. A similar venture to InCommon's, a 12-unit infill in Deer Park, has received much publicity and drawn the ire of the local residents association.
Even luxury townhouse infills can trigger intense local battles and lengthy challenges at the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.
Yet the city's planning policies - and in particular sacred cows such as the principle of protecting "stable" neighbourhoods - are evolving bit by bit. Last year, council adopted a report, "Expanding Housing Options," which cautiously puts forward the notion of permitting missingmiddle-type projects, such as garden suites, to go up in low-rise residential areas.
In October, the planning department launched a public consultation survey on allowing multiplexes, and the city is in the process of looking at related moves, such as intensifying "major streets" (which, like parts of Mount Pleasant Road, for example, are a step down from arterials), and approving small-scale commercial uses in neighbourhoods. Yet council recently pushed back on one related policy, allowing rooming houses across the city.
Other North American cities, such as Seattle and Portland, as well as the state of California, have pushed forward with more aggressive planning reforms allowing greater intensification in neighbourhoods, Ryerson University planning professor David Amborski notes. "It's really moving at a snail's pace in Toronto."
The InCommon plan for 44 Wilson Park Rd. is certainly more ambitious than the city's definition of a multiplex, which is two to four units. Mr. Cohen says the seven units will vary in size from one 430-square-foot studio to variously configured two- and threebedroom units, with sufficient space for a family.
Four will have more than 1650 sq. ft. of interior space, and all but the studio are designed to include a private outdoor terrace. "We really are trying to create family spaces for the most part, so our three-bedroom units also have a family room or an office, a living room or dining room," adds Mr. Torry, who is also a real estate broker with PSR and a long-time member of a local residents association. (The team hasn't yet released its price points.)
As for built form, the most unusual feature, in terms of Toronto's vernacular, is that the complex will envelop an internal rear courtyard, which will have landscaping and possibly an amenity such as a shared sauna or an outdoor kitchen. "I did some work with the Center for Social Innovation earlier in my career," Mr. Cohen says, "and they talk about creating ‘collision points,' where you bump into your neighbour and you maybe weren't necessarily planning on it."
Larger townhouse complexes often have communal backyard space, but these plots tend to be large and open. The internal courtyard of the Wilson Park project will be more akin to the kinds of enclosed backyards that are created by the construction of a laneway suite.
According to InCommon architect Timothy Mitanidis, a principal of Creative Union Network, the project is heading off to the Committee of Adjustment in November. He points out that it would be possible to tear down the house and build a very large replacement without going through this process. But the InCommon plan requires several variances on height and parking, even though it won't exceed the lot's allowable density. The zoning bylaw states that 45 per cent of the interior space - about 4,000 sq. ft. for the proposed expansion - must belong to a single residence. Mr. Mitanidis says he didn't think this particular regulation will undermine their case.
Mr. Cohen and Mr. Torry, who once helped corral local opposition to a condo on Roncesvalles, say they canvassed the neighbours and decided to add more parking than the city required, at least in part to make the units attractive to people with children.
Ultimately, their longer-term plan is to use this venture, if they can get it off the drawing board, as a kind of template to develop other smaller-scale condo projects on larger residential lots initially developed for a single home.
One challenge, they concede, will be finding properly scaled lots in neighbourhoods where there are already missing-middletype buildings.
The other, of course, is figuring out how to navigate community and regulatory naysayers. Although the city is looking at precisely this kind of intensification, InCommon's team concedes it's difficult to anticipate what will happen at the Committee of Adjustment, which has shot down more innocuous projects. As Mr. Cohen says, "It's a crap shoot."

How storefronts can renew downtown Calgary

Full text: Vacancy rates in downtown Calgary have been in steady ascent since 2015, yet the most heavily funded initiatives brought forward by the Greater Downtown Plan - the incentive for office conversion, the downtown vibrancy capital program and the Arts Commons transformation - won't materialize for at least another year, delaying the much-needed reactivation of the area.
In August, CREB reported a vacancy rate of 16 per cent for retail storefronts in downtown Calgary - the highest vacancy rate of the retail category in the city. "We're worried about having these dead areas," says Thom Mahler, manager of urban initiatives at the City of Calgary about storefront vacancy.
"We need to really focus on making sure that we've got continuous activity along the street."
However, the activation of these privately owned spaces is not formally considered by the city's ambitious downtown plan.
"The $55-million vibrancy program is focused on places where the city can actually do an intervention," Mr. Mahler explains. "So that would include our public rights-of-way and where we own buildings." There's also $5-million available to fund art installations, festivals and events at key downtown locations over the next three years But according to Jim Morrow, adjunct professor of sociology at the University of Alberta and coauthor of Activating Space Field Guide, cities tend to overestimate the impact of public space programming. "They always want to go and program a park," he says.
"And cities believe you can program your way out of everything."
Indeed, formal programming isn't as effective as cities may lead people to think, Prof. Morrow says, emphasizing the importance of storefronts as an interface between public and private space. "The whole point of a shop having a big front window is to open the shop to the street. ... It's a private shop, but the shop provides a very public function."
Furthermore, high street-front vacancy could put a dent on the effectiveness of Calgary's Greater Downtown Plan to revitalize the city's core. "The longer that something is empty, the more likely it is to be a blight," Prof. Morrow says.
"[Vacant spaces] also have a tendency to create a negative perception of an area. People don't go there because there's nothing there to do, and then that becomes a cycle where it feeds itself: People don't go there so businesses don't open."
While high-end restaurants and specialty stores catering to corporate workers in downtown Calgary are no longer viable, Prof.
Morrow says he believes the temporary activation of vacant storefronts with uses that add social value could be a way out of the cycle. "The ideal use for temporary use would be to have a space that helps local creators [and] community groups."
And that's precisely what Good Neighbour, a Calgary social enterprise is set up to do.
Located at the intersection of 1st Street and 5th Avenue SE, adjacent to the Bow, Good Neighbour is a temporary pay-what-you-can market that came to be owing to the support of a communityminded landlord whose property had sat vacant for more than two years.
"Our goal in entering into our lease with Good Neighbour was to both contribute to the revitalization of downtown by activating the street with a lively concept," says the landlord, who asked his name be withheld. "Properties that are presently vacant and are not readily leasable can be used for interim uses and benefit the community and assist not-forprofit companies with minimal financial impact."
Activating vacant space with socially valuable uses can bring back footfall for nearby properties and businesses, too, Prof. Morrow says. "That's the whole point of temporary use, to get some footfall into spaces."
So far, according to Alice Lam, a Calgary community activator and co-founder of Good Neighbour, the market "has become a point of interest for people who are downtown." Whether it is to shop at the market, drop off donations or simply check out the newly brightened space, there's a constant influx of people in and around the building.
"We are creating community not only for our neighbours, but for the businesses as well," she says.
However, funding this type of initiative is not currently within the scope of Calgary's Greater Downtown Plan. "[Good Neighbour] is a good example of the possibilities that we can consider, although we don't have a formal program for that," Mr. Mahler says, adding that activating vacant retail spaces is "definitely a priority - we just don't have a specific strategy on how to address that."
Since Good Neighbour opened its doors to the public in July, other community organizations have reached out to Ms. Lam to learn how they can use vacant space downtown to advance their mission. "I would really encourage [the city] to lead by example, to do some of these incubator spaces, to try new ideas," she says.
"There's no shortage of people who would fill those spaces right now, it's just that the cost is too high." Despite high vacancy rates in Calgary's downtown, rents have been slow to come down low enough to become accessible to tenants such as Good Neighbour.
"It costs [investors] nothing to leave a space empty," Prof. Morrow says. "So they will leave a space empty for as long as they can while their money appreciates."
And this comes at a cost to the community. "Pretty much once a place has not been rented for a year, it will sit at least another two years empty - and that's very concerning," he adds.
Ms. Lam, who also works as a property manager, says she believes local landlords are more likely to be motivated to give back to the community, as opposed to multinational real estate investors. "Local landlords are very dependent on what's happening in our city," she says, and Prof. Morrow echoes her observation.
"What we find is that there's a lot of properties that are owned by local owners or by people who live in the region, and when you can get face to face with them and explain to them what you're going to do, they see great potential," Prof. Morrow says about temporary activations.
And Good Neighbour's landlord sees this potential. "To demonstrate the resilience of the downtown area, landlords can ... seek out creative ways to fill vacant main-floor retail spaces with uses that are both not traditional and have a social benefit," the landlord said in a statement.
With 6,000 square feet of leasable space available in the building, Ms. Lam and the landlord are already scheming what comes next at Good Neighbour. "Now he wants to turn the building into an arts and culture hub," she says.
But to do that, they need more than a rent-free space. "We're looking to see if we can get sponsors or ultimately the City of Calgary to provide a grant to us for building the space because we are providing such an important need for this area downtown."
To date, Good Neighbour has partnered with a number of charities and agencies that provide front-line support, including Closer to Home, the Calgary Immigrant Women's Association, and the Alex. "We're trying to fit everybody in, but [the space] is not that big at the end of the day," Ms. Lam says. "So we're being very creative with how we share space and move some things aside."

Full text: THE LISTING A series of moves by U.S.based property technology companies suggest Canadian real estate watchers may soon have to familiarize themselves with an approach to residential home-selling and investing known as the "iBuyer" model.
Popularized by Opendoor Technologies Inc., founded in 2014, an iBuyer is a company that uses algorithmic price modelling to assess the value of a home in order to make a seller an instant offer without the fuss associated with a traditional real estate listing.
In recent years, the appetite of these companies has grown, with some markets in the U.S. sun belt seeing 5 per cent to 11 per cent of the homes sold going directly to iBuyers, who typically make some improvements and flip those homes back onto the market for higher prices.
But the iBuyer narrative had a major plot twist in early November when one of the major players, U.S.-based real estate listings platform Zillow, announced it was shutting down its Zillow Offers division and laying off 2,000 people. Zillow reported the division may end up costing it US$569-million in write-downs and left the company holding onto thousands homes it may have to sell at a loss.
Analysts at KeyBanc Capital markets estimate two-thirds of its listings are now worth less than what it paid for the homes, averaging 4.5 per cent below the purchase price.
The sudden collapse came even after Zillow's own data (released over the summer) showed iBuying was setting new records in 2021: More than 15,000 homes worth close to US$5.3-billion were sold to iBuyers in the second quarter, doubling the totals from the previous quarter.
By August, the share of all U.S.
homes sold to iBuyers passed 1.5 per cent, a new high for the industry.
"What happened here with Zillow's iBuyer business imploding is definitely a Zillow problem," said Mike DelPrete, a tech entrepreneur and investor who has closely watched the "proptech" market in recent years.
Essentially, even though Zillow was buying 100 houses a day before its crash, a litany of execution issues meant operating margins lagged behind rivals Opendoor and Offerpad Inc., who were better able to cash in on a hot housing market that saw prices rise across the United States in 2021.
"These companies [Opendoor and Offerpad] were making tons of money because they'd pick up a home, and sell it a month later and make tens of thousands of dollars on it. ... They have flirted with profitability this year," Mr. DelPrete said. "But Zillow stands out like a sore thumb: it just hasn't improved its core economics; it's losing much more money and never even approached profitability."
At the same time, Opendoor has announced plans to hire 100 engineers in Canada after buying Toronto-based digital renovation service Skylight in September.
But the company is being tightlipped about any expansion in Canada.
"Our goal is to serve anyone looking to move, but we have no plans to share about Canada at this time," said Ian Wong, cofounder and chief technology officer at Opendoor.
Among the Canadian roles in Vancouver and Toronto are "MLS ingestion engineer," which requires a person to dig through the digital real estate listing systems for transaction data that is necessary to build pricing models.
While Opendoor has hired close to a thousand new workers in the last year, there are currently no "ingestion engineer" jobs posted for any of its 44 local markets in the U.S.
"I wouldn't expect to see them expanding their operation to Canada any time soon; the market opportunity in the U.S. is huge and there's plenty of fish to fry," Mr. DelPrete said. "Expanding internationally introduces all these new issues. ... I don't know why they'd want to tackle that."
There are no pure iBuyer companies currently operating in Canada, though in 2018 a company called Properly launched in Calgary with an iBuyer business plan. Despite securing a $100-million debt vehicle from Silicon Valley Bank and raising $44-million in venture capital earlier this year (the syndicate of investors included executives from both Opendoor and Zillow) Properly's current business plan could be described as iBuyer-lite.
"We're a new type of real estate brokerage," said Anshul Ruparell, co-founder and chief executive officer of Properly.
Mr. Ruparell said the iBuyer model it tried when it launched in Calgary was pressured by a prepandemic real estate slump, and found the convenience factor wasn't enough to endear Canadians to the higher-than-normal transaction fees necessary to ensure its margins.
The company's new plan is a home-buying innovation it calls "Sale Assurance": a contractual agreement to buy a home at a market rate that allows the seller to tap into their home equity in a sort-of supersized bridge loan so they can put an offer on a new home. Properly's team of 30 real estate agents then goes out and sells the house - with the standard 5-per-cent commission - and returns any sale profits above the initial contract to the seller.
"We effectively provide the customer with a contract, regarded by the banks as a firm sale," he said, and then the company has between 90 days and 150 days for its team to sell the home, after which if it hasn't sold it commits to buying the home themselves.
Mr. Ruparell said that after several months of operations in the Toronto-area Properly hasn't yet had to buy anything itself.
In the U.S., the iBuyer companies make no such promise to keep fees low or refund excess profits. Indeed, those features are the crux of the business.
"Does it [iBuying] add new housing supply? No. Does it make financialization greater? Yeah. Is it likely to be met - right or wrong - with policy barriers? Yes," said George Carras, founder of Toronto-based real estate business incubator R-Labs.
Mr. Carras said that if iBuyers come north, Canadian home owners and hopeful buyers could find themselves in the middle of a struggle between the big capital that funds iBuyer platforms, and policy makers looking to preserve affordability.
"This is clearly addressing a need to expand their investible universe into that [residential real estate] asset class," Mr. Carras said, of the large institutional investors who have relatively few options for large-scale participation in lucrative residential real estate. "As far as policy stuff goes, the policy response to market events tends to be a blunt instrument, but it's clearly spelled out in the [federal] Liberal housing plan."
Indeed, of the first lines of that campaign document was a pledge: "You shouldn't lose a bidding war on your home to speculators."
The example of Zillow shows that even without regulatory pushback, the iBuyer business is not for the faint of heart.
"iBuying is hard; buying and selling real estate at scale is really difficult," Mr. DelPrete said. "It's tempting to say technology can go in and solve it, but there's no replacing people at the end of the day."

Full text: Valérie Plante has been re-elected mayor of Montreal in a striking endorsement of her controversial brand of green urbanism that has criss-crossed the city with bike lanes, often angering drivers and small businesses, as she scored a second surprise victory over Denis Coderre, the man she unseated four years ago.
For Mr. Coderre, a former Liberal cabinet minister, this defeat comes as a humbling failure to redeem his upset loss in 2017, after a campaign when personal liabilities undermined his message of security and competent management.
The anticipated re-match of the last mayoral race pitted Ms. Plante's party, the left-leaning and eco-conscious Projet Montréal, against Mr. Coderre's Ensemble Montréal, with its focus on law and order and economic development.
Projet partisans gathered at a downtown theatre screamed with joy as Ms. Plante's re-election was announced on Sunday night, chanting "Valérie, Valérie," in recognition of the woman who has transformed their party from an idealistic upstart to a local political powerhouse. With fewer than half of polling places reporting, she had received 52 per cent of ballots cast to 38 per cent for Mr. Coderre.
The loss may end Mr. Coderre's rollercoaster career in municipal politics. After years of demoralizing corruption investigations that led to the resignation of one mayor and the arrest and eventual conviction of another, Mr. Coderre swept into power with a mandate to clean up City Hall. He created the post of inspector-general to root out graft and endeared himself to voters, at first, with his energy and showmanship.
But Montrealers eventually soured on his publicity stunts and penchant for expensive megaprojects.
Left-leaning and ecologicallyminded, Projet Montréal swept to city-wide power in 2017 after years governing the dense central borough of Le Plateau-Mont-Royal with an ambitious program of building bike lanes and widening sidewalks to encourage modes of transport other than driving.
Although the party fulfilled a number of its progressive promises, Ms. Plante and her team looked vulnerable in the lead-up to this campaign. Some of the mayor's favoured urban design projects, such as a cycling highway on Saint-Denis Street and the pedestrianization of commercial strip Sainte-Catherine Street, involved grinding construction and headaches for drivers.
In the meantime, Mr. Coderre was planning his return to politics before finally launching his campaign in March. Presenting himself as a competent administrator who would run a more orderly city and control housing prices by allowing for more density, he jumped to an early lead.
But Mr. Coderre stumbled in some of his policy proposals, such as allowing construction of skyscrapers taller than the city's beloved Mount Royal and banning drinking in parks after 8 p.m., both of which he rescinded after backlash.
His emphasis on security seemed to resonate with some Montrealers made anxious by a series of brazen gang shootings in suburban neighbourhoods, but his poll numbers declined after the official launch of the campaign in September. He and Ms. Plante both promised to hire 250 more police officers in their next term.
Housing emerged as the top issue in the race, fuelled by soaring real estate prices and steadily climbing rents, both unfamiliar in an historically affordable city. Ms. Plante has promised to spend $800-million buying land for affordable housing and to build 60,000 affordable units in the coming years.
Ms. Plante's re-election effort seems to have been boosted by a sense that Montreal is in good shape, overall. The city's higher home prices and a recent labour shortage are side effects of an economic winning streak for the city, as it becomes a hub for growing tech industries such as video games, AI and special effects.
Many of the Plante administration's controversial urban planning schemes, meanwhile, like the Saint-Denis bike artery, have turned out to be relatively popular.

Full text: When the two American developers arrived with their cowboy hats, pointy-toed boots and southern accents, talking about building an "island paradise," some locals viewed them with squinty-eyed skepticism.
But by the mid-1980s, Campobello Island's herring factories were closing and the island's 1,500 residents needed jobs.
Larry Kuca and Jim McDougal's plan to turn Campobello into a coastal getaway for moneyed American visitors - complete with a marina, shopping centre, water slide, air strip and ski hill - represented some much-needed investment.
Almost as soon as they bought land on the island, the Americans were dogged by legal problems south of the border. Namely, the Whitewater scandal, during which the two men were drawn, along with Bill and Hillary Clinton, into an FBI investigation related to a failed attempt to sell vacation properties in the Ozarks. The legal and financial fallout scuttled their Campobello dreams.
Now, about 40 years later, the land Mr. Kuca and Mr. McDougal hoped to turn into a vacation hot spot on the Bay of Fundy may finally be developed.
In an online auction starting Monday, the New Brunswick government is selling the first of 74 lots from the pair's original purchase, after acquiring the properties in a bid to recover unpaid taxes.
"I think the time is right to get these properties in the hands of other people, so they can enjoy this beautiful island, and get some revenue back to the province," said Jill Green, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure.
In January, 1984, the Arkansas pair bought nearly half of Campobello Island, paying $1.1-million for 3,900 acres, and began building roads and subdividing their land into smaller plots. They put up a giant billboard for their new venture, which they called the Campobello Co. They advertised building lots and started touring around in a helicopter.
"We're all old fishermen here, that's our roots, so we were naturally suspicious," said Theresa Mitchell, a lifelong Campobello resident who worked for the pair when she was a teenager, cleaning rooms and preparing meals in a guesthouse used to host potential buyers.
"We all wanted to know, who are these guys? They were something different than we'd ever seen before."
They sold about 100 of their 700 lots on the island before they ran into trouble. In that time, they attracted some influential partners, including Sheffield Nelson, a former candidate for Arkansas governor who at the time was a member of the Republican National Committee, and Jerry Jones, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Cowboys. But they never came close to achieving their vision with the Campobello project.
Some of the Campobello Co.'s land, including several one- to three-acre oceanfront properties, was previously sold in tax sales dating back to 2008. But Ms. Green is hopeful the bulk of the land will finally find new owners in today's red-hot real estate market, which has been fuelled by out-of-province buyers. More tax sales are expected in February and March, she said.
While the scale of the developer's plans in the 1980s may have seemed out of touch with the island's rustic charm, Americans have long been a part of the fabric of Campobello. Many of the earliest settlers were New Englanders, who intermarried with Welsh fishermen to give the island an accent all its own.
Cottages here fly both countries' flags. Islanders root for the Boston Red Sox and New England Patriots, carry U.S. currency in their pockets and often earn paycheques in Maine, which is located a few hundred yards away, on the other side of Campobello's only bridge to the mainland.
The model for Mr. Kuca and Mr. McDougal's plan was forged a century earlier, when a consortium of Boston and New York businessmen built three luxury hotels on the island.
The resorts catered to wealthy Americans fleeing the heat of crowded U.S. cities. Among the affluent families who came and ultimately bought property on Campobello were the Roosevelts, who brought their son, future U.S.
president Franklin Roosevelt, every summer.
In much the same way Mr. Kuca and Mr. McDougal envisioned in the 1980s, visitors in the 19th century came first as guests of the hotels, explored Campobello's rugged beauty and were encouraged to buy a piece of the island for themselves.
"The idea was you'd fall in love with the island, purchase a piece of land adjacent to the hotel and you'd build your own summer retreat," said Will Kernohan, manager of interpretation and curator at Roosevelt Campobello International Park, which operates tours of the Roosevelt family's summer home and property on the island.
"The island is staggeringly beautiful. When you come here and see it, it's easy to understand how it would have been a magnificent resort."
Unlike their early predecessors, however, the Arkansas developers never got that far. As their legal troubles grew in the U.S., they stopped visiting Campobello, and soon locals began reading about the Whitewater saga.
Mr. McDougal, who died in prison in 1998, was convicted of 18 felony counts of fraud and conspiracy charges after he attempted to cover the losses from his failed Ozarks development with millions in savings-and-loan funds.
Mr. Kuca, who avoided prison time by agreeing to testify at the Whitewater trial, was given two years probation for misappropriating money. The Campobello Co.
collapsed after that.
Ms. Mitchell said she never had any issue with the pair from Arkansas and was always paid on time. Islanders were stunned when they saw stories about the criminal investigation into a vacation property scheme not unlike the one the two men were trying to build on Campobello, she said.
In the years since, the island's population has steadily shrunk to about 800 people. Ms. Mitchell is hopeful the empty land the developers imagined as part of an exclusive island getaway will finally attract new owners. Campobello Island, which has seen waves of American investment before, needs new blood, she said.
"We need new people on Campobello," she said. "Otherwise, we'll become a ghost town."

Municipal election isn't likely to slow Montreal's boom

Full text: On stage, they were a study in contrasts: Denis Coderre in a sober business suit and thick-framed glasses; Valérie Plante smiling broadly in an informal pink button-up shirt.
In an hour of rapid-fire debate, the city's leading mayoral candidates showed their stripes: Ms. Plante, the famously cheerful current mayor, offered a program heavy on affordable housing, bike lanes and expanded parks. Mr. Coderre, the more severe former mayor, emphasized density, security and cleanliness.
But despite their different programs and personalities, the top contestants in this anticipated political rubber match had something deeper in common: They have presided over a recent golden age for the city. In the past eight years, across each of their administrations, Montreal has been on a roll. Economic growth and political stability have returned to a place that was plagued for decades by their opposite.
Both candidates have had something to do with that winning streak, but larger factors are at play, and regardless of who wins on Sunday, few observers expect the boom times to end soon. As Chamber of Commerce president Michel Leblanc acknowledged days after the debate he had organized, "If Denis Coderre wins, it'll be fine. If Valérie Plante wins, it'll be fine."
Since the 1970s, Montreal has struggled with a series of peculiar crises: anglophone flight, biker wars, Olympic white elephants, independence referendums and well-publicized corruption. The city developed a reputation for decay and mismanagement. Today, its main concerns are closer to those of other prosperous cities: housing affordability, mobility, climate change. Montreal doesn't lack for problems, Mr. Leblanc said, but they are finally "rich people problems."
The city's new bullish mood is reflected in provincial economic statistics - Quebec had its lowest unemployment rate since 1966 and its healthiest public finances in a generation before the pandemic - but equally in cultural signs of the times.
Last week's fire that consumed the façade of Super Sexe, a seedy former strip club on Sainte-Catherine Street, was a symbol of the city's changed fortunes. Although the flamboyant sign was a minor landmark, it also represented a fallow period for the local economy: The business opened in 1978, shortly after the election of the sovereigntist Parti Québécois, which sparked a devastating flight of capital and anglophone Quebeckers.
"When Montreal lost its status as a metropolis, it became a city of vice," said Glenn Castanheira, executive director of Montreal's downtown business association, in an interview before the fire.
"We've moved beyond that."
The arrival of gaming giant Ubisoft in 1997, two years after the close call of Quebec's last referendum, marked a turning point for the city. The French company's red-brick headquarters in a former textile factory became an anchor of the hipster neighbourhood par excellence, Mile End, just when Montreal needed an injection of economic animal spirits.
Rivers of tech money now flow through the city and its zeitgeist. One of the buzziest plays of the season, Manuel de la vie sauvage, satirized the local startup scene; in the American TV show Mythic Quest, an office comedy about the video-game industry co-produced by Ubisoft, the scary corporate headquarters are located in Montreal.
A deep malaise about urban governance persisted until more recently, Daniel Sanger writes in his muchdiscussed new book Saving The City: The Challenge of Transforming A Modern Metropolis. The journalist and former staffer for Projet Montréal chronicles the rise of Ms. Plante's lefty, ecofriendly political party amid the demoralizing spectacle of the Charbonneau Commission, which revealed widespread corruption in city contracts.
Asked their feelings about local politics in 2013, city residents were most likely to describe themselves as embarrassed, angry and pessimistic, Mr. Sanger points out. That same year, Mr. Coderre was elected mayor and promptly created the position of inspector-general to clean up city hall - the one accomplishment for which Ms. Plante begrudgingly praised her predecessor at a recent press conference.
When Projet Montréal insurgents unseated him in 2017, they set about implementing an urbanist vision centred on the almost totemic figure of the bike lane. The party had already governed the bourgeoisbohemian borough of Le Plateau-MontRoyal for years with an aggressive program of narrowing streets, removing parking and otherwise reorienting life toward cycling and walking.
Projet Montréal's transformation of the Plateau also made it a more attractive home for the knowledge workers flooding into companies such as Ubisoft. That drove up housing prices to previously unimaginable heights in what was once a workingclass neighbourhood dominated by renters. "We were well aware that many of our efforts to make the borough greener, safer, and healthier were fuelling its gentrification," Mr. Sanger writes.
Eight years of clean and green governance under Mr. Coderre and Ms. Plante have exported the Plateau model to the city as a whole. Montreal is in the midst of what is routinely referred to as a housing crisis: After decades of relatively stagnant real estate values, the median price of a single-family home in the Montreal area virtually doubled from 2013 to more than $500,000 this year. Condo developments have turned neglected industrial neighbourhoods such as Griffintown into forests of gleaming towers. In the mayor's home neighbourhood of Rosemont, it can be hard to find bike parking outside the trendy new wine bars.
Ted Rutland has seen this sometimesunsettling transformation up close as an associate professor of geography, planning and environment at Concordia University.
"It's become a cleaned-up, more aesthetically pleasing city," he said, "at the expense of some character, and affordability."
How to grapple with too much of a good thing has become a defining theme of the election campaign. More density is the crux of Mr. Coderre's answer. He briefly proposed allowing the construction of buildings taller than the city's beloved Mount Royal before backing down. For her part, Ms. Plante has promised to spend $800-million over 10 years buying land for affordable housing.
The challenge for the next mayor, Mr. Leblanc of the Chamber of Commerce said, is to manage the inequalities produced by Montreal's flush of prosperity. "Montreal was historically a poor city," he added with a smile. "I'd rather have these problems."

Full text: 73 Auburn Shores Cape SE, Calgary AUBURN BAY Asking price: $919,000 (September, 2021) Selling price: $919,000 (September, 2021) Taxes: $6,425 (2021) Days on the market: one Listing agent: Steven Hill, Sotheby's International Realty Canada THE ACTION This three-bedroom bungalow made its debut when local COVID-19 cases were peaking, so there was concern that might affect buyer turnout. To the seller's relief, there were two visitors right away and one produced an unconditional full-price offer hours later.
"There weren't many high-end bungalows in that community for sale, so it was a rare property," agent Steven Hill said.
"Something that has no conditions is unusual because it carries risk with it for the buyer. However, this property being built so new and to a such nice, high standard - it even had radon gas mitigation installed - it gave the buyers complete confidence they knew exactly what they were buying."
WHAT THEY GOT Auburn Bay Lake anchors a subdivision of twostorey homes and bungalows, like this 1,762-square-foot model on a pie-shaped lot with 39-foot frontage.
Built in 2018, it contains open cooking, dining and entertaining areas, and one bedroom with bathing, dressing and laundry facilities. Directly below is a recreation area, two bedrooms and a bathroom with heated floors.
Annual homeowners association fees of $475 include use of a beach, clubhouse and tennis courts.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "Being a lake community, it's a little more prestigious than some older communities in the southeast, and it's absolutely beautiful," Mr. Hill said.
"This district is also very close to the South Health Campus and a number of great new amenities," Mr. Hill said. "It really appeals to the executive types that want their bedroom on the main floor, but might have mature children of college age or teenage that would like their space downstairs."
This particular bungalow is also one of few with an attached triple garage. "And it's even more difficult to find one that's under $1-million," Mr. Hill said.

Full text: Toronto's home prices accelerated in October, as the persistent shortage of properties for sale continued to fuel competition and push values higher.
The Toronto Regional Real Estate Board, or TRREB, said its home price index for a typical home, which adjusts for volatility, rose 4 per cent to $1,128,600 from September to October.
The index rose after climbing 2 per cent from August to September, marking the second consecutive month of increases since spring. Home values inflated across the entire region, with the price index for the typical home in suburban Peel topping $1-million for the first time.
"Things are heating up again," said Leah Zlatkin, mortgage broker with Brite Mortgage, who works in the Toronto region.
"People are still aggressively borrowing to buy homes."
There were 9,783 home resales in the Toronto area in October, with a jump in condo sales offsetting the decline in house sales.
That was the second consecutive month of higher activity since March.
However, fewer homeowners listed their houses for sale last month, leading to a 13-per-cent decline from September to October. The volume of new listings is one-third lower than fall of last year.
"We have definitely seen the market tighten since the summer," said Jason Mercer, the board's chief market analyst.
With the ratio of sales to new listings continuing to increase, Mr. Mercer said "that suggests more competition between buyers that can lead to an acceleration in price growth."
The pandemic's real estate boom has been driven by home buyers' desire for bigger properties to deal with the perpetual stay-at-home mandates.
But even though most pandemic restrictions have been lifted, home buyers are still seeking more living space in the suburbs.
In Halton, just west of Toronto, the home price index rose 6 per cent from September to October.
Compared with fall of last year, the index is up 32 per cent. In Durham, to the east of the city, and in Simcoe, to the north, the index is up 35 per cent year-overyear.
Realtors and mortgage brokers said they expect demand to continue as their clients try to take advantage of the record low mortgage rates.
Major banks have already started to raise their fixed mortgage rates, and the Bank of Canada has suggested it will increase the benchmark interest rate earlier than it had previously forecast.
"It makes them want to buy sooner. They will want to get into the market and secure their [mortgage] rate," said Michelle Plach, a realtor with Justo Brokerage.
Ms. Zlatkin, the mortgage broker, agreed. "People are getting the antsy feeling to make the move now before interest rates change," she said.
In the Vancouver area, the country's priciest real estate market, there was also a decline in new listings. That bolstered competition and prices, though not to the same extent as Toronto.
The Vancouver area home price index for detached and semi-detached houses was up 1.2 per cent from September to October, according to the local board.
The index for a detached house reached $1,850,500.
In the Fraser Valley, the index rose for every type of property, with detached houses up 2.5 per cent to $1,396,700. That is 33 per cent higher than October of last year. Resales in both regions were higher month-over-month.

Full text: When the water-heating system of Arthur Erickson Place, a 26-storey office tower at 1075 West Georgia St.
in Vancouver, was due for replacement, it gave commercial real estate services firm Colliers an opportunity to make the 1986 building much more sustainable.
The project was kickstarted by building owner KingSett Capital's Innovation in Sustainability competition, which Colliers won.
The company worked with a local consultant to replace the aging natural-gas-fired hot-water system with a modern heat-pump system powered by electricity and using carbon dioxide as the refrigerant.
With British Columbia's lowcarbon hydroelectricity system, it enables the building to avoid approximately 40 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually.
The upgrade, which brings significant greenhouse gas reduction, is only the first step in a longterm goal of getting the building to zero carbon by 2025, says Sean Drygas, who has just been appointed Colliers's global lead, environmental, social, and governance, a newly created senior leadership position.
CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES It's an example of what has become a global phenomenon: aiming for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Even oil-rich Saudi Arabia has just announced a target of achieving net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases, which are mostly produced by burning fossil fuels, by 2060. That's 10 years later than the current 2050 goals of Canada and the United States.
Toronto-based Colliers is going even further. It has just committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions for all buildings it occupies in 66 countries by 2030 and is developing a program for building owners and tenants to eliminate their building-related greenhouse gas production.
"A major starting point is switching to cleaner energy sources and the carbon intensity of how the electricity was generated," Mr. Drygas says.
That is extremely variable depending on location. "For instance, British Columbia, Quebec or Manitoba with large-scale hydro generation, electricity is very low carbon. However, if you're in Alberta, Texas or China, where a lot of coal is used to generate electricity, it is much more carbon intense."
But that's destined to change rapidly, as natural gas, solar and wind have become cheaper than coal to produce electricity, Mr. Drygas explains.
For example, the owners of coal plants in Alberta are required federally to phase out by 2029, but all three have declared they are going to voluntarily phase out by 2023. "Not only do they see the writing on the wall from a regulatory standpoint, but the economics simply aren't there any more," Mr. Drygas says.
The scientists who advise the United Nations (currently meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, until Nov. 12 to discuss climate change) have laid out a pathway to keeping global warming below 2 C - ideally 1.5 C - by the end of the century.
"And to get there we need to be net zero globally by 2050. That means all electricity has to be a combination of wind, solar and hydro or nuclear, which are considered zero carbon," Mr. Drygas says.
BUILDING AND RENOVATION Architectural and structural changes to buildings should be another part of the equation, says Lisa Bate, global sustainability lead and senior principal of B+H Architects, which is committed to achieving net-zero operations in its studios around the world by 2030 and net-zero whole life carbon by 2040.
The firm, along with several of their global clients, are also signatories to the World Green Building Council's Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment to eliminate operational and embodied carbon emissions from construction and renovation, promoting reuse of buildings and materials.
"Building and mechanical system upgrades have to work together because you can't get the results you want from a mechanical retrofit if you still have a leaky envelope," Ms. Bate says.
The return on investment is proving to be very fast and can be as quick as seven years for retrofitting holistically.
Buildings from the 1970s and ‘80s are prime candidates for retrofitting because many were built with inefficient glazing and exterior wall assemblies prone to air leakage.
PHOTOVOLTAIC An example is at Humber College in Toronto, where a 1989 postmodern glass block and insulated panel-clad building became the first retrofitted building to be certified net-zero carbon by the Canada Green Building Council, as well as Passive House Canada Certified.
Humber Building Nx was retrofitted in a project that included a 25-kilowatt-hour rooftop photovoltaic array; over all, the retrofit resulted in a 70-per-cent reduction in energy-use intensity, a 90per-cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a 97-per-cent reduction in heating energy required.
Building owners and tenants are aligning themselves to netzero goals around the world because, "put simply - green buildings are more cost-effective for businesses," says Jon Gibson, global real estate company Avison Young's recently named global director of ESG strategy.
"A long line of investors and companies are facing demand from shareholders, clients and individuals to up their game on ESG," he says.
Being green also has advantages for talent attraction and retention.
As a younger generation enters the work force by 2025 (more than 75 per cent of the work force globally will be millennials or Gen Z), "it has become more important for companies to prioritize issues that matter to their employees - environmental sustainability being one of those issues," Mr. Gibson says. "Let's also remember a high proportion of decision makers within companies in certain sectors, such as tech, are in the millennial grouping."
RECYCLED JEANS Avison Young is applying net-zero carbon approaches to its own offices. The Edmonton office, for instance, uses recycled denim jeans for wall insulation, which produces 53 per cent less carbon dioxide in production than conventional fibreglass insulation.
The renovation also prevented 1,180 pounds of drywall from entering landfills, eliminating 1,548 pounds of carbon dioxide that is normally released when drywall decomposes in the landfill.
"The money you put in, you are going to get back in savings and give the building a longer lifespan because people are going to want to stay in those buildings," B+H's Ms. Bate says.
"There is growing peer pressure. Everyone is stepping up because they want to stay competitive, so there is a lot of friendly competition to be among the early adopters to reach net zero."
It's estimated that 80 per cent of today's commercial buildings will still be standing 50 years from now, she adds.
"But are they going to be relevant if they don't meet the netzero standard?"

Full text: As I write this, the sun shines through the trees that surround my home. The only noise is the ticking of my clock.
Soon, I'll take my dog for a walk past horses and large yards with modest houses set far back. The occasional vehicle will pass and I'll nod to the driver. Birds will sing from forests that stretch up the mountains and down toward the lake. In other words, my small town in British Columbia is paradise.
So why, nearly daily, do I think about leaving?
Once upon a time, I was a city person, living primarily in Calgary and Montreal. But life was hectic and the roads were literally exhausting. It wasn't what my husband and I wanted for us or our kids.
Eleven years ago, we moved to the Kootenays. The draws: the calm, scenery and cost of housing. The fact that we could run multiple errands in a blink. That we could get to know a hefty handful of people. That our kids could run freely while others kept an eye on them.
The location has been a special blessing during the pandemic.
COVID-19 took a long time coming here and it's simple to social distance. Nearly everyone has an outdoor space of their own.
"Thank goodness," we all agreed, "that we aren't stuck in apartments."
Other people wanted these benefits, too, and flocked to the country. According to Statistics Canada, between July, 2019, and July, 2020, more than 50,000 people left Toronto and almost 30,000 left Montreal for smaller towns and villages. This flow has been contrary to the previous trend, which for more than one and a half centuries saw Canadians move from rural spots to cities.
In my region, the real estate market has exploded. In March, 2021, the Kootenay Association of Realtors stated that sales numbers had been record-breaking for the previous 12 months. My own street, which used to be a farmer's field, has seen five homes constructed in the past couple of years, with foundations waiting for a sixth.
But two main factors have marred the rural ideal for me.
First: my career. While being a freelance writer is a great gig, it's hard to constantly come up with ideas. A permanent job seems so much simpler. Close to home, though, there are none, and I don't know how much teleworking will continue postpandemic.
(Plus, this area's internet sucks.)
As a registered nurse, my husband has also pondered new work possibilities - few of them local.
Second: boredom. A "sleepy" town is wonderful when you've had enough of traffic, but so is the odd boost of adrenalin. Sure, I can hike, hang at the beach, eat at the only restaurant we like. Yet I crave museums, a plethora of food, book shops and cafés where I can linger anonymously. A bit of buzz and breathlessness would be nice.
Add to that the annoyance of constantly stacking wood to feed our furnace. That our children had to move out to attend university, the closest one being 235 kilometres away. That I can't take a dance class - my lifelong pursuit until I moved here. A pottery class would also be cool. As for the local activities I have taken up - a book club and writing group - the pandemic curtailed them. I've started Zoom-based options instead, but they hurt my eyes and, as mentioned, the internet connectivity sucks.
Pandemic aside, this grumbling runs counter to a recent study of about 20,000 Canadians aged 45 to 85, which found that rural people are more satisfied with their lives than urban ones.
By e-mail to me, co-author Philip St. John, a professor of medicine at the University of Manitoba, wouldn't speculate on why this was so, but the paper indicated possibilities such as closer social networks in rural spots, more stable long-term relationships, less economic uncertainty, lower population density and an established sense of community. The paper also mentioned the 2020 World Happiness Report, which found higher scores of life satisfaction in rural areas in North America compared to urban ones.
So why do I dream of the city?
Because the grass always looks greener.
Then again, I visited Edmonton in August and roamed down Whyte Avenue. The sidewalk was packed. Cars practically brushed my shoulders. Heat sizzled off the buildings and pavement. Ambulance sirens blared. Is that the life I truly want?
Deep in my heart, I'm pretty sure the answer is no.
Hopefully, the activities my community does offer will restart postpandemic and I'll remember the joy of rural living. So will vacations, which no longer consist of seeking "paradise," but aiming instead for bustling urban centres to get my busyness fix. Because when I leave my house in the country to walk the dog or do chores, I swear there's no place better.

Full text: Canada's colleges and institutions are seeing the fallout from nearly two years of pandemic angst, in the form of an increase in mature students seeking either new skills for jobs they still love, or new jobs altogether.
"The pandemic gave people an opportunity to really rethink who they are and what it is that's important to them, as far as their careers are concerned," says Gina Antonacci, senior vice-president of academic at Humber College in Toronto.
Humber has seen a marked rise in the number of mature students, which includes students 25 and up who have been in the work force.
In 2019, this cohort represented 23 per cent of new enrolments; this year, it's 29 per cent.
"We are definitely seeing an increase in mature student activity," she says.
Not surprisingly, those students are concentrated in the college's graduate certificate programs, or "university finishing school," as it's called at Humber.
Many come with degrees from universities and are now seeking specific skills to boost their career prospects.
There has also been a jump in the college's continuous professional learning courses, she says.
For example, Humber's Centre of Entrepreneurship saw a huge spike in enrolment.
"We have seen these new enrolments in folks over the age of 25, which to me says ... they are looking at renewing their career path," says Ms. Antonacci.
Interest in health care-related programs, in particular, has increased. The college has 70 new practical nursing students this fall and increased its bachelor of science nursing cohort by 40.
The Ontario government invested in fast-tracked personal support workers' programs for longterm care employment and Humber has seen a spike in enrolment for their accelerated sixmonth program.
"What colleges do is we respond to local needs, labour needs, employment needs. And, of course, we all saw during COVID, that there was a tremendous need for front-line workers in health care," Ms. Antonacci says.
It is the role of colleges and institutions to be flexible enough to quickly adapt like that, says Denise Amyot, president and chief executive officer of College and Institutes Canada.
For example, Ms. Amyot says Centennial College in Toronto reported a 41-per-cent increase in applications to its nursing programs, a 57-per-cent increase in applications to its pharmacy technician program, as well as a 62-per-cent hike in applicants to its medical laboratory technician program.
Colleges prioritize providing flexible learning options for midcareer and mature students, she says.
"Older learners often have other obligations, whether it's work or family."
Most college students have a degree or career already, she says. They enroll with specific goals and seek flexibility in scheduling.
There are 139 member colleges across the country, many with multiple locations, and 95 per cent of Canadians live within 50 kilometres of a college campus, adds Ms. Amyot.
Most colleges also offer prior learning assessment, which means work experience and previous learning are assessed and counted toward educational goals. Students do not have to sit through redundant courses just for credits.
"It helps you to achieve your goals faster, because you can add the recognition of the knowledge and the skills that you already have," she says.
Colleges offer an array of programs, from single-day accreditations to part-time studies, diplomas, certificates and up to fouryear degrees.
There is a growing interest in particular from students and employers alike in micro-credentials - abbreviated and focused programs for specific certifications, such as project cost management, digital transformation, or introductory studies in mass timber construction.
There are thousands of such micro-credential programs at colleges across the country now, she says.
"It's quite popular with the students, especially with the people who already have skills, or who want to upskill," Ms. Amyot says.
"I love it, because it means that we are beginning to see this culture of lifelong learning, because workers realize that either they need to specialize, or they need to adjust their skill set more than once over the course of their career."
Many colleges are reporting a bump in mature students this year, she says. For example, domestic enrolment is up 10 per cent this year at the British Columbia Institute of Technology, especially in part-time studies.
"Sometimes when you stop, you realize, maybe I don't want to do that for the rest of my life.
Maybe it's an opportunity to try something I always wanted to do," she says.
"Also, people are realizing that if you want to be competitive in this labour market, you need to up your game in order to make sure you remain on the leading edge."
At Langara College in Vancouver, the pandemic has caused a shift in the average age of mature students coming back to school, says Pablo Vargas, dean of continuing studies.
A few years ago, mature students were coming back at the age of 50; now, the average age is 30.
"Part of that has to do with people going through three to five career changes in their life, whereas before it was the one career and they would stick to that," he says.
As the pandemic continued, there was a marked increase in interest in courses specific to industries that have been in transition, such as medical office administrator, advanced project management and digital animation.
There was also interest in courses clearly linked to career changes, he said, such as real estate and project management.
People have had the time to invest in areas of interest or career skills, Mr. Vargas says.
"Students saw an opportunity to branch out, whether it was because of people losing jobs, or realizing that life was a little short and there was some permission to explore," he adds.

Full text: 8544 Smylie Rd.
HAMILTON TOWNSHIP, ONT.
Asking price: $2,150,000 Taxes: $5,574.65 (2021) Lot: 499.92 feet by 624.57 feet Listing agent: Jacqueline Pennington, broker Re/Max Hallmark First Group Realty Ltd.
THE BACKSTORY Almost everyone who comes to the Crossen House on Smylie Road asks the same thing: Can I go up in the tower?
Known locally as "Andrew's Folly" it was built by the previous owners, Andrew Smith and Dr. Ruth Bothern, and the almost 50-foot-high tower is constructed from four Douglas fir logs shipped from British Columbia with two viewing platforms, one about halfway up, another on the very top.
"When the days are hot we go and live in that top level and you can see all the way around the Northumberland Hills," said owner Carol Finlay, a reverend in the Anglican Church who has been awarded the Order of Ontario for her charitable Book Clubs for Inmates.
The other place guests want to visit is the boathouse, down at the front of the almost 11-acre property nearest the road, which is a combination dock, shelter and screenedin outdoor living room on the spring-fed pond. "It could withstand a nuclear attack the way it's built," Ms. Finlay said. "We have a little boat, so you can paddle around the little island on this little pond, and geese nest on the island in the spring. Even in April with the migratory birds we'll take our blankets and our gin down.
"We have a lot of wildlife; groundhogs, skunks and weasels. We have trout in the pond, and every once and a while we get a family of martens who come and they clean out all the fish in the pond. We also have a blue heron who comes like clockwork on May 1, he stands like a statue where the stream comes for most of the summer, watching for these trout."
Her husband, famed Canadian litigator Bryan Finlay and partner emeritus with WeirFoulds LLP, once matched wits with a beaver trying to damn up the stream, even coming face to face with the busy castor Canadensis as he removed the latest load of sticks. "According to my husband, it seemed as if he spoke to him: ‘You think you're smarter than me? I'm on the nickel, let's see who'll win this,' " Ms. Finlay said.
Eventually, Canada's mascot moved on to easier pickings.
The couple found the spot (just north of Cobourg, Ont.) in 2015 when Ms. Finlay heard from Dr. Bothern that she was looking to sell her Northumberland house, but wasn't keen on the daunting work of decluttering and putting it up for sale.
"We went to see them and had a glass of wine, and we gave them an offer that was the highest amount that three real estate agents had told us it was worth," Ms. Finlay says, with the promise they would take care of the messy business of cleaning the place out. "Within half an hour we had a deal."
THE HOUSE TODAY "This house is interesting because a lot of these old houses were built very close to the road," Ms. Finlay says. "This one was set well back, so you get all that privacy, and this beautiful old house with quarried stone."
The main house dates to 1860, and was one of a number of buildings in the Cobourg area built by the Crossen family, prominent local business leaders who ran an iron foundry and eventually the Crossen Car Company, which was the largest railcar manufacturer in Canada until the turn of the 19th century.
"We only have a handful of stone houses in the area, and most of them are located well off the beaten path, this one is only five minutes from the 401," said Jacqueline Pennington, a real estate agent with Re/max Hallmark First Group. It's one of the more expensive listings in Hamilton Township, but given the demand from well-healed Torontonians looking to retire out of the city or maintain a secondary property she's confident it will find its market.
Up the long driveway the house sits on a rise, so the garage is almost entirely below grade and the side wall of the house looks three-storeys high. A set of steps walks up from the drive to the front door, from which you can survey the sweep of lawn and perennial gardens that runs down to the pond.
There are two wings to the house: The original main house is about 30-feet wide and 22-plus-feet deep, and it has the main foyer that opens up to a staircase running upstairs to the three bedrooms. To the right is a long formal living room with a fireplace on the outside framed by two windows set deep into the three-foot-thick walls with elaborate dark-stained wood casings.
To the left of the foyer is a formal dining room with three exits: One to the four-season sun porch that faces the front lawn, one in the middle of the room that leads to the foyer and the powder room located under the stairs, and another at the back of the room next to the built-in bookshelves and that leads to the kitchen in the newer wing of the house.
The kitchen is bright and white with updated appliances, an island with a stainless-steel prep surface, large rustic terracotta tiles, a long table with bench seating for eating in and an exposed stone wall on the back.
Carved into stone wall is a short hallway that leads to the sun porch, fully winterized by the Finlays, and another door to the family room. The family room is the TV hangout space, with a big stone-hearth fireplace, but the Finlays also added a threepiece bath (with shower) that makes allows the space to become a guest suite (the couch is a pullout bed).
The other big feature is just off the sun porch - which is raw stone on one side and a wall of windows on the other - and that's the in-ground salt-water pool (with attached pergola and pool hut), just beyond that is Andrew's Folly tower.
Back to the old house and upstairs are the three bedrooms (now blessedly air conditioned, another newer addition). The two bedrooms at the front of the house are similar in size, the primary bedroom distinguishes itself with a deeper closet and the secondary currently has two twin beds.
The smaller back bedroom is across the hall from the shared bath, which has a double vanity and tub-shower.
FAVOURITE SPACE The outdoors. The house is a haven for bird enthusiasts said Ms. Finlay, who has recently seen eastern bluebirds returning the area to join the more common belted kingfishers and cedar waxwings. The toughest decision is where to spend a lazy afternoon?
"Should we sit by the pool, or up in the tower, get our binoculars by the boathouse or laze out in the sunroom? These decisions are terribly difficult to make," said Ms. Finlay, who jokes the deciding factor is sometimes if you want your glass of wine sooner rather than later.
"It's such a privilege to have had a little piece of Canadian history," she said. "Except for the fact we're so creaky and decrepit, we'd stay."

ALIVE, BUT SPUTTERING: PANDEMIC

Full text: The revival of Montreal's financial centre remains as elusive as ever.
For months, employers and political leaders in Canada's second-biggest city have articulated fears that their downtown - known for its chic conviviality - would slip into decay as some 300,000 office workers shun the area and keep working remotely.
Now, new research is raising questions about the extent to which that deterioration can be reversed.
The relatively smooth rollout of Quebec's vaccine-passport system, the province's high inoculation rates, and the return of students and tourists have helped Montreal's main business district pick up momentum and avoid a ghost-town scenario.
But a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections is fuelling doubts about the area's future.
"The possibility of recovering a general level of activity similar to that before the pandemic remains out of sight," Quebec's Urban Development Institute (UDI) and Montréal Centre-Ville say in their most recent quarterly report on the state of the downtown, published Wednesday.
"There are some clear patches in the sky but lots of clouds."
Nineteen months after the pandemic forced Quebec into a widespread lockdown, Montreal's once-vibrant downtown core is alive but sputtering.
The white-collar professionals who fuel its microeconomy - the sharp dressers who spend millions of dollars a year in its shops, restaurants and salons - are only trickling back to the office, raising fears of a permanent exodus that would reshape the downtown in ways that are only now being understood.
The latest data - pulled from a variety of sources, including traffic counters - offer little in the way of reassurance. They show that commercial vacancy rates are climbing and that the operations of a significant percentage of retailers, restaurants and other service providers are still on temporary or permanent pause.
On the bright side, new and existing condo sales suggest the downtown remains appealing for thousands of people.
It's a familiar problem across Canada. In Toronto's financial district, uncertainty about the repopulation of Bay Street's office towers is causing deep worry among merchants in the 30-kilometre-long network of retail tunnels beneath the city centre.
In Calgary, downtown office towers are about 30-per-cent vacant, wreaking havoc on municipal finances.
Montreal has its own peculiarities, however. The downtown's permanent residents, who number barely 40,000, aren't enough to keep all its businesses running. Few other cities are as dependent on commuters for their lifeblood. What those people do can make or break the city centre's business base.
A survey of 1,000 downtown employees conducted last month for the UDI report found that while the percentage of people working entirely from home is falling, 77 per cent of respondents said they were still working remotely either full-time or part-time. When people were asked if they wanted to continue working from home after the pandemic, 71 per cent said yes - for at least half their workweek or more.
The Quebec government continues to recommend remote work for companies that are able to do it.
Many of Montreal's biggest employers are still operating with most of their staff working remotely. Attendance at Fiera Capital Corp.'s downtown headquarters fluctuates between 6 per cent and 10 per cent, and while the financial company is planning a gradual return to the office, it is "encouraging employees to work where they can produce their best work," spokeswoman Alex-Anne Carrier said. At Hydro-Québec, which once had about 7,400 employees downtown in various locations, "very few employees are in the office," and the utility will eventually experiment for 12 months with a hybrid model that has the option of coming into the office two to three days a week, spokeswoman Caroline Des Rosiers said.
Some companies are deciding to decamp. Montreal's city centre had a 14.2-per-cent vacancy rate for all classes of office space in the third quarter, up from 10.3 per cent before the pandemic, according to the new report. Demand has decreased even for socalled Class A office space, the high-end real estate that makes up the bulk of downtown leasing.
"The situation is not as good as what we had hoped for at the beginning of the year," UDI head Jean-Marc Fournier said. Still, he noted some positive statistics: 53 per cent of downtown leases signed this spring and summer were renewals. And of the companies that ended their leases, half signed new ones elsewhere downtown - though shorter leases are the trend.
At the end of last month, roughly a third of business locations zoned for retail and located in shopping centres or concourses downtown were closed, either permanently or temporarily, the new report shows. On SainteCatherine Street, the area's main shopping artery, 17 per cent of shops are vacant and 3 per cent are shut for the time being, the numbers show.
The absence of workers downtown is having other ripple effects on Montreal, notably on public transit. Before the pandemic, it was the choice of 58 per cent of people coming into the downtown, according to the report. Since then, car usage has jumped - clogging up roads once again while the city's subway, bus and commuter train networks remain underused.
Montreal's transit agency warned recently that it could be forced to make major cuts to service next year if it can't find additional sources of financing to balance its budget.
City and local groups made a valiant effort during the summer of 2020 to inject some life into Montreal's core with a campaign called "Relancez l'été," or "Jumpstart summer." The Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal joined the effort and last month announced the selection of several signature creative projects to encourage the return of workers to the downtown core and boost the area's attractiveness, part of a campaign called "I love working downtown."

Full text: Alberta's two largest cities will be led by first-generation Canadians who campaigned on rebuilding and reinventing local economies battered by the COVID-19 pandemic and the oil-sector downturn that preceded it.
Calgary's Jyoti Gondek, a city councillor, and Edmonton's Amarjeet Sohi, a former Liberal federal cabinet minister, will be sworn in at the end of next month after winning their respective mayoral elections this week. Ms. Gondek is the first woman ever elected mayor of Calgary, while Mr. Sohi will be the first person of colour to be mayor in Edmonton.
They won decisive victories against their nearest competitors, who were in both cases conservatives who campaigned on cutting taxes, constraining public spending and rejecting the progressive policies set by the cities' outgoing mayors, Naheed Nenshi of Calgary and Don Iveson of Edmonton.
In contrast, Ms. Gondek and Mr. Sohi appear more closely aligned with their predecessors.
They inherit cities that have been struggling to find ways out of a provincewide economic decline that was set off by a recession more than half a decade ago and made worse by COVID-19.
The fourth wave of the pandemic has led to a resurgence in public-health restrictions as Alberta, again, deals with some of the country's highest infection, hospital admission and death rates.
Premier Jason Kenney's handling of COVID-19 has left the provincial government's relationships with Mr. Nenshi and Mr. Iveson in tatters.
In Calgary, where the effects of the downturn in the oil sector have been most acute, Ms. Gondek will also need to confront record-high downtown office vacancy rates, which have hollowed out the city's core and disrupted municipal finances.
Ms. Gondek, who singled out the downtown vacancy issue in her victory speech, said it is one of the city's most significant challenges. But she cast it as an opportunity for transformation as the city comes to grips with the reality that the oil industry is no longer enough to sustain it.
"It's not going to be like it was in the past. It's not going to be massive head offices for oil and gas," she said in an interview Tuesday. "So what do we need to do to repurpose those spaces to keep people interested in our city?" Ms. Gondek said the city must find new uses for vacant office space while turning downtown Calgary into a vibrant place to live and work. She is an enthusiastic supporter of Calgary's Greater Downtown Plan, which aims to transform the city centre into a mixed-use neighbourhood.
In some cases, that will involve converting office towers to rental housing, which has become a favourite solution in the city and has already been tried a handful of times. But Ms. Gondek said that alone won't be enough to significantly address the vacancy problem. She wants to work with tech firms, post-secondary institutions, non-profits and real estate experts to come up with entirely new ways of using office buildings.
In some cases, she said, some of those underused buildings might need to come down.
"These are all ideas that we need to be open to, because if we are actually going to get the mix of uses right, if we're going to be able to create a vibrant downtown and some of our existing buildings don't work, we've got to look at what we're doing with them," she said.
The vacancy rates have created a financial crisis. Property values downtown fell by $16-billion, or about 63 per cent, in just a few years, setting off a chain reaction that increased property taxes elsewhere in the city and forced the local government to come up with millions of dollars a year in relief.
On COVID-19, Ms. Gondek defended city council's decision to implement its own mask mandate and vaccine passport rules that are stricter than those set by the provincial government. She said Alberta's mismanagement of the pandemic has hurt the province's brand.
Ms. Gondek was born in the U.K. and moved to Canada with her parents, who were originally from India. She was the director of the Westman Centre for Real Estate Studies at the University of Calgary's business school before she was elected to Calgary's city council in 2017.
In Edmonton, Mr. Sohi believes he can help repair the relationship between the city and the provincial government, despite his political differences with the ruling United Conservative Party.
He bills himself as a collaborator who, in his previous political positions, worked with a string of Alberta premiers, including Mr. Kenney.
Mr. Sohi was first elected to Edmonton's city council in 2007. He served eight years before leaving municipal politics to run as a Liberal candidate in the 2015 federal election. He won that race and served as a cabinet minister under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
"All through my public life, I have always been very cognizant and aware of the fact that when we engage with our partners, we continue to engage with respect and openness, and never get involved in personality and a personal attack," he said in an interview Tuesday.
As an example of his ability to work with Alberta's government, Mr. Sohi pointed to his efforts in federal cabinet to get the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion built. He was federal minister of infrastructure when Ottawa bought the pipeline to save the project.
"The Premier knows about my work on the Trans Mountain pipeline," he said. "The Premier knows about my work on the orphan oil wells proposal - that I worked hard to make sure the federal government is investing in Alberta. My work on Enbridge Line 3."
Mr. Sohi's mayoral priorities are sweeping. They include expanding Edmonton's economy, stamping out discrimination and racism and addressing climate change. He believes all the items on his to-do list are interconnected.
"These issues need a systemic, holistic approach to leadership," he said. "I believe in a collaborative approach to tackling issues."
Mr. Sohi was born in India, in a Punjabi village. His family is Sikh, and he immigrated to Canada as a teenager. In 1988, before he became a Canadian citizen, he returned to India as a social activist.
He was arrested there and accused of being a terrorist. Mr Sohi has said he was tortured and spent most of his jail time in solitary confinement. He was held without trial for 21 months. Canadian authorities worked to clear his name and, in 1990, a prosecutor in India asked that the courts drop the case, citing a lack of evidence. A judge agreed.
After visiting his family home in Punjab, Mr. Sohi returned to Edmonton. There, he worked as a taxi driver, a bus driver, a union activist and eventually a local politician. His personal history, he said, informs his approach to governing.

Full text: Kelly Doody is still coping with the financial shock that hit her small business in Calgary's Inglewood neighbourhood two years ago, when she learned her property tax bill was about to increase by more than five times in a single year.
Ms. Doody, whose company, Social School, teaches digital marketing to entrepreneurs, was among tens of thousands of businesses in the city that faced significant increases as they became collateral damage from Calgary's downtown vacancy crisis.
As those vacancies caused downtown property values to plummet, the city was forced to make up for that lost revenue somewhere else, and Ms. Doody says businesses like hers are still paying the price. Increasing property values in Inglewood made things even worse for her.
"The uncertainty for businesses is so immense right now," Ms. Doody says. "This underlying monster will keep coming up unless someone does something about it that's meaningful."
With Calgarians voting in an election on Monday, the impact of office vacancies on the municipal budget will be among the most difficult challenges for the next mayor and council. Mayor Naheed Nenshi and the majority of councillors aren't running again.
Calgary's downtown office towers are currently about 30 per cent vacant, the effects of which have rippled across the city and wreaked havoc on municipal finances.
Initially, the significant drop in downtown assessments meant commercial landlords elsewhere in the city, particularly in comparatively bustling neigbourhoods outside the core, such as Inglewood, were told to pay more to fill the gap.
But that set off a crisis of its own, with small businesses warning steep tax increases were threatening their livelihood after years of economic decline in the city.
The high rate of office vacancies is still a significant problem for Calgary and its long-term financial health, as the city looks to reverse the damage by reinventing its downtown while also making its budget less reliant on the lucrative tax bills once paid by the owners of office towers.
The municipal property tax system operates in such a way that when assessed values drop only in a specific area, such as the downtown core, tax bills for those properties decrease and the shortfall is redistributed to properties elsewhere. In 2019, that meant $250-million was set to be shifted to commercial landlords outside downtown, with more than half of non-residential owners facing tax increases of more than 10 per cent.
The local government responded by capping commercial property tax increases at 10 per cent and digging into its rainyday fund to offer millions of dollars in relief. The city also reduced its budget by $60-million in 2019, which resulted in more than 100 layoffs and cuts to services such as public transit. It then decreased the proportion of tax revenue paid by businesses, effectively increasing property taxes for homeowners.
City council capped commercial property tax increases at 10 per cent in 2020 and most recently in 2021, when it approved another $13-million in relief.
Eddie Lee, the City of Calgary's acting assessor and director of assessments, said assessed values downtown, while still declining, appear to be levelling off now, although he added that the COVID-19 pandemic has added a new layer of uncertainty.
"I think it definitely is stabilizing," he said.
"I don't know if it's the rock bottom. The biggest unknown factor is the pandemic and what the future of working in an office will look like."
Assessed values are calculated by looking at a range of factors, including vacancy, lease income and recent sales of office towers.
Mr. Lee brings up Stephen Avenue Place, a 40-storey tower formerly known as the Scotia Centre, as an example. It sold in 2012 for $280-million and again in 2018 for just less than $100-million. The building is half empty, according to data from Avison Young.
Avison Young, a real estate firm that tracks office leases in great detail, has said another factor is several new buildings, which were planned during the strong economy of the early 2010s, were finished and opened at the height of the oil downturn, adding more space without anyone to lease it.
While the city has blunted the worst of that assessment problem for now, spending millions of dollars every year to shield businesses outside of downtown from tax increases isn't sustainable. The long-term fix is reducing those vacancy statistics, bringing workers - and lucrative property values - back into downtown.
City council set aside $200million as it approved a longterm plan for the downtown core. The Greater Downtown Plan focuses on economic diversification while aiming to transform downtown into a mixeduse neighbourhood where people live, work and play.
The plan calls for more housing in the downtown core and in the neighbourhoods directly to the east and south, with a focus on units suitable for families, as well as below-market affordable housing for low-income residents. The document outlines ways to make it easier for people to get around, such as through improved public transit, better amenities to make downtown a more-attractive place to live, and bringing postsecondary institutions into the city centre.
The East Village neighbourhood east of City Hall, which added thousands of units of housing and new commercial space, has been held up as a model of what is possible. The city has a similar plan for an area called the Rivers District, southeast of downtown, where enough housing units for 8,000 people are planned around a new arena that was just approved and a new conference centre that is already under construction.
The Greater Downtown Plan also focuses on converting office towers into housing, a costly and complex task but one that has already been tried in several buildings that are either finished or in the process of being converted. The federal government has set aside $300-million to convert Canada's unused office space into rental housing.
While the owners of a converted building would pay far less property tax, Mr. Lee said anything that closes the vacancy gap will increase taxes collected from office towers over the long term.
Of the two apparent frontrunners in Calgary's mayoral campaign, Jyoti Gondek, a centrist city councillor, has the most detailed proposals for downtown. Ms. Gondek, who voted for the Greater Downtown Plan, has released a platform that largely pledges to implement it.
"We are shifting toward a model of having a true mixeduse downtown instead of one that was built solely for offices," Ms. Gondek said in an interview.
"We are now rebuilding our downtown to be a place where you can get through your daily routine instead of just a place where you pull up, sit at your desk and leave."
Ms. Gondek also wants the provincial government to use a portion of its share of property tax revenue to help the city cover lost revenues arising from lower downtown property assessments.
She said the city has become "desensitized" to economic downturns because the oil industry has always bounced back before. Ms. Gondek said it's clear this time that Calgary needs to re-nvent itself rather than waiting for the oil sector to save the city.
Jeromy Farkas, a conservative mayoral candidate who has focused as much on opposing Mr. Nenshi as he has on competing against Ms. Gondek, wants to repeal the downtown plan. He said it needs to be overhauled to incorporate more feedback from the public, and he wants a greater focus on public safety, education and recreation.
He said previous mayors and city councils should have focused more on mixed-use development downtown to add housing, which he said would have positioned the city to better weather the current downturn.
While Mr. Farkas has not released a specific policy plank focusing on downtown - none of the points in his "10 point plan" for the city is about the core - he said policies such as freezing property taxes bring in more businesses to fill empty office towers.
"It's an existential problem for the city," he said in an interview.
"This campaign is about the future of Calgary, it's about economic opportunity and the downtown vacancy issue is emblematic of that. The lack of opportunities that Calgarians are experiencing is playing out in a different way, but it's most visible through those empty office towers."
Whoever wins the municipal election faces a complex problem that will take years to solve.
And there won't be any single thing that fixes it.
Susan Thompson of Avison Young said the city's vacancy rate has now surpassed the worst of the recession in the early 1980s.
She said the city needs to be pursuing a range of policies, including fostering industries such as green energy and tech, and converting unused space.
"We've got 14 million square feet sitting empty - that's a lot of tenants, that's a lot of people, that's a lot of repurposing buildings," she said.
"That's a lot of things to even make a dent in that. We certainly want to see every possibility considered to help the situation that Calgary is in."
Avison Young projects the rate of Calgary's downtown office vacancies will remain in the high 20s for at least the next couple of years, although recently the rate has tracked the company's optimistic projections as higher oil prices begin to breathe life into the economy.
Ms. Thompson said it's not yet clear how the pandemic will affect those projections as companies assess how much office space they need if more of their staff are working from home.
Whatever happens, she said Calgary's economic fortunes - and the future of its downtown - will be tied to the energy industry for the foreseeable future, even if that looks different with more focus on renewables, for example. She said that even now, energy companies still occupy the largest share of leased office space compared with other sectors.
"The pie is obviously changing," she said. "We're going to be seeing more renewables and green energy options coming in as part of a mix, but energy is going to continue to be part of Calgary."
This is part of a series on the future of Calgary's downtown, hit by years of economic decline that has left its office towers nearly a third vacant, and the solutions that could drive a recovery.

LOOKING FOR LIFE IN AN OFFICE-TOWER GHOST TOWN

Full text: A decade ago, Calgary's future seemed to be rising at the corner of 6th Avenue and Centre Street.
In 2012, the Bow, a $1-billion skyscraper designed by London architects Foster & Partners, opened its doors. At more than 230 metres, it was the tallest thing in the city; its curving walls of reflective glass and diagonally gridded steel held the headquarters of energy giants Encana and Cenovus.
This is where barber David Ghandour set up shop in 2013, on the second floor of the 57-storey building. "It looked like it was going to be a gold mine," says Mr. Ghandour, 62, as he locks up his Denim & Smith Barbershop for the day. "I've got a small shop, but it was full, and I was thinking about adding another station. Business was definitely good."
But then the layoffs started.
Beginning in 2014, a slump in oil prices brought the province's energy sector into a stall. Cenovus went through a series of layoffs and mergers, and eventually moved its offices next door, to Brookfield Place. Encana changed its name and shifted its headquarters to Denver. The rest of Alberta's oil and gas sector took a beating, too. All told, the sector lost roughly 35,000 jobs in just a few years.
Today, some 30 per cent of the Bow - and about 30 per cent of the entire downtown core's office space - is vacant. Mr. Ghandour's former customers are either working from their basements or not working at all. At 5 p.m. on a recent weekday afternoon, the plaza in front of the building was nearly empty. Wonderland, a sculpture by the Spanish artist Jaume Plensa, looked out across five lanes of traffic to a stalled construction site.
The rest of downtown is equally quiet, especially after 5 p.m. And that's not just because of the energy sector's woes or the pandemic.
Calgary has never been known as an after-hours urban centre, lacking the housing, retail activity and cultural events that keep an urban neighbourhood alive 24 hours a day. According to city data, downtown has just 11,000 residents. (Vancouver's downtown peninsula has more than 100,000.) The lack of both economic activity and street life presents a massive problem for the city, one it's working to solve. So what can Calgary do to bring its downtown back to life?
City planners and business leaders agree the old model of a nine-to-five urban core no longer works. The future lies in creating a downtown where people live and play, as well as work; a place where streets are designed for people to linger, and not - like 6th Avenue in front of the Bow, a five-lane one-way highway - a place you drive through on your way to somewhere else.
The city's Greater Downtown Plan, approved by city council in April with an initial $200-million in funding, is the starting point. "The idea is to reinvent our downtown as modern, desirable urban neighbourhoods," says Thom Mahler, who leads Downtown Strategy at the city of Calgary.
"That's the kind of place that talent is seeking and that our community is seeking."
These questions also apply to other cities that built their central business districts in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly Canada's Prairie cities. Accordingly, Calgary is pursuing some ideas that have become widespread in contemporary city planning. These include blending housing and services with offices; improving streetscapes and public spaces; and putting an emphasis on cultural events and venues.
Such efforts have brought new life to officeheavy downtowns in cities such as Pittsburgh, Chicago and New York. Lower Manhattan, arguably the place where the word "downtown" originated, has transformed since the 9/11 terror attacks into a live-work neighbourhood with triple the number of residents.
And yet, Calgary's problems are bigger - millions of square feet bigger - than those in other cities. Calgary has a disproportionate amount of office space for a city of 1.3 million; the downtown contains about 44 million square feet of it, double the amount per capita of Toronto's city centre.
Those offices are now seeing unprecedented vacancy rates. In physical terms, this means large buildings that are half-empty or even completely dark. Should roughly 12 million square feet of vacant buildings be repurposed? Mothballed? Or even, in some cases, torn down?
Downtown Calgary is a squared-off 60 blocks of density in the middle of a sprawling Prairie city. To the south, it's walled in by a Canadian Pacific Railway line; the Bow River arcs across its northern edge, lined by riverfront parks. Its streets march in a strict grid laid out by railway surveyors.
Originally this area mixed up homes and workplaces, often built from local sandstone. But the boom in Canadian oil that began in the 1960s remade the place entirely.
Most of the houses, shops and stonefronted institutional buildings were razed and replaced with office towers. This new crop of buildings evolved, over a 20-year boom, from the delicate modernism of the 1960s to the taller, chunkier and more opaque corporate aesthetic of the 1980s.
Today, it's a place of brown concrete and mirrored glass, of shopping-mall atriums linked by an above-ground pedestrian network known as Plus 15.
As long as oil was booming, none of this stopped the city from prospering. But then, in 2014, oil prices began an extended plunge.
Downtown Calgary landlords and small business owners such as Mr. Ghandour felt the impact immediately "We knew we had to diversify," says Deborah Yedlin, president and CEO of the Calgary Chamber of Commerce. "Some people, even in the energy sector, were saying this period of low prices would be good for Alberta, because it would force the province to recognize that it couldn't just rely on oil and gas for its revenues."
This idea was taking root in the city's business community, Ms. Yedlin says; she cites the creation of the Creative Destruction Lab at the University of Calgary's Haskayne School of Business, an incubator that focuses on industries with strong growth potential, including agricultural technology and green energy. These fields could rely on Calgary's young and highly educated work force, including many engineers who formerly worked in oil and gas.
"We have a lot of scientific and technical expertise that can be directed to decarbonization or [agricultural] tech," she says. "We were just starting to get somewhere."
Then COVID-19 hit, compounding the economic effects of the oil slump. Downtown property assessments have dropped by $16-billion, or about 60 per cent, since 2015. In 2021 alone, non-residential assessments downtown dropped by $801-million, or roughly 8 per cent, compared with 2020.
To some observers, there's no realistic hope of repopulating those empty buildings. Across North America, major employers are extending their work-from-home policies into 2022 as the Delta variant poses a renewed risk of COVID-19. An August poll from research firm Gartner Inc. found that two-thirds of corporate leaders were delaying their return-to-office plans. Ms. Yedlin suggests the less desirable office buildings in the core may never fill up again. Calgarians, she says, "have to ask some difficult questions and face some difficult answers."
One proposal is to repurpose some of those buildings as housing. A study by the city found 28 buildings that could be adaptively reused. Most were built in the boom years of the 1970s and 1980s, and have small floor plates - in other words, they're skinny, like apartment buildings, rather than bulky, like contemporary office buildings. The Greater Downtown Plan includes $45-million in incentives for conversions into apartments, student or seniors housing, or other uses such as university and college campuses.
For city planners, "first of all, it's a real estate challenge that we have all this vacant space," Mr. Mahler says. He compares Calgary's downtown to that of Detroit, which has seen a renaissance of new office jobs and housing in the past decade; one prominent employer, Quicken Loans, has added more than 10,000 jobs. "But," Mr. Mahler adds, "we're hoping to avoid decades of decline before the turnaround happens."
To that end, the central theme of the city's efforts is getting more people to come downtown for a variety of reasons - and to stay there. This is already beginning, with an immediate strategy to spur public markets in a new dedicated space, and support performances and street festivals. The use of events (or "programming," in planning jargon) is a staple of efforts to activate and revitalize downtowns across North America. Calgary's plan budgets $5-million over several years toward events.
This is the right idea, according to the prominent city planner Brent Toderian, because people attract other people. "If you want to increase the amount of activity in a place," he argues, "getting people to stay twice as long is easier than getting twice the number of people to come."
All this is at stake in next Monday's civic election. Mayor Naheed Nenshi - who is not seeking re-election - has championed the city's downtown plan. What happens next could depend on his successor.
Two apparent front-runners take very different approaches to the crisis in the downtown core.
Jeromy Farkas, a conservative councillor who has spent much of his mayoral campaign attacking Mr. Nenshi's record, voted against the plan earlier this year and, if elected, will push for it to be repealed. He says the plan needs to be amended to reflect what the public wants but hasn't said much about what he would do to heal downtown, other than opening a new police station and keeping property taxes low.
Jyoti Gondek, a centrist candidate who aligns closer to Mr. Nenshi, has released a platform with several planks related to downtown. She advocates converting office towers into housing and following the model of the East Village neighbourhood, which has added thousands of homes and a new library just east of the core. Ms. Gondek also wants the provincial government to stop taking its share of Calgary's property taxes, to offset the sharp decrease in downtown property values.
Nearly three-quarters of Calgary's current council have opted not to run for reelection. But all three of the councillors who voted against the downtown plan are seeking another term, including Mr. Farkas.
"A lot of this vision is up in the air at the moment," says Mr. Toderian, an international planning consultant and former chief planner of Vancouver who oversaw Calgary's downtown planning in the early 2000s. "This is a moment with a lot of potential. It would be a shame if the election changed that." Mr. Toderian generally applauds the city's current approach, in particular an emphasis on improving public space. "How do we make streets into places that you want to spend time?" he asks. He uses the phrase "sticky streets" to describe this phenomenon. "How can they be places for people instead of places for cars?" This is another familiar idea in urban planning of the past generation. But making it a reality is difficult here, as Mr. Mahler and other locals acknowledge. Downtown Calgary includes many wide streets, which are great for fast-moving car traffic, and not so great for relaxing with an espresso.
In the west end of downtown, the landlord Quadreal is trying to fill Western Canadian Place, two early-1980s office towers clad in pink granite and gold-tinted mirror glass.
One tower is 97 per cent vacant. Its LateModernist architecture is almost dated enough to be attractive; the streetscape on 9th Avenue, however, is something else.
Quadreal is marketing the complex with a photo that depicts a blur of speeding cars.
That's typical of Calgary, whose streetscape is "the opposite of sticky," says Mr. Toderian. "It's Teflon. And the reverse has to become true."
To that end, the city has set aside an additional $55-million for capital projects to improve streets and public spaces. Mr. Mahler says the city is looking at specific street redesigns, targeted to align with private-sector projects. Where there's a new restaurant patio, for instance, the block might be rebuilt to widen the sidewalk and lose a lane of traffic.
But the city is also completing quick projects to enliven the public realm, including murals by the artists Astro, on 8th Avenue SW, and Birdo, on 5th Avenue SW, and a series of landscape and public art projects this fall on Stephen Avenue, the downtown's pedestrianized shopping street.
These kinds of fast changes, sometimes dubbed tactical urbanism, are now common tools in downtown-revitalization efforts across North America. By taking public space that had been devoted to cars and creating "active uses" such as patios and parkettes, they can make streets more pedestrian-friendly and establish a sense of place. "Design doesn't have to be massive capital investments," Mr. Mahler says. "It can be small interventions that allow people to use the space differently."
The idea is to give a boost to existing businesses and to attract workers who value walkable urban spaces. "The quality of place links to attracting talent," Mr. Mahler adds. The attraction of downtown, in short, is that it feels like a city.
Calgary's city hall is also emphasizing cultural development. Arts Commons, a major downtown performing-arts centre, received an $80-million grant through the Greater Downtown Plan for a renovation and expansion.
These efforts are also building toward a big, long-term change: a downtown that has more residents.
Changing the city centre into a mixeduse neighbourhood, one with a substantial number of both workers and residents, would have numerous benefits. It would put people on the streets at all hours of the day and night; bolster local shops, bars and restaurants; and create a sense of safety and activity.
Some amenities are lacking, however.
While the city has built high-quality parks along the Bow River, Calgary's one recreation centre, the Gray Family YMCA in Eau Claire, closed its doors in February. Ms. Yedlin argues it was a critical amenity for the young families who settled in and near downtown in the 1980s, and the massive new Repsol Sport Centre - a kilometre outside of the core - doesn't fill the gap. "There is no question that there's a lack," she says.
"If you're going to be living here with a family, you want somewhere to take your kids for swimming lessons."
Most city planners agree that getting people to live downtown, roughly balancing residents and workers, is desirable in both qualitative and economic terms.
"Monocultures of any kind - whether we're talking farms or economies - are fragile and not resilient to a sudden stress or shock," says Mary Rowe, chief executive officer of the Canadian Urban Institute. "So the single-use central business district was profoundly challenged when offices closed. You need a much more diverse mix of uses and users that ensures adaptiveness and innovation."
Those ideas have driven the recent prosperity of downtowns in Canada's other major urban centres. Toronto has long had a policy of encouraging people to live downtown; in the 1990s, the "Two Kings" initiative allowed sleepy industrial districts to fill in with tens of thousands of residents.
In Vancouver, the "Living First" vision of planner Larry Beasley had a similar effect.
In Calgary, such changes could bring valuable second-order effects. Mr. Toderian suggests that increasing the housing stock would also reinforce the office market - which is precisely what happened in Toronto and Vancouver. "There is a large group of young workers who prefer not to commute by car and would prefer to choose a workplace and home in a mixeduse neighbourhood," he says.
One part of Calgary's effort on this score is supporting the conversion of offices to residential or other uses. But some in the local real estate sector argue that less desirable buildings - the faceless Late-Modernist office buildings of the 1970s and 1980s - should be demolished entirely. "We need to make these buildings disappear," Ms. Yedlin says. "We have a lot of Class B and Class C space, and you'll never tell me that you can justify converting that space into residential. There needs to be a conversation about how we tear down these buildings that no one will ever, ever want to reoccupy."
This view is not universally shared. Mr. Mahler says the city is looking at demolition "as a last resort," hoping instead to encourage activity that will fill these buildings. "Clearly that strategy is not very green," he says.
Mr. Toderian is similarly concerned about demolition. "Tearing things down troubles me," he says, "because, among other reasons, it can't be reversed." Office markets turn quickly, he notes, and it takes a long time to construct new space.
But there is an elephant in the empty room: whether, as the pandemic recedes, workers will come back to the office at all.
Employers, experts and investors across North America are divided on this question, and major development companies continue to pursue office projects in prime areas of Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal.
A recent paper from the Canadian Urban Institute, "The Case for the Core," argues that while the future is uncertain, downtowns will not die. Instead, this is an opportunity to rethink them as more equitable, vibrant, flexible and livable places. It's an agenda that largely mirrors what the city of Calgary is now trying to do.
Ms. Rowe, its CEO, suggests that change is both necessary and welcome in places such as downtown Calgary. "Cities outlive corporations, they outlive governments of every stripe. They're enduring creatures," she says. "But they morph and change in terms of their function." She suggests "the user experience" of cities, their public realm and public-facing architecture, will need to change - and governments should support design innovation in the process.
In this respect, Calgary could be a leader.
"The city has historically taken tons of risk, and it needs to continue to do that," Ms. Rowe says.
"The city has taken a lot of knocks, and there's a risk that it ends up being more conservative" in its approach to economic development and planning.
"They need to get back to being a city of ‘yes.' " With reports from James Keller

Full text: THE LISTING When two workers left in two months, Tonya Bruin had to juggle to keep her renovation construction company on top of its commitments. When a third member came to her with a job offer in hand, she knew she had a problem.
"I didn't want to lose this guy.
He's fantastic. He started quite junior, but he's reliable and clients love him," said Ms. Bruin, chief executive officer of To Do Done Renovations, which specializes in bathrooms, kitchens and basements in the Ottawa area. But that young worker levelled with her: He hadn't been looking for a new job, but on more than one occasion recruiters working for large home-builders had come to a To Do Done job site offering raises, benefits and retirement contributions. It turns out, with the first two workers, it was the same story: They were poached, too.
Ms. Bruin's case is just one indication of the construction labour shortages that industry leaders warn could be getting worse. As resale home prices have climbed to new heights this year, almost every major housing market is seeing an uptick in construction.
That's causing shortages of key tradespeople. And it's all happening at the same time as a wave of retirements of the most skilled workers is beginning to crest.
"Construction has more mobility between companies than pretty much any other sector," said Andrew Pariser, vice-president of the Residential Construction Council of Ontario. "I don't know if people are yelling at people through a fence - we're hopefully more professional than that - but we're experiencing a tighter labour market than ever before."
With 500,000 construction workers and 144 sub-trades in Ontario, not every sector is equally stretched in the hot labour market. High-rise construction is facing its toughest crunch in elevator installers and crane operators, with tense competition between companies to hire workers away.
Major infrastructure and transit projects were already putting pressure on high-rise builders' need for concrete form-work labourers, and specialists in drains and basements are also in demand among low-rise builders.
Tightness has also shown up in the "finishing" trades in carpentry, who can do a variety of jobs such as installing trim, stairs and flooring. Not coincidentally, those are the skills you'd find in renovation crews such as Ms. Bruin's.
For Ms. Bruin, the challenge is how a private employer with a small team of about a dozen can keep key workers. "Labour rates have gone up significantly across the board ... faster than I've ever seen it before," she says. "I realize now, a contract that says you will do an annual review of your salary is too long to wait." She's recently added dental and medical benefits coverage, and is looking into ways she can help her workers with retirement plans (something the construction unions offer, but most private employers cannot).
The other pressure is that, without the ability to find new workers, she can't expand her business, which is already booked five months in advance. And as labour rates rise, she has to eat any shortfalls that come from jobs she quoted half a year ago. "If all the sudden my labour costs go up 30 per cent, I'm not changing their quotes, it's not fair to my clients."
The industry at large is facing a demographic crunch: It is mainly an older work force and the baby boom members have begun retiring in large numbers over the past 15 years.
"We need about 100,000 new workers over the next ten years," to keep the current work force stable Mr. Pariser said. "If we stay this busy, we'll need more or we'll need them sooner. We have two ways: train more people who are in Canada right now, and immigration. In the last 10 [to] 20 years, I think our immigration targets weren't meeting our needs." Mr. Pariser argues Ontario should have the ability to set its own immigration qualifications (similar to Quebec) to address labour needs, although he points out some trades are better able to recruit internationally than others, pointing to success among electricians and plumbers unions to bring in overseas talent.
There are programs to train existing residents in the key trades, he says, although many are too small to address the looming shortfall.
Mike Yorke, president and director of public affairs and innovation at the Carpenters District Council of Ontario representing 20,000 tradespersons, said the unions have been poaching nonunion workers from the Pro line at Home Depot or off job sites for years.
It works: The drywall trade, for instance, is 95 per cent unionized.
Cases such as Ms. Bruin's, where a recruiter identified himself as working directly for a large homebuilder might be new. "If that's the employer or developer doing it, that's an innovation," he said.
The challenge of training new workers is huge: In the Toronto region, the Carpenters' Local Union 27 operates one of the largest apprenticeship programs in the province, but even that isn't going to make a large dent in worker shortages.
"For Toronto area, our college of carpenters brings in 100 [to] 110 through the school boards," he said. "That's a five-year project to bring a young person in; we graduate 100 apprentices each year, and 20 per cent are women," he said, an impressive figure when the overall construction industry averages between 3 per cent and 7 per cent female workers.
"If we want to bring in young women into the building trades, the best way is through the school boards."
The low number of women in the industry is just one of the cultural barriers to recruiting young people, though.
"When we speak to parents, often the parents see construction as dated or dangerous. Issues of sexism and racism, historically, that's part of the culture. ... Our job is to improve the working conditions and take on and challenge those outdated ideologies," Mr. Yorke said.
However, these issues are not in the distant past. In 2020, a series of nooses began showing up on downtown Toronto construction job sites, leaving visible minority workers feeling threatened and unprotected. Earlier this year, a drywall contractor hired a sex worker to perform nude dances on a job site. Videos of the incident ricocheted around social media, drawing condemnation from builders and union leaders alike.
"That puts us back years. ... We're outreaching to young women and men in high schools and that happens?" Mr. Yorke said.
"Everyone has a negative view of construction," Mr. Pariser said, but he cited to public opinion surveys that suggest construction workers are twice as happy with their work as the average Canadian. "It's not all doom and gloom in our sector."
In Ottawa, Ms. Bruin was able to use a hefty raise to beat back the poachers. And that third young worker decided to stay. For now.

Urban growth versus natural growth: ARCHITOURIST

Full text: It feels like being handed a list of death-row inmates: closest to myself and my ravine guide, retired architect Birgit Siber, red oak No. 870, with a diameter of 110 cm; a little further down, another red oak, No. 712, sports a yellow ribbon around its 90-cm trunk; in the distance, a basswood, No. 520, with a girth of 95 cm. There are others.
Each of these leafy sentries, which have provided dappled shade and habitat to creatures in the Woodbine Avenue and Gerrard Street East area for a century, have been identified on a printout titled "The Largest Trees In Small's Creek At Risk Of Removal Or Injury By Metrolinx."
While all won't necessarily be chainsawed, those on the ravine's southern wall will, it seems, be clear-cut in anticipation of the new Ontario subway line and future electrification.
"It's the last daylit creek system flowing into Ashbridges Bay," Ms. Siber says as she squints into the low October sun, just visible through the leaves.
As we walk, the creek burbles away to our right and, in the distance, it unceremoniously drops into a concrete cylinder. This, frankly, is not surprising, since many of the city's creeks hide in sewer tunnels, pushed there in the name of development a hundred or more years ago. Looking back at the printout, she says: "All of this dotted line, [Small's Creek is] all underground, so ... it's in our culverts, it's under our schoolyards, our churchyards, sometimes our parks."
The portion we walk, however - both on an elevated boardwalk and a muddy trail (which my dog, Bella, loves) - is glorious. Every few minutes, a GO Train rumbles by above our heads.
And while this sunny segment of creek won't be pushed underground by Metrolinx, the Save Small's Creek community group wants the provincial powerhouse to consider alternatives to how they'll widen the corridor for a fourth track and create the required retaining wall that goes with it.
The current plan, the group says in a community update, will turn the northern side of this little oasis "into something resembling a golf course." And despite "repeatedly" asking for third-party engineering firms to "evaluate less destructive alternatives ... Metrolinx has refused."
Well, not completely refused.
Since gaining support for the cause from local city councillor Brad Bradford and Beaches-East York Member of the Ontario Provincial Parliament Rima BernsMcGown, Metrolinx has sat down with Save Small's Creek on a few occasions, and they have agreed to reduce the number of trees to be felled (Metrolinx's blog states it will be 268 trees: "210 within Metrolinx property and 58 outside of Metrolinx property").
But the group says that's still too many, as it "changes the ecosystem, the ecology," says Ms. Siber, who lives kilometres away in the Beaches. "Not to mention, this embankment nourishes this [valley] as well ... imagine all of this is just shorn, that's what's going to happen in November."
On their blog, Metrolinx states, "the least intrusive option" to widening the rail corridor is a retaining wall "made of pre-cast concrete T-Sections, which are backfilled. A chain-link fence will then be located at the top of the wall for safety and security." Small's Creek advocates insist, however, there is more than one way to build a track bed.
In drawings they've prepared, something called the "buried bridge" or "guideway" option - basically a concrete surface with deep foundations - seems to do very little to disturb the ravine wall, as it requires no retaining wall of any kind.
"These kinds of things are possible to do," with Bauer drilling equipment, Ms. Siber says; in a letter sent to Toronto Mayor John Tory, geotechnical engineer Christopher Elvidge agrees, adding that there are even alternatives to the large caissons a guideway requires "and the relatively large equipment needed to install them," such as "large diameter" helical piers.
Mr. Elvidge provides yet another solution: If the existing soil were stiffened (he points to a company called GeoSolv), the ridiculously large retaining wall as proposed by Metrolinx could be shrunken considerably, which would, he writes, "limit the disturbance of the existing vegetation and trees."
Local resident Karolina Hordowick would be happy with either option.
"We moved here when our kiddo was five months old," she says, emotion evident in her voice. "I think about how this has been a little pocket of happiness for kids here; you'll see them muck about in the spring and in the fall, and it's just a chance for them, especially during COVID, to not go insane."
As her husband and now seven-year-old son pause to look at the water, she continues: "If you think about the 22 social determinants of health, one of them is outdoor space. ... It changes people's moods and mental-health state. ... Why can't Metrolinx just listen? I'm sure there's a happy medium."
And before one labels Ms. Hordowick or Ms. Siber a couple of not-in-my-backyarders, both say they're all for transit expansion.
Even the website, smallscreek.ca, carefully states: "We all believe in a strong transit system. We just believe there is a better way to build it that will protect our ravine for wildlife and for our community."
As Ms. Sibert and I finish our walk, we pause at the Merrill Bridge Road dog park so Bella can sniff a few furry friends. I ask her why, as a non-resident, she decided to get involved.
"From my perspective it's a precedent for other areas in the city that are equally vulnerable; I think we have an opportunity to change our mindset about these ravine lands and wetlands, and rethink the way we deal with them."

Wealth plays bigger factor than income in Vancouver home sales

Full text: Wealth, not annual income, is driving purchases of costly homes by some of the lowest-paid workers in British Columbia, a new study suggests.
The gap between home prices and local wages is stark in the province, where houses have been selling for well above $1million in the Vancouver region for years.
Now, new data show that a typical buyer in the lowest income quintile, with a median annual income of $29,800, spent a median of $499,000 on a home in 2018, according to the report from Canadian Housing Statistics Program.
In comparison, someone in the middle quintile with a median income of $97,600 spent a median of $490,000 on a home, according to the study, which analyzed property assessments, land-registry data and tax filings.
"The divergence between property prices and incomes in some areas demonstrated that sources other than income can play an important role in homeownership," the report said.
Annik Gougeon, a CHSP senior analyst, said the data suggest many home buyers are either taking out very large mortgages or using savings and wealth to make their home purchases.
The study attempts to provide a measure of housing affordability by analyzing the purchase price of a property against the buyer's income.
The higher the price-to-income ratio, the greater the financial burden the buyer takes on.
As the CHSP relies on co-operation from the provinces for the data, it analyzed just three provincial real estate markets: B.C., Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
The study is not a comprehensive look at the country, especially as it does not include the two largest markets: Ontario and Quebec.
The study found that B.C.'s median price-to-income ratio of 5.4 was more than double the ratios in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
The highest median price-to-income ratio was found in West Vancouver, followed by Richmond. There, buyers spent 17 times and 12 times their incomes, respectively.
What is surprising about the CHSP data is what buyers in the lowest income quintiles were able to afford in B.C. In the second-lowest quintile, a buyer with a median income of $65,500 spent a median $450,000 on a property. In contrast, in the top quintile, a buyer with a median income of $223,000 spent a median $673,000 on a home.
For the bottom quintile, Elan Weintraub, a mortgage broker based in the Toronto area, said a buyer with a median income couldn't afford a home unless they had a very large down payment. But he said people who earn $30,000 a year typically do not have significant savings.
"Even if they could borrow $300,000, how could they make their monthly payments plus food, utilities, given their income is $2,500 per month gross?" said Mr. Weintraub, director of the Mortgage Outlet Inc.
The CHSP study said its income measurement didn't capture wealth accumulated through previous home ownership, savings or financial support from people not on a property's title, such as a parent.
Laura Martin, chief operating officer of mortgage brokerage Matrix Mortgage Global, said often the largest barrier to entry for hopeful home buyers is having enough wealth accumulated to afford the down payment.

Full text: Bill Schmidt ambles outside the Baptist church that he bought as a house, smiling under a Make America Great Again ballcap. Roosters crow as he looks across the Idaho prairie that is his new home.
"I got tired of the communist government in California. And so we moved up here," he says.
In other places, it might be tough to get permission to take up residence in a church.
Not here. Idaho County has no building code nor zoning rules.
The owner of a structure can decide what to do with it.
So Mr. Schmidt, 73, left his home in Milpitas, Calif., and the politics of a state where government takes a more active role in personal lives.
Idaho County voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, and the area has long drawn conservatives.
"The politics make Idaho free," he said.
"And I wanted to be some place free."
Across North America, the pandemic has caused people to rethink where they live.
The flight from city centres to suburbs and rural communities has upended property markets across the continent as people have sought more personal space and cheaper housing.
Across the United States, the pandemic has seen movement from liberal areas to conservative regions, a migration that follows real estate prices - Republicanleaning states tend to have cheaper housing.
But it also comes at a time when Americans are, in ways not seen before, letting politics guide where they choose to reside. U.S.
census estimates show states that voted for Mr. Trump in the last presidential election saw their populations grow, on average, nearly 10 times faster between April 1 and July 1 of 2020 than those that voted for Joe Biden.
United Van Lines conducts an annual survey documenting inbound and outbound moves by state. In 2020, of the top 10 states with the highest percentage of people leaving, only three voted for Mr. Trump. High on the outbound list were Democratic strongholds such as New York and California.
Of the 10 states that saw the greatest percentage of inbound moves, eight voted for Trump. At the top of the list: Idaho, followed by South Carolina.
Idaho County has tripled the size of its mapping department as it works through a surge in applications from property owners splitting parcels of land to make way for new homes. Last year, the county issued 167 new addresses. So far this year, it has issued 202.
Skip Brandt, who chairs the Idaho County Commissioners, the area's elected officials, calls the new arrivals "refugees" seeking a conservative haven from liberal politics, in particular during the pandemic. "We're just getting inundated by people that are escaping that world," he said.
What's happening in Idaho County is happening across the country.
The pandemic arrived amid longer-term changes in how people move in the U.S. Researchers at the University of California Los Angeles and the University of Southern California are midway through a project that is examining the role of politics in domestic migration.
The preliminary finding: "People are moving more to places that are politically similar to where they're coming from," said Gregor Schubert, who studies housing and labour economics at UCLA.
That preference may not be enough to outweigh other factors, such as housing prices, in determining the exact neighbourhoods where people choose to live. But "I find it plausible that people are increasingly sorting into places that are politically homogeneous," Prof. Schubert said.
People tend to move primarily for jobs, family and the natural environment, such as proximity to mountains or better weather, scholars say. And the political orientation of states may also matter for other reasons.
"There's a high correlation between a red" - or Republican - "voting record of a particular state and housing affordability," said Stuart Gabriel, director of the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate. "In other words, red states tend to be more affordable."
But the data also point to people moving into communities politically similar to those they left - so a liberal person from California moving to a more liberal neighbourhood in Texas.
"You tend to move to places that are politically like-minded to you," said Gary Painter, a public policy scholar at the University of Southern California, who is part of the study on politics and mobility. "The fact that pattern exists at all is new. And it didn't exist decades ago in the same way."
As political liberals - including university graduates seeking first jobs - chase cheaper real estate in conservative areas, there is also evidence that they are weakening the conservative hold on some states.
"The average migrant coming out of the big cities in California is more likely to be a Democrat than whatever Texas city they're moving into," said Prof. Schubert. The result: "Some counties in Texas turning blue or purple."
Much remains unknown, including how new the trend is and what exactly is causing it.
The research is based on prepandemic data. But it portends a future of more uncertain state politics and more polarized local politics, with "even more homogeneity as it relates to who is on school boards and who is on city councils," said Prof. Painter.
Indeed, Idaho's Republican areas aren't the only ones experiencing growth. Blaine County, a Democratic stronghold that voted 67 per cent for Mr. Biden, has seen a near doubling in the number of applications this year for new homeowner exemptions to people coming from out of state.
The exemptions are tax discounts available for primary residences, and new issuances are an indication of people moving into the area.
In Idaho County, meanwhile, the least-vaccinated county in one of the least-vaccinated states in the U.S. has welcomed new arrivals who chafed under pandemic measures imposed elsewhere.
"Last summer, we had clients coming in like crazy. They were like, ‘Oh my God, this is an oasis from what we've been dealing with,' " said Bernadette Edwards, a former teacher who is now a real estate agent in the area. In Grangeville, the county seat, they could walk the streets and enter the coffee shops without masks.
"It was just this freedom oasis, and we had a lot of them move here because of it," she said.
"People are coming here for freedom and the fresh air," adds her husband, Cody Edwards, a fellow real estate agent.
Among the new arrivals is Josh Burnson, 40, who moved in May from Port Orchard, a Democratic enclave west of Seattle. In his former home in Washington state, "there just wasn't a critical mass of people who could see that what was happening was tyranny, when churches and businesses were shut down because the governor said so," he said.
In Idaho, he found a place with land he can farm, a house where he can homeschool his children and fellow residents who share his Christian faith and political views. He started looking to buy property in Idaho last April, after Washington issued its first COVID-19 stay-at-home order.
"And there are no building codes here, which says something about the way people view how far governments should get into the personal lives of people.
I liked that," he said.
Moving to Idaho, he said, is a chance to be "part of a community where there were people who were like-minded - who were concerned about the same things."

Full text: 245 Swick Rd.
KELOWNA, B.C.
Asking Price: $9,288,800 Taxes: $38,026.85 (2021) Lot Size: 5.54 acres (822 by 255 feet with 335 feet of waterfront) Agent: Richard Deacon, Engel & Volkers Okanagan THE BACKSTORY There's no other way to describe the property at 245 Swick Rd., located just outside the southern extent of built-up parts of Kelowna, B.C., on Lake Okanagan: It's a family compound.
There are three separated living spaces on the 5.54-acre lakefront lot: The main house is the largest, there's a secondary two-bedroom cottage and there's also a guest suite above the boathouse. The owner, 92-year-old Wilfred (Bill) Roach and his family have been coming to the Okanagan for 50 years and added to the property over time.
"When we first came here we rented various places on the lake. It was just a small town really," Mr. Roach said. "We found a nice little old house on the lake on the beach, bought it and remodelled it [in 1967]. The town started to grow around us, so we sold the place, then a friend called and said, ‘You gotta see this place!' [on Swick Road]. I bought it the same day. It was all bush when we bought it. ... There was just a small cabin; a one-bedroom house on stilts. I put in an extra bedroom, a bunkroom, and built the boathouse."
That was 1973, and by then Mr. Roach was already a couple of decades into his career in oil and gas. His story and the slow development of the compound mirrors the development of Western Canada's oil industry.
"I first came out to Alberta in ‘49. I hitchhiked out to see what was going on," he said.
What was going on was the beginning of the province's oil boom, based on the 1947 discovery of oil in Leduc. His father was a judge back in Ontario, and Mr. Roach ended up moving to Tulsa to get a bachelor of science degree, graduating in 1954. "I got married down there to a lovely gal from Oklahoma. I was married for 61 years."
He moved back to Alberta, working in the oil industry and eventually starting his own engineering company testing and evaluating gas wells and reserves. His company was purchased by oil services giant Schlumberger in the mid-sixties, but he would go on to invest in a number of other businesses, including pizza chains and a Pepsi-Cola franchise.
Through it all, the family would come out to Kelowna. "I grew up in Toronto, and everybody goes to the lake in the summertime; we spent our summers in Muskoka.
When I came to Alberta we started having a bunch of boys [he has four sons]. My father always said the idle mind is the devil's workshop, so, come summer, we better get them working."
The boys learned how to barefoot waterski, they fished for salmon on the shore, roamed the woods and putted around the lake in a converted tugboat.
Kelowna is midway between Vancouver and Calgary and so it tends to attract the business elite of both cities, according to listing agent Richard Deacon of Engel & Volkers. As time went on, the family found itself coming to the lake at least once a month, and by 1989 Mr. Roach was ready to build something a little grander than a cabin that he and his wife might move to permanently.
THE PROPERTY TODAY Prospective buyers will gravitate to the main house. With close to 8,000 square feet of living space, four bedrooms and five bathrooms, it's the star of the site. The house is largely hidden from the roadway, sitting deep back through the wooded lot, though it's likely a familiar site to boaters as it commands a slope that runs down to a sandy beach.
Mr. Roach said the design was inspired by French country homes, and the wall after wall of tall rectangular windows facing the lake view does evoke that lineage.
This house was finished in 1990 and the cottage was rebuilt after 2003, when wildfires destroyed an old A-frame house that stood there. The surrounding landscape still bears the scars of that fire, but most of the Roach property was unscathed. Among the features to survive the fire: a vineyard the family cultivated in 1996.
"It was supposed to be a hobby," said second son Mike Roach. "I'll tell you, a vineyard is no hobby."
He lives in the cottage and tends to the grapes. "It's been a lot of work, but it's been a real classroom for me. We're just going through harvest now, it was about three weeks earlier than normal. Depending on the year, I get 120 cases of wine out of it," he said. The mix of vintages is about 60 per cent merlot and 40 per cent chardonnay.
To get into the main house, you cross a raised catwalk from the laneway and multicar garages. Through the doors is a hallway that runs right to the rear window wall with views of the lake. "Jaws hit the floor when you walk through the door," Mike says.
To the right is a powder room, to the left is the kitchen - kitted out in French country style with painted tile countertops and backsplash and a rack of pots and pans hanging above the butcher block island.
Just past the kitchen is the family room and with kitchen seating and couches beyond surrounded on all three sides by windows, with a curving glass wall at the end of the space. On the landward side there are doors that open onto a narrow balcony overlooking the formal garden and fountain below. On the lake side is a Juliet balcony that brings in the sounds and wind from the lake. The floors throughout this area are mainly hexagonal terracotta tiles, rustic and elegant at the same time.
Back in the main hall is a long passage that runs past a formal dining room and wide-open stairwell heading down to the lower levels, and ends in a formal sitting room with a picture window wall facing the lake.
Just past the stairs is a bedroom big enough to be a main-floor primary suite (with its own shower and large closets), but currently set up as a guest room.
The rest of the living space is on the two lower levels, the middle level hosting bedrooms and a library office. The primary suite is here with its own sitting room and its own sunroom as well as huge sleeping quarters and massive ensuite bath and walk-in closet. The other two bedrooms on this floor are more modest, but also have their own baths.
There's a wet bar hidden in the wall here next to the library, to help keep guests on the patio refreshed.
The lowest level returns to the rustic tiles, and has a wood-panelled den and also a games room with a 100-plus-year-old snooker table rescued at auction from the bankruptcy sale of a Calgary pool hall. It's all in pristine condition, as befits a squared-away engineer, Mr. Deacon said.
WHY SELL NOW After more than a half-century spending time on the lake, Mr. Roach says it's time to move on. At 92, he still mows his own grass, and does a lot of gardening on the estate and he still enjoys himself and the property, but it's a little different.
"I'm here by myself now. I find I rattle around in it ... but I can take in a different view of the lake every hour," said Mr. Roach, whose wife Helen died in 2013.
The house is filled with music whenever he's home; there's a central sound system with speakers in almost every room. "I love music, my wife loved music, they [the boys] loved music a little different than I did."
The house was built for entertaining, for the family and for friends, large dinner parties or small. Of his four sons, only Mike is local, though.
"I'll be quite honest, I'm reluctant to sell it ... but my sons are all over the world," he said.
Mr. Deacon is confident the compound will find another family looking to make their own half-century of memories on Lake Okanagan.

Full text: Toronto's housing market is heating up, with resales climbing for the first time in five months as "fierce" competition for houses in the suburbs pushes prices higher.
There were 9,046 home resales in the Toronto region in September, down 18 per cent from the same period last year. But it was the first month-over-month increase in activity since March, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board, or TRREB.
Across the Toronto area, the average selling price of a home was $1,136,280, an 18-per-cent jump over September of last year. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the average price was 1.8 per cent higher than in August.
The board's home price index, which calibrates for price volatility, reached $1,082,400 in September, a rise of 2 per cent over August, and the first monthover-month increase since May, with the regions surrounding the city of Toronto leading the way higher.
Although more homeowners put their properties up for sale last month, the total number of houses on the market was lower than in the fall of last year.
Realtors describe a return to the frenzied competition that characterized most of the pandemic's real estate boom. "It is quite fierce," said Michelle Plach, a realtor with Justo Brokerage.
Ms. Plach listed a semi-detached house in Mississauga on Thursday for $799,000 and was inundated with requests to see the property. The house sold a day later for $999,999. A week ago, Ms. Plach said another Mississauga house received 20 offers.
She said over the summer, houses were getting between three to seven offers. Now, she said properties are "easily getting 10 to 20 offers."
The home price index for the Peel region, which includes Mississauga, rose 2 per cent from August to September. In Halton, which is farther west and about an hour commute to downtown Toronto by train, the index jumped 4 per cent. Prices rose at a similar pace in the Simcoe region, which is north of Toronto, and to the east in Durham.
With more companies embracing a flexible work model and allowing staff to work from home part of the week, home buyers continue to seek bigger properties outside of the downtown core, according to realtors.
But with houses topping $1-million in the city and parts of Toronto's suburbs, homebuyers are forced to look at condos, according to TRREB. Condo resales continue to climb with the average selling price of a condo in the city surpassing $744,000 in September, higher than prior to the start of the pandemic.
Jason Mercer, the board's chief market analyst, said more first-time home buyers are entering the market and the competition has "led to an acceleration in price growth over the past few months."
In Canada's priciest real estate markets, such as the Vancouver region, resales were steady, but dropped 11 per cent in B.C.'s Fraser Valley, according to their local boards.
In the Vancouver area, the home price index for detached and semi-detached houses was up 1.2 per cent from August to September. The index for a detached house hit $1,828,200.
In the Fraser Valley, the index rose across all types of properties. Detached houses recorded the biggest gain, with prices up 1.9 per cent to $1,362,220 over the same period.

Full text: 72 Duke St.
CHESTER, N.S. Asking Price: $5,850,000 Taxes: $14,670.41 (2020) Lot Size: 1/2-1 acre Agent: Piers Baker, Duckworth Real Estate THE BACKSTORY In the seaside village of Chester, N.S., a landmark home known as White Cottage stands overlooking Front Harbour.
The house dates to 1795, when British Lieutenant Anthony Thickpenny was granted a swath of land on Nova Scotia's south shore and built a home for himself and his wife, Elizabeth.
For thousands of years before the British arrived, the Mi'kmaq people were living on the peninsula. The area is part of the unceded Mi'kmaq Traditional Lands known as Mi'kma'ki. Today, White Cottage belongs to Toronto-based interior designer Philip Mitchell and advertising maven Mark Narsansky. The two have had ties to the province since they vacationed with friends and spotted a small Gothic revival house for sale.
"We came into Chester, had lunch, bought a house. True story," Mr. Narsansky says.
After a few years, the two were contemplating moving up to a larger home when rumours circulated through the village that an investor was eyeing the grand old home at 72 Duke St., Mr. Narsansky says.
"We heard that somebody wanted to tear it down and we said, ‘That can't happen.' " THE HOUSE TODAY In 2011, Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Narsansky purchased the house and moved around the corner from their Victorian cottage.
The newly acquired property came with 4,800 square feet of space in the main house, 462 feet of water frontage and a wharf. It also presented a challenge.
"It was a little bit down on its heels," a diplomatic Mr. Narsansky says.
The two men soon discovered that the house they rescued needed a massive restoration.
Over the decades, some poorly built additions had been tacked on to the original 1795 dwelling.
For a time, the house had served as an annex to a local hotel before it was converted to single-family again.
"It had been added on to but not been made into a cohesive house," Mr. Narsansky says. "It was a rabbit warren of odd spaces."
In some places they discovered that beams had been shaved down so they were no longer safe. The area around one of the porches had no proper flashing to keep the rain out.
"For 10 years water was just running down through the walls."
The couple moved into the coach house and workers began dismantling the old house, board by board. The pieces were numbered and packed into nine storage containers.
"We were really passionate about saving what could be saved," Mr. Narsansky says. "We spent about six months taking it apart."
The components they were able to preserve included floors, stairs, railings and pickets from the original dwelling.
The pieces that couldn't be reused were milled down to be used in the trim, beadboard and other details.
"Some of it was carved into folk art," Mr. Narsansky says. "Nothing was thrown away." Today guests arrive to a welcoming foyer, which in turn leads to the pine-panelled dining room. The main floor also has the kitchen, large living room, sunroom and doors opening to a covered porch.
The arched walls that separate the spaces are not original to the house but they are reminiscent of Chester's boatbuilding heritage, Mr. Narsansky explains.
"Arches are very nautical."
During the renovation the men paid close attention to details that would create the impression of a home that had evolved over the years.
In the foyer, for example, they had mosaic tile laid by hand, then surrounded with a border, Mr. Narsansky says.
"We wanted to have a feeling of history," he says.
Beneath the patina, they added modern conveniences such as in-floor heating, luxury plumbing fixtures and built-in speakers.
Upstairs, the primary suite has a large bedroom with a fireplace, two dressing rooms and two full bathrooms.
The third-floor guest suite has two bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms. Outside, the roof deck provides a good vantage point for watching the weekly sailing races.
Throughout the building, a hodgepodge of windows was replaced with new reproduction wood windows appropriate to the era.
In that time, glass was difficult to make so panes were always small, Mr. Narsansky says.
On the lower level, an ancient fireplace was still standing in the original kitchen. While work was under way, a tradesman discovered a crack in the chimney.
That meant the entire chimney had to come down, Mr. Narsansky says, because lighting a fire could have burned the house down.
The couple rebuilt the fireplace and chimney and turned the area into the family room. That level also has a mud room with a doggy spa and doors leading to a veranda with a wisteria-covered pergola and an entertainment pavilion with a fieldstone fireplace.
"Right through into the fall we always have a fire out there," Mr. Narsansky says.
The home is surrounded by herb and perennial gardens and the coach house provides an additional guest suite above the two-car garage.
After many years of work by local artisans, the restoration won the Built Heritage Award from the Heritage Trust of Nova Scotia, and White Cottage was recently one of the stops on an "art house" fundraising tour for the Chester Art Centre.
Today the historic village draws visitors to its galleries, restaurants and sailing on the waters of Mahone Bay.
Mr. Narsansky says the couple prefer the lively scene in town to a more rural setting. The oldest pub in the province, the Rope Loft, is just along the harbour.
When the COVID-19 health emergency shut down travel, Mr. Narsansky and Mr. Mitchell decided to ride out the pandemic in Chester.
"Why not?" Mr. Narsansky says. "You can be here in a little village on the ocean, walking dogs and living the life."
THE BEST FEATURE The kitchen was expanded from a small galley to a comfortable room for cooking and entertaining. The men, who both love to cook, were not aiming for a period kitchen but the impression of one, Mr. Narsansky explains.
There's a La Cornue range, two farmhouse sinks and a dining alcove with a bay window.
The floors were sanded by hand and the refrigerator is disguised behind a wood panel.
"We wanted it to look like a big, old armoire so it doesn't feel like a kitchen."
The large island, hand-carved from hemlock, is topped by wood - also finished by hand.
"We wanted it to have a very tactile feel to it because that's where everyone hangs around," Mr. Narsansky says. "You can feel the nicks if you run your hand across it."
He adds that gathering in the kitchen is a time-honoured East Coast tradition.
"It's the heart of the whole home. No matter where you start or what you plan, you end up in the kitchen."

Full text: China is grappling with a power crunch that threatens to curb economic growth and worsen product shortages that have roiled global supply chains in recent months.
Surging coal and gas prices, as well as rising demand for electricity amid a boom in manufacturing and exports, have led to severe power shortages across China, with more than half of all provinces reporting problems.
The shortages have resulted in rolling blackouts in some areas, and factories have been forced to close or suspend operations during certain hours to conserve power.
The impact on industries is broad and includes power-intensive sectors such as aluminum smelting, steelmaking, cement manufacturing and fertilizer production. Suppliers for Tesla Inc.
and Apple Inc. have also reportedly been forced to halt production.
Analysts are concerned that knock-on effects could damage the wider Chinese economy, potentially dwarfing any problems caused by the collapse of real estate giant Evergrande, which has dominated headlines in the past month.
A number of banking giants - including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. - have cut their forecasts for Chinese growth this year, citing the power disruptions.
The outages are just the latest headwind for the Chinese economy. Manufacturing output fell in September, ending an 18-month expansion. Consumer spending is slowing. And the country is awash in debt, whether at the government or household levels.
Any troubles in China could have far-reaching implications for a global economy that, over the past two decades, has increasingly relied on the country to drive growth. Of late, China has played a central role in troubled supply chains, owing to intermittent shutdowns at factories and ports as Beijing looks to stamp out the COVID-19 virus.
The power shortages are liable to make the supply situation even worse.
"Beijing's unprecedented resolve in enforcing energy-consumption limits could result in long-term benefits, but the shortterm economic costs are substantial," analysts at Japanese financial holding company Nomura said in a recent report.
While China is shifting to greener energy production, coal still fuels some 67 per cent of the country's power generation, the report said. Coal costs are soaring around the world, but strict government limits on electricity pricing have prevented power companies from passing on increased costs to consumers, leading some to cut production.
Even provinces with plenty of energy to go around are still experiencing power shortages as their governments try to hit national energy-consumption targets for the third quarter. In August, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) warned that two-thirds of all provinces had missed their targets in the first half of the year.
That prompted some local governments to impose rolling blackouts this month, often with little warning. It led to traffic chaos after street lights stopped working, and there were reports of people being trapped in elevators or forced to walk up dozens of flights of stairs. In the northern Liaoning province, 23 workers at a foundry suffered carbon-monoxide poisoning after a blackout shut down the ventilation system, state media reported.
In an opinion piece published Sunday in the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, local governments were told not to be "too aggressive" or "slam the brakes too hard" in cutting energy consumption.
"No matter how tight the power supply is, we must give priority to guaranteeing residents' electricity use," it said, warning of potential societal unrest.
At a news conference on Wednesday, officials from the NDRC echoed this guidance, saying the party "attaches great importance to the work of ensuring energy supply during the heating season."
The NDRC said it will add advanced coal-production capacity, increase coal imports and try to increase domestic natural-gas production in order to relieve the current crisis. On Thursday, authorities in Heilongjiang province said they would ramp up the amount of electricity imported from Russia to ease local power shortages.
However, on the same day, the China Coal Industry Association warned that inventory at power plants is low and it is "not optimistic" ahead of the winter, the season of peak demand.
There was evidence of public anger over the blackouts being censored online. Both FreeWeibo and FreeWeChat, services that monitor censorship on China's biggest social-media platforms, showed many posts being deleted.
In an editorial this week, staterun tabloid Global Times attacked foreign media for launching "a new wave of criticism badmouthing China's economy and raising the alarm," adding that "this power crunch is not a crisis for China."
"China is prompt in discovering and discerning problems, and public opinion has played a positive role in it," the paper said.
While the manufacturing hubs of southeastern China have been among the worst-hit this month, residents of northern provinces are fearful that the shortages could continue into the bitterly cold winter, bringing widespread misery and even death.
"Even with prior notice, no electricity equals no heating, how would we live through this winter?" wrote one user on Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter.
The temperature regularly plunges below -20 across northeastern China, where households are largely dependent on coal for heating - though some have moved to electric heaters in recent years.
One Weibo user in Jilin province, on the border with North Korea, said that without power, "taking a hot bath is impossible, eating a hot meal becomes a luxury.
Are we really going to live like ancient human being? ... Read our books by oil lamp?" With reports from Alexandra Li, Matt Lundy, Reuters and Associated Press

Full text: The rapid unravelling of Chinese property giant Evergrande has sent bond prices tumbling and spread uncertainty through global markets, but some asset managers are starting to see opportunities to buy back into the floundering company's debt at rock-bottom prices.
Against a backdrop of gloom and fears of global contagion in markets, investment research company Morningstar Inc. highlighted a small number of asset managers that have shown willingness to pursue investment opportunities emerging from China Evergrande Group's misfortune.
They include Royal Bank of Canada's British-based subsidiary BlueBay Asset Management LLP, which sold off large parts of its Evergrande exposure over the summer but has recently had renewed interest as a buyer, as well as BlackRock Inc., UBS Group AG and Ashmore Group, according to Morningstar's report.
Starting in late 2020, BlueBay built overweight positions in Evergrande debt, including in two emerging market bond funds that had portfolio exposure of 3.6 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
In July, however, BlueBay began cutting back its holdings, reducing its exposure in each fund to about 0.9 per cent as of Sept. 22, according to Morningstar.
More recently, as prices for Evergrande bonds plummeted to firesale levels - reaching 25 cents on the dollar in some cases - BlueBay has made small purchases of the teetering giant's distressed debt.
BlueBay "believes that current pricing for these bonds (around the mid-20s) fully reflects the default probability, and it has thus gradually started adding China Evergrande exposure to the portfolios," wrote Shannon Kirwin, senior manager and research analyst at Morningstar, in a research note.
Similarly, U.S.-based BlackRock "added [Evergrande's] debt to five of its strategies" when prices reached distressed levels in mid-September, while Swiss bank UBS and British-based Ashmore have held significant exposures to Evergrande, which totalled US$283-million and US$146-million respectively as of August.
BlueBay's overall exposure to Evergrande is minimal, but the asset manager still holds the property giant's debt in several portfolios, according to Morningstar.
RBC spokesperson Chris Dotson said BlueBay's emerging market debt portfolios "currently have very limited holdings in Evergrande," and BlueBay has "lower exposure to the company" as of Sept. 24 than it had on Aug. 31.
"Prior to this, the investment team proactively reduced exposure to the company earlier this year, divesting the majority of its holdings," he said in an e-mail.
According to Morningstar, BlueBay expects some of Evergrande's local rivals such as Guangzhou R&F Properties "are likely to come under further stress owing to tight financing conditions," Ms. Kirwin wrote.
But she said the fund manger sees other Chinese property companies as "well-supported," and BlueBay "is ready to add back to some of these issuers as soon as the managers see signs of market stabilization."
Asset managers haven't shown "the same level of panic that you're seeing playing out in the broader market" over Evergrande, Ms. Kirwin said in an interview. Although there is significant uncertainty about the property giant's fate, Ms. Kirwin heard "again and again" that asset managers expect Chinese authorities to take some action to contain the situation, which would help calm markets.
"Given that expectation, since there's so much panic selling, we've heard some managers saying that now it's creating some opportunities because the baby is getting thrown out with the bath water and everything is being sold off across the board that remotely has to do with the Chinese real estate market," Ms. Kirwin said.
Although Evergrande bonds are cheap, another factor separating asset managers that are more bullish on Evergrande from their bearish rivals is their tolerance for wading into lengthy processes to work out distressed debt that could tie bondholders up in legal wrangling for years.
Last year, BlueBay added to a team dedicated to emerging markets illiquid credit that has specialists in debt restructuring.
"This is definitely an area where they are trying to build up a competitive advantage versus other credit houses," Ms. Kirwin said.
"You basically have to have a lot of staff and a lot of special expertise to be interested in making money off these things."

Full text: The crisis at China Evergrande Group, one of that country's biggest property developers, points to a problem much bigger than unsold apartments in second-tier Chinese cities.
Like Evergrande, China's debt-fuelled growth model is sputtering. During a brilliant three-decade run from 1978 to 2007, the country sprinted ahead, expanding its output at around 10 per cent a year. But since the financial crisis of 2007-09, its pace of growth has slowed considerably - to under 7 per cent a year in the run-up to the pandemic.
A much more severe deceleration could loom ahead. If some prominent forecasters are right, growth in gross domestic product will slide to a near-standstill over the decade to come.
"If you look out 10 years, I would not be at all surprised to see growth at only 1 or 2 per cent a year," Leland Miller, chief executive officer of analytics firm China Beige Book International, said in an interview.
"Our long-term forecast is that growth in China will slow to only 2 per cent in 2030," Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, declared at an online seminar this week.
Stagnation in China would be bad news for businesses everywhere. In the years leading up to the pandemic, the Asian giant accounted for roughly a third of global growth, according to the World Economic Forum.
Raw-materials suppliers would be among the biggest victims if the pace of Chinese construction falters and the country's appetite for iron, copper, nickel and zinc goes into a long-term funk.
Automakers that dreamed of huge sales in China would also feel pain, as would investors who hoped for runaway growth in emerging market stocks.
Granted, Beijing could engineer a strong short-term recovery if it chooses to deliver massive fiscal stimulus.
But in the long term, its ambitions for growth face at least three big headwinds: an economy that persistently misallocates capital, towering levels of debt and slowing productivity gains.
A slowdown would not surprise skeptics such as Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Peking University in Beijing, who has argued for years that China's growth numbers are less impressive than they appear.
Prof. Pettis warned in an essay last month that as much as half the country's reported growth in GDP over the past decade is imaginary wealth that exists only on paper. It is "the bezzle," to use the wonderful term invented by the late Canadian-born economist John Kenneth Galbraith. According to Prof. Pettis, much of this bezzle is associated with local governments' desire to build big-ticket infrastructure projects that deliver little economic payoff.
"The way this works is straightforward," he said. "Some entity, usually associated with the government and therefore lacking hard budget constraints, spends, say, $150 to build a bridge or a railroad that ultimately generates only $50 in additional economic benefits."
So long as the builder of the project can carry the project on its financial statements at its original cost, the economy looks to be growing nicely. But because the project can't justify its cost in reality, the growth is actually an illusion.
One consequence of bezzle is that debt keeps expanding because the returns from such projects can't generate returns sufficient to pay down the funds borrowed to construct them. This helps to explain "the extraordinary surge in China's debt ratios since the mid-2000s," Prof. Pettis asserted.
Between 2008 and 2019, total private and public debt in the Chinese economy jumped from 169 per cent of GDP to 306 per cent, according to the Institute for International Finance. Despite this borrowing spree, growth slowed and productivity withered. Construction of unnecessary bridges, railways, airports and other superfluous infrastructure projects dragged on economic efficiency.
So did the country's obsession with real estate. The property sector, broadly defined, now accounts for 30 per cent of value added in the economy, Citibank estimates. Yet this economic driver rests on squishy foundations. Supply has been running well ahead of demand for years and the surplus is growing as population growth grinds to a near halt. China now has enough empty houses and apartments to accommodate more than 90 million people, according to the economics researchers at the Rhodium Group.
Why has Beijing been so welcoming to questionable infrastructure projects and vacant apartment developments? One reason is that land sales make up a big chunk of most local governments' revenue. In addition, infrastructure and real estate projects are handy ways to spur growth and create jobs. And both are ways to insulate China from shocks outside its borders.
Loren Brandt, a professor of economics at the University of Toronto and noted China watcher, says Beijing began redefining its relationship with the rest of the world around the time of the financial crisis. Leaders sought to promote self-reliance and "indigenous" innovation, while reducing vulnerability to external threats.
Their campaign has had a dampening effect on growth. Over the past 10 to 15 years, trade as a share of China's GDP declined. Exports, which grew at a breakneck annual rate of 25.5 per cent between 2000 and 2007, inched ahead by only 2.1 per cent a year between 2013 and 2019.
Productivity growth slowed to a crawl.
"Growth and dynamism in the Chinese economy has declined," Prof. Brandt said in an interview. This is distinctly odd, he notes, because Chinese industry is far less productive than its peers in advanced economies and there is plenty of room for catch-up growth. But closing the productivity gap seems to have fallen well down Beijing's agenda.
The country's leadership is now primarily focused on cementing the primacy of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), said Mr. Miller of China Beige Book. Beijing's recent moves, such as cracking down on many of China's big tech companies such as Tencent and Alibaba and reining in the country's tutoring industry, signal that the CCP is no longer interested in boosting economic growth at all costs, he said.
Instead of lionizing business leaders, President Xi Jinping and his associates want to cast themselves as defenders of ordinary citizens - an important message given the growing economic inequality in Chinese society. Beijing intends to direct market forces, not the other way around.
"They are making clear who is in charge," Mr. Miller said.
Part of Beijing's strategy to bring the economy under firmer control involves reducing the froth in the property sector.
Its announcement last year that property developers would have to meet three key tests of creditworthiness - the "three red lines" - forced the sector to reduce its balance-sheet leverage and led directly to the crisis at Evergrande. "If you're an optimist, you can argue all of this will lead to slower but healthier growth," Mr. Miller said.
The danger is that slower growth may turn out to be very slow indeed.

Full text: On July 1, as the Chinese Communist Party celebrated its centenary with a grand parade in the capital, Beijing, Hui Ka Yan watched from a position of honour atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace, overlooking Tiananmen Square.
Dressed in a blue blazer, his receding hair dyed the pitch black of China's elite, Mr. Hui's prominent presence at the celebration was seen by many observers as a vote of confidence in him and his company, the real estate developer China Evergrande Group.
For years, Evergrande had faced questions about its ever-growing pile of debt, which reached US$300-billion this year, but which it had always been able to refinance, shrugging off the barbs of shortsellers and other critics.
In part, this appeared to be due to Mr. Hui's impeccable political connections. A member of the standing committee of the Chinese People's Consultative Conference, Mr. Hui was a common sight at official forums and the yearly Two Sessions meeting of China's rubber-stamp parliament.
While known for his extravagant wealth - Mr. Hui has twice topped lists of China's richest people - he was also lauded in state media for his charity work, speaking of the importance of alleviating poverty and reducing inequality long before Chinese President Xi Jinping launched his "common prosperity" drive this year.
This month, Mr. Hui's ability to steamroll through seemingly any crisis appeared to come to an end. Markets worldwide plunged on news Evergrande would likely miss several coming interest payments on onshore and overseas bonds, with a further US$37.3-billion coming due within a year.
Cassandras warned of a potential "Lehman Moment," akin to how the collapse of Lehman Brothers presaged the 2008 financial crash in the United States, and pointed to widespread exposure to Evergrande in the Chinese real estate market and banking system.
While it has so far avoided default, Evergrande has hired financial advisers to assess a restructuring, and authorities in Beijing have signalled no intention to bail out the company, including reportedly telling local governments to prepare for its collapse.
From being lauded as a visionary entrepreneur and committed anti-poverty campaigner, Mr. Hui now faces the wrath of Chinese regulators in a system in which high fliers who return to earth tend to crash down hard.
Hui Ka Yan - also known as Xu Jiayin - was born in Henan, a province in central China, in 1958. The country was just entering the Great Leap Forward, Mao Zedong's campaign to jump-start industrialization, which ended in disaster, leading to a famine that caused the deaths of an estimated 20 million people.
"I know poverty very well," Mr. Hui said in a 2018 speech. When he was a little over a year old, his mother fell ill, and with no money to see a doctor, soon passed away, "leaving me half an orphan." His father, a veteran of the war against Japan turned agricultural worker, was often absent, and Mr. Hui was largely raised by his grandparents.
"In school, all I ate was sweet potato and steamed bread," he said. "The desks were made of mud tables. When it rained heavily outside, the water would drip on us."
After graduating high school, Mr. Hui struggled to find work, unable even to find a job "moving bricks for 10 yuan a month" - less than a dollar. It was 1976, and China had just reopened its universities after Mao's death and the end of the Cultural Revolution, during which millions of young people were "sent down" to the countryside to learn from the peasants. Mr. Hui threw himself into his studies and was able to pass the college entrance exam.
After university, Mr. Hui worked in a steel factory, but the days of the "iron rice bowl" jobs were over, as paramount leader Deng Xiaoping launched China's reform and opening, encouraging markets and liberalizing parts of the country's economy.
Though he was successful at the factory, and was promoted multiple times, Mr. Hui was entranced by the potential opportunities of the New China and soon quit and moved to the southern city of Shenzhen, the flagship of Mr. Deng's reform campaign, on the border with Hong Kong. In 1996, he founded Evergrande, with just eight employees squeezed into tiny offices in the nearby city of Guangzhou.
Since the founding of the People's Republic, property had been tied to employment, with people living in worker dorms and collectives. But in the 1990s, China was beginning to experiment with private home ownership, and Mr. Hui's new company surfed the growing wave of urbanization, as millions of workers migrated from the interior of China to coastal cities.
Much of this was fuelled by debt, with many real estate developers taking on huge amounts of leverage to build tower blocks quickly, often to very poor standards and, as prices went up, increasingly with an eye to speculators rather than homeowners. This growing bubble became characterized by so-called "ghost cities" - vast developments built in rural China that struggled to convince anyone to occupy them. But empty apartments were also a common sight even in major cities, as speculators and easy borrowing drove home prices ever higher.
When Evergrande listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2009, its shares boomed, but it soon became a poster child for what many saw as the increasingly risky Chinese real estate market.
In 2012, short-seller Andrew Left published one of the most pointed criticisms of Evergrande, saying the company was effectively insolvent and accusing it of "accounting shenanigans" and defrauding investors.
"Evergrande is over-leveraged and the company has no margin for error," Mr. Left wrote in the report.
While the company's share price dropped 20 per cent as a result of Mr. Left's claims, it was him, not Evergrande, who was dragged before regulators. In 2016, a Hong Kong tribunal found him guilty of market misconduct and banned him from trading in the territory for five years.
Mr. Left, whose ban ends next month, told CNBC this week that "everything I discussed from leverage to corporate governance turned out to be true, and instead of considering my report [regulators] forced me to spend millions defending myself."
For many observers, it seemed Evergrande's ever-growing debt pile and overseas critics simply did not matter. The company continued to start new projects across China, and Mr. Hui grew wealthier and wealthier, becoming in 2017 the country's richest man.
His new fortune enabled a lifestyle that would have seemed impossible to even the richest Chinese in 1958, let alone poor peasants like Mr. Hui's family. He bought property around the world, travelled in a private plane, and opened a bank account in the British Virgin Islands, a notorious tax haven. In Red Roulette: An Insider's Story of Wealth, Power, Corruption, and Vengeance in Today's China, author Desmond Shum describes going shopping with Mr. Hui for a US$100-million pleasure yacht in southern France.
"[Mr. Hui] envisioned a floating palace to wine and dine officials off China's coast, away from the prying eyes of China's anticorruption cops and its nascent paparazzi," Mr. Shum writes, adding of the price tag that "dropping this type of money among these jet-setters had become, if not routine, at least not totally out of the ordinary."
Throughout his rise, Mr. Hui also gave large amounts of money to charity, topping several annual lists as the country's most generous benefactor, and he invested in anti-poverty work, first in his native Henan and then nationwide. In speeches, he urged other entrepreneurs to give back, earning him laudatory coverage in Chinese media.
In his public appearances, Mr. Hui was also careful to pay homage to the Communist Party, without which, he said, his success would not have been possible.
Had the Party not reopened the universities, "I would not have been able to leave the countryside," he said in 2018. "Without the 14 yuan per month [government] bursary, I would not have been able to finish university. And without the country's wise policy of ‘reform and opening up,' there would be no Evergrande today. Therefore, everything the company and I have was given by the Party, the state and the society."
Mr. Hui's political adeptness went beyond flowery speeches, and he cultivated close ties first with officials in Guangdong province, where Evergrande was headquartered, and later in Beijing and throughout China, enabling the company to achieve a level of nationwide success that other companies have not.
"If you look at a lot of other real estate developers, even the big ones, they tend to be a lot more geographically focused," said David Yu, a cross-border finance and investing expert at NYU Shanghai. "And that's because to grow you have to have good relationships with the local government to win the land, to win approvals and all the other steps."
According to Cercius Group, a Montreal-based intelligence firm that specializes in Chinese politics, Mr. Hui developed close ties to Zeng Qinghong, a one-time vice-president of China and close ally of Jiang Zemin, president from 1993 to 2003, during whose tenure the country's real estate market really took off. Other reports have linked him to the family of Wen Jiabao, who served as China's premier from 2003 to 2013.
In Red Roulette, Mr. Shum said Mr. Hui was acquainted with Zhang Peili, the premier's wife, and describes how, after a dinner between Mr. Hui, Ms. Zhang and Whitney Duan, Mr. Shum's wife, the real estate magnate casually purchased two US$1-million rings at a Beijing jewellery store.
Ms. Duan refused a ring, her husband said, and it's not clear who Mr. Hui eventually gave the rings to.
"In China, there are several ways to get the attention of those in power," Mr. Shum writes. "[Mr.
Hui's] preferred method was through giving outrageously expensive gifts."
During this time, Mr. Hui also expanded Evergrande's footprint beyond property, taking stakes in entertainment ventures, a mineral water brand, electric vehicles and Guangzhou FC, which Mr. Hui's company co-owns with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the ecommerce giant founded by Jack Ma. In a speech earlier this year, Mr. Hui said that the "New Evergrande" had arrived, after the company "completed the transformation from real estate to multi-industry and digital technology."
This expansion, as before, was driven by further leveraging the company, with Evergrande accumulating some US$300-billion in debt by the start of this year. As long as Evergrande could continue raising money however, relying on strong relationships with state-owned banks and private funders, as well as overseas bondholders, Mr. Hui could continue to surf - in China at least - on a reputation as a genius entrepreneur, and one who spoke of the need to tackle inequality and give back to the poor.
"Authorities from small, lower-tiered cities would be intoxicated by [Mr.] Hui and his very visible political correctness and connections - welcoming his development projects and proposals with open arms," market analyst Shuli Ren wrote this week.
"Warnings fell on deaf ears - and the developer-turned-conglomerate went on living out its nine lives."
Some of this public perception played directly into Evergrande's success, particularly when it came to selling consumer investment products and signing up people for new property developments. In multiple reports this week, retail investors spoke of believing the company simply could not default, owing to its political connections and reputation. This encouraged people to purchase products promising outlandish returns, with the assumption the investments were a safe bet.
Christina Xie, who works in export in bustling Shenzhen, told Reuters she had pumped her life savings into Evergrande investment products.
"I was planning to use it for me and my partner's old age. I worked day and night saving, now it's game over," said Ms. Xie.
"Evergrande is one of China's biggest real estate companies ... my consultant told me the product was guaranteed."
Prof. Yu, the NYU Shanghai expert, said "China, and Asia in general, are driven by these charismatic, aggressive entrepreneur founders."
"Evergrande have been very, very successful over a good amount of time, they're not an overnight success," he added.
But Prof. Yu saw in the company's shift from its core product to other areas a level of hubris that might have led Evergrande to overextend itself, leading to the apparent unravelling this week.
Certainly, for all his political adeptness, Mr. Hui does not seem to have perceived, or believed he could ignore, a shifting regulatory landscape, as Mr. Xi called for an end to real estate speculation and ordered companies to avoid overleveraging.
Last year, the Chinese government introduced three "red lines" for property developers, requiring them to keep debt levels within reasonable bounds.
Evergrande was in breach of all three, and soon found itself unable to raise more capital, even at one point reportedly approaching staff to loan the company money.
Two months after Mr. Hui appeared on the Tiananmen rostrum, rubbing shoulders with China's most powerful people, his company was facing default, lambasted around the world as a potential second Lehman Brothers that could bring down not just the Chinese economy, but also the global one.
"I don't understand why [Mr.
Hui] is still standing," said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of J Capital Research and an expert on Chinese companies. Pointing to evidence that some negative stories about Mr. Hui were being censored on the Chinese internet, she said it was unclear why Mr. Hui's political cache was "so particularly strong." Despite this, Ms. Stevenson-Yang said, in normal circumstances with a scandal like this, "you would expect him to end up in jail."
For all the criticism and doomsaying in the past week, however, Mr. Hui has remained bullish, promising in a statement that, sooner rather than later, "Evergrande will emerge from its darkest moments."

Full text: DONE DEAL 630 Dinner Bay Rd., Mayne Island, B.C.
MAYNE ISLAND Asking price: $2.479-million (May, 2021) Selling price: $1.85-million (June, 2021) Previous selling price: $940,000 (2012); $299,100 (1989) Days on market: 39 Taxes: $7,300.93 (2020) Listing agent: Brenda Dean, Re/Max Mayne Buyer's agent: Ian Watt, Sutton Group West Coast Realty THE ACTION In the 1980s, the Oceanwood was a popular resort, always booked. It then fell behind the times, says buyer's agent, Ian Watt. It had not been used as an inn for several years. The buyers are two local businessmen who intend to renovate it.
"Ten acres of waterfront property, with a house - that's worth the $1.85-million they paid. It just happens to come with a nice little hotel. It is going to take somebody local who has the desire and the money to bring it back to life."
The property sold on June 25 and completed mid August.
WHAT THEY GOT This large 10,897square-foot building could either be used as an estate, or be converted back to a boutique hotel.
The 10-acre waterfront property has south-facing views of Navy Channel, with 12 bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms, a commercial kitchen, dining area, breakfast room, library and several lounge areas.
There is a games room, a hot tub, outdoor patio and path to the ocean. The property includes a separate three-bedroom, twobath, 1,148-square-foot house, also with ocean views. There is a two-car garage and workshop.
THE AGENT'S TAKE Mayne Island prices have skyrocketed in the last year, says Mr. Watt. But the building was built in 1980, so the interior is dated and the house needs updates that meet current standards of energy efficiency.
Knowing a significant outlay will be required to bring the property up to snuff, Mr. Watt's buyers were firm in their offer.
"It's not like someone can come in and say, ‘I have 20-percent down. I am going to mortgage it.' There are very few people who can take on this kind of endeavour. So we said, ‘sorry, take it or leave it.' " - KERRY GOLD

Full text: 31 Colquhoun Cres.
HAMILTON Asking Price: $5.486-million Taxes: $35,979 (2021) Lot Size: 134 feet by 361 feet Agents: Lan Burgess, broker with Re/Max Real Estate Centre Inc.
THE BACKSTORY Sometimes all it takes is one look at a house and you're sold. For Diane Zhao, all it took was the view from the backyard of 31 Colquhoun Cres.
Colquhoun Crescent is just off Hamilton's Scenic Drive - an aptly named road that runs along the edge of the Niagara Escarpment, an area the locals call The Mountain that overlooks the lake-side steel town below. The view from 31 Colquhoun Cres., is an unobstructed vista of the city; it feels like your own private lookout point.
"The view is unbeatable," Ms. Zhao said. "If you're sitting in the back living room you can see the view from sunrise to sunset; it's like a painting. Once I moved in I saw it's not just the daytime, there's a huge balcony off the master bedroom and even at midnight you see this stunning, phenomenal view of the city."
What really brought Ms. Zhao to the area was education: The private school she enrolled her children in (Hillfield Strathallan College) is literally just down the street.
Ms. Zhao is from Nanning, China, in Guangxi province (near the Vietnam border), where her husband operates an organic agriculture business. She says she moved to Canada 11 years ago to give her children a Canadian education: "We wanted them to experience a different education than what's in China, to broaden their knowledge of the world," she said.
The plan may have worked too well. "I believe they like Canada more," Ms. Zhao said, and offers that she also prefers the weather here to back home. "I'm originally from the southern part of China; it's humid and hot and like summer 90 per cent of the year."
In normal years her husband would visit Canada four or five times, but since the pandemic began almost two years ago they haven't been able to see each other in person.
"It's been a big impact," she said. "Thankfully, with modern technology, every day we can Facetime or Zoom. It helps a lot."
Her youngest child is 6, and her oldest is just heading off to university, so Ms. Zhao has decided it's time to downsize to something a little more manageable than the almost 13,000 square feet of living space (including the basement) at 31 Colquhoun Cres.
THE HOUSE TODAY The most critical detail of the house is that it has been completely renovated inside. The exterior structure is mostly intact from when she bought it four years ago, said Ms. Zhao, but inside, "no corner was spared, including the layout which was totally changed."
"The old layout had a lot of irregular shapes; I wanted to make the house functional and I tried to make everything rectangular and square," said Ms. Zhao, whose English is limited, so her realtor Lan Burgess assists in translating.
"She is super organized," Ms. Burgess said about her client, who she said spent close to $2-million on the extensive interior updates.
The result is a main floor done almost entirely in white, with oversized tile flooring in all the hallways with engineered hardwood in most of the adjoining rooms. Through the double doors (which are framed by an oversized arch of windows) is a soaring two-storey atrium with a coffered ceiling and stairs with blackstained wood treads climbing to the second level.
To the right is a large office with view of the front garden; on the left is a formal dining room with a butler's pantry that leads toward the kitchen in the rear.
Straight ahead is a sitting room/entertaining space that also stretches up two storeys (which is open to an upstairs walkway between the living quarters) with a fireplace centred between two floor-to-ceiling windows. On the left, is the large eatin kitchen.
A painted-blue central island with brass faucets and hardware anchors the kitchen with white pantry walls off each end, behind which is the huge gas range with enormous single-slab porcelain backsplash that runs up to the oversized fan hood.
The eating area sits across from the island next to a window wall and a set of glass French doors that open to a raised patio in the rear. A step down from the kitchen is a den/sun room with a TV and another coffered ceiling and another window wall facing the lower patio and pool deck. Standing on that patio, those views once again can't be beat.
Tucked away behind the kitchen is a set of stairs leading up to what might have once been servants' quarters and is today a large playroom (her youngest's favourite space). Unlike the mainly white-walled house, this space has whimsical blue and green paint shades that alternate on almost every angle of the dormers and walls. There's a powder room here, but it's separated from the rest of this level's rooms by a short hallway.
Past an upstairs laundry (there's also laundry in the finished basement, next to an in-law suite) is a hallway that connects the four bedrooms on this level.
The house is big enough that each of these bedrooms could be a primary suite in another house. They all have walk-in closets and their own ensuite bathrooms, though the two at the far end of the hall (past the overlook balcony) are the smaller of the four. The third bedroom is quite large; that's for the university-bound senior child, and features its own separate office space.
The true primary bedroom is at the rear of the house and can't really be mistaken once you see it. A huge bedroom with that $5-million dollar view curves to the left to a large den with fireplace and access to the balcony overlooking the pool and the city. Just off this is a large ensuite bathroom (done in black and white like the rest of the house) with a black standalone soaker tub on one side of the double vanity and glassed-in shower on the other. Behind the bed is an oversized walk-in closet/ dressing room filled with custom cabinets.
The finished basement has the in-law suite (there's also a mainfloor bedroom tucked away near the mudroom that could serve as a nanny suite).
The main area is a huge family space with stone wall with electric fireplace. There's also a bar area, billiards room, library, gym and a bathroom with a cedar-walled sauna and separate shower.
FAVOURITE SPACE Ms. Zhao at first suggests she most prefers the study inside the house. But as the conversation progresses, her true passion emerges: The garden which extends almost 100 feet from the street and covers almost an acre of land.
When she was renovating the house she hired a landscaper, but was ultimately unsatisfied with the result and set about re-doing it herself.
"Another reason she and the neighbours get along is they appreciate the work she's done," Ms. Burgess said. "She can point out a dozen different trees she planted - lavender, cherry trees - it's amazing. She'll be cutting branches and digging while chatting with me on the phone."
Ms. Zhao admits she can spend anywhere between three to five hours a day gardening. "I hope the next family are like me and really take care of the property and make it even better," she said. "I put a lot of thought into making it beautiful and functional."

Full text: CFA, proposition sales specialist at Refinitiv, covering research and portfolio management sales WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?
Companies that perform well during periods of growing inflation, with a focus on companies within the food and staples retailing industry.
THE SCREEN Recent updates from two of Canada's key economic indicators signal that the effects of the pandemic are starting take a toll on the country's economic outlook.
Firstly, Canada's annual inflation rate rose to 4.1 per cent in August, the highest seen in 18 years.
In addition, recent data from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. show the seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts fell 3.9 per cent in August compared with the previous month. Investors are questioning what options they have to ensure their portfolio returns remain unscathed.
Consumer staples is one of two sectors that have historically fared well during high inflationary periods (the other is financials). Consumer staples tends to perform better than other sectors because demand for these products stays consistent even as prices rise. Today our focus is on companies within the food and staples retailing industry.
There are several ways to measure whether companies in these industries can remain stable during high inflationary periods; today we'll use free cash flow and Refinitiv's proprietary StarMine Relative Valuation Model.
First, we screen for Canadianlisted food and staples companies with a market capitalization exceeding $1-billion.
Next, we screen for companies with a Relative Valuation (RV) Model score of 60 or higher.
The RV Model score is a percentile (1 to 100) ranking of stocks based on price and enterprise value (EV) ratios. The RV Model combines information from six prominent valuation measures relevant in most equities: EV-tosales; EV/EBITDA; price-to-earnings; price-to-cash flow from operating activities; price-to-book; and dividend yield. (EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.) It should be noted the RV Model is highly predictive regarding the relative movement in the company's stock price.
Lastly, we screen for companies with a free cash flow yield over the past 12 months of 6 per cent or more. This ratio compares the free cash flow per share that a company has earned, on average, over the past year against its stock price. A higher figure means a company is generating enough cash to satisfy its continuing obligations and investors are receiving a good return on the money they've invested. Food and staples retailers that can maintain a higher ratio demonstrate they can sustain margins even as the cost of food production increases in a period of high inflation.
MORE ABOUT REFINITIV Refinitiv, a London Stock Exchange Group business, is one of the world's largest providers of financial market data and infrastructure, serving more than 40,000 institutions worldwide.
Refinitiv provides information, insights, and technology that drive innovation and performance in global financial markets, enabling the financial community to trade smarter and faster, overcome regulatory challenges, and scale intelligently.
WHAT WE FOUND The screen ranked by StarMine's Relative Valuation model produced five companies. Here are two of note: North West Co. Inc. scored the highest in the screen with a Relative Valuation Model score of 87.
The retailer has a network of stores under various banners operating in Northern and Western Canada, as well as Alaska, the South Pacific islands and the Caribbean. North West has largely benefited from a pandemic-driven sales boost; recent secondquarter earnings came in well above expectations.
However, CIBC World Markets has suggested sales may struggle as vaccination rates increase in rural communities and residents can travel to shop outside of their local market. Nonetheless, throughout the pandemic, management has gained useful insight into customer demand and price sensitivity; it hopes the investments made into product and pricing will help the company hold on to market share gains.
George Weston Ltd., which scored second on the list with a RV Model of 83, is a holding company engaged in food processing and distribution business.
It operates through its three operating segments, Loblaw Cos.
Ltd., Choice Properties Real Estate Investment Trust and Weston Foods. Weston has fared well even as the pandemic rolls on, with a total return of 38 per cent over the past year.
Loblaw, which itself appears on our list with an RV Model score of 71, generates the majority of Weston's profits.
Loblaw's 30 per cent gross margin is substantially higher than its peers, which helps explain Weston's 14.7 per cent free cash flow yield.
Investors are advised to do their own research before trading in any of the securities shown.

In many past elections, the lament from those in the province has been that the sheer number of voters east of Manitoba has seen the winner decided before ballots are even counted on Canada's West Coast, leaving Westerners wondering if their issues or their votes mattered much.
But in this contest, polling has shown a tight race, and that Canadians are now worrying about the same concerns that drove the results of the last two B.C.
elections, including the contest just last year.
A national Angus Reid poll at the end of August found climate change remained the most important issue for one in five Canadians surveyed, with it ranking among the top two issues for voters under the age of 55.
Max Cameron, a political scientist at the University of British Columbia, said climate was undoubtedly top of mind for people living in a province that just experienced another "hellish" season of forest fires; a heat dome that killed hundreds of people; and the largest act of disobedience in Canadian history, with more than 1,040 people arrested during protests over old-growth logging at Fairy Creek.
B.C. has been the stronghold of the Green Party, electing the party's first MP and first MLA on platforms focused on battling climate change. Climate issues have been at the centre of provincial campaigns as far back as 2008, when the BC Liberals successfully campaigned on their move to bring in North America's first carbon tax.
But the Greens suffered several key setbacks. In June, New Brunswick Green MP Jenica Atwin crossed the floor to join the Liberals and, earlier this month, former BC Green Party leader Andrew Weaver endorsed the Liberal Party as well, calling it "the only credible science-aligned climate plan put forward by any political party at the federal level to date."
"This was a real chance for the Greens to make gains, but they were disadvantaged in a variety of ways, including some self-inflicted harm," Prof. Cameron said, referencing the party's political infighting and leader Annamie Paul's turbulent tenure.
The 2019 election delivered two Greens to the House of Commons, along with 17 Conservatives and 11 each for the Liberals and the NDP. Former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould was elected as an independent. (She did not run in this campaign.)
Young Canadian voters, those between the ages of 18 and 34, told Angus Reid affordable housing was one of their top concerns. All three parties have acknowledged the country's housing crisis with promises to address the increasing demand for affordable places to live, as well as measures to ensure new accommodations - whether rental or owned - get built. If the new government lives up to its promises, it will represent the most aggressive involvement of the federal government in housing in decades.
"I love the feds being back into housing. All three parties are interested in housing. It feels like the feds are running the campaign we had back in B.C.
in 2017," B.C. Housing Minister David Eby said.
All of the parties, though, were vague about how they would meet these goals given significant obstacles, especially a quagmire at the municipal level in getting zoning and permitting done swiftly.
Results from the Liberals' efforts to execute on their housing promises from 2019 shows there should have been 64,000 new homes built after four years of that government's housing strategy.
Available statistics suggest only about half that were actually created.
Paul Kershaw, a professor at UBC who founded the Generation Squeeze group aimed at increasing the equity in society for younger people, likened the rising cost of residential real estate across the country to an escalator. He said the major parties have articulated ways in which they are trying to slow that escalator down, but none have said they want to stall it. That remains unpalatable to the party leaders because of the massive windfall many older voters have enjoyed over the past decade as the value of their homes has skyrocketed.
"You need to be willing to have a hard conversation," he said.
During Mr. Trudeau's visits to B.C., which included stops in Vancouver, Saanich, Surrey and Steveston, the Liberal Leader promised investments in wildfire firefighter resources and longterm care homes.
Erin O'Toole held a rally in Nanaimo, on Vancouver Island and visited the Vancouver area. His campaign encountered one of its biggest controversies while Mr. O'Toole was in the province, when he was forced to walk back a platform promise to rescind a ban on certain weapons.
NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who is running for re-election in his BurnabySouth riding, made more campaign stops in B.C. than any other leader.

Full text: Faced with a growing affordability crisis, Berlin will ask voters this month to consider a radical housing decision: whether or not to evict the city's biggest landlords and transfer 240,000 rental units to public ownership.
After collecting nearly 350,000 signatures, Berlin housing activists secured a referendum to be held alongside Germany's national and state elections on Sept. 26. Voters will be asked whether the city should invoke a rarely used article of the German constitution to expropriate corporate landlords owning 3,000 or more units, including the country's largest, Deutsche Wohnen, and Stockholm-based Akelius, which also owns properties in Montreal and Toronto.
Even if the referendum passes, the expropriation would face numerous political and legal challenges. But the campaign is shedding light on a rentalaffordability crisis that has echoes of the situation in Canada, where party platforms have largely focused on home ownership ahead of Monday's federal election.
"Every city is experiencing this rapid rise in the cost of housing - especially for renters," said Leilani Farha, an Ottawa-based former UN special rapporteur on the right to housing who now runs a housing research and advocacy group called The Shift. The Berlin referendum, she said, "has provided a vehicle for it to become a public conversation."
It's been a little more than three decades since the German city was cleft by a wall that symbolized the Cold War, with state-owned apartment blocks dotting Communist East Berlin.
Though the city's first years after reunification were once famously described as "cheap but sexy," Berlin's appeal as a global capital has belatedly bestowed it with swaths of new citizens, prompting demand that sent rents soaring.
The city's average rent has doubled since 2008, according to the housingsearch provider Immowelt.de.
"That is a problem for renters, because their rent doesn't just pay for the buildings, but for dividends to shareholders," said Jonas Becker, a spokesperson for the group behind the referendum, Deutsche Wohnen & Co.
Enteignen.
The campaign's mauve-andyellow signs are scattered throughout Berlin alongside ads for candidates seeking seats in Germany's next government. Mr. Becker spoke with The Globe and Mail this month as thousands marched through central Berlin in protest of rising rents, many of them wearing vests and carrying flags bearing the same colours.
Berlin sold off 200,000 units of public housing in the first 25 years after the wall fell, and corporate landlords began taking an increased interest in the city following the financial crisis of the late 2000s, as many investors diversified into new asset classes.
Mr. Becker said he pays the equivalent of $30 per square metre for his apartment in the city's northwest. The campaign, which has more than a thousand volunteers, is asking for Berlin to set a rental price of $6.05 per square metre for new public housing if the referendum succeeds.
Joanna Kusiak, a referendum campaigner and University of Cambridge research fellow who studies progressive housing movements, said the campaign is unprecedented globally. "You have a grassroots initiative that is trying to leverage a national legal framework to tackle the global financialization of the housing market," she said.
Success will not come easily.
The campaign believes the government should buy the units for about $15-billion, but the city has said it might cost as much as $54billion - closer to the units' market value. As proposed, the purchase would be covered by loans, which could be paid via rental income.
And though the city government imposed a five-year rent freeze last year, it was struck down in April by Germany's top court, which found that the decision infringed upon federal law.
If passed, the expropriation referendum could face similar challenges.
Jakob Hans Hien, a Berlin lawyer who represents some commercial landlords, pointed out that Berlin's constitution lacks the same expropriation measures that Germany's contains, which could throw a successful referendum into jurisdictional disarray. And expropriation, he said, is generally meant to be a last-resort decision; it might be easier for the city to buy stakes in the companies that own the units instead.
The political and legal wrangling of following through with the expropriation, Mr. Hien said, "would lead to chaos, deepen our problems and not help at all."
But even if the grandest ambitions of the referendum don't succeed, Ms. Farha said, the result could force governments to respond more strongly to the rental crisis: "When movements get more radical, it pushes politicians."
Asked to comment, Deutsche Wohnen provided a statement arguing that Berlin's biggest housing issue is low supply, not the concentrated ownership of existing units.
Most of Canada's cities are designed far differently than Berlin, with a greater emphasis on single-family homes than mid-rise apartment buildings. Still, as of 2018, more than one in four Canadians was a renter, said Statistics Canada, and according to a recent Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation report on income inequality, the price of a two-bedroom apartment doubled between 1992 and 2016.
The decreasing affordability of housing has left many Canadians without homes at all, leading to encampments in public spaces in cities such as Toronto and Halifax, which have prompted tense, sometimes violent clashes with police and few long-term solutions from local politicians.
Yet Canadians will have few options as drastic as Berliners do as they head to polls on Monday.
The Liberals have promised affordable housing investments, a rent-to-own program and "policies to curb excessive profits" for corporate landlords. They've also promised incentives to convert office space into rental housing, while reviewing the tax treatment of corporate landlords. The Conservatives, meanwhile, are pledging to offload at least 15 per cent of federally owned real estate for housing while making it easier for landowners to donate their property to land trusts for affordable housing.
All three leading federal parties have promised to build or repair a million or more new units - of which the New Democrats say at least 500,000 would be affordable homes. The NDP has also promised to launch incentives to encourage the construction of affordable housing while making mortgages more flexible for firsttime buyers.
Still, Ms. Farha, whose research focuses on the financialization of the housing market, called the platforms "underwhelming' with "too much emphasis on home ownership."

Full text: HEALTH CARE LIBERAL PARTY OF CANADA A re-elected Liberal government would spend an additional $6-billion to help address health care wait times.
The Liberals would also spend $3.2-billion to help provinces and territories hire 7,500 new family doctors, nurses and nurse practitioners and $400-million over four years to improve access to virtual care. The party is also pledging to incentivize health professionals to practise in underserved rural areas by increasing the maximum debt relief under the Canada Student Loans forgiveness program to $60,000 from $40,000 in the next five years and would make dentists, pharmacists, midwives and early childhood educators eligible for debt relief. The party's platform includes a promise to cut back health transfer payments to provinces that allow extra billing for publicly insured services.
The Liberals would also create new regulations under the Canada Health Act to underscore the need for access to sexual and reproductive services across the country and would deny charity status to anti-abortion organizations such as crisis pregnancy centres. Justin Trudeau is pledging to create new mental-health transfers, and the party is promising a range of initiatives to address the opioid crisis, including $500-million for treatment programs. The Liberals would also create a national longterm care act to improve conditions in such facilities, provide 10 days of paid sick leave and develop a national school nutrition program.
CONSERVATIVE PARTY OF CANADA A Conservative government would increase health care funding by $60-billion over the next decade, but only $3.6-billion of that would arrive in the next five years. The party is also pledging to create a national mental-health plan that would ask the provinces to dedicate a portion of health care funding to mental-health initiatives. And employers that offer mental-health coverage would receive a tax credit for 25 per cent of the cost for the first three years. The party also wants to create a three-digit suicide prevention hotline. The Conservatives would also increase employment insurance benefits for seriously ill individuals to 52 weeks from 26. Erin O'Toole has promised his government would protect the conscience rights of health care workers by allowing them to refuse abortion care or medical assistance in dying - but those workers would still have to refer patients to another provider. Also, a Conservative government would restore the 10-day waiting period for anyone who requests medical assistance in dying and would also reinstate the requirement for two independent witnesses to ensure an individual is not being coerced, along with a number of other changes. Mr. O'Toole has promised to spend $325million over the next three years to create 1,000 residential drug treatment beds and build 50 recovery community centres.
NEW DEMOCRATIC PARTY If elected, the NDP would introduce a national pharmacare program. The party is also emphasizing its commitment to a public health care system and working with provinces to improve wait times, as well as improving access to virtual care. The party wants to improve Canada's pandemic response to deal with future threats and develop a federal vaccination strategy. The NDP would also eliminate private, for-profit nursing homes and create national standards for long-term care. In addition, the party would create a universal dental care program and provide public coverage for mental-health services, eye and ear care and fertility services. To address the opioid crisis, the NDP would end the criminalization of drug addiction and provide a regulated alternative to street drugs. The party also supports supervised drug-use sites.
GREEN PARTY OF CANADA The Greens would create a national pharmacare program and expand universal health care to include longterm care and improved access to mental-health services. The party would also increase provincial health transfers based on demographics and health needs. The Greens are promising to negotiate with provinces and territories to prioritize access to mental-health and rehabilitation services, as well as access to abortion care and gender-affirming health services. The party would change Health Canada's mandate to focus on mental health and addiction, health promotion, disease prevention and the risks of climate change. The party's platform pledges a number of initiatives, such as banning neonicotinoid pesticides and toxic ingredients in personal care products. The Greens would decriminalize the possession of drugs for personal use, ensure access to a safe supply of drugs and increase funding for community organizations to test street drugs. The platform also emphasizes the need to expand access to virtual care and telemedicine.
BLOC QUÉBÉCOIS The Bloc wants to improve domestic production of vaccines and personal protective equipment. The party would prioritize the negotiation of lower drug prices, improve paid sick leave and increase health transfers to all provinces and territories.
PEOPLE'S PARTY OF CANADA The PPC is campaigning on a promise to replace cash health transfers with a permanent transfer of tax points of equivalent value to all provinces and territories.
CHILD CARE LIBERALS Affordable and expanded child care is a centrepiece of the Liberal platform, with the party highlighting its plan in the April budget to give the provinces and territories $29.8-billion for child care through to fiscal 2025-26.
That promise (a feature of Liberal platforms since 1993) aims to expand the number of subsidized spaces and reduce fees by 50 per cent in 2022, on its way to reducing out-of-pocket costs to an average of $10 a day in 2025-26.
CONSERVATIVES The Tories are proposing refundable tax credits that would replace both the Liberal subsidies and the existing tax deduction for child-care expenses, which has been criticized for favouring wealthier families. The cost of those credits - $2.6-billion over five years - would be far less than the $29.8-billion the Liberals propose to spend on child care over that same period; however, the Conservatives say they have subtracted the $1.5-billion annual expense of the existing tax deduction and are counting on increased labour force participation in their $2.6-billion estimate. Otherwise, the total cost of the Tory plan would be closer to the Liberal outlay.
NDP The New Democrats are again promising cheaper, universal child care. The party has not provided costing or other specifics beyond saying it wants to implement a "$10 a day child care system that's there for all parents."
GREENS There are few specifics in the party's platform, but the Greens say they would implement affordable, universal child care in partnership with the provinces and others, as well as gradually increasing federal spending on child care to 1 per cent of GDP.
BLOC The Bloc does not have much to say about national child care. But the party says it would push Ottawa for the $6-billion earmarked for Quebec under the Liberal child-care plan. The Quebec-based party has consistently said it wants federal transfers to be free of conditions.
PPC No policy beyond promising to reverse new spending programs announced by the Liberals - which presumably includes the billions of dollars earmarked for child care.
CLIMATE TARGETS AND HOW TO MEET THEM LIBERALS In government, the Liberals pledged to reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions to 40-45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Their strategy involves the country's carbon price steadily rising to $170 per tonne by the end of the decade (with accompanying rebates rising as well) and an array of complementary programs, such as the $8-billion industrial decarbonization fund in this year's budget. Their biggest new climate promise in this election campaign is the proposed requirement that at least 50 per cent of passenger-vehicle sales be electric by 2030, supported by an extension of EV purchase rebates and increased spending on charging infrastructure. Other new commitments include an expanded strategy to make buildings more energy efficient, a net-zero power grid by 2035 and new tax credits to subsidize renewable electricity generation and clean technologies.
CONSERVATIVES The Conservatives say they would return Canada to its previous target of a 30-per-cent reduction in emissions by 2030. Although they no longer oppose carbon pricing outright, they would dramatically scale it back - pledging to cap the fuel charge paid by most fossil fuel consumers at $50 per tonne, while switching from the current system of rebates to one in which every payment would go into a personalized "low-carbon savings account." They, too, are promising an EV sales quota - 30 per cent of 2030 new vehicle sales - but have made no promises regarding rebates. They are similarly committed to a building retrofit strategy. One area where they would go beyond current government policy is requiring a 20-per-cent reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels sold domestically, up from 13 per cent under the federal Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Another is an additional $3-billion for natural climate solutions, with a focus on working with farmers.
NDP The New Democrats are calling for Canada's emissions-reduction commitment to be raised to 50 per cent by 2030. Their platform is less detailed than that of the Liberals or Conservatives in terms of explicit spending or regulatory planks. Among their more specific proposals are the addition of carbon budgets to federal climate accountability legislation, which would allocate permissible emissions by sector over multiyear periods; a 2030 target for a net-zero power grid; and the creation of a civilian climate corps, to enlist young people for conservation efforts. The NDP is also more pointed than the other parties about favouring domestic industries when making climate investments, including larger sales rebates for EVs made in Canada.
GREENS The Greens have the most ambitious 2030 emissions-reduction target: 60 per cent.
They are the only party to advocate raising the carbon price more sharply than the current plan dictates. They also propose ending the sale of gas-powered personal vehicles entirely by 2030 and introducing a buyback program for existing ones. They propose roughly quadrupling Canada's climate financing to developing countries to US$4-billion annually. Like the NDP, they suggest the introduction of carbon budgets and a civilian climate corps. And while the Liberals, Tories and NDP all express interest in tariffs (known as carbon border adjustments) on some carbon-intensive imports, the Greens are unequivocal about imposing them.
BLOC The Bloc's platform does not set an emissions-reduction target for 2030, nor does it feature a comprehensive set of climate promises. Almost all the green policies it does propose are designed to benefit Quebec, especially by promoting or protecting the province's abundance of hydroelectricity. It calls for the formula for equalization payments to benefit provinces with relatively low emissions, proposes funding to expand Quebec's electricity sector while warning against any efforts to impose interprovincial transmission onto it and demands that Ottawa stop subsidizing large auto makers in Ontario and direct more funding to clean-tech companies in Quebec instead.
PPC The PPC rejects the science of climate change and would reverse all significant government policies aimed at reducing emissions.
OVERVIEW: THE PARTIES LIBERALS: When he triggered this election, Justin Trudeau declared that it would be a performance review of his government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the government brought in billions in social benefits for Canadians. If he wins a majority this time, he will have more room to act on the economic recovery, implement a national child-care system and continue its plan to bring Canada to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
CONSERVATIVES: Leader Erin O'Toole hopes to break through against the Liberals in ways his predecessor, Andrew Scheer, failed to do in 2019.
That's involved serious policy shifts on climate change (the party once opposed carbon pricing, but Mr. O'Toole supports a form of it) and distancing itself from social-conservative stands on same-sex marriage.
NDP: The support of Jagmeet Singh's socialist party has been critical to the Trudeau government on budgets, pandemic policy and more.
They're in third place in the polls and are aiming to gain ground so they can continue to hold influence in a minority parliament.
BLOC QUÉBÉCOIS: The once-ailing separatist party had a good year in 2019, taking 32 out of Quebec's 78 seats. After two years of challenging the Trudeau government on confidence motions, Leader Yves-François Blanchet's goal this time is to hammer Quebec-specific wedge issues that will allow it to hold those seats.
GREENS: The environmentalist party came out of the previous election with three seats, but by 2021 it had only two, and a new leader, Annamie Paul, struggling to contain internal feuds over racism and Middle East policy. Ms. Paul has spent most of the campaign in the Toronto riding she hopes to win.
PEOPLE'S PARTY: Founded by former cabinet minister Maxime Bernier, this far-right populist party won no seats in its 2019 debut and got just 1.6 of the popular vote.
Party-preference polls in this campaign have shown it doing as well or better than the Greens, but it's faced criticism for spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines and being endorsed by white-nationalist groups for its anti-immigration policies.
FOREIGN POLICY LIBERALS The Liberals promise to establish a "Canadian Centre for Peace, Order and Good Government" to expand the availability of Canadian expertise and assistance to countries seeking to advance justice, promote human rights, inclusion and democracy and deliver good governance. They would establish Canada as a safe haven for people fleeing political or security crises, especially human-rights defenders, journalists, feminists, LGBTQ2 activists or members of religious or ethnic minorities at risk. In that vein, they would enable staff at Canada's embassies around the world to support the work of feminists and LGBTQ2 and human-rights activists by quadrupling the annual investment in the Canada Fund for Local Initiatives, which funds projects in developing countries. They would also help establish an international anti-corruption court; donate at least 200 million vaccine doses to vulnerable populations around the world through the COVAX initiative by the end of 2022; launch a comprehensive Asia-Pacific strategy to deepen diplomatic, economic and defence partnerships in the region; introduce legislation to eradicate forced labour from Canadian supply chains and ensure that Canadian businesses operating abroad are not contributing to human-rights abuses; and work with Group of Seven, NATO and like-minded partners to develop and expand collective responses to arbitrary detention, economic coercion, cyberthreats, foreign interference in democratic processes and egregious violations of human rights.
CONSERVATIVES The Tories would shift Canada's international trade priorities away from China and toward other countries in the Indo-Pacific and Africa. As part of this, they would pursue a Canada-Australia-New Zealand-United Kingdom ("CANZUK") free trade deal that includes the free flow of capital investment between partner countries, enhanced defence and security partnerships and expanded intelligence co-operation. They also pledge deeper ties with India, including a free trade deal and investment treaty. They would pass a foreign agents registry act for individuals and companies acting as agents of foreign principals (country, corporation, entity or individual) in a political or quasi-political capacity, including lobbying, policy development, advertising, and grassroots mobilization. They would work with allies to address efforts by China, Russia, Iran and others actively undermining democratic norms, institutions and the rule of law. They would also advance the idea of an international anti-corruption court; pass legislation mandating an office of religious freedom and conscience to promote and protect freedom of thought and conscience as outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; pursue reform of the UN Human Rights Council to prohibit gross human-rights abusers from becoming members and stop the council from singling out Israel for criticism; withdraw from the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank; ban Huawei from Canada's 5G infrastructure and further investigate the company's role in providing surveillance technology used against the Uyghur minority in China; and grant asylum to mainland Chinese proponents of freedom, as well as persecuted minorities such as Tibetans, Falun Gong practitioners and others.
NDP An NDP government would "stand up to China with a strong and coherent strategy to defend Canadian interests at home and abroad." The NDP says it would work with allies on a "co-ordinated international response to China's disregard of the rule of law" and "call out human-rights abuses by China, stand with Hong Kong pro-democracy asylum seekers, and provide coordinated support for those facing threats by Chinese entities here in Canada." The NDP would also boost Canada's international development assistance, with the goal of contributing 0.7 per cent of this country's gross national income to international aid. They also pledge to support the waiving of intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines and ensure the necessary transfer of technology "so that low-income countries can start making vaccines locally." They would also "contribute more to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to end these epidemics and support heath care systems in developing countries."
GREENS The Green Party says it would sign and ratify the Treaty to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, which more than 60 countries, including Canada and most NATO member states, have refused to sign. It would cease all federal support to Canadian exporters of arms and fossil fuels, with the exception of potential necessary sales of peacekeeping equipment in co-operation with the United Nations. It would lead an international discussion to define "environmental refugee," include it as a category of refugees accepted into Canada and grant asylum to an "appropriate share." It would pursue fair trade policies that prioritize the protection of human rights, labour standards, cultural diversity and ecosystems. The Greens say they would strengthen the mandate and tools available to the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise to independently investigate the conduct of Canadian companies operating abroad and report publicly on its findings. They also promise to lead international discussions to reform the Agreement on TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights to ensure that "intellectual property rights are not barriers to the achievement and furtherance of international human rights and clean development."
BLOC The Bloc does not seek to govern Canada - it only runs candidates in Quebec - but has goals for Quebec's international relations. The party's platform says the Bloc adheres to the Gérin-Lajoie doctrine, first formulated in 1965, which says Quebec should conduct its own international relations - including signing treaties - in areas under its jurisdiction, such as education and culture. The Bloc would like to see Canada obliged to obtain consent from Quebec before taking international positions on any issue within Quebec's jurisdiction. The party also calls for Canada to stop selling military goods to Saudi Arabia because of that country's intervention in the war in Yemen, where the Saudis are accused of killing civilians.
PPC The PPC pledges to withdraw from all United Nations commitments that "threaten our sovereignty," calling the UN a "dysfunctional organization where non-democratic countries, because of their large numbers, have the most influence." It says it has no interest in seeing the UN "grow into a more powerful quasi-world government." It would withdraw from UN agreements such as the Global Compact on Migration and the Paris Agreement on climate change and "reduce our presence in UN institutions to a minimum." The PPC would also end development aid to foreign countries by phasing it out and focusing Canadian international assistance "exclusively on emergency humanitarian action in cases such as health crises, major conflicts and natural disasters." INDIGENOUS ISSUES LIBERALS The Liberals say they would move ahead on reconciliation with Indigenous peoples by confronting the legacy of residential schools and launching an Indigenous urban, rural and northern housing strategy. The party also says it would make "any investments necessary" to eliminate all remaining long-term drinking water advisories for First Nations - after previously promising to eliminate them all by March, 2021 - and are promising $6-billion to ensure access to clean drinking water for all First Nations.
CONSERVATIVES The Conservatives also say they recognize safe drinking water as a fundamental human right and would end long-term drinking-water advisories. They say they would work with Indigenous communities to find new approaches to the issue. The party has also pledged to take other steps, such as enacting a "For Indigenous, By Indigenous" housing strategy. Their platform also includes a promise to work with Indigenous people to create a "Canadian Indigenous Enterprise Corporation" for resource development.
NDP In its platform, the NDP says it would fully implement the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 94 calls to action. The party also says it would work with Indigenous peoples to co-develop a national plan for reconciliation.
It says it would establish, through legislation, a national council for reconciliation to "provide oversight and accountability for this process, reporting regularly to Parliament and Canadians." The party also says it would pursue negotiations on issues such as self-government, education, housing and health.
GREENS The Green party's platform promises to support the Indigenous-led protection of conservation areas and to fund the stewardship of lands and waters by Indigenous guardians. It also promises to establish a "For Indigenous, By Indigenous" housing support program for all off-reserve and urban Indigenous communities. On drinking water, the Greens promise to end all boil-water advisories. And the party says it would protect the traditional fishing rights of Indigenous people, including the right to engage in fishing in pursuit of a moderate livelihood.
BLOC The Bloc's platform proposes working with Indigenous communities to strengthen and guarantee their inherent rights.
The party says it would ensure the federal government fully implements the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It also says it would abolish the Indian Act and believes in the inherent right of Indigenous communities to self-govern.
PPC The PPC says Indigenous issues are complex and that many Indigenous people suffer from social issues, including homelessness, crime, domestic violence, substance abuse and suicide. It also cites other major issues, including the legacy of residential schools, and says it is not possible to address more than a few of those issues in the context of an election platform. It says its approach would be guided by the principles of respect, freedom, fairness and responsibility.
GUN CONTROL LIBERALS A Liberal government would continue its crackdown on magazine-fed semi-automatic rifles by introducing a buyback program. Owners will be able to sell their guns or have them rendered permanently inoperable. Other measures would ban magazines capable of being modified to hold more than five rounds, set aside $1-billion for jurisdictions that ban handguns and increase the maximum penalty for gun smuggling from 10 to 14 years.
CONSERVATIVES Mr. O'Toole has shifted his position on last year's federal ban on some semi-automatic rifles. While his platform says he would repeal the ban, Mr. O'Toole stated recently that he would keep it in place. Conservative Party gun proposals focus on a review and replacement of the current firearms classification system. The platform proposes increasing penalties for gun smugglers, expanding RCMP border enforcement teams and stiffening punishments for people who commit gun crimes while prohibited from possessing a firearm. Another proposal goes after so-called straw purchasers - licensed gun owners who buy firearms legally before selling them on the black market - by requiring anyone who transfers more than three guns a year to get a business licence.
NDP Firearms policy warrants a single paragraph in the NDP platform. The party vows to keep assault weapons and illegal handguns "off our streets" while addressing gun smuggling, organized crime and gang violence.
GREENS The party platform does not mention guns, but Ms. Paul said during the second French-language debate that she favours banning all "assault firearms" and tackling root causes of crime such as poverty and homelessness.
BLOC The Bloc proposes adding a category to the Criminal Code with a precise definition of an "assault weapon" in order to ban all such firearms. It says a buyback program must be mandatory but must also respect the rights of law-abiding hunters. And it wants to see more weapons intercepted at the border.
PPC The PPC would replace the Firearms Act "with new legislation that will prioritize effective measures to improve public safety and fight crime" replace the current licensing system with a lifetime certification system; simplify the firearms classification system to eliminate what it calls "ineffective restrictions" repeal the federal cabinet's 2020 ban on about 1,500 types of firearms; and "mandate that all future changes to firearms regulation be completed through Parliament only."
HOUSING The three leading parties agree that the country has a shortage of affordable housing. Each party has promised to increase the supply and make it easier for young Canadians to buy a home. They agree on the need for a federal registry of beneficial owners of property, and each has a plan to make it harder for foreigners to buy residential property.
Here is where they differ: LIBERALS The party would cut the federal mortgage insurance rate by 25 per cent for home buyers with down payments of less than 20 per cent; create a new tax-free savings account for first-time home buyers; increase the rebate on closing costs for first-time home buyers; and fund a $1-billion program for rent-to-own projects. The party would also create a new home-renovation tax credit for families adding a secondary unit for a live-in family member. They would also give home buyers more consumer protections, such as banning blind bidding, which would require home sellers to disclose competing offers on their properties. And the party has promised to build or repair 1.4 million homes over the next four years and create a $4-billion fund to push Canada's largest cities to create 100,000 homes within three years.
CONSERVATIVES The party would "encourage" seven- and 10-year fixed mortgage terms in order to provide stability for first-time buyers; make it easier for homeowners to renew their mortgages with another lender; and provide tax incentives for owners of rental properties. The party said it would create one million homes over three years via proposals such as tying public transit funding to increased density and converting at least 15 per cent of the federal government's portfolio of buildings into housing.
NDP The party plans to lengthen the maximum mortgage amortization period to 30 years from 25 for insured mortgages on first-time home purchases; increase the rebate on closing costs for first-time home buyers; and provide struggling renters with subsidies of as much as $5,000. The party is promising 500,000 affordable homes over 10 years, which would rely on a funding mechanism to streamline the application process. And it promises to cut the GST on the construction of affordable units and use federal lands for some of the properties.
GREENS Most of the party's housing proposals target the creation of affordable housing.
It pledges to build a minimum of 300,000 affordable housing units over 10 years; make it easier to develop and support co-operative housing; and require federally funded housing developments to allocate 30 per cent of their units to affordable housing or make them available to people with disabilities and special needs. The party promises to revamp Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's mandate to focus on developing affordable and co-operative housing instead of providing mortgage insurance. The party also plans to extend the moratorium on evictions until the pandemic is over and raise the 1-per-cent vacant home tax for foreign owners who leave their properties unoccupied.
BLOC The Bloc proposes using federally owned properties to develop low-income housing and supports a tax on real estate speculation; but, unlike the other parties, does not make facilitating home ownership a priority - ostensibly because renting is more socially acceptable and common in Quebec than in other parts of the country.
PPC The party proposes tackling the housing crisis by slashing annual immigration levels to between 100,000 and 150,000 from the current goal of approximately 400,000. It plans to cut the Bank of Canada's inflation target to 0 per cent from 2 per cent, which it says would cool home price inflation. It would stop providing federal funds for social housing.
JOBS LIBERALS The Liberals are promising to extend the Canada Recovery Hiring Program until March. The program covers part of the cost of hiring back workers or increasing employees' hours for businesses that saw major revenue drops during the pandemic. The Liberals are tying job creation plans to child care, worker retraining and a push toward a low-carbon economy. The party's $10-aday child-care program is intended to bring more women into the work force while increasing the number of jobs in the child-care industry. The Liberals say they will create a $2-billion fund to retrain oil and gas workers for green jobs. And they promise to introduce a new EI benefit for self-employed Canadians that would provide assistance for up to 26 weeks.
CONSERVATIVES The Conservatives are promising something similar to the Canada Recovery Hiring Program. It would cover 50 per cent of the salaries of new hires for six months after the end of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy program in October. The party is also looking to spur job creation through a set of tax credits aimed at boosting business investment. That includes a 5-per-cent tax credit for investments in capital equipment over the next two years and a 25-per-cent tax credit for individual investments of as much as $100,000 in small businesses.
The Conservatives say they will require "gig economy companies" to make contributions equivalent to CPP and EI premiums to a new, portable "employee savings account."
NDP The NDP says it would continue to offer wage and rent subsidies for small businesses until they're "able to fully reopen." The party would also introduce a long-term hiring bonus to cover the employer portion of EI and CPP for new or rehired staff. The NDP jobs plan is geared toward "a low-carbon future," with the party promising to support jobs in energy-efficiency retrofitting, renewable energy and public transit. But the platform also focuses on manufacturing jobs, especially in the auto industry. The party is proposing a number of changes to employment insurance, including making EI available to people who quit their jobs to go back to school or to provide child care, and expanding EI for seasonal workers.
GREENS The Greens support extending wage and rent subsidies until pandemic-related restrictions are fully lifted. The party is focused on creating jobs in the green energy economy, with the aim of replacing "every high paying fossil fuel sector job with a high paying green sector job through wage insurance, retraining programs and early retirement plans."
BLOC The Bloc's main concern is federal transfers to Quebec for health care and support for struggling sectors such as tourism. Party leader Yves-François Blanchet is adamant that those transfers not come with strings attached.
PPC The PPC plan to boost employment involves cutting the corporate income tax rate to 10 per cent and eliminating taxes on personal capital gains. The idea is to leave more money in the hands of business owners so they can invest in productivity-enhancing equipment. The party says it would eliminate all government subsidies to businesses, including regional development grants and conditional loans and loan guarantees.
SMALL BUSINESS LIBERALS Early in the pandemic, the government created wage and rent subsidies to help businesses that lost revenue due to COVID-19.
Those subsidies are set to end on Oct. 23. If re-elected, the Liberals say they would keep up "temporary" wage and rent support just for the tourism sector, which has struggled with lockdowns and travel restrictions.
They would also extend the Canada Recovery Hiring Program, which began this summer to cover a portion of the costs of new hires.
The Liberals also say they would introduce a program promised in the spring budget to help small businesses with e-commerce. They also promise to finally move forward with a plan to lower credit card fees charged to merchants.
CONSERVATIVES The Tories' Canada Job Surge Plan would cover 25 per cent to 50 per cent of the salaries of new hires, depending on how long the employee was out of work. It would run for six months after the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy expires. The Conservatives have the only proposal aimed directly at the hard-hit food-service industry: a 50-per-cent rebate for Monday-to-Wednesday dine-in meals at restaurants for a single month. It was inspired by a program that ran in Prince Edward Island last year. For retailers, the party proposes a month-long GST holiday. And the Conservatives also propose a number of new loans and tax credits for small-business owners: a loan of as much as $200,000 (with up to 25 per cent of it forgivable, based on revenue losses); a 25-per-cent tax credit on as much as $100,000 personally invested in a small business; and a refundable tax credit for new capital investments.
NDP The New Democrats would extend the wage and rent subsidies indefinitely for small businesses - until they are fully reopened. The NDP also promises to pay the employer portion of EI and CPP premiums for new and rehired staff. The party would also cap the fees credit cards charge merchants on every transaction to 1 per cent from the current 1.4 per cent.
GREENS The Greens would also extend the wage and rent subsidies until all pandemic restrictions are lifted.
The party also proposes subsidizing the adoption of clean technology among small and medium-sized businesses and creating a $1-billion venture capital fund to support new green startups.
BLOC The Bloc platform says seasonal businesses, such as festivals and tourist spots, have lost two seasons because of the pandemic and need targeted assistance. And the party says the federal procurement strategy needs to change to favour small and medium-sized enterprises.
PPC The PPC platform does not specifically mention small business. In a statement, a spokesperson said the party would help small businesses by encouraging provinces to end all lockdowns and vaccine passports and by shrinking the size of the federal government.
TAXATION LIBERALS The party would implement a number of targeted tax increases, raising $25.5-billion in new revenues through to 2025-26 - although almost half that amount is supposed to come from stepped-up enforcement by the Canada Revenue Agency. The Liberals would increase the corporate income tax rate to 18 per cent from 15 per cent on earnings over $1-billion for banks and insurance companies. They would also levy a "Canada Recovery Dividend" on those businesses, raising $5.5-billion over four years. Tightening the rules for the federal minimum tax for individuals would raise $1.7-billion over five years. And the Liberals would tax vaping products, raising $395-million over five years. They would also boost a number of tax credits, most notably by expanding the Canada Caregiver Credit and turning it into a refundable benefit.
CONSERVATIVES There are no permanent broad-based tax changes in the Conservative platform, but there are a host of proposed credits and some targeted tax cuts. The biggest credit by far is the doubling of the Canada Workers Benefit for low-income individuals and families, a measure that would cost $5.8-billion a year by 2025-26.
Other measures include credits for construction workers, seniors care, mental-health benefits and expanding the Canada Child Benefit. The Conservatives do propose cutting taxes, but those measures are targeted or time-limited. They include extending the deferral of capital gains taxes for rental housing investments and credits for investments in small businesses. The closest the Tories come to a broad tax cut is their proposal for a one-month GST holiday in December for purchases at bricks-and-mortar retailers, carrying a price tag of $1.8-billion. They would also give the CRA additional funds to squeeze more money from tax dodgers.
NDP The party is proposing a wide range of tax increases that would raise $166.3-billion over five years, partly through more aggressive tax collection and cracking down on what the NDP calls tax havens.
Unlike the Liberals, the NDP is proposing broad-based tax increases, including boosting the top rate for individuals, scaling back the favourable tax treatment of capital gains, increasing corporate taxes and a levy on "excess profits" for this fiscal year. The party's single largest tax increase would be an annual wealth tax on households with a net worth of at least $10-million, a measure the NDP projects would raise $60.1-billion over five years.
The party is not proposing any tax reductions, although it would boost some tax credits and allow seniors receiving the Guaranteed Income Supplement to keep more of their benefits even as their incomes increase.
GREENS The Greens would introduce sweeping tax increases - ending favourable treatment of capital gains, boosting the corporate tax rate to 21 per cent and an annual wealth tax for households with a net worth of $20-million or more.
BLOC The Bloc supports a wealth tax and a real estate speculation tax, as well as cracking down on what it describes as tax avoidance by large companies. But its platform does not go beyond those broad statements.
PPC The PPC says it would eliminate targeted tax measures that do not serve a "compelling public policy purpose" and then, after erasing the federal deficit, implement broad-based reductions in personal income and capital gains taxes and corporate taxes.
DEFENCE LIBERALS The Liberals would work with the U.S. to modernize NORAD - upgrading the North Warning System, deploying new technology to improve surveillance and monitoring and improving command and control systems. They would work to root out all sources of antiIndigenous and anti-Black racism, LGBTQ2 prejudice, gender bias and white supremacy in the Canadian Armed Forces and implement the recommendations of the Advisory Panel on Systemic Racism. They would also expand the resources available to sexual assault survivors in the military through the Sexual Misconduct Response Centre and make these services available to all Department of National Defence employees, veterans and members of military families. They would implement the recommendations of the independent external comprehensive review led by former Supreme Court justice Louise Arbour to address sexual harassment and misconduct in the Canadian Armed Forces, including instituting external oversight and independence over the processes of reporting, investigating and adjudicating complaints, outside of the chain of command. The Liberals would also expand Canada's longand short-range strategic airlift capability in order to increase Canada's contribution to NATO, coalition and allied military operations abroad and to improve support for domestic and international emergency response.
CONSERVATIVES The Tories would increase defence spending to "move closer" to a NATO pledge to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence. They would call a public inquiry into harassment and discrimination in the Canadian Armed Forces; develop a new Arctic naval base at Churchill, Man., that would make the Arctic more accessible to the Navy year round; update and enhance the North Warning System and extend it to protect the entire Canadian Arctic; create a NATO centre of excellence for Arctic defence at the Resolute Bay CAF Training Centre to enhance co-operation and interoperability with allies; join the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Australia, India, Japan and the United States) in the Indo-Pacific to address increasing instability in the region, which they say is a security threat that Canada can no longer ignore; and procure two armed, heavy icebreakers for the Royal Canadian Navy to contribute to Canada's efforts to "own our north" in the face of increased Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic.
NDP The party promises that contracts for new military equipment, including ships and fighter jets, will ensure industrial benefits and jobs for Canadians. They would immediately implement the recommendations of the Deschamps Report, including establishing independent oversight and accountability for sexual harassment and assault in the military; improve search-and-rescue response times by raising them to international standards and ensuring that our capabilities are sufficient to meet the needs of the North; make mental-health support for Canadian Armed Forces members and their families a priority; oppose the privatization of services on military bases across the country; and ensure that funding supports national defence and international commitments, with a renewed priority of advancing multilateral peacekeeping initiatives around the world.
GREENS The Greens would also quickly implement the recommendations of the Deschamps Report. They would sign and ratify the Treaty to Abolish Nuclear Weapons and press for the conversion of military industries in Canada and worldwide into peaceful and restorative industries. They would realign Canada's defence spending to increase our ability to deliver disaster assistance (e.g.
through the Disaster Assistance Response Team), respond to domestic crises and contribute to UN peace missions and cyberdefence initiatives. The party would reinforce Canada's Arctic sovereignty through expanded patrols and funding for community infrastructure development, regional sustainability projects, research, cultural and other socioeconomic activities. It would also assess Canada's membership in military alliances such as NATO and NORAD to ensure they are meeting Canada's priorities when it comes to diplomacy, development and defence.
BLOC The party wants the Davie shipyard in Lévis, Que., to receive a larger share of the federal government contracts to build ships for the Royal Canadian Navy. It urges a complete revision of the shipbuilding strategy to make Davie a full partner.
PPC The PPC pledges to prioritize its relationship with the United States and work closely with other allies to "maintain a peaceful international order" - but says it would not get involved in foreign conflicts without "a compelling strategic interest in doing so." MANDATORY VACCINATION LIBERALS Mr. Trudeau has promised that, if re-elected, his government would require passengers to be vaccinated in order to travel on interprovincial trains, flights, cruise ships and other federally regulated forms of transportation. He has also pledged to create new rules that would require federal public employees to be vaccinated. While he has stated that there would be consequences for people who fail to comply with the policy, he has not provided any details.
Liberal candidates must also be fully vaccinated, according to the party. In response to antivaccination protests outside hospitals, Mr. Trudeau has said the Liberals would create a new law barring such events from blocking access to health care facilities. A Liberal government would also make it illegal to intimidate or harass a health professional carrying out their professional duties. Mr. Trudeau has promised to create a national vaccine passport for international travel.
CONSERVATIVES Mr. O'Toole says his government would not mandate vaccines for federal employees, but if they are unvaccinated, they would need to take a daily rapid COVID-19 test before going to work. Passengers on federal vessels would need to provide a recent negative test or undergo a rapid test before boarding a train, plane or ship.
Mr. O'Toole condemned the anti-vaccination protests outside hospitals this week, calling them "unacceptable," but has not said if his party would amend or change the laws to address the issue. A Conservative government would also establish a national proof-of-vaccination program that Canadians could use for international travel. The Conservative Party is not requiring candidates to be vaccinated during the campaign, saying the decision to get vaccinated is a personal one.
NDP Under an NDP government, federal employees would need to be vaccinated in order to be on the job or risk discipline or termination, according to Mr. Singh. In response to recent anti-vaccine protests, Mr. Singh said an NDP government would make it illegal to harass or obstruct anyone from seeking medical care and would introduce new penalties for anyone who assaults a health care worker. The NDP supports the use of vaccine passports, and Mr. Singh has called on the government to roll out a national system as soon as possible. The party says all its candidates must be fully vaccinated.
GREENS Ms. Paul says it's important for Canadians to get vaccinated against COVID-19 - but cautions that a mandatory vaccination program risks alienating or excluding some individuals and groups.
BLOC Mr. Blanchet says he would like to see more vaccine production based in Quebec.
PPC Mr. Bernier opposes mandatory vaccination and is the only leader of a major federal political party who is not vaccinated against COVID-19. The party platform promises to repeal vaccine passports and mandates and includes numerous references to misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.
THE FUTURE OF THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY LIBERALS The Liberals are effectively promising a gradual, managed transition away from oil production. Their platform includes a new promise to set increasingly restrictive caps on emissions from the oil-and-gas sector at five-year intervals. (It's not yet clear how they would be enforced.) They are also pledging to end subsidies to that industry - though that would apparently not rule out government supports for investments that help fossil fuel companies lower their emissions, including carbon capture technology, for which a new federal tax credit was in development when the election was called. Meanwhile, they are promising $2-billion for a new "futures fund" for oil-reliant provinces, aimed at economic diversification and helping workers retrain - part of the broader "Just Transition" strategy for which the government launched consultations just before the campaign.
CONSERVATIVES The Conservatives remain the friendliest of the leading parties toward the oil-and-gas sector and are particularly bullish on natural gas exports, which they would promote as a transitional fuel for countries trying to get off coal. They are promising an array of clean-technology supports aimed largely at helping the industry reduce emissions and remain competitive, including $5-billion for carbon capture. While the Liberals have also promised support for using natural gas sites to produce hydrogen, a fuel source that does not produce emissions when used and is increasingly in demand globally, the Tory platform puts more emphasis on it. They also pledge new legislation to crack down on blockades by protesters, such as those opposing pipelines; an end to the federal ban on oil tankers off British Columbia's northern coast; and a revival of the scrapped Northern Gateway pipeline. They do not promise a transition or diversification strategy for oil-producing provinces.
NDP The NDP platform does not provide such a clear picture of the oil-and-gas sector's trajectory. However, they promise to end subsidies to that sector, which seems to mean no federal support for investments in technologies that could simultaneously reduce the industry's emissions and improve its viability, such as carbon capture. Although they have sharply criticized the government's purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline, they have not committed in this campaign to scrapping it or stopping its expansion. To help workers displaced by a transition to cleaner energy sources, they are promising a strategy that includes expanded employment insurance, retraining and job placement help, as well as the protection of retirement benefits.
GREENS The Greens propose the most aggressive transition away from fossil fuel production, with an end to the leasing of federal land for that purpose, an end to all new oil exploration and pipeline projects and a phase-out of existing bitumen operations between 2030 and 2035. They cite wage insurance and early retirement as part of their plan for transitioning workers.
BLOC The Bloc is adversarial when it comes to anything to do with the Western resource industry. In addition to joining several other parties in proposing an end to fossil-fuel subsidies, its platform reiterates its opposition to oil pipelines or additional rail transport through Quebec.
It calls for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project to be scrapped and an end to any promotion of oil exports. It also takes aim at the Liberals' and Conservatives' support for "blue hydrogen," produced from fossil fuel sites while using carbon-capture technology to minimize emissions, in favour of "green hydrogen," produced from renewable resources such as Quebec's hydroelectricity.
PPC The PPC platform promises robust support for pipeline projects, a reversal of the government's Northern B.C. oil tanker ban, as well as efforts to "counter anti-oil and anti-pipeline propaganda from radical environmentalists and foreign foundations." It also promises to "eliminate all corporate subsidies," which presumably would include those to oil and gas producers.

Full text: The first time Sean McGivern set foot on PEI in 2017, he remembers being charmed by the beaches and the quiet. But what really caught his eye was the low cost of real estate.
The Guelph, Ont., resident and new entrepreneur had flown to the Maritimes on business. He specialized in the design of green milling and processing facilities, and travelled east to help a client - an Island seaweed processing company - with its marketing.
Once there, he noticed how much cheaper properties were than in Southern Ontario, despite being larger and often having access to the Atlantic Ocean.
Mr. McGivern had not gone with the intention to shop for land, but these deals were too good to pass up.
"Out there I was just doing some quick maths, the prices didn't even compare to back home."
Mr. McGivern had been leasing a house in Guelph for $2,500 a month with his parents since 2016, after leaving his livestock farm in his hometown of Owen Sound to start a new chapter as a business owner. But nothing was tying him to the city - he could do most of his work from his laptop. So, he started looking around Prince Edward Island for a lot on which to relocate.
"From a COVID standpoint, economical standpoint, social standpoint, PEI has a lot going for it ... it made sense to make the move."
Mr. McGivern's initial plan was to build a seasonal cottage in the Maritimes for him and his parents, and split his time between the Island and Guelph. He settled for a $30,000 fixer-upper on an acre of land with access to the beach in Christopher Cross, on the northwestern tip of PEI. But the more time he spent on the Island, the more he liked it, and he also realized a permanent move would allow him to build his dream home.
He tore down the little house and, in its place, built a 7,500square foot, five-bedroom and four-bathroom family home with a detached garage on his newly acquired land. It took the better part of a year, and the total cost of building neared $800,000, but the result, he said - a large country house with amenities for all tastes - was well worth it.
It takes no more than a quick, front yard view to appreciate the home's traditional appeal - the patio and yard are spacious and give way to a wide path to the ocean.
But it takes a venture inside to appreciate the estate's character, brought to life by Mr. McGivern's careful craftsmanship punctuated by personal signatures.
The eight-foot-wide hallways, the white cupboards and pristine hardwood floors give the home an open and bright vibe, while its flocks of ceramic geese décor and multicoloured road signs on the walls create an outback, cottage feel.
The place's strongest asset, if not for the custom woodworking, is its versatility. Mr. McGivern said most of his guests can find a feature they like, and the full home gym, the basement wooden bar, the home theatre, or the 500-square-foot party room are particularly popular. Those eclectic assets made it an instant community hangout spot when Mr. McGivern finished building in 2018.
"Before COVID we'd have 80 [to] 100 people here for a party and live music and food. We just love the place ... building something like this at this price just wouldn't have been possible in Ontario."
As much as he likes his home, Mr. McGivern now has the itch to return to livestock farming, and is looking to sell the property to buy farmland. Morgan Murphy, a real estate agent at Red Isle Realty Inc., listed Mr. McGivern's home in July, and said it has garnered lots of interest from out-ofprovince buyers at its current price of $800,000.
"It's probably one of the most immaculate homes I've ever walked through," Mr. Murphy said. "It'd be scary to know what it would be worth in Toronto."
Mr. Murphy lists cottages, commercial spaces and homes in the province that range from $300,000 to well over a million dollars. On average, he said onethird of his buyers across the board are from outside Atlantic Canada - especially Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia.
"People from larger cities realize they can get a nice condo for $300,000 or a nice family home for $500,000 and they realize it makes sense to come here."
The reopening of tourism and a growing widespread interest in remote work is making PEI an attractive place to relocate for people from across the country. As a result, the average price of a PEI home increased by 12.03 per cent between March and July, 2021 - more than any other province, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association.
Meanwhile, the influx of interest from out-of-province buyers, along with some of the lowest vacancy rates in the country and the growing popularity of shortterm rentals is raising the barrier of entry to home ownership for locals.
So much that the provincial government implemented a down-payment assistance program, which grants loans of up to 5 per cent for first-time buyers of homes worth up to $300,000.
Mr. Murphy said there is such a difference in market value between homes on PEI and in Canada's bigger cities that what can seem expensive to Islanders still feels like a deal for some migrants.
"Locals think the market is crazy," Mr. Murphy said, "but to someone from another province, if you can work remotely for half the price on a nicer lot with a nicer view with a better house, it's a deal."
In such a market, Mr. McGivern wonders if he could have sold his home for a higher price and made a better profit.
He said that ultimately, however, it does not faze him - it wasn't about the money, and more about having the chance to build and live in the home of his dreams for a few years.
And as he waits for his masterpiece to sell, he shops for farmland. He is limiting his search to two provinces.
"I'm looking at PEI for sure," he said, "and then a bit in Nova Scotia, but that's it."

Full text: Canada's real estate market picked up steam in August, with prices climbing higher and sales volume steady over July.
There were 48,379 home resales last month on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association.
That was 0.5 per cent below July's activity and the smallest monthover-month decline since April.
The home-price index, which adjusts for volatility, reached $736,600 last month, a 1-per-cent increase over July and the first acceleration in month-over-month price inflation since February, according to CREA. The index price is 21 per cent higher than in August of last year.
CREA senior economist Shaun Cathcart said the country's housing market appeared to be "somewhere in between pre and peak pandemic levels," a time when a shortage of homes for sale and strong demand ramped up competition to unprecedented levels.
The rising prices triggered CREA to revise its home-price forecast slightly higher. The association is now predicting the national average home price will reach $680,000 this year, which is 19.9 per cent higher than in 2020.
CREA's previous two outlooks predicted an annual price increase of 19.3 per cent and 17 per cent. The association does not provide a forecast for its homeprice index, even though it is a more accurate representation of typical home values.
The pandemic's real estate boom has been driven by buyers looking for bigger properties to live in and work from during the health crisis. That has pushed up demand for houses across the country, particularly in smaller cities and semi-rural areas where real estate is cheaper than the major urban centres.
Places that were once considered affordable, such as Hamilton and Barrie in Ontario, and Chilliwack in British Columbia, have seen steep price increases over the course of the year. It was a similar story in August. The home-price index was more than 2 per cent higher month over month for the Chilliwack region and Okanagan Valley in B.C., as well as in Brantford and in the Oakville and Milton areas in Ontario. The index was up by more than 1 per cent in most of New Brunswick and nearly 2 per cent in Fredericton.
Over all, more homeowners listed their properties for sale in August. New listings across the country were 1.2 per cent higher than in July but 22 per cent below August of last year. It is not clear when more listings will come to the market.
Some realtors have said the fall is turning out to be like a normal selling year, when activity picks up after summer vacation and ahead of the traditionally slow winter months. Colette Gerber, a realtor in the Vancouver region and former chair of the local board, said some of her clients are waiting until later in September or early October to buy and sell.
But with many Canadians priced out of the market and a shortage of properties for sale, CREA expects resales to fall next year. Even though the association predicts there will be less urgency to find a bigger property to ride out the pandemic, it sees prices continuing to rise. CREA expects the national average home price to climb by 5.6 per cent, to about $718,000, in 2022.

Could housing skeptics be wrong? Or at least, premature in their skepticism?

Full text: INSIDE THE MARKET Housing skeptics argue that Canada's real estate frenzy is a bubble that will inevitably explode, just as the U.S.
property boom did in spectacular fashion back in 2007. But what if the skeptics are reading history wrong?
The U.S. experience over the past two decades has been widely misinterpreted, according to recent research from a trio of economists. In a paper titled The 2000s Housing Cycle with 2020 Hindsight, the researchers point out that while U.S. home prices were unquestionably frothy in 2006, they weren't entirely the speculative lunacy that is commonly perceived.
The strongest evidence for that viewpoint is that U.S. home prices recovered strongly after their plunge from 2007 to 2012. Looking back over the course of the entire past 20 years, the pattern "is not a boom-bust but rather a boom-bust-rebound," write Gabriel Chodorow-Reich of Harvard University, Timothy McQuade of the University of California, Berkeley, and Adam Guren of Boston University.
To put that another way, bubble-era speculators were undoubtedly premature, but they were not necessarily wrong. The housing crash devastated home prices for a few years, but it did not leave them in a permanent hole.
The S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index now stands above its bubble-era peaks, even after adjusting for inflation. This is not what one would expect to see if the boomera surge in prices had been based on nothing but runaway emotions and wonky debt, as The Big Short and other popular histories of the housing mania suggest.
Instead, fundamental factors appear to have played a larger role then previously thought, according to the researchers. They found that the cities that had the biggest booms in the bubble period between 1997 and 2006 also had the largest busts - but that was then followed by the strongest rebounds.
This suggests bubble-era buyers were not, by and large, a pack of fools. These investors were correct in thinking that the long-run outlook for real estate in several cities had fundamentally improved.
Where these buyers went wrong was in being too optimistic about the short term and taking on too much debt as a result. This led to financial fragility and a crash that dragged home prices below their fundamental value.
However, once that shock was past, strong fundamentals powered an impressive rebound.
What were the fundamentals that shifted, beginning in the late 1990s, to drive this trend? Among other things, superstar cities such as Seattle, San Francisco, San Diego and Boston became magnets for well-paid jobs in finance and technology. As well-educated, upwardly mobile families flocked to take advantage of those jobs, they ran up against a limited supply of housing.
Viewed this way, a significant part of the U.S. housing mania in the early 2000s can be seen as a reflection of supply and demand rather than a spontaneous outburst of euphoria or a reflection of loose lending conditions. Indeed, the researchers found they could predict the size of the boom-bustrebound cycle in various U.S. cities with a model that looked at a few fundamental factors such as housing supply, local incomes and amenities.
The researchers tip their collective hats to the work of the late Charles Kindleberger, a famed professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who wrote Manias, Panics and Crashes, a classic work on financial crises.
Prof. Kindleberger contended that manias typically begin with a real improvement in fundamentals. This change excites investors, who then grow overoptimistic and bid prices up unreasonably high, leading to an eventual crash.
The challenge for investors (and for policy makers) is to separate the genuine improvement in fundamentals from the speculative fever - the rational exuberance from the irrational, so to speak.
"Of course, hindsight is 20-20," the researchers write. Separating overoptimism and fundamental factors, and saying how much of each is responsible for any given rise in housing prices, is nearly impossible when rapid changes are occurring. But they suggest policy makers "should heed Kindleberger's dictum that essentially all manias are to some degree grounded in fundamentals."
Canadians may want to ponder this notion. The Canadian cities that have enjoyed the biggest gains, such as Toronto and Vancouver, share many features with U.S. superstar metropolises - they are centres for financial and technology jobs, with a limited supply of housing.
Rather than dismissing house prices in these cities as speculative bubbles, it may help to see them through the Kindleberger lens as grounded in fundamentals, with perhaps a dash of overoptimism added in. To be sure, a short-term correction is possible, but, if the U.S. experience is any guide, it will require a change in fundamentals - such as a large increase in housing units - to bring prices in these centres back to earth over the long haul.

Full text: A Toronto property developer who has worked tirelessly to help hundreds of people fleeing the Taliban settle in Canada - spending $50,000 to buy them essential supplies - has been praised as a "shining example of Canadian compassion" by the Immigration Minister.
Wais Habibzai, who fled to Canada from Afghanistan in 1992 after his house was destroyed by a rocket, has launched a personal aid effort to provide clothes and other necessities for refugees who escaped Kabul.
About 1,000 refugees are being provided with food and accommodation by the government as they prepare to resettle in Canada, Mr. Habibzai said. But he said the refugees, isolating in several Toronto hotels, lack many essentials, including clean underclothes, phones and baby bottles.
Many of the refugees arrived with only the clothes on their backs and Mr. Habibzai has been buying them outfits from Walmart.
The Afghan-Canadian businessman has turned conference rooms in refugee hotels into repositories for clothing and necessities, recruiting dozens of people to volunteer as translators and help fund the aid effort.
He has made daily trips to local stores to buy underwear, shoes, jeans and shirts, bottles and baby formula and personal hygiene products. He has also bought chocolate, candy and toys for children, as well as prayer mats, and hijabs for some older women.
Mr. Habibzai, 40, said he is delighted to see young refugees, who arrived in traditional Afghan attire, walking around Toronto hotels "as true Canadians" in jeans and T-shirts emblazoned with the Canadian flag.
"Some came with [traditional clothes]. The next day they were wearing the shoes I gave them: the T-shirts, jeans. I went to Walmart and bought them some Tshirts with the Canada flag. They loved it. They were walking about as true Canadians," he said.
"Teenagers, 20- to 22-year-olds - they want to be modern."
Marco Mendicino, Minister for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, said welcoming the Afghans "wouldn't be possible without the generosity of Wais and so many others like him."
"As Afghan refugees sought shelter from persecution and war, Canada stepped up. And as refugees now begin new lives in Canada, Canadians are stepping up. Few embody that spirit better than Wais Habibzai. Wais is a shining example of Canadian compassion," he said.
"And as a refugee himself he's the living embodiment of Canada's ‘intergenerational cycle of immigration' where each generation of newcomers welcomes the next."
The Immigration Department says it has helped 3,700 evacuees, including Canadian citizens and permanent residents, flee Afghanistan, which recently fell to the Taliban. But it has faced criticism for not helping enough escape. Its special immigration program has been plagued by bureaucratic and technical problems.
Mr. Habibzai has been visiting refugee hotels each day to find out what those who managed to reach Canada need. He has recruited Afghan family and friends to translate and has been raising thousands of dollars to top up the $50,000 he has spent himself.
He said refugees who had left family behind were desperate to know they were safe, but often had no way of making contact.
Mr. Habibzai bought them phones and SIM cards, as well as chargers that fit Canadian sockets.
He has also offered to house several desperate families in his vacant properties rent-free for a year. But he says many new arrivals have money and are well educated.
The Toronto businessman, whose father was the manager of an Afghan national TV station and former diplomat, was forced to flee Afghanistan after the mujahedeen - religious fighters who fought the Russian occupation, evolving into the Taliban - destroyed his home with a rocket launcher.
He came to Canada in 1992, at the age of 14, and said his experience as a new immigrant motivated him to help the fleeing Afghans. He wants to "give back" to the country that took him in, because he remembers how "tough" it was for him arriving in Canada "with nothing."
"My dad had to leave the job, and since our home got destroyed by the rocket launcher," he said. "It was very difficult for my father to get a rental apartment [in Canada] because he had no credit, no job, and his English was broken. It was tough. My father was a strong man. He wanted to work, whatever it takes, no matter what, even though he was a diplomat for years."
Eventually, his father took a job as manager of a convenience store. Mr. Habibzai eventually founded his own property company, buying his first house at 18 and selling it to fund his university fees. He now builds homes in Toronto and runs a real estate company, as well as technology companies in Afghanistan.
"Today I am building homes and, thanks to Canada, I got my education here. My brother played soccer professionally for Team Canada," he said. "It is all because of this beautiful country.
And I want to give back."
The businessman has also been giving the new arrivals tips on Canadian life, including how to download apps and order pizza.
"Two things I tell them about this country are, ‘Study and work and don't think about nothing else,' " he said.
"I tell them, ‘Listen, I am nobody. I am just this young Afghan-Canadian businessman. I came here, like you, with $20 in my pocket or not even that, with nothing. But Canada is the land of opportunity: You can be somebody.' "

With demand high, builders tweak the traditional townhouse

Full text: THE LISTING As the price of housing continues to hit new highs in the Greater Toronto Area, builders of new townhouse developments are finding buyers are demanding finishes that match the price tag.
"If you think back on suburban towns, they were all the same elevation, maybe three beds and bathroom," said Lee Koutsaris, vice-president of marketing, sales and design at home-builder Metropia.
Ms. Koutsaris is referring to the blocks of undifferentiated townhomes built in the past 30 years you can see backing onto major roads and highways in suburban areas. Buyers could expect to pay a lower price than the local detached housing market, but also get less space, and expect carpet not hardwood, vinyl not tile and laminate counters not stone.
"It was very much seen as an entry level for grade-related housing with a front door. You're seeing young families and older downsizers who don't want a condo [apartment] because of the lack of outdoor space," Ms. Koutsaris said. However, as Metropia said as it prepared to start presales on its Lawrence Heights project in Toronto this year, some things have changed.
Now, not only is there more thoughtful design and architecture required for the exteriors, but when your starting price is more than $1-million, people don't want a "budget" product.
"As the price of the townhome has crept up ... the finish has stepped up. We could have sold it standard and have an upgrade process, but the market's not doing that," she said. "Everyone gets an oak staircase."
Now, 10-foot ceilings are common, custom bathrooms, hardwood floors and stone counters.
The challenge is that buyers want the full HGTV upscale renovation package, but in a housing form that's sometimes 14-feet wide.
"So, we have a U-shaped kitchen and we're being creative to get more cabinetry space [all of it custom millwork]," she said.
It's much like the experience in high-rise condos in downtown Toronto and Vancouver that have found ways to squeeze in highend materials to make under-600-square-foot spaces worth paying some of the highest-per-square-foot prices for housing in Canada. Townhouses have always filled a niche in between expensive detached houses and cheaper apartments, but overall buyers want more.
The desire for higher-end finishes in townhouses is reflected by how much more expensive these homes are now. The resale market has the most robust data, and trends there tend to inform pricing in new developments.
Townhouses typically account for a little less than 20 per cent of the home sales recorded by the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB), Canada's largest board, and are usually hundreds of thousands of dollars cheaper than detached homes.
Prepandemic, at the end of 2019, townhouse prices had risen more than 11 per cent in the 905 communities, averaging $657,577, and the city of Toronto saw price rises of just 0.4 per cent and from a higher average sale price of $717,369. (TRREB's topline townhouse stats include non-condo towns and rowhouses, and the latter tend to be a little pricier.)
Fast forward to this year and TRREB's market data show about 20-per-cent price year-over-year increases for townhomes almost every month, even as the price gulf between a townhouse and a detached home has only gotten wider (2021 saw multiple months of 30-per-cent to 40-per-cent price changes in detached home prices compared with 2020).
In July, things slowed down a little, the average selling price for a Toronto townhouse was up 5 per cent year over year to $893,347 (compared with the stratospheric $1,633,649 for detached), and the average condo apartment sold for $715,977. The average townhouse price in the 905 was up 19 per cent year over year to $837,906 ($1.346-million for detached).
The volume of sales slowed, falling below the July, 2020, mark, but the overall trend is still strong: In the full year 2019, there were 14,648 townhouses sold in the GTA, but in 2021 with five months to go, 12,163 have sold.
In townhouse presales, things have also been red-hot. Ms. Koutsaris said Metropia has sold almost 600 townhouse units at its Union Village site in Markham, just one of several builders selling similar numbers in the area, when in a typical year Markham might see 600 presale townhouses sold, total.
Christina Giannone, vice-president, planning & development with Port Credit West Village Partners, which launched the Brightwater Towns in 2021, said the company completely sold out the first 106-home phase of the 72acre site.
Designed by Canadian architectural firm Superkul, Brightwater adds some flexibility to the needs of its buyers, not just by offering high-quality materials, but by offering a standard main-floor plan (open kitchen, living, dining space with outdoor patio access) with a variety of second- and third-floor options.
"We wanted to provide a product that felt elevated and we did a lot of market research when we were exploring developing these.
We asked what was the detached market like, and what we tried to do was fill in a gap," Ms. Gianonne said.
"We created multiple options: Did they want two beds on the second floor and a primary retreat on the third floor, or did they want the primary on the second floor? How many bathrooms, how many dens or flex spaces? We gave purchasers that option to find what was right with them without any additional cost."
Price was a factor. Ranging between $1.4-million and $1.8million, with sizes close to 2,600 square feet, buyers in Port Credit had expectations about what that dollar would achieve. There was even the opportunity to add an elevator thinking of seniors worried about aging in a multilevel home (several buyers took that, and a few more opted for a configuration that allowed for a future elevator install).
"What was the most desired? The three bedroom, three bathroom plus powder room, and the majority of people who purchased that incorporated a den on the second floor," she said.
Somewhat surprising were those who wanted just two bedrooms: both primaries with ensuite bathrooms on each floor. Apparently in some cases it was friends or siblings planning to share ownership in townhouse.
The other thing Superkul proposed and buyers approved of was an alternating rooftop terrace arrangement, so that every other house had the terrace either at the front or the back of the house, so buyers wouldn't have to share their roof decks with neighbours. And there are three styles of façade to choose from, something Metropia is also experimenting with, which results in a block of homes where not every frontage looks the same.
All this architectural sophistication, high-end material and prices above a million dollars are a distinct break with the townhouse developments of the past.
And as growth plan targets in Ontario communities demand more density in areas unlikely to approve of high-rise towers (such as the Kawarthas or Barrie) they may just be a sign of things to come.

Full text: B.C.'s Housing Minister says the Canada Revenue Agency's internal 1996 audit - which uncovered wealthy immigrant home buyers in and around Vancouver not declaring their income from abroad - is just one of many instances where successive federal governments failed to properly regulate the real estate market.
In an interview on Thursday with The Globe and Mail, David Eby said that the CRA study from 25 years ago is still relevant today and the agency needs to dedicate more resources to taxing foreign capital in Canada's real estate markets, which will make buying a home more equitable.
"When you have people earning local incomes, paying significant taxes on those incomes, competing with people who are coming from low-tax jurisdictions and who are not declaring those incomes to Revenue Canada, and not paying taxes, it's an unfair contest," Mr. Eby said.
"Our tax system is a self-reporting system, it relies on people reporting their income and being honest and disclosing their assets and I don't know why average working Canadians from all backgrounds wouldn't say ‘why should I be honest ... if the federal government knows that people are playing the system in this way?' " The 1996 audit focused on 328 higherend sales in the Vancouver suburbs of Burnaby and Coquitlam, but the study also analyzed a random sample of 6,060 sales from Vancouver and neighbouring Richmond and discovered "similar demographic results."
Of the 46 houses bought in Burnaby, staff found 72 per cent were purchased by new arrivals to Vancouver who reported an average total family income of just $16,000. In contrast, the CRA's chart from the audit showed four buyers who were long-term residents reported average family incomes that were tens of thousands of dollars higher.
Housing experts said the study suggested that the typical wealthy foreign family buying Vancouver-area real estate pays little or no income tax while pricing these homes out of the reach of many locals whose taxes pay for public services.
Mr. Eby said he does not believe the 1996 report was intentionally buried by the federal Liberal government of the day, just given to a bureaucrat who had five other competing priorities and allowed it to sit there gathering dust.
"Before I spent some time in government, I would definitely attribute this to malice and a cover-up," he said.
What is distressing, Mr. Eby said, is that the federal agency fought a journalist for five years to stop the release of the document.
A spokesperson for the CRA said Thursday that it could take a few days to respond to The Globe's request for comment on Mr. Eby's remarks. Last week, the agency apologized for the protracted battle to keep the document secret from the South China Morning Post's Vancouver correspondent Ian Young, who first requested the information in 2016 after a whistleblower leaked him details of the study.
The CRA has said the audit intentionally focused on cases where the buyer may have been underreporting their income and, thus, "was not intended to, and should not be, extrapolated to the whole population."
The federal agency also said it takes cheating its system seriously and, in recent years, has stepped up audits in the hot housing markets of Toronto and Vancouver while closely monitoring the increase in sales in and around Montreal.
Mr. Eby said the agency needs to enforce existing laws by harnessing the tools his government has created. These include home buyers' declaration of their country of residence for tax purposes as well as the registry for beneficial owners - which will come into full force at the end of this year to make it tougher for people to hide real estate investments behind corporations, trusts or partnerships.

Full text: An internal Canada Revenue Agency audit concluded 25 years ago that wealthy new immigrants were buying up most of the priciest houses taken from a sample in and around Vancouver while declaring poverty on their tax returns. But the report was not made public until a fiveyear access-to-information battle concluded recently.
Housing and immigration academics say the study could have warned the public about the scale of foreign money being parked in Metro Vancouver's residential real estate - decades before the provincial government began taking meaningful action to slow this trend.
During the federal election campaign, all three major parties have proposed various policies to curb international demand for real estate, which has contributed to rising unaffordability in a number of urban centres.
The Liberals and Conservatives are promising to ban foreign home buyers for at least two years.
The New Democrats have pledged to tax those who aren't Canadian citizens or permanent residents with a 20-per-cent levy - the same penalty imposed in British Columbia's biggest cities for the past three years.
But critics say the parties need to follow B.C.'s lead to capture even more information about property owners so that they can be taxed more equitably and governments can tamp down international real estate speculation.
The CRA's analysis from October, 1996, was shared with The Globe and Mail this week after its release to Ian Young, the South China Morning Post's Vancouver correspondent, who first requested the information in 2016 after being leaked portions of the internal memo explaining its findings.
The audit focused on 328 higher-end sales in the suburbs Burnaby and Coquitlam, but the study also analyzed a random sample of 6,060 sales from Vancouver and neighbouring Richmond and discovered "similar demographic results."
Of the 46 houses bought in Burnaby, staff found 72 per cent were purchased by new arrivals to Vancouver who reported an average total family income of just $16,000.
In contrast, the CRA's chart from the audit showed four buyers who were long-term residents reported average family incomes that were tens of thousands of dollars higher.
This income gap between new immigrants and neighbours who had lived there longer was also observed in Coquitlam, according to the CRA's chart released in the package of documents.
"It should be noted that an obvious large discrepancy exists between the average total family incomes for long-term Canadian residents and newer Canadian residents," the author of the memo wrote to his CRA boss.
"Furthermore, based on lifestyle and average age of these taxpayers, it is likely that many of these new Canadians still have active business activities, but are not reporting all their sources of income."
Vancouver lawyer Richard Kurland, who has been helping international clients immigrate to B.C.
for 25 years, said the analysis proves the CRA failed to catch those hiding their global income while competing for homes on Canada's West Coast.
"They knew it was happening and did nothing, so the bleeding continued, taxes were not paid, property was subject to speculation and the end result [is] people in Vancouver are paying many more times than they have to for residential property because the CRA did nothing when it was warned by its own employees about what was going on," he said.
David Ley, a geography professor at the University of B.C. who studies housing bubbles, said the 1996 report could have spurred politicians to address the anomaly of "apparently poor people buying very rich properties" decades earlier. He said the CRA had long maintained that it would take too many resources to crack down on home buyers hiding wealth abroad, in large part because other countries they lived in were unlikely to release the pertinent tax information.
"It's very difficult to pursue foreign sources of income - so they didn't," Dr. Ley said.
The CRA told The Globe this week that the study intentionally focused on cases where the buyer may have been underreporting their income and, thus, "was not intended to, and should not be, extrapolated to the whole population."
But large parts of the internal communications around the release of the document were redacted because the agency said federal access-to-information law allows consultations or deliberations between government employees, a minister of the Crown or their staff to remain confidential.
The federal agency said it takes cheating its system seriously and has stepped up audits in the hot housing markets of Toronto and Vancouver in recent years.
Still, the CRA said its five-year battle with Mr. Young over the release of this document is "clearly not normal, nor is it acceptable; we are continuing to take steps to improve [our] performance."
Andy Yan, a housing analyst and director of Simon Fraser University's city program, said the federal government has a lot of tools - such as home loan data and analysis of social demographic changes in neighbourhoods - through which it can confirm or refute how widespread these investment patterns have been. But ultimately, he said, the CRA has not effectively enforced the country's tax rules, helping create an unfair system where foreign capital is stored in residential real estate. "There shouldn't be any free parking," said Mr. Yan.
In 2015, a Globe and Mail investigation into public data - including land titles, tax reporting and court records - revealed a similar pattern to the 1996 CRA study that suggested the typical wealthy foreign family buying Vancouver real estate pays little or no income or capital gains tax. These family homes were priced out of reach for many locals whose taxes pay for public services.
The Globe discovered that one in three multimillion-dollar homes bought in Vancouver areas popular with foreign buyers was registered to a homemaker, student or corporation - one indicator of how the identity of the person who actually paid can be hidden.
When a spouse or child sells a property that is registered in their name, the real investor can avoid capital-gains taxes - because the relative in Canada can claim it was their primary residence, therefore not an investment.
This and other Globe investigations helped increase public pressure on the provincial Liberal government to enact Canada's first tax on foreign homebuyers.
After the New Democrats were elected in 2017, in part on their pledge to further crack down on expanding real estate speculation, B.C. implemented a host of new taxes and demand-side tools.
Mr. Kurland said more provinces need to follow B.C.'s lead in requiring that homebuyers declare their country of residence for tax purposes as well as create a registry for beneficial owners - which will come into full force at the end of this year to make it tougher for people to hide real estate investments behind corporations, trusts or partnerships.
He said the CRA's current "whack-a-mole" approach to catching scofflaws in the housing market relies on auditors digging for specific information in individual cases, but it will soon be able to use algorithms to scour all its tax information and these twin data sets to better catch those hiding wealth in B.C.
"It's equivalent of an abacus versus a spreadsheet," said Mr. Kurland, who added that he saw a "massive selling spree" among foreign owners in B.C. before each of those two policies became law.
Rohana Rezel, a software engineer who advocates for more affordable housing by using software and data to uncover speculators in Metro Vancouver's market, said the most effective federal policy on this issue would be to blanket the whole country with a speculation tax on all homes.
Then, owners could offset this two-per-cent penalty against what they pay to the CRA each year, said Mr. Rezel.
"If you're paying income taxes of a certain amount it doesn't apply to you," said Mr. Rezel, who immigrated to Canada from Sri Lanka in 2008.

Full text: It's not like it's a specialty; one does not need to be the equivalent of a pediatric surgeon, but for architecture.
No, if one understands spatial relationships, light penetration and how to use materials to improve both, a good architect can conjure up the same magic in a Rosedale mansion or East York bungalow.
"It doesn't really matter the size of the building," agrees Brian O'Brian, who was born in Montana and is a very good architect indeed. "I'm always looking for these points where you can cut the house, where there are sectional conditions ... to draw in little bits of light, particularly when you can get them to go from roof to first floor. And it doesn't have to cost enormous amounts of money to make holes."
The holes Mr. O'Brian made for Joe and Keira Park, for instance, are quite tasteful.
Allowing old, gnarly rafters to travel across the ones where light rains down into the formerly dark middle of their cute-as-a-button East York detached makes for a nice contrast with the smooth, creamy-white drywall, and the enormous hole he made on their rear wall has now been plugged up by a cantilevered addition that houses two similarly cute, small bedrooms for the couple's two young children.
But more on all of that in a minute.
The first thing Mr. O'Brian designed for the Parks was even smaller: a backyard scooter shed. It was at the Parks' 2010 housewarming party that Mr. O'Brian, new to Canada at that point, was allowing his ear to be bent by Mr. Park on how tough it was to house his vintage Vespas (it should be noted here that Mr. O'Brian and his Canadian wife had met the Parks when they took over their Leslieville rental).
"I remember the discussion very well because I was lamenting that everything available at Home Depot just didn't cut it," says Mr. Park, smiling as he looks over at Mr. O'Brian. "And then you got your architect's vision about it."
And that vision was to design a wide shed with a drop-down front wall that Mr. Park could build himself. The wall-on-awinch would, with a few cranks, become a work-surface where Mr. Park could restore and tinker with his classic Italian beauties.
Not only was this little shed Mr. O'Brian's first commission in Canada, it made the pages of Canadian Architect magazine for its inventiveness.
Anyhow, with a solid relationship now established, when the Park family expanded to four a few years after that, they called the Works Office of Brian O'Brian to ask that age-old question: "Do we need to move, or is there a way to wrestle space out of this old place?" Many friendly chats ensued. Listings in their price range looked like they'd need a renovation. So, they were between a rock and a hard place. If they did renovate, they'd not want to spend more than $200,000. Was that realistic?
"We had no idea what we should expect - we'd never had a reno [done] before," Ms. Park says.
With a clever plan that avoided excessive foundation work, a good engineer (Kieffer Structural Engineering) and a local, family-run contractor (Tarazhi's Restoration), and some economical choices with regards to finishes, Mr. O'Brian assured them it could be done. There might even be room for a little pizzazz, too.
Two years later, and with a whole lot of time spent housebound owing to the pandemic, it's clear all parties are overjoyed with the results.
Whereas before, one would climb the stairs to be confronted by three doors in semi-darkness - their daughter's tiny room hovered over the stairwell - one is now deposited into a light-filled transition space where plants thrive and little drywall slots allow light to cascade down.
Their daughter's former bedroom is now an open and airy, cedar-clad, reading nook (it was here that virtual school was held, Ms. Park notes).
Past the now-renovated bathroom, a little hallway leads to two ship's-cabinlike bedrooms, equal in size, where floorto-ceiling windows reflect light onto warm wood panelling that mimics the size of each window-wall.
Downstairs, although little has changed to the front rooms - they received new white-oak flooring, paint and sexy black door hardware - the staircase was reworked with new treads and a wall rather than the "visual activity" of handrails and pickets, and the kitchen got a complete overhaul using IKEA cabinetry.
Viewing the new addition from the backyard, one is struck by how much visual interest a cantilever can create (and sheltered private space), and how a few simple design moves can transform what - in an amateur's hands - would have been a plain wall into something with depth, shadow and complexity.
"You take the single volume and then read other volumes within that, or shapes within that," Mr. O'Brian explains. "So things seem to pop in and out."
Over all, it's a skillful, thoughtful renovation that has completely changed the character of one small East York home.
And, since it came in under budget, it's something more folks should consider ... especially if they want more architectural beauty in their life, says Mr. O'Brian.
"I really was happy to do this," he says.
"I don't really care so much about the budget or the scale; it's really just about, are the people interested in doing something? If not, then it's not worth the time that goes into it. But as soon as they're interested in rethinking how the space might work, how light works primarily, then I think it gets far more beautiful."

High demand is killing off rental freebies

Full text: The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over in Canada, but as some parts of life get back to normal there's one condition tenants in the country's largest city may be sorry to see go: rental incentives.
A rental incentive could be something as simple as a landlord offering a year of free internet or cable, or even a gift card to Starbucks. But in the past year landlords desperate to fill their buildings have been compelled to offer real money: first month of rent free, or even cash bonuses for moving in.
The combination of work from home and fear of enclosed spaces hit multifamily rental buildings hard in Toronto, lowering rental rates and raising vacancy rates to levels not seen in decades. But as universities begin to offer in-person classes and more businesses have begun reopening offices, the flood of renters returning to the city has caused some of those landlords to pare back on the incentives as competition for units heats up.
"Prepandemic there were no rent incentives," said Adrian Rocca, chief executive of Fitzrovia Real Estate, one of the largest builders of new purpose-built rental buildings in Toronto. Fitzrovia has $4-billion in rental assets under management and does its own property managing in addition to developing and building new rental. "Through the pandemic the norm for incentives was about two months rent-free plus $500 to $1,000 of cash incentives; they call it the move-in bonus. We also saw an 8per-cent drop in face rates." Face rates are the rent that applies once you factor out the incentives.
Mr. Rocca said existing rental buildings have been offering incentives on an apartment-byapartment basis throughout the pandemic, but where they really took off is in the lease-up phase of a new building, where rental managers try to sign up tenants to fill an empty tower. In 2021, Fitzrovia had two new buildings open and in the case of The Waverly, a 166-apartment, 16-storey building at College and Spadina (which replaced the old Silver Dollar Room lounge) - began leasing on Feb. 4, but four months in, the company removed all its incentives with about 20 units still to lease, and recently signed eight more leases without any cash incentives. The building is now 92-per-cent leased.
"We had one-month rent free, and all together we had $2,700 cash incentives; free internet was in there. Now we're just offering internet as an ongoing part of the program," he said.
According to Urbanation Inc., a real estate research firm, in the second quarter of 2021 the most popular incentive being offered in purpose-built rental buildings was one-month rent free (52 per cent) followed by 25 per cent offering two-months rent. The other incentives included another 12 per cent offering a move-in bonus and then smaller single-digit offerings of three-months rent, six months parking, gift cards or gym memberships.
Some in the industry suggest that while cash bonuses may be fading away as the rental market gets pricier, not all incentives are strictly monetary.
"We offered a one-month rent free incentive, because we recognized COVID brought on challenging circumstances, and we wanted to offset moving costs," said Chrystal LeBlanc, director of residential strategic marketing with rental housing owner BentallGreenOak. "I think we're going to see incentives dial back, but we're going to continue to see lifestyle incentives."
BentallGreenOak is currently running a lease-up at a new building branded Novus in Liberty Village, a 579-apartment tower that began preleasing in June and has signed up tenants for about 20 per cent of its units thus far.
In Liberty Village, a community filled with condominium apartments often owned by investors, BentallGreenOak is also spending a lot of time educating prospective tenants on things such as security of tenure that's typical of a purpose-built rental.
That said, Novus's rents are above current market with a onebedroom running between $2,190 and $2,550 (according to services such as Padmapper.com, Liberty Village one bedrooms average $1,950) and a three bedroom starting at $4,910 and hitting as high as $7,500 (Padmapper average: $4,700). And because it's a building completed after 2018, the rates won't be subject to Ontario's rent controls, even if a tenant won't get a potentially spurious "own-use" or renovation eviction that's become all-too common among investor-owned apartments.
BentallGreenOak constructed the lifestyle parts of its incentive packages as a set of bonuses worth $1,000 that renters could choose between. Some packages offer additional cash for moving expenses and gift cards for furniture retailers Article and EQ3; another offers eight sessions with a personal fitness trainer and a Lululemon gift card; another was all about the local restaurants with gift cards for Brodflour bakery, Kibo sushi and Chang Mai Thai food. BentallGreenOak is also offering to plant a tree for each new lease, and is running a draw to give away a Tesla electric car.
Ms. LeBlanc says the onemonth-free promotion will continue for now, but says the cash incentive on its own is too transactional an approach to leasing up Novus. "We don't want to just put bodies in suites, we want a community. When we first put out one- or two-month-free rent, it may open a door, but that's not why someone's going to choose to stay at your community," she said.
For some builders of new rental, there was never going to be any cash incentive needed. At least, that's the view of Bryan Levy, CEO of residential building company DBS Developments and CFO at the parent company and asset manager Preston Group.
Preston faced construction delays as it worked on its new 20storey purpose-built rental building - called 2Fifteen Lonsdale - in Toronto's exclusive Forest Hill neighbourhood and is planning to launch the lease-up campaign in September with occupancy planned for early 2022.
"For our building we're not planning on coming out to market with any incentives at all, we will not require any incentives on the initial lease-up," he said. "Our other properties, are different stories. Over the pandemic we've offered certain incentives. Now we're seeing every day it's changing, whatever incentives are still there I don't think it's going to last too much longer."
For Mr. Levy, Lonsdale is a prestige property not just because of its proximity to schools like Upper Canada College, but the materials and finishes are a fit for a neighbourhood known for expensive custom houses. Suites will feature appliances from high-end brands such as Gaggenau, Thermador and Bosch, custom-designed kitchens from Wise-Nadal (two-bedroom units will get a wine fridge thrown in) and natural stone and quartz in kitchens, bathrooms and fireplaces. The building has a porter, a concierge and custom app for managing tenant relations - from maintenance requests to booking such amenities as the rooftop lounge, the party room with chef's kitchen or the gym kitted out with Peloton bikes. Even in construction, they are pushing their chips in with floor-to-ceiling windows, large balconies for every suite and even a specialized brick façade that's never been used in a Toronto high-rise.
Manufactured by the Broager, Denmark-based Petersen Tegl Company, the K91 Kolumba brick is extra-long so fewer are needed in construction and can be seen in Toronto on the Drake Hotel.
Mr. Levy toured the factory with the company's seventh-generation family ownership and came away deeply impressed. "It's a beautiful brick, but most developers would think we're crazy for how much we spent. We're north of $7 Canadian on a brick; a typical normal brick is a couple bucks. As it begins to go up [on the building] now people are stopping to look," he said.
But even for buildings without as much cachet as Lonsdale, as the effects of the pandemic fade and rental incentives disappear with it, Mr. Rocca doesn't see much chance of them coming back in a city that has been in such high demand to live in for so long.
"It was such a tight market, we've been at 2-per-cent structural vacancy for 25 years," he said.

Full text: The federal Liberals have pledged $2-billion to help workers in oil-producing provinces transition to a greener economy, but the proposal is getting a lukewarm reception in communities that might be beneficiaries of the funding.
In Cold Lake, Alta. - where more than 2,000 of the city's 15,000 residents are employed at nearby oil-sands operations - Mayor Craig Copeland said he doesn't believe most people working in the sector want to switch jobs.
Cold Lake's economy has suffered over the past seven years because of low oil prices, consolidation and layoffs in the energy sector. Mr. Copeland said local real-estate prices have fallen almost 40 per cent since 2012.
However, things are looking brighter this year, thanks to higher commodity prices driving increased oil-sands production.
Mr. Copeland said he's optimistic about the future of his community, a place where 20somethings can earn six figures, buy homes and raise families.
"We already have a huge industry that generates enormous wealth for people," Mr. Copeland said, calling the Liberals' transition proposal a ‘made-in-Ottawa' solution not grounded in reality.
"Until you find a way to replace that, people won't even look at retraining."
The Liberal proposal for a $2billion "Future Funds" program for Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador is part of a larger promise to ensure workers aren't left behind as Canada pursues its climatechange commitments.
The party's platform contains a promise to create a "Clean Jobs Training Centre" to help oilpatch workers upgrade or gain new skills.
The Liberals have pledged to require the oil and gas industry to reduce its emissions from current levels at the pace and scale needed to achieve net-zero by 2050, and will set five-year targets toward that goal beginning in 2025.
While there are different ways to accomplish that goal, said Isabelle Turcotte - director of federal policy for clean energy think tank the Pembina Institute - the outcome will undoubtedly have an effect on oil and gas employees.
"It's been hard in Canada to talk about reductions in oil and gas, because of workers," Ms. Turcotte said. "But regardless of the pathway [to net-zero] we choose ... we will see a decrease in production and consumption of oil and gas, all the way to 2050."
Gil McGowan, president of the Alberta Federation of Labour, said climate change is a reality his province needs to face up to.
"We've had a great ride with oil and gas, but the sector will never be the same engine for economic growth that it was," Mr. McGowan said. "Pretending that we can ignore the direction that the world is heading and go back to the past is not in the best interest of Alberta workers, including people working in the oil and gas sector."
Mr. McGowan said the AFL has been lobbying for federal support in the range of $10- to $20billion a year to help oil-producing provinces and their workers diversify. He said the labour group would like to see a new federal transfer program that could fund green infrastructure projects, training and apprenticeships in affected provinces.
Thousands of Albertans have already been affected by downsizing, automation, and the continuing evolution of Canada's energy sector, said Adam Legge, president of the Business Council of Alberta. The percentage of the province's labour force that has been unemployed for more than one year is 2.4 per cent, the highest rate of long-term unemployment in the country (the national average is 1.4 per cent).
Mr. Legge said his organization is supportive of federal funding for clean energy, diversification and anything else that will help to keep Alberta competitive in a changing world. But he said Canada's oil and gas sector is still critical to the national economy, and will remain so for a long time.
"We support this kind of [transition fund] initiative because there are many people who aren't going to find the same kind of job they once had," Mr. Legge said. "But what we don't want it to be is code for ‘wind down of the sector.' We don't support that approach at all."
Ted Clugston - mayor of Medicine Hat, Alta. - said his city was "devastated" when natural gas prices collapsed in 2008. He said Medicine Hat has been pursuing diversification ever since, and has had significant success attracting solar and wind power projects to the area.
However, Mr. Clugston said the employment created by those projects doesn't come close to comparing with the thousands of local jobs created by the oil and gas sector.
"There's lots of jobs during construction, but once [wind and solar farms] are built, there's not that many jobs," he said. "I don't know where all these green jobs are going to come from."
The federal Conservative Party platform makes no mention of a transition fund for oil and gas workers, instead criticizing Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau for "wanting to phase out the sector and its jobs." It says a Conservative government would support energy sector workers.
The NDP platform pledges to "work together" with labour, employers and the provinces to find solutions that could include expanded EI benefits, re-training and job placement services.

Full text: The wait list for Omar Gandhi's services is longer than usual these days.
The Halifax-based architect's luxury estates across Atlantic Canada have been in high demand over the past 10 years: Buyers like their signature dynamic designs, minimalist tones and ocean views. But since the start of the pandemic, Mr. Gandhi's phone line has been especially busy - he is answering many more calls from potential buyers than before.
"I'd say that we have been approached by 300 per cent more people than any previous year," said Mr. Gandhi, who currently has projects on the go in Nova Scotia, PEI and Newfoundland.
"Things have been busy the entire time of COVID, and during the last couple of months, we've said no to a lot more than we used to."
Luxury homes in the Atlantic provinces became attractive to buyers from just about everywhere in the past year. As people across Canada and around the world navigated waves of COVID-19 infection and intermittent lockdowns, many became interested in moving to the East Coast for its relative affordability, seclusion from large urban centres and large plots of land.
"I think people being at home thought a big piece of land by the ocean seems pretty romantic," he said. "There has always been lots of those properties available in Atlantic Canada, but what may be changed is how bad people feel they need it after being quite cooped up for the year."
Border closings, though they are now being loosened, have prevented international customers from seeing the properties in person and has curtailed the enthusiasm of foreign buyers to buy land in the Maritimes.
That's not great for Atlantic Canada's luxury housing business, where buyers of the most expensive homes are seldom local to the area, or even the country.
"We had a client from Switzerland who wanted to fly his private jet to Halifax, and then take a helicopter to a home," said real estate agent Rick Foster, who lists several luxury properties in and around the city. "It didn't matter if you had all the money in the world, you still couldn't come to Nova Scotia."
But now that restrictions around travel within Canada are mostly lifted, and that those around international visits are slowly following suit, Mr. Gandhi said he is seeing an added boost in interest for his upscale, seaview projects.
Mr. Gandhi designs approximately 10 residences a year, many of which have access to Atlantic shoreline. One of his projects currently for sale is a darkcoloured, fortress-like estate in Kingsburg Beach on the south shore of Nova Scotia. The 2,600square-foot home, named Treow Brycg, stands two storeys high on 1.6 acres of land, 90 minutes away from Halifax. Its wall of windows at the front allows for ample sunlight and sea view, while the dense, dark bronze steel back wall shields from winter and maintains privacy. The whole is perfect for folks who want a beachy escape. The home's price tag of $2,669,000, however, puts it out of reach for most locals.
"I'd say two-thirds of my buyers come from away," Mr. Gandhi said.
For that same reason, Mr. Foster, who lists several Atlantic Canadian properties priced at more than $3-million, said he is looking forward to the day travel restrictions can lift and potential clients can come to see his listings in person.
He thinks the market for those houses will be fierce, because local properties listed just under that price range are also in high demand.
The number of homes sold in Nova Scotia listed between $1million and $1.5-million went from 43 to 63 to 101 in the past three years. Mr. Foster said Maritimers are buying many of them.
Locals, he said, have more generational wealth than people realize.
Yet, Mr. Foster said he relies primarily on buyers from Ontario, the United States and Europe - many of whom have never seen Nova Scotia - to buy properties listed at $2.5-million or more.
In the last year, he relied heavily on virtual home tours and Zoom video calls to help customers get a feel for their potential purchase. That, at times made it difficult to seal the deal.
"If you're buying, say, a $3-million home or more, that's a bit more of a challenge to invest in without seeing the property."
As of late, both Mr. Foster and fellow Nova Scotia real estate agent Mariana Cowan said they are seeing growing interest for the luxury properties they list, now that international visits are becoming possible.
Ms. Cowan listed a massive home on Duncan's Cove in southern Nova Scotia in 2017, and said many people from outside the area have recently asked for video tours.
"There is more activity on the property than we have ever seen."
The estate, 137 Gannet Lane, is listed at $4,395,000 and is a completely redesigned observation tower from the Second World War that overlooks the entryway into Halifax Harbour. Its five storeys and 6,800 square feet encapsulate four bedrooms, six bathrooms, separate guest homes and an infinity pool, and the whole sits on 2.7 acres of land, with 550 feet of oceanfront access.
"There are these homes in the area that are pretty secluded but that are so rich in history," she said. "This one is a beautiful place and I think the interest is just going to be more and more, especially as we're getting more of an influx of people."
In co-operation with Ms. Cowan, the property is currently on auction, with a reserve bid pegged at $2.6-million.

Another win for Toronto's Distillery District: ARCHITOURIST

Full text: Writing in Canadian Architect the year before the provincial government shuttered Ontario Place, Brendan Cormier mused that, had architect Eberhard Zeidler been allowed to proceed with "Harbour City" - a government-commissioned, water-based, low-rise community of 60,000 residents that would've replaced the island airport with canals and bays - there would be no need to consider how to "re-energize" the area.
"Harbour City was an expression of the province's vision to have Torontonians living by the lake," he wrote. "Its failure has meant that the waterfront area around Ontario Place has remained without a significant residential base, perhaps contributing to the development's attendance problems."
I'll say. And 10 years later, with residential considerations still off the table, I have little hope that this masterpiece will enjoy the kind of renaissance it deserves.
How do I know? Because, during a walkabout of the Distillery District with Neil Pattison of Graywood Developments and architectsAlliance's Rob Cadeau last week, we found the place teeming. And, with the borders opened to Americans only recently, my guess is it was mostly local people.
"You have to have residential, always, to get that multiuse fusion," Mr. Cadeau says. "Twentyfour hours a day, people in [the] space."
"I look back what happened at Canary Wharf in London, because that's where I grew up," Mr. Pattison says. "I went as a planning student ... we went to the 50th floor [of One Canada Square] and we looked around and there's no residential around, and you go down to the beautiful marble plazas with fountains - after five o'clock, it's deserted."
Residential, then, is key. Shortly after Toronto's amazing, Victorian-era industrial townscape was opened to the public in 2003 - after producing a zillion gallons of booze as Gooderham and Worts for a century and a half - shovels hit the ground for the first high-rise condominium, Pure Spirit (architectsAlliance).
And, in a city that can still flounder when it comes to blending contemporary architecture with heritage, it found, and struck, a balance and garnered rave reviews.
Other buildings followed, including the deliciously wonky balcony walls of twins Clear Spirit and The Gooderham (2013 and 2014, also by architectsAlliance), which used heritage buildings for one podium and deftly created a new brick podium for the other.
And because red brick is what the pedestrian experiences - the towers are clad in milky-white glass - the human scale is preserved.
"It's about the podium, the scale of the podium, and how it meets the street," Mr. Cadeau says. "So it's very important that that's well detailed [and] materials are special."
Thankfully, Mr. Cadeau is heading up the team to produce the newest residential building at the Distillery (yes, there are a few sites left to develop) for Graywood. Better yet, it's going to "pull" the pedestrian experience to the south by occupying the site of a former one-storey building at 33 Parliament St., while also replacing asphalt with greenery and cobblestones.
"We're having a new, animated edge against Distillery Lane," Mr. Pattison says. "It's kind of just parking, no-man's land with that dead edge to it. ... So we've got 20,000 square feet of retail on our ground floor."
And to ensure that retail jibes with the existing "no chains" policy, the Distillery District's developer, Cityscape, will purchase that space and "curate it the same as they've curated the [existing] retail."
"That was a big, big win for us."
Christened "The Goode" (better than "The Wort," this author jokes), the 32-storey, 540-unit building will also feature a semienclosed courtyard at its base, which will add to the sense of discovery that already exists due to the network of heritage laneways and jiggity-jaggity building placement.
"It's just this variety of space that encircles this building," Mr. Cadeau says. "That's very much indicative of the Distillery; there's this kind of meandering sense to the spaces opening and closing, it has this serendipitous experiential quality, and that's in a sense what we're trying to create here."
As we meander the site ourselves, we note that the Sudburybased French school, Collège Boréal, will move into the yet-to-bebuilt "Ribbon Building" that will trace the southern border of the site - and how lovely to have students contribute to the vibrancy of the area - and discuss how the many fine restaurants have turned the area into a foodie destination.
We also count the other developments nearby, such as East Bayfront - "You don't realize how close it is because the rail corridor cuts it off," Mr. Pattison says - or Parliament Slip, and the 3C Waterfront project, which includes the old Victory Soya Mills silos, and consider how those future residents will contribute to the health of the Distillery's retailers.
What's needed next, we agree, is a hotel (and that seems to be in the works) and, perhaps, a small grocery store.
When I lived in Montreal in the mid- to late-1990s, visitors would almost always ask me to take them to Old Montreal, and I'd happily oblige while concealing pangs of jealousy. As a proud Torontonian, I wished for a similar, compact, tourist-worthy destination filled with heritage architecture. When the Distillery District was born, I got my wish.
When heritage writers or thinkers look back upon Toronto in the first 50 years of this century, there is no doubt in my mind that the Distillery District will top the list as most significant. And because of the neighbourhood that's been created around it, it will be around for those same advocates to enjoy long after that.

Full text: Tim Ennis is gliding in his kayak up the mouth of the Courtenay River. The view around him isn't exactly a pretty sight. One bank of the river, which spills into a lovely estuary, is walled with rusty corrugated steel. The ground above the wall is a barren expanse of broken concrete and asphalt. "It's a beautiful piece of property we bought, isn't it?" he says.
But Mr. Ennis has a smile on his face. The conservation group he works with, Project Watershed, raised millions to acquire the site, home of an abandoned sawmill that was considered one of the worst eyesores in the Comox Valley area on Vancouver Island.
The group plans to return it to its preindustrial splendour, removing the ugly 400-metre-long retaining wall and creating a wetland where salmon, herons and otters can thrive.
After years of lobbying, fundraising and negotiating with the local First Nation, work on the Kus-kus-sum project is finally under way.
Crews have already pulled down an old sawmill building.
Now they are jackhammering the concrete and dumping it in bins for recycling.
For Mr. Ennis and locals who have watched and waited for progress, it is a marvellous sight.
To make it all the more satisfying, the headway is happening without the acrimony that has broken out in places such as Fairy Creek on the other side of Vancouver Island, where protesters have been confronting police in a struggle over the logging of oldgrowth forest. Mr. Ennis and his colleagues worked closely with Interfor, the forestry giant that owned the property.
Rather than confront resource companies, groups like his are quietly buying up and restoring environmentally sensitive pieces of land.
"I've never stood in front of a logging truck, but I've worked with just about every logging company," says Mr. Ennis, 46, a biologist and outdoorsman who is senior project manager for Kuskus-sum.
Environmentalists have dreamed of restoring the site ever since the clanking old mill closed in 2006. The estuary, where fresh water meets salt, is one of the most fertile on the B.C. coast.
Remnants are still visible of a complex network of fish traps Indigenous people built there to exploit its abundance long before colonialism.
The mill and its steel wall changed the river's flow, deflecting it and eroding the opposite bank. Seals learned to use the wall to catch salmon. Adult seals would herd the fish against it and train their young to lie in wait. It became known as the "killing wall."
When the mill closed, conservation groups worried that developers would snap up the site to build homes for the retirees that are flocking to the Comox Valley, driving up real estate prices. Project Watershed set a goal of raising $6.5-million to buy the 8.3acre property and "unpave paradise."
The plan captured the imagination of the community. Residents often pass by the site on their way through town, and welcomed the chance to help beautify it. Donations big and small flowed in.
The B.C. government also came through. Mr. Ennis was out getting ice cream one day when he got a call from the province's chief financial officer.
An e-mail with a document was on its way to him. Could he sign it and send it back by the end of the business day? "Yes, sir, I could," he replied. He ran home from the ice cream shop. "Holy gosh, it's a million dollars," he remembers thinking. Another $650,000 was to come. Premier John Horgan took a personal interest and visited the site during last fall's provincial election campaign.
Interfor signed over the property soon afterward - the last sawmill building came down in March and work on breaking up the concrete started June 21. Once the site is cleared, workers will start on earthwork and planting.
The aim is to create a rich habitat that will connect with an existing marsh just downriver.
It's a win not just for the estuary, but for the environment at large at a time of raging wildfires and rising alarm over climate change.
With their dense plant matter, salt marshes take in more carbon per square metre than towering stands of old-growth forest.
It's a win for reconciliation, too. Project Watershed worked closely with the K'ómoks First Nation, which will hold joint title to the site with the City of Courtenay.
The site takes its name from an Indigenous village that once stood on the riverbank. Kus-kussum means slippery, likely a reference to algae-covered rocks by the river. Its heritage was honoured by a traditional ceremony to mark the start of demolition work. Eagle down was sprinkled to purify the area, once used as a cemetery.
It's all in sharp contrast to what is happening just a three-hour drive away in Fairy Creek. Comox Valley environmentalist Meaghan Cursons says that while she would never criticize the protesters for striving to defend forests, "we are in a different context here."
Much of the timberland in the area is privately owned, just as the Kus-kus-sum site was. That is unusual in British Columbia, where much of the land used for forestry is held by the Crown.
It means that instead of fighting the government over what parts of timberland should be conserved, local groups can negotiate with the companies to purchase sensitive tracts and protect them.
The group Ms. Cursons leads, the Cumberland Community Forest Society, has been buying up sections of local forest since 2000, quietly creating a natural haven next to the historic community of Cumberland, a growing mecca for hikers and mountain bikers just southwest of Courtenay.
The group's current projects include collecting data on the 10 local bat species, helping to protect thousands of tiny western toads that migrate from local lakes and wetlands into the forest, and raising money for a new purchase of land.
She says the work that she and others, like Mr. Ennis, have been doing is a combination of art and sport. "The art is raising all this money. The sport is racing against time to buy private land before it tips into the hands of people who are property-speculating."
The result at Kus-kus-sum should be spectacular. Workers will build trails and viewing platforms to help the public enjoy the site. They will plant thousands of native trees, shrubs and wetland plants. They will create channels and ponds leading to the marsh.
They will pull up the giant sheets of steel that form the killing wall and put a sloping riverbank in its place.
The migrating salmon will gain a fighting chance. Instead of being corralled by marauding seals, most will slip away through the swaying marine plants to live another day.

Full text: Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau is promising to deliver a wide-ranging package of measures to address housing affordability, including a policy that echoes the Conservatives' recent campaign pledge to ban foreign purchases of residential homes.
The Liberal Party's pledges on Tuesday include a new tax-free savings account for first-time home buyers, a $1-billion program to increase rent-to-own projects, and 25 per cent lower rates on CMHC mortgage insurance.
Under a "Home Buyers' Bill of Rights," the Liberals also promise to ban blind bidding on homes, require the disclosure of recent sale prices, and impose an antiflipping tax that would apply if a property was resold after less than 12 months.
The political bidding war for Canadian votes in the Sept. 20 federal election also includes an attempt to one-up the Conservative Party's campaign pledge to support the construction of one million homes over three years. The Liberal plan promises to build, preserve or repair 1.4 million homes over four years. The higher number would be achieved partly by adding a year to the Conservative timeframe and including repairs to about 130,000 homes, rather than new builds.
"We'll help you buy your first home sooner," Mr. Trudeau said in Hamilton. "If there's anything this pandemic has taught us, it is that home is a really important investment; a really important place for people to feel safe, to be able to build their future. ... It is still inaccessible for far too many people."
Housing affordability - the recent spike in home prices and the dearth of affordable rental units - has been a high-profile issue, and the parties are targeting their platforms accordingly.
Housing is prominent in the Conservative and NDP platforms, which have been made public.
The Liberals have not yet released a full platform.
But the challenge is that many housing decisions, such as zoning and building approvals, are primarily provincial and municipal responsibilities.
The proposals to ban foreign nationals from buying residential properties in Canada would escalate efforts to address concerns that international speculation is partly contributing to the rise in home prices.
The 2021 federal budget announced a national 1-per-cent tax on vacant or underused properties that are owned by people who are not Canadian or permanent residents, starting in 2022. The measure would be in addition to similar policies in some provinces.
The Liberal policy announced Tuesday would ban new foreign ownership of Canadian housing for two years. The party said this would give Ottawa time to work with provinces and municipalities on a framework to better regulate the role of foreign buyers in the housing market.
The Conservatives proposed a two-year pause on foreign purchases last week. The party would also encourage foreign investment in purpose-built rental housing that is affordable.
The Liberal government announced a national housing plan, but the impact has been "limited," funds remain unspent and affordability has worsened, according to a report released this month by the Parliamentary Budget Officer.
Mr. O'Toole said on Tuesday that the Liberals have a record of not delivering when it comes to addressing housing concerns.
"The housing crisis has exploded in the last three or four years under [Mr. Trudeau's] leadership.
He has had programs that have been ineffective in terms of affordable housing and in terms of programs for first-time homebuyers," he said. "We have a serious plan to tackle a serious crisis for our country. And after six years of inaction from Mr. Trudeau, more hollow words today is not what Canadians deserve."
Outside a Revera care centre in Mississauga, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh spoke on Tuesday morning about his party's promise to bring for-profit long-term care under the public umbrella.
Mr. Singh also said the housing crisis has worsened under the Liberals. "Housing has become more expensive, renting has become more expensive," he said. "Canadians can't afford another four years of broken promises from Justin Trudeau on housing."
The NDP promises to create at least 500,000 affordable housing units over 10 years, waiving the federal sales tax on the construction of affordable homes, and rent relief for lower-income families.
Murtaza Haider, a professor of data science and real estate management at Ryerson University, said restrictions on foreign home ownership would be welcome.
But he said data from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.
show foreign buyers influence only a small segment of the market.
"Restrictions on foreign homeownership are popular, yet their impact is marginal at best in the long run," Prof. Haider said.
Canada's housing problems are a result of an imbalance between supply and demand, he added, adding that over the past five decades, fewer homes have been built annually relative to the population than in the early 1970s. Canada has undersupplied housing while the population has grown, mostly owing to immigration, he said.
"If the math is done right, the Liberals are promising fewer than 5 per cent more dwellings than the Conservatives if we compare their platforms for the same duration of either three or four years," Prof. Haider said. "Furthermore, the Liberals might end up building fewer new homes than the Conservatives because the Liberal platform includes repairs and preservation, which does not necessarily add new homes."
Prof. Haider said it is encouraging the Liberals would attempt to restrict blind bidding and are promising other measures that would give buyers more control, a positive step in addressing house price inflation.
"At a time when the demand outstrips supply, homebuyers compete for fewer homes resulting in bidding wars," he said. "In Canada, buyers bid without knowing what others have bid, and influenced by the fear of missing out, they end up bidding, at times, hundreds of thousands of dollars more than the second highest offer."
Joanne Vanderheyden, president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM), said she is glad housing affordability is a campaign issue.
"We're pleased to see specific commitments in today's announcement by the Liberal Party of Canada that respond to our recommendations to work directly with local governments to increase affordable housing options for Canadians," she said.
To reach their target of 1.4 million homes, the Liberals say they would provide a $4-billion "housing accelerator fund" to municipalities to make more core urban land available. Other promises include doubling the National Housing Co-investment Fund for a total of $2.7-billion over four years; $600-million to convert empty office space to housing; and a new home-renovation tax credit for families adding a secondary unit for a live-in family member.

Full text: Commercial developers across Canada say they're determined to meet the challenges of climate change come hell or high water, but it's not always easy being green.
"There's more of an inherent responsibility among developers than ever before to build in ways that are climate friendly. That extends to operating buildings as well, using renewable resources to run the property," says Jonathan Gitlin, president of RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust, a $14billion enterprise that owns 289 properties, mostly retail.
According to Richard Joy, executive director of the non-profit Urban Land Institute, which provides advice and information to some 2,000 public- and privatesector members in the GTA, the entire sector is frustrated, and the "mishmash" of regulations and policies make it hard for builders and property managers to know what climate measures they should deploy, and which ones will be effective.
"It's a confusing road map, with policies that range from good intentions to low intentions, and misalignments of policies at different levels of government," Mr. Joy says.
"There's nothing that approaches standardization [of carbon measures], and therefore there's nothing yet that approaches accountability in our industry," he says.
Anything from bicycle storage in an office parking garage to a commitment to use cement that is produced using less carbon might count as a climate measure, but it can be hard to know what will make a difference and should become standard practice.
To try to bring some sense to this confusion, in early November, the ULI is holding a local industry-wide symposium on greenhouse gas and sustainability measures, just in advance of a United Nations summit meeting in Glasgow, where world leaders aim to develop tougher, enforceable climate measures.
Buildings and construction contribute nearly 40 per cent of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, and Canada's buildings, which require both heating and cooling, are particularly reliant on energy use, which in most cases produces carbon.
Earlier this month, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that: "It is indisputable that human influence has warmed the climate system, raising global surface temperature. ... Many weather and climate extremes such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall, droughts and tropical cyclones have become more frequent and severe."
As if to confirm the report's findings, more than 270 fires have been burning in British Columbia this summer, destroying homes and towns. Also this summer, severe flooding in Henan, China, killed more than 300 people after 201.9 millimetres of rain fell in one hour, while Western Canada's farmers are stricken by what may be the worst drought in history.
Meanwhile, giant firms such as RioCan are looking for ways to lower the carbon footprints of their properties and protect them from potential climate-related ravages. While not all weather-related building disasters are directly attributable to climate change, there is ample circumstantial evidence.
In June, 2021, for example, the Champlain Towers South building in Surfside, Fla., collapsed suddenly, killing 98 people, including four Canadians. Investigators have already said that sea levels in that area have been rising at three times the global average, which can affect a building's structural foundations.
Companies that invest and build real estate are noticing that the cost of ignoring climate change can mean higher insurance premiums and maintenance costs, as was pointed out in a 2019 study by investment firm BlackRock.
"Extreme weather and other climate-related events pose a risk to commercial real estate" that could also mean "reduced or even denied coverage if insurers shy away from underwriting risks that have become too great or uncertain. Investors need to get ahead of these risks," BlackRock's study said.
Investment firm Brookfield Asset Management Inc. has named former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney as its head of transition investing toward a postcarbon world.
"Climate change is an existential threat," Mr. Carney said in a 2019 interview conducted by the United Nations under his other role as the UN's Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance.
Companies that invest in solutions "will be rewarded," he said.
"Those who are lagging behind and are still part of the problem will be punished."
It's a message that smaller companies across Canada are taking to heart as well.
"We're a real estate company, but we're more. Real estate is a tool we use to create better neighbourhoods and to create a better planet," says Leslie Najgebauer, vice-president of impact and engagement for Tas, a developer with projects in the GTA.
"We've developed an ‘impact framework' to incorporate environmental, social and governance [ESG] factors across our business," she says.
The company's commitments include becoming carbon-neutral by 2045 and adopting benchmarks for operations that mesh with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, agreed on by the world body as the measures needed to secure a better future even sooner, by 2030.
In Western Canada, developers such as Cape Group say they are training their site staff in passive house - a voluntary standard developed in Europe to reduce a building's energy footprint.
"We're also using cross laminated timber [instead of steel girders]," says company president Reisa Schwartzman. "We have several buildings on the go and we're working toward being a leader in this method of construction, which cuts carbon footprints substantially," she says.
Developers need to take a holistic approach to building and managing properties, says Zeina Elali, associate and senior sustainability adviser at the Toronto office of Perkins & Will, a global design studio.
"We look at a building as a living design," she says. "We look at its sustainability - its impact - and then its resilience, how to adapt and forecast changes in climate and build this into the design.
"We also look at what the building will be like for the people inside, and we look at regeneration - using renewable resources, whether it's the sun's heat or reusing storm water. We look too at a building's embodied carbon - how much carbon is coming out of our design, what materials we can reuse and which materials are produced with less carbon," Ms. Elali adds.
"The development industry is trying not just to keep up with sustainability, but to raise the bar," says Jonathan Westende, chief executive officer of Windmill Developments, which has sustainability-focused projects in Toronto, Guelph, Ont., and Ottawa. He says he has been watching politicians dither about climate change for years - he started the company in 2003 - but he's optimistic that even if politicians waver, companies will get it together.
"What's driving sustainability now is capital markets," Mr. Westende says. "They're afraid about the risk profile of developments susceptible to climate and that's changing the types of investments they're willing to make.
"That's what will make a difference," he adds. As planet Earth continues its precarious journey toward sustainability, "will we do enough to steer the boat?" Special to The Globe and Mail

Topsy-turvy arts complex pitch merits further reflection: ARCHITOURIST

Full text: Imagine you come from a distant land. France, perhaps, or Spain, where old and new architecture co-exist and commingle, and cultural institutions are plentiful.
You journey across the ocean to a strange place called Toronto.
Your quest: To learn what makes Torontonians tick, to view what they hold dear and to understand them through their art. So, it's off to the Royal Ontario Museum, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Gardiner Museum, the Textile Museum of Canada and the Museum of Contemporary Art.
But you thirst for more. A friendly local points to the small galleries along Queen Street West, so you stagger along, barely sipping enough at each to sustain your soul.
And then you see it. Shimmering, glassy and ghost-like, it's a fantastical, upside-down building floating above its solid, red brick twin. A phantasmagoria that must be a fake projection - a Fata Morgana - since a conservative city such as this would never create such a wonder.
Move closer ... and it's real. An art gallery. A creation space. A fashion showplace. A bandshell facing a park. An oasis to feed even the most culture-savvy tourist.
But not yet.
Today, the red brick, 11,000square-foot decommissioned Postal Station C at 1117 Queen St.
W. sits empty. Colliers International, on behalf of the Crown corporation, has accepted bids and removed the listing. And, sadly, the group that wants to turn this beautiful, 1902 BeauxArts building by Port Hope, Ont.born Samuel George Curry (18541942) into an arts and culture centre did not make the short list.
"They don't have an obligation to pick any of the submissions," begins Aya Kitchens and Baths chief executive officer Dave Marcus, who led the charge.
"But they did go to a short list and so, on a simple level, maybe the deal is dead, but we're hoping that ... through government will, there might be a way to revisit [our bid]."
The government should.
Award-winning architect Paul Raff, known for his bold, challenging designs - his stacked vertical glass window at Cascade House and Limelight Bandshell at Lee Lifeson Art Park come to mind - has created a visionary complex that could only exist as a Queen West art space, and only across from the highly successful (and hipster headquarters) Drake Hotel.
"A city like Toronto needs these spaces to be relevant globally ... and why can't these spaces be right in the hub of things?" Mr. Marcus asks.
"So that was our approach to it, and so the people that we pulled together were, yes, people that have strong business backgrounds, but also have a real philanthropic interest in the project, and that's why I don't see this as having condos on top."
Mr. Raff adds that the old postal building sits isolated on its own little parcel of land, an art object that can be appreciated on all sides already, so to perform a facadectomy and attach a glass condominium on top would be an injustice.
But more bulk would be required, he admits: "We know that to make an arts facility that's going to have the vibrancy, and gravity, and excitement to make it work, it's going to have to be bigger than it is, so we could put a glass box on top - which we kind of did - but even the most beautifully crafted glass boxes in the world are all generic and have been done before."
So, taking cues from both the heritage of the street and the forest of new condo towers (which, ironically, in this very neighbourhood drove artists out from affordable loft buildings), the architect created something that "works with both" but is "Other ... very Other ... and really celebrates the heritage architecture."
Not only would a two-storey building become five-storey - the space between the 1902 building and its glassy mirage would rise a full storey and house a purposebuilt "black box" exhibition space - there would be a basement venue/exhibition space and, thanks to a curving spine climbing the south façade (which faces Lisgar Park), another half-storey on the roof. Here, a bar with incredible views could operate. In addition to housing practical things such as modern HVAC systems, data cable, fire stairs and a fly tower, this spine would extend floor plates and allow for a cavernous stage for musical or dramatic performances in the park.
"It's a kind of trio," Mr. Raff says. "It's the Beaux-Arts building, its reflection, and it's this curvaceous thing that comes up the back and over it ... it makes it eight times the facility."
Too good to be true? Too strange for politicians to climb on board? Acknowledging there is a "crisis" in the arts and culture community, Davenport MP Julie Dzerowicz recently called for a halt to the sale of 1117 Queen W.
to "consider the best interest of the local community."
Local councillor and Toronto deputy mayor Ana Bailao has also called for a halt, and has further requested that Canada Post leave the building in public hands "for the purpose of establishing a cultural and arts hub."
As of this writing, an online petition at Change.org has almost hit 1,800 signatures.
But will Mr. Raff's architectural mirage actually shimmer to life?
"This isn't something we're doing because it's a vanity project or we're specifically trying to get something out of it," Mr. Marcus finishes. "We're trying to help make a community centre, an arts and cultural organization, become manifest.
"At the end of the day, one part of it is the architectural vision, the other part is just the vision, what could this be, and who would use it and how, and I think that part of it has to be an open discussion."

Full text: The Canadian Real Estate Association says home sales cooled for their fourth consecutive month in July as new supply fell in about three quarters of all markets across the country.
The association said Monday that seasonally adjusted home sales totalled about 48,686 in July, down 3.5 per cent from 50,459 in June and off 28 per cent from their peak in March.
On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, home sales totalled 53,870, down 15.2 per cent from 63,5000 during the previous July.
CREA said the month-overmonth decline in sales July delivered was the smallest of four consecutive decreases since March, but the month was still the second-best July on record.
Christopher Alexander, Re/ Max Canada's senior vice-president, said the numbers show the real estate market is moving back to a typical cycle, where spring is busy and summer slows, but supply and demand are still unbalanced and people are tired from conditions earlier this year.
"There was such a frenzy in the early spring until halfway through April that turned a lot of people off because you were hearing about multiple offers constantly and huge sums of money over asking price being paid," he said.
"I've heard stories of people who are experienced investors, who've been looking for over a year and have put in more than 20 offers and still haven't found the home that they want."
Those on the hunt for a home had far less to choose from than they did in prior years or months.
The seasonally adjusted number of newly listed homes dropped 8.8 per cent to 65,757 in July from 72,137 in June.
On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, 69,322 homes were listed, an 18.9-per-cent drop from 85,448 last July.
The decline in new listings was led by markets like the Greater Toronto Area and Vancouver, which are known for being heated and regularly experience a frenzied pace in sales, along with Montreal and Calgary.
"Home sales continue to back off from extreme levels seen earlier in the year, but current activity is still historically strong and driving solid price growth in most markets," BMO Capital Markets senior economist Robert Kavcic said in a report.
"One could argue that some of those shifts went too far during the height of the madness, and we could see some undoing ahead, even if a lot of the underlying change is permanent."
While recent months have cooled the overall markets, there are still signs of strain.
The conditions seen in July tightened the sales-to-new listings ratio despite sales activity also slowing on the month, CREA said. The national sales-to-new listings ratio reached 74 per cent, up from 69.9 per cent in June.
The tightening of market conditions in July tipped a majority of local markets back into seller's market territory, reversing the more balanced nature many markets exhibited in June, CREA said.
The association found that the average price of a home sold reached $662,000 in July, up 15.6 per cent from the same month last year.
Excluding the GTA and Vancouver, the average price was $132,000 less, CREA said.
Mr. Alexander believes the next few months will be interesting because interest rates remain low and buying power is high, but prices are still expected to rise in many markets.
For example, the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board predicts the average home price will be $1,070,000 by the end of the year.
"I'm curious to see how the fall plays out," Mr. Alexander said.
"It's going to be strong, but what I'm curious to see is how many multiple offers happen and what kind of percentage over asking price people will pay."

Full text: While it has been emanating from below ground, those in the vicinity of Danforth and Bastedo Avenues have repeatedly noted two muffled sounds during the past year.
The first is chant-like, and seems to be something like "Kana Havah Mah Tanow" over and over; the other, more percussive, is similar to that of the Ipu gourd, traditionally struck during the Hawaiian hula dance.
Is some sort of rogue Polynesian school operating in Toronto's east end?
Nope, just me, Skipper Dave, a gaggle of split bamboo at my feet and brandishing a neighbour's borrowed brad nailer - rat-a-tattat-tat - as sweat runs down my forehead and I ask my chief mate, Shauntelle, "Can I have a mai tai now?" for the umpteenth time.
That mantra is a joke, of course, as there'll be no mixology until our private imbibing oasis is mostly complete ... which, gentle reader, might be around the same time you find yourself gripped by this tantalizing tale of a tiki bar's birth.
Our tale begins during the dog days of summer three years ago.
Pith helmets strapped on tight and an oil cloth real estate map in hand, we stopped our outrigger upon the discovery of an old variety store for sale. While neglected, it had good (pirate) bones. An excellent fit for our vintage furniture store, yes, but the high-anddry basement had a separate room that screamed for more than just storage ... or steerage.
Since the old Papaya Hut blade sign had been saved from the demolition of 513A Yonge St. a few years earlier, Ethel's Papaya Hut would be its name.
Years of research led up to this red-letter date. The Skipper, while living in Montreal in the mid-1990s, had co-led expeditions to Jardin Tiki, the Hawaii Kai Lounge at Bill Wong's and Tiki Doré (sadly all gone), and his chief mate had gained her tikilegs quickly upon meeting the Skipper in 2002 - so much so that, going forth, all vacations would include a trek to the local tropical-themed watering hole (jet-lagged at L.A.'s Tiki Ti in 2005; a romantic night in 2007 at Tonga Room in San Francisco; shaky legs back to the overpriced NYC hotel from Otto's Shrunken Head in 2009, etc.).
The Papaya Hut started unceremoniously, however, with enormous sheets of plywood.
While the hired man was applying those to two walls of brick - brad nails stick much better to plywood - he also constructed a tiny folded plate roof. Here, a simulation of thatched roofs would also offer a place to hang the garbage-picked trio of lanterns emblazoned with Asian characters.
He also cut an oval hole to allow for the future installation of a custom bamboo window (more on that later), and left one wall untouched, since there was much debate on whether it would contain a mural or some other visual treat as sweet as haupia pie.
After purchasing a counter with a bar sink on Facebook marketplace - which the Skipper installed - it was time to gather supplies for the build-out. Thankfully, we plucky Polynesian lovers didn't have to wait for the supply ship to dock; no, Bamboo Toronto on Bellamy Road had thatch, four-foot-by-eight-foot lauhala mats and rolls of bamboo panel matting.
In July, 2020, friends who'd already built a basement bar asked if we wanted to swing by to discuss the finer points of staple guns versus glue guns, while taking a peek at how their space had come together. Fortuitously, one of those friends, Steph Goulet, had taught himself tiki carving, so it was decided he would carve a long chair rail for the Hut. The rail would contain glyphs of martini glasses - Skipper's favourite cocktail - hibiscus flowers, harlequin-shapes, pinwheels and the Ethel's Papaya Hut monogram.
To achieve a dark and weathered look, Mr. Goulet taught the Skipper how to burn and brush these pieces, which was done a few days later with much giggling as the roofer's torch created quite the fire-show.
Unfortunately, as with all extracurricular activities, the time came when tools were laid to rest.
Over the next few months, only pictures were hung and the tiki mug collection was lined up on a high shelf.
Closer to Christmas, an old teak cabinet was transformed into a worthy vessel for the vintage stereo, and, once the decision was made to feature fake lava rock on the third wall, two big sheets of vacuum-formed plastic were secured thanks to a tip from a film-industry friend ... turns out there are secret warehouses with plastic sheets that mimic brick, flagstone, rubble or what have you.
Over the Christmas break the Skipper cut (what seemed like) a thousand small cylinders of bamboo in various diameters. In the spring of 2021, his chief mate taught herself how to tint and pour resin in those cylinders to create miniature stained-glass windows. A handy tube of construction adhesive turned these myriad parts into a magical oval window over the bar that, with the addition of a water-wave projector aimed at its backside, will make patrons feel as if they are underwater.
For the Hut's ceiling, joists were minimized with the addition of woggles with cheese holes made from plywood scraps ("woggle" is a term used to describe the biomorphic ceiling shapes of architect Morris Lapidus's famous 1950s Miami Beach hotels; cheese holes were simply holes to allow columns or lighting to poke through) and a fish net filled with flotsam.
A recent, sweaty push using modern power tools has put the finishing touches on this primitive room - which might be all of 400 square feet - to bring it closer to those first envisioned by "Trader" Vic Bergeron or Don the Beachcomber.
Yes, blood, sweat and a few tears have been shed in creating Ethel's Papaya Hut. But, when the first mai tais are finally raised, the only sound trickling up to the Danforth Avenue sidewalk will be that of laughter.

Full text: DONE DEAL 1103 Lake Bonavista Dr. SE., Calgary LAKE BONAVISTA Asking price: $799,000 (May, 2021) Selling price: $800,000 (May, 2021) Previous selling price: $545,000 (September, 2020) Taxes: $3,874 (2020) Days on the market: four Listing agents: Tarek Hageahmad and Abe Elhage, Century 21 Bravo Realty Buyers' agent: Joel Gwillim, CIR Realty THE ACTION Agent Joel Gwillim escorted his clients through about a dozen turnkey houses on large properties in Calgary's various lake communities. But the standout was this renovated, threebedroom house on a 65-footby-100-foot lot that hit the market when both parties were out of town. Online marketing material reassured them that it was worth buying as soon as possible.
"That's the beauty of modernday real estate - you can take virtual tours and look at really good pictures to get a good feel for a property," Mr. Gwillim said. "We were in competition with somebody else, so we knew we'd have to play ball on price.
"We sweetened the deal by having an unconditional offer, so it was easy for the seller to take it."
WHAT THEY GOT This 1,343-squarefoot house was built in 1971.
But in the past few years, it was refitted with new features throughout, complete with an updated façade, rear decks and double garage. The kitchen and three bathrooms were modernized, and the foyer was redone on the landing between the main and lower levels. Entertaining areas on both floors were also refreshed with floor-to-ceiling fireplaces.
"This was bi-level, so you had a good amount of space up and down," Mr. Gwillim said. "The fact it was all done was icing on the cake."
Annual homeowner association fees of $325 cover maintenance of local parks and lake.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "It's an in-demand area because it has larger lots, larger homes, and the lake privileges, which a lot of people like to have not knowing the summer's future," Mr. Gwillim said.
"If we're in any sort of lockdown, at least they had somewhere fun to go that was local."

Drive-throughs an adjustment, not a stampede

Full text: When the COVID-19 pandemic was declared in March, 2020, experts predicted a revival of drive-in movies and a major shift by retailers to build drive-through and curbside pickup facilities.
Although the shift is not as big as some retailers expected, there are signs of change that will likely be long-lasting.
A survey conducted by McKinsey and Company found that last summer, 23 per cent of Canadians said they used drive-through restaurant service either for the first time or more than before the pandemic, 18 per cent did the same for curbside meal pickup and 27 per cent went to curbside locations to pick up goods they ordered online.
Meanwhile, many retail and food outlets have modified their parking lots and lanes, and there are still 37 drive-in theatres in Canada.
This summer, you can pull up the minivan to the Starlite Drivein in Stoney Creek, Ont., and choose from among three double features. There are also special film events, such as drive-in movies at Ontario Place in Toronto, which opened in 2020 and earlier this summer in response to pandemic indoor theatre closings.
Elsewhere there are sparks of drive-in creativity. In Amenia, N.Y., for example, about an hour north of New York City, a retrofacility called Four Brothers Drive-in welcomes not only cars, but also overnight campers and walk-ins who can bring chairs and blankets and enjoy movies under the stars.
In Vaughan, Ont., north of Toronto, SmartCentres launched a summer series of free drive-in movies every Thursday and Saturday through September at ArtWalk as part of SmartVMC, a 100-acre planned city centre site being developed at the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre near the northernmost TTC subway station. The SmartCentres site also has food trucks and 30,000 square feet of Instagram-friendly mural art.
The goal of the movies and the art is not to be car-friendly or COVID-19-safe, though the site is both, says Mandy Mail, vice-president of marketing for SmartCentres, but to create an attractive destination in advance of a development of four mixed-use buildings and a nine-acre park, slated to be built this decade.
"We're creating the destination in advance for people to enjoy, and we're making it art-inspired," Ms. Mail says.
It's another example of how, while developers have acted quickly to come up with pandemic-era drive-through facilities, it's not really a cohesive trend. People idle their engines at drivethroughs for their doubledoubles and lattes, but they did that before the pandemic, too.
As lockdowns start to ease and people drift back into stores, restaurants and cinemas, the move toward more widespread drive-in business is turning out to be more of an adjustment than a stampede, says Jonathan Gitlin, chief executive officer at RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust.
Nevertheless, "going forward, we think that some of this change is here to stay," he adds. The McKinsey study found that 70 per cent of Canadians who tried a new shopping method since the pandemic say they intend to continue it after restrictions are lifted.
Retail and commercial developers are finding that they need to accommodate people who don't want to go inside. Since early 2020, RioCan has set up designated curbside pickup parking spots in its malls, and retailers have set up systems for motorists to phone or text and have merchandise loaded into their cars.
Even such subtle changes are a major undertaking for a company such as RioCan, which owns 289 properties, most of them retail/ commercial, with 44 million square feet of leasable space.
"When the pandemic started, we recognized that our customers, who are our tenants, needed to enable people to shop without coming into stores," Mr. Gitlin says. "We had to change our parking-lot configurations [to] set up spaces for people collecting goods."
"We've learned during COVID that consumers like having some control over the goods they purchase, which they don't always have when they have something delivered to their homes," he adds.
"On the other hand, during COVID they didn't necessarily want to go into stores. We think bringing things to them in their cars is a trend that has legs. This is despite noticing that many people began lining up at shops when governments okayed indoor shopping a few weeks ago."
According to Eric Baxter, a developer and restaurant investor in Amenia, where the retro-drive-in theatre is located, COVID-19 did not affect retail and restaurant patterns in the semi-rural region as much as in bigger cities.
"We built a local coffee shop that includes drive-through and in-store pickup and a number of outdoor tables, but these are features that were planned before COVID happened," Mr. Baxter says.
"These were always part of a long-term trend, but for retail developers, the pandemic may have sped up the timeline a bit. But I haven't seen a lot of evidence of developers saying that COVID has changed things forever in the way they design buildings," he adds.
At the same time, developers say that they're anxious to design and build projects that don't cater to car culture the way earlier malls and food stands did.
"You can drive to ArtWalk, but we also want people to come on the subway, on their bikes and on foot," Ms. Mail says about the new Vaughan food and movie destination.
"Here, we're actually seeing zoning that eliminates the allowance for drive-throughs. In the future, people may look at our cities and ask why we configured everything just for cars," Mr. Baxter says.
Mr. Baxter, Mr. Gitlin and Ms. Mail agree that if there's any trend, it's less toward drivethroughs and curbside service and more toward expanding outdoor dining space.
"We're learning how much people love being outdoors," Mr. Baxter says.
In fact, Mr. Gitlin says, one lesson the pandemic has taught us is that people like being outside so much that designers are conceiving projects that blur the distinction between being inside and outside the building.
He points to The Well, a mixedused project under way on King Street West in Toronto. The RioCan/Allied Properties Real Estate Investment Trust development is designed to create a seamlessness between indoors and outdoors.
Whether people walk in, drive up or get served outside, the goal is the same, and it's one that the pandemic has reinforced, Mr. Gitlin says. "We want people to come to a place where they feel comfortable and safe."

Full text: The Catholic Church in Canada has billions of dollars in assets across the country, a Globe and Mail investigation has found, suggesting it has ample means to help in reparations for Indigenous communities and reconciliation efforts to address the legacy of residential schools and the abuse that thousands of children suffered there.
To investigate its wealth, The Globe and Mail procured tax filings for thousands of Catholic Church organizations from the Canada Revenue Agency, and worked with the research organization Charity Intelligence Canada to arrive at an overall financial picture for the Roman Catholic Church in Canada.
The calculation reveals the vast combined assets of Catholic organizations in the country. In all, 3,446 registered Catholic Church charities - mostly dioceses and parishes - received a total of $886-million in donations in 2019, making them combined the largest charitable organization in the country. All told, 2019 net assets - the sum of cash, investments, property and other holdings, after accounting for liabilities such as debts and loans - are valued at a minimum of $4.1-billion. (The number does not account for the assets of Catholic organizations such as monasteries.)
"These are staggering numbers," says Kate Bahen, managing director of Charity Intelligence, a registered charity that provides analysis and ratings on the finances and transparency of Canada's charity sector.
The Catholic Church's share of a national residential schools settlement reached in 2006, meant to go toward healing and reconciliation efforts, amounted to $29-million in cash, $25-million in church in-kind services, and $25-million from a fundraising campaign. That campaign raised just $3.7-million.
According to Ms. Bahen, donations to the Catholic Church in recent years have been so substantial that about one dollar of every $20 in charitable giving each year goes to Roman Catholic charities.
The Catholic Church has a decentralized structure in Canada, with each diocese operating as an autonomous entity over which a diocesan bishop has authority. As such, it has said that responses on the residential school issue are best left to the local level. The bishops are members of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, which is the national assembly of bishops, although they are not accountable to the CCCB.
Lawyers representing the church have long cited a lack of funds when it comes to compensation related to residential school survivors. In 2014, the federal government took legal action against the dozens of Catholic organizations that ran the schools, saying they still had outstanding financial obligations at a time when the other churches that ran the schools - United, Anglican and Presbyterian - had met their obligations. A lawyer for various Catholic entities told The Globe in 2016 that many of them were near bankruptcy.
The Catholic Church is facing renewed scrutiny over its role in running a majority of the country's residential schools, which separated Indigenous children from their families in a system designed to strip them of their language and culture. Discoveries of more than 1,200 probable unmarked graves containing human remains at or near several former residential school sites in Canada over the past few months have sparked outrage and grief. The findings rekindled a discussion on reparations, and what the Catholic Church, which ran most of the schools, could do to make amends.
Along with analyzing the church's finances, The Globe spoke with more than two dozen experts, including lawyers, scholars, bishops, Indigenous leaders, analysts and residential school survivors, combed through court documents and reports to get a sense of how past settlement deals and court challenges played out, and scrutinized reparation efforts in other countries.
Many Indigenous leaders and members of the Catholic community want a more significant response from the church after the $25-million fundraising campaign came up short. They say they would like to see more substantive funding that could go toward scholarships, healing, language and cultural programs, and investigations into the deaths of children at the schools.
"The waypoint for meaningful reconciliation is to address reparations, reconstruction funding and redress," said Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a law professor and academic director of the University of British Columbia-based Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre. For example, "just the cost of addressing unmarked burials and the investigation of those sites will involve millions of dollars that First Nations communities do not have, and should not be expected to raise to investigate their own genocide."
Chief Bobby Cameron of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations in Saskatchewan is calling for a swift response from the Catholic Church to address the intergenerational trauma of residential schools.
"We would like to see immediate action, whether they take it out of their own pockets, or whatever it may be. If the will is there, and the sincerity is there, and the heart is there from the Catholic Church in Canada, they will find a way," he said.
Given the scale of the harms, he added, a response should be far more than the original $25-million of the fundraising campaign.
"I would say in excess of $500million. Because there are a lot of survivors and descendants - there are hundreds of thousands of people affected by this. There's a lot of healing and initiatives [needed] to help our First Nations move forward."
THE THREE OBLIGATIONS Canada's residential schools operated for more than a century, with at least 150,000 First Nations, Métis and Inuit children torn from their homes and forced to attend; many were forbidden to speak their language or practice their culture.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) called it a policy of cultural genocide. The last school closed only a few decades ago, in 1996, the TRC said.
The National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation has documented more than 4,100 children's deaths at residential schools - many from disease, neglect, malnutrition and abuse - and estimates thousands more died.
By the early 1900s, death rates among children were so high that some officials in the federal government and the Protestant churches wanted to have day schools instead. The plan "foundered for lack of Roman Catholic support," the commission's 2015 report said.
Catholic entities ran about 60 per cent of the schools, which were mostly funded by the federal government. The church has faced mounting criticism over its role.
In addition to their failure to raise their share of funds for healing programs, the Catholic entities have also come under fire for not sharing historical records that are crucial to learning the identities of the children who died and their cause of death, nor has the Pope issued a formal, public apology.
The federal government has paid $3.2-billion in individual settlements, and divided an additional $1.9-billion among all survivors as part of the settlement reached in 2006. In a side deal, Catholic entities agreed to three financial obligations: $29-million in cash payments; $25-million worth of "in-kind" services; and to make their best efforts to raise the $25-million for healing projects. Together, the three obligations were "a sweetheart deal for the Catholic Church," said London, Ont., lawyer Rob Talach, who has represented survivors in clergy abuse lawsuits.
The fundraising campaign took in $3.7-million, just 15 per cent of its goal.
In a 2014 court case in Saskatchewan, federal government lawyers alleged Catholic officials had improperly redirected funds meant for residential school survivors toward legal and administrative fees, The Globe reported last week. After more than a year in court, the judge released the Catholic entities from their remaining settlement obligations.
Some bishops have vowed to restart the fundraising campaign and work toward the $25-million.
The Globe asked six bishops for comment. Five were unavailable or didn't respond. Bishop Thomas Dowd of Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., said he is in favour of a national campaign. The Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops declined a request to interview its president, Archbishop Richard Gagnon, saying he is unavailable.
In an e-mailed response, Archbishop Gagnon did not directly answer questions on past fundraising or whether the church would consider selling assets or allocating permanent funding for healing and reconciliation programs for Indigenous peoples.
In 2019, the most recent year for which data are available, church entities' revenue - their combined donations, government funding, investment returns and other income sources - amounted to $1.52-billion. That year, they also declared a surplus, or profit, of $110-million.
Only 138 Canadian companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange reported more than the Catholic Church's revenue in 2019, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The church entities' declared revenue to the Canada Revenue Agency puts them in the company of household names such as Cineplex Inc. and Corus Entertainment Inc., which brought in $1.67-billion and $1.69-billion respectively.
Yet despite the church's wealth, the figures calculated by Charity Intelligence are still "absolutely" a conservative count, Ms. Bahen said.
They exclude the finances of monasteries and nunneries. They also exclude charities that don't raise a lot of money or have much property, which aren't required to submit as detailed a tax filing to the Canada Revenue Agency.
Charity Intelligence's financial analysis reveals much of the Catholic Church's assets are locked up in real estate. Land and property holdings alone accounted for $3.3-billion in assets in 2019. But, Ms. Bahen said that figure is also "significantly understated."
For example, several organizations declare the combined value of their properties to the CRA as $1.
The Archdiocese of Toronto for years has declared $2 in property assets in its charity filings, even for new buildings. But its 2020 audited financial statements, which are available upon request from the CRA, show nearly $940-million in property.
Declaring the value of all its property, including newer buildings, at $2 contravenes accounting standards, according to the archdiocese's outside auditor - a practice Ms. Bahen said she had never seen before. A note in the audited statements explains that this is done because the archdiocese expects the properties - from parish churches and offices to St. Michael's Cathedral Basilica - to be used indefinitely.
Neil MacCarthy, a spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Toronto, said the organization stands by its accounting choices. "As stewards of the funds entrusted to the archdiocese by parishioners," he wrote in an e-mail, "our goal is to sustain the properties that have been funded and developed by the local Catholic community over the past two centuries for their intended use - to gather for worship and offer charitable outreach to the community at large."
Despite the way many church properties are declared to the CRA, some have netted large sums when sold.
In 2004, the Sisters of Charity of Montreal, known as the Grey Nuns, sold their motherhouse to Concordia University for $18-million. The Archdiocese of Toronto's 2018 audited financial statements noted it had struck a deal to sell one parish's real estate to a developer for a minimum of $44-million.
As part of his litigation work, Mr. Talach, the London lawyer, has sometimes examined the books of Catholic organizations across Canada, and said he has been surprised by their wealth - "especially in real estate holdings."
During one case, Mr. Talach obtained audited financial statements for the Diocese of London, in Ontario. Those statements, which were made public as part of the court proceedings, showed that in 2002, the organization held $99-million in capital assets, including land and buildings.
The fact that Catholic entities managed to raise only $3.7-million for their $25-million best-efforts campaign is "disgraceful and disingenuous," he says.
"We're talking about vast wealth, even at the individual diocese level. To say that across the nation they couldn't come up with [the money] is insulting to anyone with even basic understanding of the operations and the finances of the Catholic Church in Canada."
The church has found funds for some priorities. In September, 2016 - the year after the residential school fundraising campaign concluded - St. Michael's Cathedral Basilica reopened in Toronto after a restoration.
The project took five years - overlapping with the seven-year residential school fundraising campaign. The renovation included 13 new statues, a handpainted ceiling with gold-leafed stars, a new balcony and a custom-built organ with 4,143 pipes - at a cost of $128-million, more than 30 times what was raised for residential school survivors' healing programs.
‘A GROUNDSWELL WITHIN THE CHURCH' As a Catholic, Lorraine Whitman has been to the Vatican several times to attend midnight mass and reaffirm her faith.
Ms. Whitman, a member of Glooscap First Nation in Nova Scotia and president of the Native Women's Association of Canada, has seen the splendour of the cathedrals, and has wondered why that wealth has not been shared to help those who suffered harms from the church.
"I just feel so sickened to know all of the psychological, physical, emotional abuse and traumatization that our Indigenous children have gone through," she said. "I have seen those beautiful paintings, I have seen all of their collections, all of their treasures that they have. One painting, if that were sold, do you know how far those dollars would go in the healing of our communities?" It's difficult to pinpoint the global wealth of the Catholic Church. At the Vatican, the Sistine Chapel and works by Michelangelo, St. Peter's Basilica and the art in its museums are considered priceless. Last month, the Vatican revealed for the first time that it owns more than 5,000 properties.
In Canada, frustration is growing in the Catholic community over the response from church leaders on residential schools.
Petitions and open letters continue to gain signatures - one calling for churches to compensate communities that lost children at the residential schools has more than 40,000 signatures; another by Catholics calling for the church to offer to pay for reinterment of the children's bodies has 6,500. Some are calling for a boycott of donations, or that the church's taxexempt status be revoked.
"There's a groundswell within the church, to the leaders, who seem a bit more reluctant than many of the members ... to say we must meet our commitments, and I'm hoping that there will be some action on that," said Mayo Moran, a law professor who is provost and vice-chancellor of Trinity College at the University of Toronto.
The Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (CCCB), she says, "really need to show more leadership on this. Invite the Pope to come, get that money together, address the records - those are the things that need to be done." Instead, she characterizes the response so far from the conference as "reluctant." The CCCB's main roles are to assist bishops in joint action and co-ordinate charitable initiatives.
In a June interview, The Globe asked the CCCB's Archbishop Gagnon about the potential for a national fundraising campaign and whether the church would pledge money. At the time, he said local efforts were more appropriate; he said he couldn't respond to a question on whether the church would contribute funds through assets or cash holdings.
"A lot of Catholics think that's inadequate," said Prof. Moran, who is the former chair of the committee that oversaw the compensation process for survivors under the residential schools settlement agreement. "They want their church to step up and do more. It really doesn't reflect well on the church, unfortunately ... I suspect that people believe that they are protecting the church from liability. But my sense is that it's really undermining the church's moral legitimacy.
"This is a failure of leadership," she said.
When asked about overall finances across Canada, Archbishop Gagnon said in the e-mail that CCCB "does not keep a collection of financial statements" for Canadian Catholic charities. He said bishops from many dioceses have indicated interest in local or regional fundraising campaigns, and that it is "encouraged" by the start of fundraising drives in Toronto, Calgary and Saskatchewan.
The CCCB has distanced itself from the residential school issue.
Its website notes that each diocese and religious community is corporately and legally responsible for its own actions. "The Catholic Church as a whole in Canada was not associated with the residential schools, nor was the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops."
Bishop Dowd of Sault St. Marie said he would prefer a national fundraising campaign, as it would be an opportunity to build awareness among parishioners, especially new Canadians, and solidarity, and that this should be a continuing initiative, not a oneoff.
He said a "duck and cover" approach amid growing public outrage is not the best response. "I'm not in favour of press releases that sound like they were written in a corporate laboratory," he said. "I think we need to express our own broken hearts." Other countries are grappling with past atrocities, and churches' role in them.
Australia's Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse uncovered decades of horrific abuses by Roman Catholic priests. In 2018, an investigation by The Sydney Morning Herald found the church had grossly underestimated its property values in evidence to the commission, which the Herald said raised questions about whether the church was trying to protect assets and minimize compensation to victims. It identified church-owned properties in the state of Victoria alone at about 7-billion Australian dollars ($6.5billion).
In the United States, a national discussion is under way over reparation proposals for African Americans. In March, the Jesuits - a religious order of the Roman Catholic Church - pledged to raise US$100-million toward reconciliation efforts, to make amends for its role in the enslavement of Black people. In April, the House Judiciary Committee approved legislation to create a commission that will study reparations to the descendants of slaves.
In Canada, several bishops have issued apologies for residential schools, and some religious orders have offered to share historical documents.
The United Church of Canada has a policy that a minimum 10 per cent of the proceeds of all property sales go toward reconciliation initiatives, including a healing fund. It has also set aside money each year for reconciliation programs, and said last month it approved $3-million to help finance investigations of unmarked graves at residential schools.
MOVING FORWARD Cora Voyageur still remembers the number that the nuns assigned to her as a nine-year-old at the Holy Angels Indian Residential School in Fort Chipewyan, Alta.: 21. Her sister was No. 19; her youngest sister was No. 45.
She remembers being called "savage," and the constant fear of beatings. "There was this underlying feeling of unease and anxiety and the idea that you could get whacked at any time," she said.
"You did not feel safe."
More than five decades later, the residential school survivor, who is a member of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation and a sociology professor at the University of Calgary, wonders why substantive responses from Catholic Church leaders are still so tepid, especially given that Catholic entities ran most of the schools.
Funding from the church toward, for example, better access to postsecondary education, could have a transformative effect on young Indigenous people, she said.
Funding could also go toward identifying the children in the unmarked graves, and determining how they died. Some entities have recently promised to share documents - after years of requests - but there are still costs associated with collecting and digitizing them, said Raymond Frogner, head of archives at the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation.
Several entities - such as the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, a religious order that ran many of the schools - have said they don't have the funds to do this, and thus far the church has not offered to cover costs.
"The Catholic Church itself could surely find some funds to do this of all things, right? If you really want to be accountable, now's your chance to actually pay for the costs of making these records available," Mr. Frogner said, adding that about $100,000 would be needed.
Several of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 94 calls to action ask churches to step up.
No. 61 says they should work with survivors and Indigenous groups to establish permanent funding for initiatives such as projects for healing, language revitalization and education, and for Indigenous youth to explore their spirituality and self-determination.
Funding for healing programs could also revive a once-powerful Indigenous organization. The Aboriginal Healing Foundation, which existed from 1998 to 2014, was a national Indigenous-led organization dedicated to community-building and healing. The foundation disbursed about $610million to more than 1,500 programs. It was shut down late in 2014, when the Harper government let its funding lapse.
The foundation was to receive most of the $29-million cash transfer that was among the Catholic Church's commitments under the residential schools settlement. But the money was hard won, according to Mike DeGagné, president of the national Indigenous charity Indspire and former executive director of the Aboriginal Healing Foundation. When the time came for the Catholic Church to give the foundation the funding, "the phone went absolutely silent," he said. The foundation had to plead with the church to release its money.
To Mr. DeGagné, organizations such as the foundation are sorely needed today. "On the day that the Aboriginal Healing Foundation closed and all those projects were forced to close down, there were almost 1,000 employees within those programs in communities," Mr. DeGagné said.
"That's 1,000 employees that were accountants, HR people, directors, counsellors, elders and people who were doing something or being trained.
"What I'd like to see is institution building," he said. "Indigenous organizations that can make real change."
Cora Voyageur, the residential school survivor in Alberta, wants to see fulfilling change, and a bold, new direction. "Let's build a new relationship," she said. "One based on respect, and equality."

Full text: When an athlete reaches their shelf life due to injury or age, a career in real estate is often a sustainable fit, and because so many of their peers are already working in the industry, it's already a supportive environment.
Victoria-based rugby sevens player Lucas Hammond just returned from Tokyo, where he played in his first Olympics. The team made it to the quarter-final, but Canada lost to New Zealand 21-10, which was a blow, Mr. Hammond says.
Although he's now unsure of his future in rugby, he's officially joined the ranks of athletes who have made real estate a second career.
The 27-year-old had obtained his real estate licence late last year, after the pandemic delayed the 2020 Olympics and left him wondering if he'd ever get to Tokyo. The team had qualified for the Olympics in early March, 2020, and a week later, everything went into lockdown, so he decided the time was right.
"It was a crazy time, but I had started the real estate course before that because I was planning on doing it after the Olympics, anyway," Mr. Hammond says, the day after returning from Tokyo.
"I had nothing else to do, so I powered through the course, got through it last summer, wrote the exam in September and had my licence by November."
When training for the Olympics, Mr. Hammond was running from his 6 to 11 a.m. rugby session in Langford, where the team is based, to property showings between there and Victoria, where he lives. He kept a change of clothes in his car.
Juggling rugby with the job could have been more challenging if his realtor teammate wasn't also an athlete. He had joined former football player Alex Carroll's Carroll Group, which works with Engel & Völkers Vancouver Island.
Throughout his rugby career, Mr. Hammond has had to look for jobs that fit with his schedule, including work in construction and restaurant jobs. Secondary jobs are a necessity for most players, a fact that kept him humble, he says.
Now that he's a realtor, he's planning to donate a portion of each sale to underprivileged young rugby players, because he saw too many youth give up early because of the costs of the sport.
"That was a big draw for me, to join a team, to work in a team environment again, instead of going it alone," Mr. Hammond says.
Other reasons athletes often make the transition to real estate is they have a naturally entrepreneurial drive, and they excel at building relationships with all kinds of people, says Mr. Carroll, a former Canadian Football League player. Since he was a kid, he only ever wanted to play football, and a scholarship took him to Queen's University, where he got a bachelor's in political science. He considered a career in law, but went on to play with the Saskatchewan Roughriders and then the Montreal Alouettes, where he quickly blew out his knee in training. Mr. Carroll, who is 29, got started in real estate after that career-ending injury, four years ago.
Unlike Mr. Hammond, Mr. Carroll's sports career ended abruptly, which he thinks might be an easier transition.
"They flew me home, I came back to Victoria and I enrolled in the real estate course right way.
This career had always been in the back of my mind, just because I had a bit of an entrepreneurial spirit. I felt like that was part of my DNA. I was a football player. I was never the most talented. I'm just a small white kid from Victoria. I never had those physical attributes that I would have been able to get by on. I really had to work on it. What I prided myself on was just the fact that I was willing to outwork the next guy.
"So, I just knew that as long as I got into anything entrepreneurial, where I was my own business and I could lead the charge, so to speak, I would have some measure of success. I always felt confident that that was going to be the case."
For an athlete, it's not just a matter of changing jobs. There's the question of identity, he adds.
"Someone once told me that every athlete dies twice ... I lived and breathed football from the time I was 7 until I was something like 25 ... People knew me as a football player. Not to say I didn't have other characteristics.
I would talk about other things.
But that was my identity. That was the thing I woke up and got excited about every day.
"So the second that that ends, you do have to go through a bit of a period where you reinvent and begin to tell a new story about who you are. It was easy for me to make that transition because it was cut and dry, I could walk away. I knew I was never going to play again. I was injured. It didn't make sense for me to continue to pursue it.
"I will be curious to see how Lucas approaches that same thing because he's been doing both for the better part of a year now, and continuing to pursue rugby, while beginning his new career in real estate. It's a softer transition for him." Mr. Carroll was supportive of Mr. Hammond's schedule and his determination to get to the Olympics.
They had met a few times, and he decided to invite him to join his company because of what he had achieved as an athlete. He had also been looking to expand. Business has been good. He recently sold a house at 3680 Crestview Rd. in Oak Bay for $177,000 over the listed price, for $1.476-million.
"There are certain things about who he is as a person and how he's carried himself to reach this level, and in some ways it's the biggest stamp of approval that I can see, and I know what it takes," Mr. Carroll says. "Top eight in the world is not so shabby."
There is a long history of athletes throughout North America who have made the move into real estate, from all sports. Within Engel & Völkers alone, former athletes include Major League baseball players Jim Bruske and Adam Kennedy, CFL player Chris Burns, and American football player Beau Blankenship. Closer to home, Ryan Cochrane, twotime Olympic medalist for the swim team, has been working as a Victoria realtor for the past four years. And Mr. Hammond's teammates Harry Jones and Connor Braid built a new commercial brokerage in Victoria for the past year, also while training for the Olympics.
As part of a sports-loving family, Mr. Hammond started playing rugby at age 7, in South Africa, where his parents worked as missionaries. He'd play barefoot, and he loved it. They returned to Toronto when he was 12 years old, and he continued to play for a local club. He says the toughest part of starting out in real estate is getting the first listings, which means building a network and getting his name out there, spending money on ad campaigns, and travelling further afield, to Sooke once a week.
After training sessions, he went door to door and dropped hundreds of letters in mailboxes, often hobbling because he was sore after a morning on the turf.
He can't complain, though.
He's witnessing a market that is going crazy for luxury real estate, and that's his new goal.
"Right now I'm working my ass off every day but residential higher end is what I'm aiming for," he says. "The amount of buyers buying unseen is crazy, out of this world right now. Buying these multimillion-dollar homes on a FaceTime call."
His ability to quickly recover from losses will likely help him through the challenges of a real estate career, he says.
"In sevens, especially, with so many games happening so fast, you can't dwell on one. You need to regroup and move on to the next one, or you fail at the next one as well. I can definitely see that parallel with real estate. You get rejected every day, and you just need to regroup and move on and keep focused on the end goal."
Mr. Carroll said the turnover rate for new realtors is high. Not everyone can deal with the highpressure hustle required.
"I also would say more than anything else, it always comes down to, what has your history of discipline been? Because there are a lot of aspects of this job that aren't super glamorous ... such as having tough conversations with people and picking up the phone and making calls even when you're not feeling so good.
There are a lot of highs and lows."
But he agrees with Mr. Hammond that the pressure to overcome failure and immediately get back out there works for the athlete mindset.
"When we came into the CFL, they told us that the average CFL career was one year. It's injuries, it's turnover."
Football careers are often fleeting, he says.
"It's a cut-throat business, and it's a performance-based business, and every week you're kind of on the chopping block. So if you are on the team at the start of the year, generally you see a new group of guys in the locker room every week. That's the nature of it. So it can be difficult, and it's a high pressure environment, and so a great experience for me."

Point Grey mansion sets record in Vancouver with $42-million sale

Full text: DONE DEAL 4743 Belmont Ave., Vancouver POINT GREY Asking price: $58-million Selling price: $42-million Previous selling price: Not available Days on market: Undisclosed Taxes: Upward of $200,000 Listing agent: Christa Frosch, Sotheby's International Realty Canada THE ACTION The mansion belonged to prominent philanthropists Joseph and Rosalie Segal.
Because it's an exclusive market that demands privacy, details of the sale are not public, listing agent Christa Frosch said. She would not say how long the home took to sell, but there are previous reports that it had been on the market in 2017 for $63-million.
The house was listed privately and about 30 parties viewed it. The buyer is listed as a numbered company, with its sole director being the founder of Vancouver-based Primacorp Ventures, Peter Chung.
The $42-million sale price represents the highest selling price of a home on a single-family lot in Greater Vancouver, according to Sotheby's. The deal completed some time in July.
"On a global level, when you think about what Canada has to offer versus other countries, we are still very reasonably priced for luxury, safety and privacy," Ms. Frosch said. "I think that's a really good thing to keep in perspective."
WHAT THEY GOT Built more than 20 years ago on a 1.3-acre lot, this nearly 22,000square-foot house has five bedrooms and 12 bathrooms. And inspired by French royalty, the place comes with a sweeping staircase, massive crystal chandeliers, plaster ceiling mouldings and columns, polished stone floors, and a garden inspired by the Palace of Versailles.
It also offers spectacular views of the North Shore Mountains, which is what makes Point Grey one of Vancouver's priciest neighbourhoods.
"When you own a home in this price point, buying the home is only part of it because you have to keep it up at a high level," Ms. Frosch said. "So the operating cost of a house like this is a lot."
THE AGENT'S TAKE "I think our pricing will only continue to go up," Ms. Frosch said. "I think as far as local people within Canada moving from provinces, they are looking at opportunities. And on a global level, we are a very [well] thought of country and it will continue, our pricing and demand for homes, and luxury homes, in particular."

Full text: Toronto's housing market extended its slowdown in July with the fourth straight month of declining sales and flattening prices, as the province reopened more widely and the desperation to find bigger properties eased.
There were 9,390 home resales in the Toronto region in July, down 15 per cent from the same month last year, and down 2 per cent from June on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board, or TRREB. Condos, with prices typically lower than houses, were the only type of property to see an increase in sales year over year.
Across the Toronto area, the average selling price of a home was $1,062,256, a 12.6-per-cent increase from July of last year and 0.9 per cent above June on a seasonally adjusted basis.
The home price index, which adjusts for volatility in pricing and sales, was $1,054,300, marking the second straight month of no movement after spiking 5 per cent in January.
"The motivation to sell or buy has gone down quite a bit. The urgency is not there," said Katie Steinfeld, realtor with On The Block Realty Inc., who works in the Toronto region. Ms. Steinfeld said that change in sentiment started when the province began to reopen in the summer and Ontarians were able to leave their homes for non-essential activities such as patio dining.
The number of new home listings was down 31 per cent year over year. But even though there was less inventory, there were also fewer buyers willing to get into frenzied bidding wars. "If it is going to be a bidding war, they are shying away and not wanting to compete. Buyers are coming in with lower offers," she said.
The stricter mortgage stress test that was instituted in June had little to no effect on the current slowdown given that the rule changes were so small, realtors said.
Christopher Alexander, senior vice-president with Re/Max Canada, said this year is turning out to be similar to a pre-COVID year with slower activity in the summer. Mr. Alexander said that although there is still competition and multiple offers taking place, there is a sense of calm compared with the pandemic-fuelled housing boom that started in May of 2020.
"There isn't as much as ‘I have to buy now or I will miss out.' People have more things to think about and do than just real estate," he said.
Both Mr. Alexander and Ms. Steinfeld believe activity will pick up in the fall.
The board's chief market analyst, Jason Mercer, said that the "strong upward pressure on home prices will be sustained" amid supply shortages and population growth.
In other major Canadian markets, activity also slowed. On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, sales in the Montreal area dropped 18 per cent from the previous month, according to the local board. In the Vancouver region and B.C.'s Fraser Valley, sales fell about 11 per cent over the same period, according to their local boards.
Prices were essentially flat in the Vancouver area with the index price of a detached house at $1,801,100 in July. In the Fraser Valley, the index price for a detached house edged down 0.4 per cent to $1,319,200, while rising incrementally for townhouses and condos. In the Montreal metropolitan area, the median price of a single family home rose slightly to $508,000.

Full text: 533 Route 203 HAVELOCK, QUE.
Asking Price: $2,250,000 Taxes: $2,397 (2021) Lot Size: 140 acres Agents: Christina Miller, Profusion Realty and Patrick Wiltshire, Re/Max Platine THE BACKSTORY In the early 2000s, Canadians were gripped by a political scandal.
A federal sponsorship program created to promote Canadian unity was exposed as a scheme that siphoned more than $100-million from government funds and into the coffers of a few well-connected Quebec advertising agencies and other firms.
Justice John Gomery of Quebec's Superior Court became a well-known figure across Canada when he was appointed to investigate the corrupt dealings. The Gomery Inquiry made daily headlines as it exposed fraudulent invoices, misuse of funds and kickbacks to the Quebec wing of the federal Liberal Party. The judge's reports provided recommendations on how similar abuses of power could be prevented in the future.
This May, Mr. Gomery died at the age of 88. Pierrette Rayle, his widow and a retired judge of the Quebec Court of Appeal, says the two had decided to sell the 140acre farm they purchased 31 years ago as a refuge from their demanding careers.
Ms. Rayle recalls the couple being in a rush to fly overseas for a legal conference when he suggested they squeeze in a visit to a farm that had recently come up for sale. They drove about one hour south-west from Montreal on a cold and rainy September day to the rural township of Havelock and arrived at the farm just north of the Canada-U.S. border to see a stunning view of Covey Hill, one of the northernmost peaks of the Adirondack Mountains.
Despite the weather, they were both drawn to a grove of towering maple trees on the property.
"We went for a walk in the forest," Ms. Rayle says. "All of the paths were winding through.
There is nothing straight there. It was magic."
As the two headed back to the car, the real estate agent asked, "Don't you want to see the house?" Ms. Rayle says the couple had been so entranced by the landscape they forgot about the circa-1860 farmhouse at the end of the driveway. And after a quick tour through the house, they made up their minds.
"We came out and made an offer," she says. "We just said, ‘This is what we need.' We needed to stop that frantic pace and look after our health."
THE HOUSE TODAY The old farmhouse had been modernized by previous owners, but Ms. Rayle and Mr. Gomery wanted to add more space for themselves and their blended family of four children. The couple brought in architect Andrea Wolff of Montreal-based Architem, who spent the next five years overseeing the expansion and renovation.
Ms. Wolff designed a twostorey, L-shaped house with five bedrooms and plenty of places for the family to gather in approximately 3,500 square feet of living space. The objective was to preserve the atmosphere of the farmhouse while adding elegance.
"For people from the city, you want your refuge and your haven to be of the same standard," Ms. Rayle says. "It's for professional people who want some comfort."
The original farmhouse is now the living room, with wide plank floors, built-in bookshelves and a wood-burning stove.
Ms. Rayle says the couple thought at first that they would remove the antique stove and a small staircase to the second floor. But one day, the couple returned from a walk on a chilly day and Mr. Gomery decided to light up the wood stove.
"Within five minutes, we were both convinced we had to keep it," she says. "The humidity was gone, and we were nice and toasty."
And while the chef's kitchen offers an island, lots of counter space and high-end, built-in appliances, the stove became a favourite implement for Mr. Gomery.
"He cooked stews on that watching his football games on Saturday afternoons."
Meanwhile, a sunroom off the living room became the preferred spot for a second cup of coffee in the morning, she says, and a screened porch creates a delightful setting for breakfast. In addition, there's a family room with a fireplace surrounded by fieldstone, and a library.
The property also comes with an old barn to house the chickens, a sugar shack and a swimming pool.
Ms. Rayle says the couple enjoyed gardening in summer, with many of their friends being weekend hobby farmers. She often makes tomato sauce and preserves from the produce in her garden. When she gets together with friends and family, she brings along a gift and often leaves with a jar of honey or apple jelly from another farm in return.
And in the winter, they would go cross-country skiing.
"The rural life was completely new and it was a true discovery," Ms. Rayle says. "We needed a place where we would live differently and it worked. Your stress was left behind."
The couple also moved to the farm for several months when COVID-19 lockdowns went into effect, and they found solace among the trees and birds and other wildlife.
"It was just wonderful," she says. "Nature did not know that there was a COVID pandemic."
These days, it's the couple's eight grandchildren and other family members' turn to fully enjoy the property.
"They jump in the pool and then they climb the trees and the rocks and then they go and pick some blueberries," she says. "It's the way we used to live and it's not available anymore."
THE BEST FEATURE Ms. Rayle hopes the next custodians of the property will conserve the land and forest. Some of the trees in the sugarbush have been standing for more than 100 years, according to her.
And every year, a local sugarmaker arrives to tap the trees for sap to turn into maple syrup. She says she always goes down to taste the sap straight from the metal pail.
"We hope it will go to people who say, ‘Let's protect this extraordinary forest,' " Ms. Rayle says.
"We always called our forest the cathedral," she adds. "The trees make you feel like you're not the owner of the forest - you're the fiduciary."

Full text: After the former Budd Automotive parts maker closed in 2008, the sprawling 70acre site in Kitchener, Ont., had to wait for its makeover.
Over the past decade, the property received an $8.6-million environmental cleanup, but plans for big-box retail and other development never materialized. This year, with new owners, the property's focus is back on industrial users who, in today's digital economy, put a premium on access to skilled workers in deciding where to locate. To that end, the evolution of the former Budd lands is a lesson in patience - and good timing.
With COVID-19 disruptions to global supply chains over the past year, the inventory of prime industrial properties has shrunk, causing a sharp rise in lease rates.
In the Region of Waterloo, which includes Kitchener, industrial market vacancy rates fell to "an all-time low of 1.3 per cent" in the second quarter of this year, according to Colliers International, with rents up almost 5 per cent over a year ago.
In April, Perimeter Development Corp., which has made its mark in office and retail development in Kitchener and Waterloo, announced a joint venture with Crestpoint Real Estate Ltd., to purchase 37 acres of the Budd property for a new industrial business park. Soon after, furniture maker Krug Inc., purchased 23 acres of the site adjacent to some of its current operations. The remaining 10 acres of the Budd site will be set aside for a stormwater management pond.
Perimeter chief executive officer Craig Beattie says his company had its sights on the property for a couple of years for the location at Homer Watson Boulevard and Bleams Road: close to Highway 401, residential housing and retail amenities. On the opposite side of Homer Watson is a long-established business park and a popular urban woodlot.
Beyond the location - a rare infill opportunity in an established neighbourhood - Mr. Beattie says, "the part we are the most excited about is its proximity to a terrific work force." With two local universities and a trades college, he says, graduates are in high demand by a growing number of advanced manufacturers and startups in Waterloo region.
What has been true for the office sector, he says, now applies to industrial employers: "It is all about talent." Perimeter aims to attract light manufacturing, logistics and technology companies to the now-named Homer Watson Business Park slated to open in fall 2022.
At Krug, the future park's nextdoor neighbour, recruiting skilled workers also figured into its decision on where to consolidate currently scattered operations and allow for expansion.
Krug president Len Ruby says his company looked at potential sites for two years before concluding the Budd property fit the bill.
"We took a closer look and really started to like what we saw," he says, with its location a recruitment tool. "We have to invest in a substantial amount of training and learning, which takes years," he says. "We want to retain people and attract good-quality people; it is a war for talent, even in what we do."
This fall, assuming Kitchener approves, Krug expects to renovate two existing buildings (82,000 and 52,000 square feet, respectively) on its newly acquired site. "Having those structures will enable us to get in more quickly than building from scratch," says Mr. Ruby, a bonus given rising steel and construction costs.
Assuming city planning consent, Perimeter plans to prepare its site this fall to construct three buildings (60,000, 150,000 and 500,000 square feet, respectively), with occupancy, starting in late 2022.
Mr. Beattie, who has previous experience in industrial development, says the buildings will be constructed to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards, potentially making them the first new industrial buildings in the region with some level of "green" certification.
"It goes back to the talent piece," he says, with workers increasingly selective about where they work. "Those workplaces that provide some great amenities, people choose to work there."
As neighbours, Perimeter and Krug plan to collaborate on signage, landscaping and possible worker-friendly amenities, such as showers for cyclists, developing a brand for the overall site.
Availability of skilled workers has become a "consistent conversation" in location decisions for industrial users, says Ted Overbaugh, senior vice-president and managing director for CBRE Ltd., the listing agent for Perimeter's business park. No matter the user or location, he says the same questions arise: "What is the access to labour?" and "Can we supply the labour and talent we need?" The demand for qualified workers comes amid a "skyrocketing" demand for industrial spaces, says Ryan Mounsey, supervisor of economic development for Waterloo region.
He says the Perimeter development, the latest in "a whole new series of projects" rejuvenating vacant manufacturing properties in the region for high-tech tenants, "shows that older industrial sites can be repositioned over time for today's new economy."
For companies unable to find a location with existing and repurposed inventory, he adds, "emerging greenfield sites provide another opportunity."
He cites the current phased development of a 400-acre industrial campus on the east side of Waterloo region, estimated to add between three million and four million square feet over the next several years. Meanwhile, several of the region's municipalities look to expand their inventory of industrial lands to capitalize on demand.
For Kitchener, which applied a tax rebate program to facilitate the environmental cleanup of the former Budd property, its pending renewal marks a significant milestone.
"From our perspective, we have land that was sitting dormant for 12 years and wasn't generating property tax revenue or generating new employment," says Brian Bennett, manager of business development for Kitchener's economic development department. "Bringing this land into production will create new tax revenue, as well as new employment and provide opportunities for companies that want to expand or locate in Kitchener."
As for the time taken to find new uses on the former Budd site, he emphasizes the need for patience. "Good things will come, but you have to be patient."

Full text: No sooner had my interview with Azerbaijani journalist Khadija Ismayilova begun than she had a request: Could we please focus on her work rather than her life? For, as she noted, when people write about journalists who are harassed, they tend to forget about the essence of why they are persecuted. Framed this way, her request seemed reasonable - but when work and life become inextricably linked, as they are with her, then disentangling the threads in order to bypass a remarkable personality misses an important part of the gestalt.
Yes, her accomplishments as an investigative journalist surely stand on their own.
But her life - what she has had to endure as a result of these accomplishments - elevates them still further. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. "Unfortunately," she said ruefully, "when journalists write about the bad guys, it turns up consequences for the authors."
Ms. Ismayilova was born in an Azerbaijan that was still part of the Soviet Union.
She was a schoolgirl when she joined the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, known as Komsomol, and as a Pioneer (the league's group for those aged 9 to 14) recalls writing poems in praise of Lenin and denouncing America. Both her parents were engineers, and her father, a member of parliament and a minister in the government of then-president Heydar Aliyev, was responsible for overseeing the country's rich oil and gas industry. Their home was continually full of guests, with her parents always hosting and helping fellow citizens - their efforts part of some greater collective good. To outsiders, the Ismayilovs must have seemed like a model Soviet family.
It took a televised soccer game between the Soviet Union and Turkey in 1986 to open young Khadija's eyes to the precarious reality of her family's true existence.
Ms. Ismayilova recollects being shocked at seeing her parents supporting Turkey.
When she asked what they were doing, her mother, brushing aside her husband's concerns, divulged the family's big secret: "We are actually Turks," Ms. Ismayilova remembers her saying. "Russia has occupied our country. It is the Russians, not the West, who are the imperialists."
If this was not enough for a 10-year-old child to digest, her mother also let it be known that she had been a dissident in her youth. "Within 10 minutes, I had learned about empire, occupation, forbidden national identity and censorship," Ms. Ismayilova said.
A few days later, the Komsomal Pioneer burned her journals - and with them, her poems to Lenin.
Looking back at her childhood, Ms. Ismayilova says that many things were done in secret, from listening to the BBC and Voice of America, to her mother buying Gershwin records and her grandmother going to the mosque. By the time she was a teenager, glasnost and perestroika were opening up society and the Stalinist past was being re-examined. Yet despite this newfound openness, there were certain lines in Mr. Aliyev's Azerbaijan that could not be crossed. Ms. Ismayilova's father had spoken out against corruption in high places, and after drawing attention to failings within the lucrative energy industry at a cabinet meeting broadcast live, he was summarily fired. Gone overnight and shunned by Mr. Aliyev, who governed through patronage and clan-like loyalty, he would never find a job in Azerbaijan again.
Ms. Ismayilova was in her third year of university when her father was dismissed.
With her mother having long left engineering to be a stay-at-home parent, the situation marked a sharp downturn in the family's fortunes. "He had always held high government office, and because he was not corrupt, we had no money," she said. "It was a suddenly challenge to buy food." Her father's precipitous fall from grace for speaking the truth would prove a portent for Ms. Ismayilova's own coming battles with the Aliyev family.
Ms. Ismayilova is not a journalist by training. She graduated from the School of Oriental Studies at Baku State University after studying Turkish philology. Fluent in Russian, Turkish and English, she briefly found work as a translator before transitioning into journalism. Her father had wanted her to be an academic ("he had this Soviet fetish for a PhD," is how she saw it) and in deference to his wishes, she had enrolled for postgraduate studies at the Academy of Sciences in Baku. But after he died, she dropped her studies to work fulltime as a journalist. "If journalism had not been so fascinating, perhaps I would have gone along with it."
Ms. Ismayilova's early career was stormy as she joined and soon resigned from a series of Azerbaijani newspapers.
Looking back at this period, she is unsparing in her self-criticism.
"I had a bad temper, would not accept orders, made a lot of mistakes and was too defensive," she admitted. Three years of relative job stability followed when she was appointed editor of political news for Echo, a Russian paper in Azerbaijan, but she resigned in protest two days after the 2003 election, which saw Ilham Aliyev succeed his father Heydar as president. Echo was pro-government, she said, and had failed to tell the truth about the new leader's corruption.
In the years that followed, Ms. Ismayilova worked for Caspian Business News covering the environment and economy, wrote for Eurasianet (a website based at Columbia University's Harriman Institute, one of the leading centres of scholarship on Eurasia) and spent 18 months in the United States working for Voice of America before returning home to train local journalists. She later became a bureau chief for Radio Liberty (a U.S.-funded platform that offers news and analysis to countries in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Caucasus and the Middle East), and the editor of Radio Liberty's team in Baku. While her work focused increasingly on corruption, she did not yet see herself as an investigative journalist.
The murder of Azerbaijani freelance journalist Elmar Huseynov in 2005 changed that. While it was widely believed that Mr. Huseynov was murdered to silence his criticism of Ilham Aliyev and his father, Ms. Ismayilova also saw his death as an indictment of the media in Azerbaijan. "We were partly responsible for his assassination," she said. "He was killed because he was the only one investigating the president's family and their businesses."
In trying to understand what came next in her career, it is informative to take note of Ms. Ismayilova's feeling of guilt - she experienced an allied emotion, shame, a few years later when The Washington Post approached her to fact check their story on the numerous Dubai properties of Ilham Aliyev's children. It transpired that Mr. Aliyev's 11-year-old son was the owner of nine waterfront mansions valued at around US$44-million.
"I felt ashamed that foreign journalists do this work and we don't," Ms. Ismayilova explained.
With her inquiring mind and a gimlet eye, Ms. Ismayilova began digging. She looked into the impunity afforded Mr. Huseynov's assassins. She exposed how millions of dollars had gone missing from Azerbaijan's national bank. She revealed the corrupt commercial dealings of Kamaladdin Heydarov, appointed chairman of the state customs committee by Heydar Aliyev in 1995 and minister of emergency situations by Ilham Aliyev in 2006. Mr. Heydarov's business empire, ranging from fruit juice to real estate, had garnered massive wealth for this family.
Ms. Ismayilova also began looking into the Panama Papers for links with the Azerbaijani ruling elite. At first, she lacked the technical expertise to mine this trove of millions of leaked documents that detail attorney-client information on hundreds of thousands of offshore entities. Paul Radu, co-founder of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), taught her how to sort through and interpret the data. What emerged was evidence showing that the president's wife and daughter owned numerous companies.
Ms. Ismayilova also returned to a previously abandoned investigation of the cellphone company Azerphone - with her new skill set, she was now able to refute the government's lie that Azerphone was owned by global tech company Siemens.
In fact, three companies listed as based in Panama were the owners - and all three belonged to Ilham Aliyev's daughter. Regulations for bids and contracts had been bypassed and licences granted without competition or oversight.
At times, the sheer weight of corruption alone must have seemed overwhelming.
Ms. Ismayilova revealed that the government had more assets outside the country
than within. She exposed fraud in the 2008 national elections. She unearthed connections between the Aliyevs, construction projects and the Eurovision Song Contest, as well as links between the Azerbaijani first family and a bribery scandal involving Luca Volonte, an Italian deputy and member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
Earlier this year, Mr. Volonte was sentenced to four years in prison for taking US$2.43-million in bribes to dampen European criticism of Azerbaijan's human rights record.
No local journalist in Azerbaijan had gone this far before. The government responded by taking Radio Liberty off the air locally. In response, Ms. Ismayilova moved her program online - the government's riposte was to jam the satellite.
After Ms. Ismayilova's first Panama Papers exposé, the intimidation turned more ominous, eventually leading to blackmail.
From July, 2011, through January, 2012, cameras were secretly placed in her apartment and she was recorded being intimate with her boyfriend. Her brother was sent stills from the video with a note calling her a whore. Azerbaijan is a very traditional society, where it is taboo for women to have sex outside of marriage. Tradition demanded of her brother that he either kill her, her boyfriend, or the person who made the video.
She recalls finding out about the video from her brother just as she was about to go on air. Remarkably, she went ahead with the program. After consulting with the OCCRP and her lawyer, she wrote a Facebook post about being blackmailed, and how the tactics would not stop her work. The following day, she wrote another post listing her continuing investigations and those in the pipeline. A week later, the Azerbaijani government released the video through a website it claimed belonged to the country's main opposition party. Ms. Ismayilova's supporters encouraged her to say the video was a fabrication, but she refused.
"I owned it," she said defiantly. She had seen the government use tactics like this before to break journalists and silence them. She would have none of it.
The government's blackmail attempt had a paradoxical effect. Banking on the public's anger at a single woman in an Islamic country having sex, it had miscalculated. The scandal increased Ms. Ismayilova's profile, making her work more widely known. Family, friends and even Azerbaijan's Islamic Party rallied to her defence.
But behind Ms. Ismayilova's public veneer of resolve, the personal cost was steep. The relationship with her boyfriend ended.
She wondered whether he had been complicit in the filming. The loss of trust impeded new relationships. When she found out that the cameras in her apartment had been installed in her bathroom, too, her body shut down.
"I had to smile in public," she said. "I had to continue working. But I was physically broken."
In the depths of despair, she recalls a female student she was mentoring at the time telling her to stop whining and push on with her investigations. "That woman saved my life," Ms. Ismayilova said. She went on to publish the findings from four major investigations that year, the most productive of her career.
New tactics were employed to silence her. She was arrested on trumped-up charges of harassing a colleague, but released when the government's case collapsed. She was then convicted of evading taxes, another bogus charge, and given a 71/2-year jail sentence. After 18 months in prison, her sentence was commuted to two years and three months, with five years of probation. The latter ends soon, but online bullying from government trolls continues.
Ms. Ismayilova's resilience is remarkable. She told me she is driven by "the people's right to know." In her pursuit of the truth, she is therefore sustaining one of the cornerstones of civil society - the right of citizens to hold their leaders accountable. But there are other forces, subtler and less obvious, at play.
Her guilt in relation to Mr. Huseynov's murder and her shame when The Washington Post came calling on the Dubai property scandal are telling, for shame and guilt are the primary emotions associated with moral injury. This concept refers to damage done to one's conscience or moral compass by perpetrating, witnessing or failing to prevent acts that transgress one's own beliefs, values or ethical codes of conduct. When we place this definition alongside Ms. Ismayilova's meticulous exposé of her government's sleaze, the fit is immediately apparent. Such gross corruption is outrageous - we are morally affronted by it. However, only a select few are prepared to do something about it.
Murder, blackmail, character assassination and financial ruin may silence the majority, but not Ms. Ismayilova.
When I asked whether she worried about the risks associated with her reporting, she said: "You get a gut feeling before publication that something bad might happen, but your first thought is to get it out there - because if you do not publish, you feel very bad about it. You feel like you gave up; you were scared. This is not a good feeling to live with. It's actually easier to spit it out."
There you have it: the blackmail, public shaming, jail time, the pain of it all - preferable to keeping quiet. Ms. Ismayilova's father dared speak out against corruption in Heydar Aliyev's government. Her mother was a dissident in the days of the Soviet Union. Their daughter has gone many steps further in her pursuit of the truth and accountability. In doing so, she has received some notable honours, including a Right Livelihood Award, known as the Alternative Nobel Prize.
Affirming as awards may be, they cannot explain what set Khadija Ismayilova on her career trajectory. An inquiring mind got her started, but it is an unshakeable moral compass that has kept her at it despite everything thrown at her. Staying true to one's ethical code can lead to prison in Ilham Aliyev's Azerbaijan, and many other places in this world. But there is a rare, precious upside, too. "I feel accomplished," Ms. Ismayilova said. "Despite everything, I feel happy." MORAL COURAGE: ABOUT THE SERIES Journalists are key to civil society, keeping readers, viewers and listeners informed of events both local and international. At times, this work entails exposure to grave danger. The factors that motivate journalists to continue this work despite these threats are many and complex, but central to it all is moral courage. Simply put, to some journalists, doing nothing in response to the egregious behaviour of corrupt or genocidal politicians, human traffickers and drug cartels is worse than the repercussions that come from exposing such crimes. These journalists are driven by a moral imperative to risk their own safety and psychological well-being for the story - and the price paid for this steely determination is invariably steep.
Anthony Feinstein, a psychiatrist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto, is an authority on the psychological effects of conflict on journalists. Together with Dr. Feinstein, The Globe and Mail is running Moral Courage, a project that will feature frank and intimate interviews between Dr. Feinstein and a journalist working in hazardous situations around the globe. Each story showcases the work of these journalists, the factors that explain why they feel compelled to pursue such an all-encompassing mission, and the personal consequences their work entails.

Full text: They had not been to a mall in nearly a year, but on the first day that Scarborough Town Centre was permitted to reopen at the end of June, university students Areney Kamalavannan and Naome Karunakaran came for some retail therapy.
The result was a fairly modest haul - two small bags from Sephora and Lids - but the friends agreed it was refreshing just to be able to see what they were buying, and (praise be) to leave the house.
"I got fed up with online shopping," Ms. Kamalavannan said.
After the nightmare of COVID-19, shoppers like these are a reason for hope for mall owners and retailers.
But while industry watchers expect an exuberant return to in-person shopping, many malls are still facing longer-term headwinds once the novelty of those initial outings wears off.
Even before the pandemic slammed the retail industry, people were going to malls less often - including the top-tier ones that generate the most revenue per square foot. In 2019, foot traffic at Canada's top 10 malls fell by 22 per cent compared with the previous year, according to Deloitte.
"Short term, malls will do quite well.
We're expecting one of the best back-toschool environments that we've ever seen ... and the Christmas season is also expected to be very strong this year," said Corrado Russo, senior managing director with Hazelview Investments, a global investment manager focused on real estate.
"But once we get past that, all of the challenges that malls have had over the last five and 10 years are still there."
Those challenges include the declining popularity of department stores, the rise in online shopping and a contraction in fashion retail that once filled many mall spaces.
Vacancies during the pandemic did not balloon as much as landlords feared at the beginning - largely because of government support. Still, 2,026 stores in Canada closed in 2020, more than three times the prior year's number, according to global commercial real estate giant Cushman & Wakefield. That was led by Starbucks and David's Tea, but also included many mall stalwarts that either pared down their number of locations - such as Aldo, Bizou, Bouclair, Ricki's and Stokes - or decided to close altogether, such as Carlton Cards and Addition Elle.
Now, as mall owners begin to emerge from the pandemic's doldrums, they are rethinking how to use their space, and landlords and retailers are working to evolve the shopping experience to keep people coming back.
"The pandemic has just accelerated those conversations surrounding the right tenant mix, how to attract people to the mall, what we should do with the actual physical real estate ... [and] offerings in the mall that better accommodate for ecommerce," said Hani Abdelkader, a principal with commercial real estate services firm Avison Young in Calgary. "COVID has accelerated the urgency to adopt these things." HOW RETAIL IS BOUNCING BACK FROM COVID-19 Many shoppers are sitting on disposable income that went undisposed during months of curtailed vacations and evenings out. For the fortunate whose employment was not affected by the pandemic, it is a windfall borne of boredom.
Canadians socked away more than $200billion in savings last year, according to Statistics Canada.
Not all of that will flow back into retail.
But there are some opportunities in all that pent-up demand, such as fashion retailers courting customers whose wardrobes have not been refreshed in months.
"Where we have been opened the longest with lesser restrictions, we are getting sales that are in the order of 70 to 80 per cent, and in some cases 90 per cent, of what they were prepandemic," said Sal Iacono, executive vice-president of operations with mall owner Cadillac Fairview.
However, some believe shoppers are coming back to malls with a different mindset - less tolerant of nuisances such as long checkout lines, hunting for parking and waiting for assistance.
"The in-store experience has to be more frictionless," said Mark Penn, chairman and chief executive of marketing firm MDC Partners and chairman of Harris Poll, which has been surveying consumers during the pandemic.
Ivanhoé Cambridge is trying to address this, speaking with its tenants to find out which "pain points" need solving to keep attracting shoppers.
Solutions for pandemic problems could be part of a longer-term strategy. For example, in response to COVID-related capacity restrictions, many malls introduced digital line-management tools to let shoppers know when it was their turn to go into a store without making them physically stand in line. Those could now be repurposed to reduce the irritation of busy checkouts. Oxford Properties is currently looking at digital tools to allow people to reserve parking stalls before coming to its malls.
"We believe in malls, certainly," said François Lacoursière, Ivanhoé Cambridge's senior vice-president of innovation. "But of course, we need to change."
DO LOCAL RETAILERS HAVE A PLACE IN MALLS?
The pandemic ignited a "Shop Local" movement, but for most people looking to support small businesses, the mall is likely not the first place that comes to mind.
That's because mall landlords have typically preferred long-term lease deals - five to 10 years in general - that independent shops may not be able to commit to.
But as COVID-19 has opened up more space in malls, and more owners are looking at the right tenant mix to attract shoppers, more flexible leases are attracting a new crop of retailers.
Victoria-based jewellery maker and designer Cory Judge is one of those. The trade shows she relied on were cancelled early in the pandemic. "My entire livelihood just disappeared in a puff of smoke," Ms. Judge said.
So she decided to open a store. Ms. Judge teamed up with two friends who were also small-business owners - a glassblower and the owner of a farmers' market. The idea was to carry products from other Canadian artisans, including handmade cutting boards, jam, art, T-shirts and candles.
But when the trio went looking for a space, most landlords did not want to risk a short-term lease. The Bay Centre, a mall managed by Cushman & Wakefield, was an exception. The Victoria Market Collective opened there in October.
"We did a four-month lease to begin, which is unheard of usually," Ms. Judge said. They then renewed for another year.
While pop-up shops are nothing new, these kinds of flexible leases are becoming more common in malls.
"When you've got this uptick in vacancies, [owners] become more receptive to the risk associated with these temporary tenants," said John Crombie, executive managing director of retail services in Canada for Cushman & Wakefield. The company has recently done deals with many small retailers, including a seller of electric bikes, a custom perfume maker and specialty food shops.
Tenant mix was already shifting before COVID-19: Non-retail spaces grew from 27.3 per cent of mall space in 2015 to 34.3 in 2020, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade association that announced a rebranding this week and will be renamed Innovating Commerce Serving Communities.
Owners have repurposed retail spaces to open more food and beverage options, fitness centres, educational spaces, health care and other services - a trend that is expected to continue.
"Most landlords, if you look at their malls, 5 per cent or less of the [gross leasable area] is devoted to alternative uses," said Sherif Masood, Oxford's vice-president of national asset management, retail.
"Our goal is to get that up to 10 per cent in the next few years."
Events, entertainment pop-ups and other attractions have also taken on new importance.
Oxford is currently in talks with a company that did a Dr. Seuss exhibition prior to COVID-19 to do more events at its malls. Such attractions draw people from a wider geographical range, Mr. Masood said.
During the pandemic, Oxford also repurposed parking-lot space across Canada, creating outdoor patios to provide comfortable social spaces for guests and to support food and beverage tenants inside the mall who were hurting.
At Scarborough Town Centre, the company held a "Street Eats" festival with food trucks.
"A lot of the concepts will be here to stay," Mr. Masood said.
WOOING NEW SHOPPERS FROM AMAZON TO THE MALL The concept of the mall originated in convenience. But that one-stop shop has been supplanted to some extent, by the likes of Amazon.com Inc. During months stuck at home, even more Canadian shoppers have now built up an e-commerce habit.
According to research firm eMarketer, e-commerce sales in Canada jumped by a whopping 75 per cent last year to $77.25billion. That research predicts that even after the pandemic jump, e-commerce's share of the overall retail market will continue to rise.
That is not to say that stores are dead.
But while most people do intend to go back to bricks-and-mortar shopping, 60 per cent of Canadians surveyed by Harris Poll said they expect to continue to shop online as well. Those "blended" shoppers expect better digital services both online and in stores.
Roots Corp. launched virtual shopping appointments in April, 2020, connecting customers with store associates by phone, live chat and video while Roots locations - many of them in malls - were closed.
Some staff have now been permanently moved into that function, and while the company is expecting fewer virtual appointments as customers come back to stores, it is considering how to continue merging online shopping with in-person service.
"It's really about taking that next step.
If you have a buy-online-pick-up-in-store customer, do you call them and say, ‘Are you coming in tomorrow? I'm going to set up a change room so that you can try things on,' "Roots CEO Meghan Roach said.
"We're definitely having those conversations about how to evolve things."
Montreal-based Salesfloor has a mobile application for store associates to shop live online with customers, and has seen its customer base grow by 67 per cent in the past year.
"Even though traffic is definitely going to bounce back, you probably will see a drop of about 15 per cent in traffic that just won't come back, because customers now are more comfortable than ever purchasing online," Salesfloor co-founder Oscar Sachs said.
Some malls are also using digital tools to bring shoppers back. "We're launching a bunch of [promotions] this summer - come to the mall three times and get rewarded," said Matt Crowell, founder and CEO of Kelowna, B.C.-based GetintheLoop, a digital marketing firm that does localized promotional offers for large and small retailers.
Malls also want to be part of the e-commerce ecosystem. After retailers repurposed some mall locations as "dark stores" to fill online orders during the pandemic, many mall owners are looking into building their own microfulfilment centres.
"We can help with [delivery] logistics, help on returns and also have last-mile capacity," said Mr. Lacoursière of Ivanhoé Cambridge.
Some malls are working to improve services for people who buy online and want to pick up or return items in stores.
Cadillac Fairview has started a pilot with a service called ReturnBear, offering centralized product returns for multiple retailers.
"In the long term, the holy grail we're trying to work toward is the one-basket approach," Oxford's Mr. Masood said.
"Wouldn't it be cool if you can go online, buy from four or five different stores and then swing by the mall in one spot and pick them all up?" "We have to make the customer's journey more seamless," he said. "Give people a reason to get off the couch."

Full text: Calgary's downtown office vacancy rate is on track to top 30 per cent and potentially reach a level unseen in a major North American city since the 1930s, a commercial real estate firm said Thursday.
According to a new report from Avison Young, the office tower vacancy rate in downtown Calgary broke a new record in the second quarter of 2021 and now sits at 29.2 per cent. That's up from 28.9 per cent in the first three months of 2021, and up from 25 per cent in the second quarter of 2020.
The firm now predicts Calgary's downtown vacancy rate will reach 30 per cent some time in the next three months, with more than 14 million square feet of empty space. Avison Young's worst-case projections show the vacancy rate climbing to 34 per cent before it tops out.
News reports from the 1980s suggest Houston hit an office vacancy rate in the low 30s during that decade. Denver's downtown also struggled during that time.
(Comparing vacancy rate statistics over time can be difficult because different brokerages use different formulas. Some look only at buildings over 100,000 square feet, while others look at all buildings over 20,000 square feet, for example.)
But in Canada, a downtown vacancy rate above 30 per cent is unprecedented - and it's "exceptionally rare" everywhere else, Avison Young insight manager Susan Thompson said. If the office market vacancy rate was to climb to 34 per cent, it could be a North American record.
"That kind of vacancy rate has not been seen in a modern major office market since probably the Depression era," Ms. Thompson said.
"I sit on conference calls with my global counterparts around the world and they all shake their heads and say, ‘that's not a number I can wrap my head around.' " Calgary's downtown has been severely impacted by years of low oil prices and a wave of mergers, acquisitions and layoffs in the oil and gas sector. In one high-profile example, the merger of Cenovus Energy and Husky Energy earlier this year was expected to result in more than 2,000 layoffs - the majority in Calgary.
Energy and related engineering companies occupied 57 per cent of downtown Calgary in 2012.
They now occupy just 32 per cent of the city's downtown core. Five of downtown Calgary's 170 office buildings are currently completely empty, according to Avison Young, and there are an additional seven properties with at least 75 per cent vacancy.
But as dire as the latest numbers are, Ms. Thompson said, there are hopeful signs.
The vast majority of commercial real estate deals occurring in Calgary's downtown right now are for offices under 10,000 square feet. Though those small deals won't make up for the large oil and gas tenants being lost, it does indicate that other industries - including the high-tech sector - are moving in.
Real estate is a lagging economic indicator, Ms. Thompson said, so office market vacancy rates take a while to start improving even as local conditions improve.
"It takes some time to play out," she said. "But we do eventually see the tide turning."
In April, Calgary City Council voted to spend $200-million on the first phases of strategy aimed at finding a long-term fix for the downtown. The approved plan calls for investments in infrastructure, amenities and streetscape improvements, as well as the setting aside of $45-million in available incentives for office-toresidential conversion projects.
"It will take time to see the impact of the plan, but we are working towards a better future for Calgary's downtown space," said Brad Parry, interim chief executive of Calgary Economic Development, in an e-mailed statement.
"While these [vacancy] numbers are not where we'd like them to be, we do expect to see them change in the coming year as markets around the world begin to reopen and people get back to pre-COVID activities," Mr. Parry said.
Some industry watchers say Calgary's downtown office market has already exceeded the 30 per cent threshold. According to commercial real estate firm CBRE, Calgary's downtown office vacancy rate hit 32.7 per cent in the second quarter.

Full text: 151 Inglewood Dr., Toronto MOORE PARK Asking price: $4,125,000 (May, 2021) Selling price: $4,020,000 (June, 2021) Previous selling price: $1,710,000 (September, 2007) Taxes: $14,326 (2020) Days on the market: nine Listing agents: Dino Capocci and Lauretta Stewart, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
THE ACTION This 21/2-storey Georgian was one of several Moore Park homes released for sale right after Victoria Day. It drew in nearly three dozen visitors, but no one reappeared the evening of the offer date. Luckily, the next day, a buyer worked out a $4.02-million deal.
"There was a property listed at the same time on the same street - but further in on a coveted lot and at a lower price - and they had an offer date and did not receive any offers," said agent Dino Capocci, "and another one was listed for multiple offers and did not receive multiple offers either, but it sold close to list. So, I do feel the market is cooling quite a bit."
WHAT THEY GOT This five-bedroom house with an in-ground pool and a detached, double garage sits comfortably on a 50-foot-by-139-foot lot.
"It's a beautiful house with a beautiful pool," Mr. Capocci said.
The interior layout retains formal living and dining rooms original to 1928.
There are also casual recreation areas on the main and lower levels. Additional spots to unwind include a breakfast area, a sauna, an upper balcony off of one bedroom and a massive rooftop terrace.
"It had the coveted five bedrooms and also a second-floor library, which easily could be a sixth bedroom," he added.
THE AGENT'S TAKE Local institutions were also an attraction. "Moore Park is a great school district, so a lot of families were looking to upgrade," Mr. Capocci said.

Haiti braces for more violence

Full text: In the days before his death, Jovenel Moïse was plowing ahead with what he saw as his legacy project. In meetings and Zoom calls with members of his cabinet, the Haitian President hammered out the wording of a formal decree to hold elections in September, which would include a referendum on his proposed constitutional reforms.
In one final exchange during the late afternoon of July 6, Mr. Moïse and his Elections Minister, Mathias Pierre, made edits over WhatsApp. "He wanted to move forward," Mr. Pierre recalled.
The referendum plan was contentious, to say the least. Mr. Moïse sold his reforms, which would increase the power of the presidency, as a necessary step to break the country's perennial political gridlock. His opponents viewed them as a step toward dictatorship.
It was only the latest fight the 53-year-old entrepreneur had picked during his brief political career. He battled some of the country's oligarchs when he cancelled their government contracts. He clashed with pro-democracy activists over his efforts to rule by decree. And he fell out with erstwhile allies in his own political party over his refusal to heed their advice.
At 1 a.m. local time on July 7, heavily armed commandos burst into Mr. Moïse's bedroom, broke one of his arms and one of his legs, gouged out his left eye, and shot him 12 times. His wife, Martine, was wounded, and had to be airlifted to Miami for treatment.
The Haitian National Police have blamed the attack on a pulp-novel plot: A failed Floridabased businessman, they say, teamed up with a former Haitian senator, an ex-justice department official and a private security company to hire 28 mercenaries, most of them former Colombian soldiers, to overthrow the government. Twenty-four members of Mr. Moïse's palace guard, who failed to protect him, are also under investigation.
Around Port-au-Prince, theories abound over the killing's ultimate masterminds and motives. Some cast the blame on oligarchs, others on drug cartels or political rivals. Many doubt the official narrative. Key to unravelling the intrigue will be an understanding of both Mr. Moïse's turbulent career and Haiti's fractious politics.
Conversations this week with a dozen members of the country's political and business circles, civil society and diplomatic corps painted a complicated picture of the late president. To critics, he was authoritarian and uncaring. To supporters, he was well intentioned and headstrong.
To both, he was fatally stubborn and with a knack for making enemies.
Most people would speak only on condition their names not be published, for fear of inviting violence in a volatile political situation. The conversations revealed a clear consensus on Haiti's plutocratic political culture. Virtually everyone The Globe and Mail spoke with depicted the country's politics as a proxy war between a handful of oligarchs, each one backing different candidates who would favour them over their competitors in the awarding of government contracts.
"We are still working with the economic model of the 18th century, where the peasants are working and another class is doing what they want," said Monique Clesca, a social-justice activist and former United Nations official here. "About 70 per cent of the population has nothing."
In the capital, people with money or power live in compounds surrounded by 3½-metre stone fences. Regular residents must contend with armed gangs that control parts of the city, and a lack of public services such as a sanitation system. Into this context stepped Mr. Moïse.
A businessman from the country's north, he was best known before politics for running a banana plantation that tried to restore the country's long-lost status as one of the fruit's top exporters. With no prior political experience, he was chosen by the ruling Tèt Kale Party as its presidential candidate in 2015. The results of that election were invalidated because of massive fraud, and Mr. Moïse won a do-over the following year.
In office, Mr. Moïse did battle with several people he would characterize as oligarchs. He cancelled an electricity supply contract held by Sogener, a company owned by the Vorbe family, and put its generating plants under government control.
He also clashed with Reginald Boulos, a grocery store and real estate magnate who had once been Mr. Moïse's ally. The president tried to stop the national pension fund, the ONA, from lending to big business, cutting off a source of funds to Mr. Boulos. The tycoon, for his part, accused Mr. Moïse of being a tyrant and set up a political party to take him on.
"Jovenel came with a deep belief in change," said Laurent Lamothe, a former prime minister who became a friend and informal adviser of the late president's. "He likes quick solutions to problems and he was a very direct person. He doesn't hold anything back. He tells you what he thinks. His yes is yes, his no is no."
Not that Mr. Moïse was totally opposed to cultivating relationships with oligarchs. Political and diplomatic insiders said Mr. Moïse remained close with Sherif Abdallah, owner of a major insurance company, throughout his time in office.
The president also faced persistent street protests. He was accused of inaction or even complicity in the misappropriation of state funds related to a gasolinesupply program called Petrocaribe, clashed with the opposition over the end date for his term, and started ruling by decree last year after postponing parliamentary elections. Meanwhile, gang violence rose, economic prospects collapsed and a string of opposition activists and journalists disappeared or turned up dead.
"Jovenel didn't listen. He didn't see that people were speaking to him and telling him: ‘This is what is going on.' It was an attitude of arrogance in front of their despair," said Ms. Clesca.
Then came the constitutional reforms. Mr. Moïse planned to abolish the post of prime minister, reassigning its powers to the president. He also wanted to synchronize parliamentary and presidential elections to make it more likely that both would be controlled by the same party, and grant elected officials immunity from prosecution during their terms and allow presidents to run for re-election, which is currently prohibited.
Georges Michel, a Haitian historian, voted for Mr. Moïse. He saw the president as a hard worker who could get things done, including a rural road-building program. But Mr. Michel changed his mind as he grew increasingly alarmed at Mr. Moïse's autocratic tendencies.
"In his new constitution, he wanted to eliminate all checks and balances. He wanted to destroy our progress since 1986. He wanted to take us back to the Duvalier times," Mr. Michel said, referencing the notorious fatherson dictator duo that ran Haiti for 29 years.
Even Mr. Moïse's own political party fell out with him after he failed to heed their advice on dialling back his plans for the Constitution. Mr. Moïse caused a further rupture within the party this month when he announced a plan to appoint opposition politician Ariel Henry as prime minister instead of a member of Tèt Kale.
Just two days after that announcement, the president was dead.
At first, the assassination looked like a fearsomely professional job. Video appeared to show the hit squad, impersonating U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency officers, arriving at Mr. Moïse's suburban compound and easily getting inside.
At his own home in the steep, craggy hills that overlook Portau-Prince, Mr. Pierre, the Elections Minister, was awoken at 1 a.m. by gunfire. It lasted about 45 minutes, he recalled, after which he went back to bed. At 3 a.m., the secretary of state called to tell him the president had been assassinated.
The cabinet gathered at the home of Claude Joseph, the interim Prime Minister.
Meanwhile, five kilometres away, a debacle was unfolding.
The commandos didn't get very far from Mr. Moïse's house before Haitian police blocked their escape. Some holed up in an abandoned commercial building. Others escaped into the bushes, only to encounter mobs of citizens who lit the underbrush on fire to smoke them out. Eleven rushed into the Taiwanese embassy.
When the dust settled, 20 men had been arrested, at least three were shot to death and five escaped. Over the subsequent days, Haitian police accused several other men of planning the crime.
There was Christian Emmanuel Sanon, 63, a Haitian doctor and evangelical pastor. He had registered more than 20 businesses in Florida, offering everything from medical services to real estate, before going bankrupt in 2013. There was former Haitian senator John Joel Joseph; Joseph Felix Badio, an ex-government official; businessman Rodolphe Jaar; Antonio Enmanuel Intriago Valera, a Venezuelan who runs a Florida security company called CTU; and Walter Veintemilla, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., insurance agent and financier.
The plot, Haitian authorities have said, was to install Mr. Sanon as president. They have not made clear how exactly the alleged conspirators planned to achieve this. And in a strange twist, police suggested many of the gunmen may not have actually known what they were signing up for, believing they were simply being hired as Mr. Sanon's bodyguards.
The most pervasive theory in Haiti is that one of the country's oligarchs ordered the killing, in hopes that whoever succeeded Mr. Moïse would be more amenable to their business interests, and hired the rest of the conspirators. It was a possibility that the late president had himself apparently foreseen.
"He mentioned several times that the corrupt oligarchs were going to try to kill him," Mr. Lamothe said.
"He's a man who died for what he believed in. He was a principled guy, he was doing his reforms, and he died for them. He went against the system, and the system killed him."
Other theories - accusing either narcos or Mr. Moïse's political opponents - are less fleshed out, but nonetheless circulated.
A Colombian television program, Noticias Caracol, this week said three of the mercenaries had fingered Mr. Joseph, the interim PM, as the mastermind. The program did not cite its sources, and Haitian police denied that there was any evidence of Mr. Joseph's involvement.
Meanwhile, the country is struggling to find a way forward in the killing's aftermath. Mr. Joseph, who has declared himself acting president, has said the government will go ahead with Mr. Moïse's planned elections and constitutional referendum.
But three other people have challenged his hold on power - Mr. Henry, who had been announced as Mr. Joseph's successor but not yet sworn in at the time of the murder; Joseph Lambert, the head of the Senate; and Wendelle Coq Thélot, a high court judge backed by several opposition parties.
The U.S. government, which is helping with the murder investigation, has endorsed the idea of holding elections this year. But most political parties and social activists say that, given the country's security situation, any elections organized solely by Mr. Joseph's administration will give the incumbent government an unfair advantage.
"It's a total mess. We are in a major political vacuum. We should have a consensus with all the political parties, get ourselves together to organize the elections - not leave the elections to the current government," said Chantal Merzier Elie, an opposition human-rights activist and former foreign policy adviser to previous Haitian presidents. "I hope this can bring Haitians together."
Mr. Michel, the historian, was less optimistic. He feared that Mr. Moïse's assassination could redefine what people are willing to do to seize or hold on to political power. He had to think back 100 years, to when then-president Vilbrun Guillaume Sam was dragged out of the French embassy and beaten to death by an angry mob to find the last time Haiti was in such a crisis.
"I think that this will lead to more violence. They refuse to play fair, they refuse to be honest. It can lead to more radicalization," he said. "The current situation is really dire. It's the direst one since 1915."

Full text: Ontario's Auditor-General is investigating the Progressive Conservative government's sweeping changes to the province's landuse planning policies in a valuefor-money audit, with a report expected by the end of the year.
The probe is expected to examine some of the policy moves the government says are needed to spur the construction of new housing, but that critics charge have enabled sprawl, weakened environmental protections and favoured real estate developers who donate to the PC Party.
Ann Lehman-Allison, a spokeswoman for Auditor-General Bonnie Lysyk, confirmed in an email that an audit of the province's land-use planning was under way, but said the agency does not comment on the details of continuing investigations.
One source who has been contacted by auditor staff says the probe's scope appears to include an examination of the government's extensive use of once-rare ministerial zoning orders, or MZOs. These allow the province to short-circuit the normal local planning process and issue nonappealable approvals for developers. The Globe and Mail is not identifying the source because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the audit.
As the government points out, some of these MZOs have been to speed the construction of longterm care homes or affordable housing. But others have been issued to approve routine housing projects, a factory and, in the case of two distribution centres in the Greater Toronto Area, the paving of protected wetlands. (The government withdrew one such MZO, in Pickering, east of Toronto, after an outcry. It also rescinded one issued for a glass factory in Stratford after residents said they were not consulted.) In cases that do not involve provincially owned land, the government says it provides an MZO only when requested by a local municipality.
Premier Doug Ford's Municipal Affairs Minister, Steve Clark, has brought in a wide range of changes to the province's land-use planning rules, welcomed by a building industry that has long complained its efforts have been stymied by red tape.
Mr. Clark restored powers to the province's land-use tribunal, which critics charge has favoured developers over citizens groups.
He eased density requirements on suburban housing, while requiring more density around transit stations.
The Opposition NDP asked the Auditor-General earlier this year to examine some of the government's policy changes. In an April letter to NDP MPP Jeff Burch, Ms. Lysyk responded and confirmed her office was taking a look.
"As part of our ongoing audit activities, we are currently conducting a value-for-money audit of land-use planning and will be reviewing the province's growth planning process," Ms. Lysyk wrote, adding that the results of the probe will be included in her 2021 annual report before the end of the year.
Mr. Burch, the party's municipal affairs critic, asked the Auditor-General to review the PC government's changes to its Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, including the growth projections municipalities must use for what are known as landneeds assessments.
Critics say these projections have historically overstated the number of people and jobs that end up materializing for some areas, notably suburbs outside faster-growing Toronto and Peel Region.
But the province, under what it calls a new "market-based" system for land-needs assessments, now requires municipalities to use these projections as minimum numbers, and to designate all land needed to accommodate projected growth until 2051, a decade past the currently required 2041.
Using inflated projections means designating more farmland for development than necessary, Mr. Burch and others warn, fuelling sprawl while delivering unfair windfalls to land owners, whose holdings increase in value once earmarked for growth.
"It benefits land speculators and developers linked to the PC Party," Mr. Burch said in an interview. "The same donors that are benefitting from the MZOs."
In a submission last year on the changes, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA) warned against using pre-COVID-19 projections for population and job growth, saying the plans would result in the swallowing up of more prime farmland.
"The continuing loss of the key resource that underpins Ontario's agriculture and agri-food sector has the potential to jeopardize the future of food production in the province," OFA president Keith Currie said.
Planners in York Region, north of Toronto, said in a recent report to regional council that the landneeds assessment there will result in 80 per cent of the region's "white belt" - mostly farmland outside built-up areas but not within the protected Greenbelt - being designated for development by 2051.
Kevin Eby, a former director of community planning with the Region of Waterloo, says the growth plan's projections have been much higher for most of Toronto's suburbs than the real-world data found in the 2016 census and in the forecasts used by the province's own Ministry of Finance.
Under the 2005 growth plan projections, he said, Durham Region had to designate enough land for 64,000 new housing units by 2021, but as of last year, it had only built 33,000 - a prediction off by almost 50 per cent.
Krystle Caputo, a spokeswoman for Mr. Clark, defended the use of MZOs but added that the minister welcomes input from the Auditor-General.
"MZOs are a tool our government uses, in partnership with municipalities, to get critical local projects, like housing and longterm care homes, located outside of the Greenbelt, moving faster," she said in an e-mail.

Full text: A key Haitian cabinet minister says investigators are scrutinizing both the country's oligarchs and presidential bodyguards as they seek to fully unravel the plot that ended in the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.
Elections Minister Mathias Pierre told The Globe and Mail that Christian Emmanuel Sanon, the Florida-based doctor accused of ordering 28 commandos to storm Mr. Moïse's private home, was only a middleman between the killing's real masterminds and the gunmen who carried it out.
"He was paid by certain local people here," Mr. Pierre alleged during an interview on Monday at his office in the Port-au-Prince suburb of Pétion-Ville. "Very soon, the police and the investigation will tell the truth about it.
He hired the mercenaries to execute the task."
Mr. Sanon is also connected to a Canadian NGO reportedly created to perform development work in the Caribbean country.
Corporate records show he was vice-president of UNIHA, a charity registered in Laval, Que., in 2017. His address was listed as a house in Pétion-Ville, roughly a kilometre from Mr. Moïse's home. The charity was dissolved in 2018.
Mr. Sanon, who divided his time between Florida and his native Haiti, was arrested over the weekend.
Haitian authorities say he planned to seize the presidency for himself after taking down Mr. Moïse.
Mr. Pierre suggested that the trail of evidence in Mr. Moïse's murder will ultimately lead to the powerful families that control major businesses in Haiti. Mr. Moïse had tried to renegotiate or cancel their government contracts, and in some cases nationalized their assets.
"Moïse has been fighting what he called the oligarchs. He was trying to remove control from some powerful groups of interests in this country, and give more power to the government," Mr. Pierre said. "I think the assassination of the president was the result of his belief and his ideology, and those who were fighting him were in a position to put an end to his life."
Mr. Pierre referred to the electricity, building and banking sectors as places where Mr. Moïse tried to break the power of vested interests. He also cited the late president's efforts to curb the practice of lending big businesses large sums of money from the country's pension fund, the Office Nationale D'Assurance Viellesse (ONA).
Prosecutor Bed-Ford Claude has summoned several business and political leaders for questioning. These include Jean Marie Vorbe and Dimitri Vorbe, whose electricity plants in Haiti were taken over by Mr. Moïse's government, and Réginald Boulos, a banking and grocery store magnate who borrowed money from the ONA.
The Vorbes and Mr. Boulos did not respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Sanon, by comparison, does not appear to have been particularly wealthy. He set up more than 20 companies in Florida over two decades, including medical services and real estate businesses, but filed for bankruptcy protection in 2013.
In court documents related to the bankruptcy, Mr. Sanon listed his annual income as US$60,000, from the New Hope Cancer Center in Port-au-Prince and Organization Rome Haiti, an NGO providing housing and medical equipment in the country. Mr. Sanon disclosed assets of US$185,000 against debts of US$430,000. He lost his house in Bradenton, Fla., to bank foreclosure.
In the documents, Mr. Sanon said that he also owned a television station in Haiti and served as pastor at an evangelical church in the country, and had further business interests in the Dominican Republic.
Rémy Joshua Césaire, a Montreal-area man listed as UNIHA's CEO, told La Presse that Mr. Sanon was one of the charity's founders.
The plan was to build a hospital and university in Haiti, but it never got off the ground, the newspaper said. Mr. Sanon travelled to Montreal at one point for a meeting related to the organization.
"He worked in politics. I believe there was a political party in Haiti that wanted him to become its candidate in the elections, for the presidency," La Presse quoted Mr. Césaire as saying of Mr. Sanon.
Haitian police have said they started looking into Mr. Sanon almost immediately after the attack. According to their account, when officers surrounded mercenaries fleeing the home, the men began dialling Mr. Sanon's number. Among the gunmen were 26 Colombians and two HaitianAmericans, including James Solages, a former bodyguard at the Canadian embassy in Port-auPrince.
A raid on Mr. Sanon's house turned up 20 boxes of bullets, gun parts and a hat from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, according to Haitian authorities. Videos that appear to show the hit squad arriving at Mr. Moïse's house show a man, alleged to be Mr. Solages, announcing "this is a DEA operation" through a bullhorn.
The DEA has denied any involvement in the killing.
Canadian Foreign Minister Marc Garneau spoke via videoconference Monday with Haitian Prime Minister Claude Joseph. Mr. Joseph's office said Mr. Garneau promised Canadian support for Haitian police "in the fight against insecurity."
Officials from the U.S. departments of Justice and Homeland Security, and the FBI, met in Portau-Prince Sunday with police chief Léon Charles.
Mr. Pierre said he hoped the FBI's involvement would help allay doubts about the investigation. Haitians are increasingly questioning the police's official narrative of the attack, particularly the notion that the mercenaries were able to breach the president's bedroom without any interference from his bodyguards.
Mr. Pierre said the heads of three police units responsible for protecting Mr. Moïse have been placed on administrative leave and are being interrogated by Mr. Charles. These are Dimitri Hérard, Léandre Pierre Osman and Paul Addy Amazan. A fourth man, presidential security coordinator Jean Laguel Civil, has been subpoenaed by Mr. Claude, the prosecutor.
Colombian police said over the weekend that Mr. Hérard had frequently travelled to the country.
Mr. Pierre, meanwhile, said the government was just as incredulous as everyone that there had apparently been no fight between the assassins and the security tasked with protecting Mr. Moïse.
"On our side, we didn't believe it." he said. "Not a gunshot."
With a report from Stephanie Chambers in Toronto.

Hipcamp sees opportunities, challenges in quest to bring sharing economy to the great outdoors

Full text: THE LISTING The arrival in Canada of a new service for connecting private landowners with campers is bringing the sharing economy to a new category of user. But as ride-sharing and roomsharing did before it, campground-sharing is running headlong into local rules and regulations that in some instances ban the practice outright.
"What we see is the regulations and local rules can vary widely, and also how [the landowner] hosts: In some places it's tent camping, in other places RV camping and in other places structures. It comes down to what they want to do and how their land is zoned," said Tegh Singh Bedi, who is the general manager for the Canadian arm of Hipcamp, the U.S.-based online service founded in 2013 to connect campers with campgrounds.
Hipcamp launched in Canada in June, in partnership with Ontario-based startup Pitched. Since then, the service says it already has more than 600 places to stay and it is adding campers by the day.
Internationally, the service claims that more than 700 hosts have listed their properties and it has enabled more than three million "nights under the stars" through its platform.
But like gigantic sharing economy platforms Uber and Airbnb, which have run into fights over local regulations, Hipcamp has also faced challenges from local municipalities over how land is zoned for use and whether private landowners can become campground operators overnight.
"We ensure our hosts are working with their municipality to fully understand how the bylaws are laid out. If we are made aware of any issues with a particular host, we'd work with them directly ... in some cases we may take them off the platform," Mr. Singh Bedi said.
However, it's up to hosts to do their research and obtain any licences, but they don't need to provide proof to Hipcamp that they can legally offer a campground before they start booking stays or collecting revenue.
So it's easy to sign up and start hosting - but if a municipality comes with fines or enforcement, Hipcamp isn't on the hook.
"It's not a requirement of the on-boarding process for them to provide us with that ... but it is a requirement of the on-boarding process for them to observe the laws within their jurisdiction," Mr. Singh Bedi said.
Part of the appeal for a service such as Hipcamp is that camping is having a moment. With the Canada-U.S. border still closed for casual travel and cottage booking services reporting record rental rates, people looking to get out of the house for a weekend are rediscovering the simple pleasures of a tent, a yurt or a parking spot for an RV.
In Ontario, some provincial parks report every weekend being booked solid until Labour Day. Leading into the summer, demand was so high that authorities also started cracking down on reselling because a secondary market had sprung up.
Canadian citizens and longtime residents can camp for free on Crown land for up to 21 days, but those looking for a more guided experience are increasingly turning to options such as Airbnb and Hipcamp.
But newcomers to the service should be aware that in Ontario, many municipalities have restrictive rules for how long a trailer, RV or tent may be set up on private land. Unlike the short-term rental market that argued it had launched itself into a legal void, even unpaid overnight camping or RV parking on private land is often specifically banned by Ontario towns and regions.
Denise Gough-Rose, who is a seamstress and a home baker in Crediton, Ont., saw a socialmedia advertisement for Hipcamp and decided to try it, launching her listing as Country Camping at Rosemanor for $55 a night.
"It's a heritage farm and we have the middle property, we have two acres to ourselves with a great big yard at the side," she said. "At night, the stars above are breathtaking, and you can hear the cows mooing. I'm quite a birder and there [are] 20 or more different varieties here."
Ms. Gough-Rose said she couldn't get ahold of her municipality to find out whether what she was doing is legal. "I looked into it and couldn't find anything," she said.
Currently, she offers RV camping with two parking spots and a fire pit. They don't offer hydro, though they allow generators and there's water but no sewer hookups.
The zoning bylaw of South Huron, the municipality that includes Crediton, is explicit: "The location or use of a mobile home in any zone is prohibited unless specifically provided for."
There are different rules for residential, agricultural or rural small holdings - but even if allowed, there are limits to how many nights a homeowner can use to park an RV.
Asked whether she would keep hosting if it required a licence or inspections: "It would be a deal-breaker," Ms. GoughRose said.
Other hosts The Globe and Mail spoke with had done no research on their local municipality's rules, and some who preferred not have their names used suggested they'd like to stay below the radar of enforcement officials.
Dani Carlton (a photographer) and Jennifer McCabe (a realtor) offer two "glamping" campgrounds for visitors for between $150 and $170 a night at a 10-acre site the duo live on in the municipality of East Gwillimbury, Ont.
Ms. Carlton said because the camping structures were not permanent, they were told they don't need to apply for permits to host campers. (The first groups stayed over the Canada Day long weekend.)
"We're pretty booked up already, I think we have two weekends left" for the remainder of the summer season, Ms. Carlton said.
But this does not follow the town's zoning bylaw.
"The town's zoning bylaw outlines that overnight, non-serviced camping is reserved exclusively for public or institutional lands. It does not allow overnight camping for ‘agri-tourism use', therefore, the town does not have a permitting process available for this type of camping," said Danielle Verneuil, a communications officer for the town, adding that the bylaw department would respond to infractions on a complaint basis.
Mr. Singh Bedi said Hipcamp expects hosts to comply with applicable laws.
"Anything that's made aware to us, we take action," he said.
"What we are doing is a new type of concept and a new service ... we are eager to collaborate and make this a reality so it's safe and affordable for Canadians to get outside."

Full text: The new leader of Canada's national housing agency says the best way to combat soaring home prices is to build more housing.
In some of her first public comments since taking the helm of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. in April, Romy Bowers said she is concerned about the spike up in home prices over the past year and the level of homeowner indebtedness.
"I do think housing is becoming a really significant societal issue," Ms. Bowers said in an interview. "What worries me about escalating house prices is that it exacerbates the gap between homeowners and people who are not homeowners."
Since the start of the pandemic, homeowners have been able to take advantage of record low borrowing rates and have seen their household wealth increase as property values jumped. The average home price is 38 per cent higher than last year and a typical house across the country costs more than $700,000, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association.
Meanwhile, renters, many of whom earn low wages, suffered employment losses or were required to continue working in congregate settings such as warehouses and grocery stores when COVID-19 was quickly spreading. And even though rental rates fell in the city centres, rent is still high. Cities are becoming more unaffordable.
While first-time home buyers are unable to save for a down payment, older homeowners are not selling in part because alternatives, including condos, are so expensive.
"It really makes me feel that we need to double down on some of the things that we have been working on - our focus on supply, our focus on rental, our focus on creating more dense neighbourhoods in our cities," Ms. Bowers said, referring to CMHC's programs to repair rental units and build new rental housing.
Ms. Bowers said she has heard from many young people that home-ownership seems so out of reach. "In my mind, the best way to address house-price escalation is to provide more supply," she said.
Under Ms. Bowers's predecessor, Evan Siddall, CMHC expanded its focus of providing mortgage insurance to include providing affordable housing to vulnerable populations.
Like Mr. Siddall, Ms. Bowers said she believes the glorification of home-ownership needs to end.
She said more needs to be done to add more homes per square kilometre in urban centres, a process also known as densification.
Ms. Bowers said the rise in home prices is not new. She pointed to a 2018 CMHC study that found the main reason behind house-price escalation was the mismatch between demand and supply.
"I am very supportive of actions that can be taken by all levels of government to ensure there is a robust supply response to demand," she said. "I look forward to doing further work on that, to really think about how we can really accelerate the increase in supply in urban centres particularly, but all across the country."
Ms. Bowers said there is "no silver bullet" to quickly adding supply. But she said there are lots of barriers to development at the local level, such as zoning issues and nimbyism, or not in my backyard, from homeowners resistant to denser neighbourhoods.
A former managing director at Bank of Montreal, Ms. Bowers joined CMHC in 2015 and held several roles, including chief risk officer and senior vice-president overseeing the agency's affordable housing programs.
Ms. Bowers said she has spent her first 90 days as chief executive officer meeting agency staff and listening to more than 100 external housing stakeholders to discuss the agency's role in housing and how it can improve.
She said CMHC's announcement this week that it will loosen its insurance requirements for home buyers will not lead to higher home prices or fuel demand because the changes simply move CMHC back in line with its private-sector competitors.
The looser requirements, which allow home buyers to have a lower credit score and slightly higher debt burdens, unwind tighter rules the agency introduced a year ago.
"We made the changes unilaterally [last year] and basically the business moved to our competitors," she said. "And we don't think there is a net impact on the housing market as a whole."
Ms. Bowers said CMHC made the initial decision to tighten rules at the beginning of the pandemic when the economy was shutting down, job losses were mounting, and there was great uncertainty about the housing market.
CMHC, which used to be the largest provider of mortgage insurance, expected the two private-sector insurers to follow suit but they did not. As a result, lenders funnelled more of their business to CMHC's competitors.

Full text: Toronto's housing market eased further in June, with the average selling price declining 2 per cent over May and sales dropping for the third straight month.
There were 11,106 home resales in the Toronto region in June, up 29 per cent over the same month last year, but 7 per cent lower than in May, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board, or TRREB. That followed two consecutive months of double-digit percentage sale declines.
Across the Toronto area, the average selling price was $1,089,536, a jump of 17 per cent over last year but down 2 per cent from the previous month.
The home price index, which adjusts for luxury home sales, hit $1,050,300, an increase of nearly 20 per cent year over year. But compared with May, the price index was flat after rising as much as 5 per cent from January to February.
Realtors said at the beginning of the year that virtually every property was selling but now buyers are pickier.
"Buyers are more selective.
They have more choice," said Paul Singh, a realtor with Justo Brokerage.
Mr. Singh said homes that would have fetched $1-million in the first quarter of the year are now selling for between $970,000 and $980,000. At the same time, he said other properties continue to be high in demand and are going for well over the asking price.
In the Simcoe region, north of Toronto, and in Halton, to the west, the home price index was essentially flat after declining in the previous month. The pandemic's real estate boom was led by homebuyers seeking bigger properties outside of Toronto, which led to price inflation across smaller cities and rural areas that were not accustomed to bidding wars and multiple offers on properties.
With houses selling above $1million in the Toronto region, more buyers have been priced out of the market or have considered condos. Last month, resales fell for every type of property except condos, which rose by 4 per cent over May. The average selling price of a condo was $683,479 across the Toronto region, which was flat over the same period.
The number of new listings of all types of homes continued to decline in June and TRREB renewed its call on policy makers to help real estate developers build more homes. "The only long-term solution to affordability is increasing supply to accommodate perpetual housing needs in a growing region," TRREB president Kevin Crigger said in a news release.
Mr. Crigger and most of the real estate industry has said the federal government's higher immigration targets will continue to fuel sales and prices.
Zaynah Marani, an immigration lawyer with her own firm, Marani Law LLP, said that she has seen more new permanent residents this year. Ms. Marani said that while most of the new immigrants are already in Canada, becoming a permanent resident allows them to buy real estate without paying the 15-percent foreign real estate buyers' tax that is in place in the Toronto region. She said that motivates new immigrants to buy property.
June was the first month under the federal government's stricter mortgage stress test. It is unclear whether this contributed to the slowdown in activity.
In the country's most expensive real estate market, sales were also down in June. In the Vancouver region and B.C.'s Fraser Valley, the volume of sales fell 12 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively, according to their local boards. However, prices for all types of properties were higher than in the previous month.
In the Vancouver region, the home price index for a detached house hit $1,801,100. In the Fraser Valley, it reached $1,324,400.

House near Wychwood Park blends features built more than a century apart

Full text: The picture window in Leah Fuller and David Sebald's living room frames what, at a glance, appears to be one big tree. But the swirl of twisting branches actually comes from two separate trunks. The closest to the windows is a pear tree. The other, just behind, is for apples. (Every fall, a charity called Not Far From the Tree picks the fruit, giving some to Ms. Fuller and Mr. Sebald and some to food banks, community kitchens and local health centres.)
The way the pair of plants blend is an apt metaphor for Ms. Fuller and Mr. Sebald's home as a whole. The front and back halves of the house were built over a century apart. The street-facing section is Victorian circa 1880 and the rest is modern circa not long before COVID-19 - yet the two sections come together seamlessly.
When the couple bought their house 11 years ago, they were attracted by the location - near Toronto's popular Wychwood Park - and the sense of history. Their place was originally a farmhouse, surrounded by what used to be crop fields.
Some of the original details remained, such as the turned wood railings that march up the front hall staircase.
What they enjoyed less: some of the common issues in very old homes.
The living room, stuck in the middle of the ground floor, had no windows. The kitchen, at the back, was almost as dark - and its walls were made of a thin layer of poorly insulated brick. Sometimes, in the middle of deepest, frostiest winter, the pipes would freeze. "We had to shut off the water when the temperatures got too cold," says Ms. Fuller, a teacher. The same wall was also bulging into the nearby laneway, so much so that they were afraid that a car might get too close and crash into the side of the house.
And when the couple started to think about having children and wanting an extra bedroom upstairs, they originally contemplated moving.
But "two things stopped us," says Mr. Sebald, who works in food services. "Buying something in our neighbourhood had become prohibitively expensive. And we had really fallen in love with our neighbours. Good neighbours are priceless.
We've said to them several times: If you move, we move."
Instead of selling and upsizing, the couple decided to stay put and renovate with an extension on the back. To handle the overhaul, they hired Barbora Vokac-Taylor, a high-school friend of Mr. Sebald and a designer with a skill for balancing sometimes contradictory things. Her houses can all at once be minimal yet warm, white walled yet family friendly, modern and Victorian. "Barbora makes amazing things happen," Ms. Fuller says.
"We put a modern, black-clad addition on the back of the home to extend the space," Ms. Vokac-Taylor says. "But the roofline is peaked. It not only fits in with the front of the house, it works with the neighbourhood as a whole." (The area is eclectic, with both new and old homes including some with pre-Victorian roots.
In fact, there is a neighbouring ultraquaint cottage that dates back to 1835. It was originally used to collect tolls from farmers as they traversed what was once a privately owned thoroughfare that is now a major artery in Toronto, Davenport Road.)
Part of the design process involved determining what aspects of the house to keep and what aspects to remake. The front hall, the formal dining area and the original stairs all stayed. The once-windowless living room was relocated to the back of the new addition, right next to a giant wall of glass. The kitchen now looks onto the living room and therefore the windows, and has skylights overhead to bring in additional light.
Upstairs, the three original bedrooms stayed. A fourth, the master suite, includes a massive ensuite and large windows that are surrounded by treetops.
Renovations can be stressful, but Ms. Fuller and Mr. Sebald found moments of delight to enjoy the process.
During the demolition phase, they came across mementoes of the home's past that they have preserved, including century-old glass bottles and a newspaper from 1930. "The paper has a story about Babe Ruth," Mr. Sebald says. "He was insisting he get paid what at the time was a lot of money in baseball - $85,000 a year."
(In 2021, $85,000 would be equivalent to about US$1.4-million, a bargain by today's MLB standards.)
The couple have also made space for future moments of delight. Although they have a formal entrance off the sidewalk from the front, they typically enter the house through the back laneway, where they have a mudroom. Outside the back entrance, they've earmarked a long black wall for a street art mural. "We haven't decided what we'll do with it yet," Mr. Sebald says. "We just know we want it to be creative."
Thinking through the layers of time of the home has given Ms. Fuller and Mr. Sebald valuable perspective. The house was finished in late 2019, just before the family had to hunker down for the pandemic. "This house has now seen two families through major pandemics," Ms. Fuller says. "The Spanish flu and COVID-19. We feel lucky because we know we have a lot more comfort than whoever lived here 100 [years] ago."

Halifax's Muir Hotel is more than just something new on the harbour

Full text: When is a hotel more than just a place to sleep?
Touring the site of Halifax's Muir, which opens in late fall, a few answers are as clear as the view of the iconic Angus L.
Macdonald suspension bridge: When it occupies part of a historic, two-hectare waterfront address; when it's the first luxury hotel in a city not known for refined lodging; and when it launches in the midst of a global pandemic.
If that weren't pressure enough, Scott Armour McCrea, president of the Armour Group, the real estate development and construction company transforming the site, cites no less than "Fogo Island meets RitzCarlton" as his goal for the $200million mixed-use development, known as Queen's Marque.
"I'm trying to create a Canadian landmark, to be honest with you," he says.
Although humility runs in the blood of born-and-bred Maritimers, McCrea's bold aspirations capture a new confidence rising up from the East. You can see it in Muir's proud tagline, "Born of this Place," and recent national news headlines about Halifax's desirability, both as a refuge from COVID and an affordable place to live, with nearly deserted beaches a mere 20 minutes from downtown.
With all the buzz, it's no wonder both Condé Nast Traveler and CNN Travel included Nova Scotia as one of the top 21 places to go in 2021, name-checking Muir as one of the main draws.
The three wharf buildings of Queen's Marque jut out into the harbour like majestic, seaworthy vessels, and are the work of acclaimed Nova Scotia architect Brian MacKay-Lyons - the natural choice for the job.
"We have one of the most important architects in the country living here, and yet he'd never had a commission of this scale in the province," McCrea says. "It would have seemed almost wrong not to use him."
The development, which includes stores, restaurants and a residence, was designed to be noticed and be used, much like the central piazzas of European cities. Muir, which means "sea" in Gaelic, is the jewel in Queen's Marque's glittering, salt-kissed crown.
Affiliated with Marriott's Autograph Collection, Muir is independent in style and spirit. From the time you walk past the hotel's Range Rover parked out front and enter the lobby, which at the time of writing is still a construction zone, it's easy to grasp that while the materials speak to a local vernacular - from salt-and-pepper granite to Tatamagouche sandstone and Muntz, a marine metal - their elevated application is part of a new design language.
"People's perceptions of the Maritimes are hackneyed, but there's a modern aesthetic emerging and we can put an exclamation point on that here," McCrea says.
Enter Alessandro Munge of Toronto's award-winning Studio Munge. With projects such as Nobu Toronto and Brooklyn's the William Vale hotel to his name, Munge knows luxury hospitality like few others.
That said, Halifax is different, less studied and sleek. Did Munge feel the pressure of being hired as a "from away" firm?
"I don't usually chase clients, but I really, really wanted this," he says. "With bigger city projects, you're one of many, and you risk blending in. Muir offered the chance to push the envelope and affect the region in a positive way. For us, the key was not coming in with a humble approach that's on point with those who live there."
Muir's 109 rooms, all but four of which have water views, call to mind staterooms on a private yacht. Walls are curved and wrapped in weathered V-groove white oak. Both the bar and bathroom mirror feature a backlit, porthole-shaped mirror. Although the shipbuilding narrative can't be avoided, its references are whisper-discreet. "Yes, we're on the ocean, but we stayed away from the thematic," Munge says with a laugh. "There are no light fixtures made of rope, no big anchor in the lobby - this isn't Vegas!"
Like beach glass or driftwood softened by waves, everything in the room begs to be touched, from the gleaming walnut arm of a Stickley-inspired chair to the leather-clad bedside tables. "If your hands wander over every surface, that's a sign of success for me," Munge says. "I want people to relax and rub the arm of the chaise or feel the raked texture of the oak floors underfoot."
Instead of a traditional desk, there's a walnut table with exposed joinery tucked alongside a modular sectional. "It's more of a kitchen table than a desk," McCrea tells me, unable to resist an East Coast kitchen party joke.
Overhead, a ceiling fixture mimics the silhouette of a traditional gas lantern with a leather-handled twist. On the wall of each room is a painting of Nova Scotia, and no two are alike. On the bed, a considered decision was made to avoid the usual white top sheet and go with fog grey.
Studio Munge even designed a Muir Tartan throw for the foot of the bed. "We deconstructed a Scottish tartan and there's a softness and almost tenderness to the palette - no punches of colour. It's our way of representing Nova Scotia's landscape." If that all sounds appealing, you can bring it home for a price; some of the furniture pieces and textiles are for sale, allowing visitors to extend their coastal experience.
Step out of the private space and back into the public and you'll find an art gallery (part of Queen's Marque's $7-million collection), wellness centre with halotherapy salt room and even a guests- and members-only speakeasy serving premium historic cocktails. McCrea says the speakeasy might be called BKS, but declines to spell out the acronym. "I'll never tell," he says, raising an eyebrow. "It's a secret."
As for Muir, the word's out.
Come fall, this new waterfront retreat will be a welcoming postCOVID home away from home - and much more than just a place to sleep.

Paper raises $100-million in bid to tutor students by text

Full text: A Montreal company that has emerged as one of Canada's fastest-growing startups by using instant messaging to tutor students has raised US$100-million, led by Silicon Valley venture capital giant IVP.
Paper Education Co. Inc. has been in the market selling online tutoring for only three school years, but already has 100 U.S.
school districts as clients and is available to one million students.
Paper says it is on track to reach $50-million in annualized revenue in 2021, up from less than $1million in early 2019. Prepandemic, the company had 100 tutors and 30 other employees; today it has 1,000 tutors and 130 staff.
"This isn't just good growth for an educational technology company or a Canadian company, this is amazing growth for any company anywhere in any sector," said Tom Loverro, general partner with IVP, which previously backed Coinbase, Netflix and Twitter. "Their growth speaks to how much this product is needed.
If they can take this to every public school district in America" - there are about 13,500 of them - "it could be a very large market."
Paper aims to transform tutoring by making the service equitable and accessible to any student, who often need help around the clock. The company doesn't sell to parents, but to school districts, which pay US$50 to US$100 per student a year. It is available free to students in English, Spanish, French and Mandarin, covering 200 topics.
"I was always bothered by the fact that it was students that could afford tutors that would use tutors," said Cassie Parham, assistant superintendent with Irvine Unified School District, a Paper client with 42 schools near Los Angeles. "I love the idea of providing tutors for free," she said, praising Paper for the quality of its tutoring, accessibility and responsiveness.
"There's not many companies I would go out on a limb for and endorse. Paper is one of them."
Philip Cutler, Paper's 32-yearold chief executive officer, grew up in privilege in Westmount, Que., the son of a real estate developer and art gallery owner. His grandfather was a judge and his grandmother was May Cutler, an author, onetime mayor of Westmount and founder of Tundra Books, which published The Hockey Sweater. Mr. Cutler attended private school and played football at McGill, where he earned an education degree. In his 20s he started a summer camp and was elected to Westmount Council.
Despite his comfortable circumstances, Mr. Cutler was struck by inequities in the classroom as he began teaching at two schools in Westmount. Only the wealthiest students had private tutoring, but "rarely was it the students who actually needed the help the most" who got it, he said.
He also knew from his experiences tutoring that the process was inefficient. Students might only need a few minutes of help in an hour-long session. Or they might need well over an hour, or help when it wasn't available. So he left teaching to start Paper, originally called GradeSlam, with developer Roberto Cipriani, the company's chief technology officer. They took the company through a local accelerator to test whether students would respond well to tutoring by text, which they did.
The service uses the Socratic teaching method, meaning tutors don't provide answers but prompt students to find them themselves. Rather than sit with one student at a time for set sessions, tutors handle four to five simultaneously and are available on demand. Paper uses artificial intelligence to match students and the best available tutors, and to predict optimal staffing levels based on demand. "We've eliminated a lot of the inefficiencies; that has allowed us to pass on those savings," Mr. Cutler said.
Paper also allows students to run first drafts of essays by tutors.
Teachers can monitor all interactions between students and tutors.
Paper scouted out school districts that were early tech adopters but found no takers in Canada, which Mr. Cutler calls "disappointing ... but we have to focus on who wants to work with us."
That turned out to be California districts - which account for 75 per cent of Paper clients - starting with Laguna Beach Unified School District. "The first time I saw [Paper] I thought, ‘Why didn't I think of this,' " says Michael Morrison, chief technology officer with the district. In a district of 3,000 students, users signed on a total of 1,470 times last year, which was above expectations. Laguna Beach also referred other local districts to Paper.
Mr. Morrison attributed Paper's success to a pent-up demand for equitable tutoring, plus the flow of U.S. federal funding to schools to help them step up digital learning efforts, particularly during the pandemic. "I know a lot of districts used [federal funds] to do this," he said.
The financing was also backed by past investors Framework Venture Partners, Bullpen Capital, Reach Capital, Birchmere Ventures, Salesforce Ventures and BDC Capital.

Full text: Canadian corporations are taking their human-resources policies into previously unthinkable directions as they look to a future when COVID-19 recedes.
Lightspeed POS Inc. is among several companies nationwide making significant changes to their strategies on compensation, benefits and recruiting. The Montreal-based software company introduced a new policy in recent weeks offering unlimited vacation to employees and allowing them to work from anywhere, betting nevertheless that most will return to the physical space they were forced to abandon overnight.
"I do think that coming back to the office is going to be a big part of people feeling attached to the company and a feeling of belonging," Lightspeed chief executive officer Dax Dasilva said in a recent interview with The Globe and Mail.
"There is a magic being together."
As the pace of vaccination picks up in Canada in the weeks ahead and local economies reopen in tandem with a loosening of public-health restrictions, business leaders and human-resources specialists say the work world will experience a reset.
In some cases, what emerges will be unrecognizable, as traditional notions of where to work and when to take time off are wiped out to make way for new realities.
At Lightspeed, executives surveyed employees about what they wanted in a new human-resources policy and 82 per cent of them said they wanted to come back to the office with the flexibility of working remotely when they choose. Mr. Dasilva said he's not surprised by the result - both because the company's business is helping retailers and hospitality providers facilitate customer interactions and also because Lightspeed's headquarters and other offices have become what he calls "meaningful places."
Lightspeed's head office is in the Gare Viger, an old French château originally built for the Canadian Pacific Railway. The company occupies six floors of the building and announced this month that it will double its office space in the château as part of real estate company Jesta Group's development of the site.
"We help physical gatherings happen with our business in retail, restaurant, in golf, and we also help those companies go digital," Mr. Dasilva said. "So I don't want a company that doesn't gather itself."
The CEO and his team are also offering unlimited vacation to employees. And although he acknowledges such a policy has sometimes had the opposite effect at other companies that have tried it - unlimited time off results in people taking less time off because there are no parameters and they feel guilty for not working - he said it can be successful with the right implementation.
The wider goal is to offer staff maximum flexibility at a time when the competition for talent has widened beyond Canada's borders, Mr. Dasilva said.
"There are big U.S. companies in tech that are trying to entice the Canadian work force to work remotely for them. So that's a challenge. That's why we have to have compelling benefits and visionary working models," he said. "[We want employees to conclude], ‘Ok, I do have a lot of choice here. I can sort of design the way that I'm thinking about planning my time.' " Those sentiments are finding echoes at Waterloo, Ont.-based OpenText Corp., where CEO Mark Barrenechea said the coronavirus pandemic has created and accelerated a whole new set of expectations among staff. Gone are the days when a fridge stocked with beer and a foosball table would attract talent. Today, it's all about physical freedom and health support.
"Employees want control.
They want control of their space, they want control of their time," Mr. Barrenechea said in an interview.
Beyond that flexibility, however, an employer has to properly articulate a culture - a purpose and how each employee fits into that, Mr. Barrenechea said. "Vagueness is kryptonite" for millennial workers in particular, he said. "Expectations today are that yes, I need to be paid well for what I do, but you also need to value the contribution. You need to value the role regardless of location."
Mr. Barrenechea holds "allhands" meetings for OpenText's 14,000 employees in 40 countries every two weeks from his living room to engage staff and set that tone from the top. The company has hired a nutritionist and fitness guru. And it has created a $3million relief fund to pay for health-rated employee expenses not covered by insurance.
Before the pandemic, roughly 90 per cent of OpenText employees worked in an office-based environment and 10 per cent worked remotely. The CEO said the company expects its new normal will be 80 per cent working a flexible arrangement of two to three days in the office, while 20 per cent will work remotely only.
"Most employers think an office is where you create culture and performance, right? It's just wrong thinking," Mr. Barrenechea said. "Many of our jobs are no longer tethered to an office so we can widen the recruiting. We can recruit from Sherbrooke to Quebec City up through the Maritimes because we no longer have that office-based mindset."
If remote working has created new fertile ground for hiring, it has also flattened internal corporate hierarchies to some extent, said Mary Alice Vuicic, chief people officer for media company Thomson Reuters. And that in turn has facilitated creativity and where ideas come from, she said.
"You no longer have a separation of offices with people and, you know, who's more senior versus not," Ms. Vuicic said. "On a Zoom call or a Teams call, everybody is the same-sized square and it forces that almost democratization and that empowerment. Everybody has an equal voice."
Reuters last year designated a full day as a mental-health day and essentially paused operations. This year, there will be two such days, Ms. Vuicic said.
Over all, the company is attempting to create an environment that supports well-being, even when people are working. It now purposely defaults all of its meetings to end five or 15 minutes early from the normal scheduled end time as a "pens down" measure inciting people to take breaks.
(Woodbridge Co. Ltd., the Thomson family holding company and controlling shareholder of Thomson Reuters, also owns The Globe and Mail.) The health crisis has made workplace flexibility a reality, but not everyone has benefited equally from the change. A major swath of the labour force, notably working mothers, has been driven to the breaking point trying to balance home and work responsibilities.
Roughly 100,000 women in Canada have quit their jobs since the pandemic started and aren't looking for a new one, according to an analysis published by Royal Bank of Canada in March.
What's needed now is a further rethink of traditional working hours and previous standards for qualification in order to get more people in the work force, says Agata Zasada, vice-president of people and culture at Vancouverbased Bananatag, a communications software company.
"We have this opportunity to really open the floodgates around talent," Ms. Zasada said.
"As an example, [at Bananatag] we've taken off education as one of the requirements for almost every job. ... I think we need to get creative around flexibility."
One area where employees are pushing harder is on where they work, and that has expanded beyond the general orbit of their employer's city to other provinces, says Stephanie Hollingshead, CEO of the HR Tech Group, a non-profit association for human-resources professionals in Canada's tech sector. Roughly half of companies the association polled in a recent survey said they are willing to accommodate such requests, while almost a quarter said they are planning to allow remote work for other countries.
"It's becoming more complex for the HR teams to manage that," Ms. Hollingshead said. "But it's being demanded. Talent is being able to drive what they want. And [many of them] want to work partially remote or fully remote from some beautiful location."
Aside from the tax implications, the shift in having more employees work farther away from the mother ship will have other consequences, Ms. Hollingshead said. "The day-to-day management of the team is challenging, too, when you're not able to physically put eyeballs on people and see how they're doing," she said. "We're seeing a lot more use of technology tools. ... People won't like this, but [it means] a significant increase in meetings."
As millions of workers recalibrate their lives in the months ahead to split their time between home and office, these new realities will collide with traditional ways of organizing and benchmarking employees, said Brian Kropp, chief of research for Gartner Group's human-resource practice. Not only will employers have to figure out how to create hybrid models that work for their companies in terms of physical space layouts, work schedules and other logistics, they'll also have to assess the broader ramifications on a company's culture and objectives.
For example, Gartner data show while there is little performance difference, if any, between employees working remotely and those working at the office, managers say those coming into work are higher-performing, Mr. Kropp said. He said that has the potential to exacerbate gender inequality because women are more likely to say they want to work from home than men.
"You put that together and what you see is potential significant backsliding on progress that we've made on closing gender wage gaps," Mr. Kropp said.
"Because managers become more biased to the people that they see in the office, which are more likely to be men than women."
Another big question being debated among humanresources professionals is tied to cost-of-living adjustments: Should you pay less to employees who work remotely in places where the cost of living is less than that of the city to which their job is tied? Many companies are choosing not to cut the pay of these employees (which could expose them to reputational damage) but rather to slow down any raises they will get over time, Mr. Kropp said.
"We've gone through in the last 14 months the biggest experiment in changing work that we've ever had," Mr. Kropp concluded. "But what we're going to experience across the next 14 months is actually going to be even more disruptive and a bigger shift and a bigger change."

‘There's a panic among people': Rising rents in Montreal threaten the fabric of the city

Full text: A blue banner hanging from the Manoir Lafontaine snapped in the wind on a blustery spring day, as if to emphasize its message, loud and clear in either language: "Renoviction."
The corporate owners of the 12storey building in Montreal's Plateau neighbourhood - Hillpark Capital - were ordering residents to move out by the summer for major renovations. But the renters weren't going quietly. At a lively protest in April, full of jangling tambourines and bullhorn speeches, they claimed they were being "renovicted," to be replaced by wealthier tenants. (In a statement, Hillpark said the building is in bad shape and needs extensive work and that tenants will have a right to return at a level of rent controlled by provincial law.)
It helped make Manoir Lafontaine a symbol of what some are calling the city's housing crisis. In a place where only about a third of residents own their homes, that means a crisis of rent.
For decades, Montreal has been an oasis of affordability. A combination of factors, from the language barrier to a weak economy to ample housing stock, made renting in the city a rare North American bargain - small-town prices in one of the continent's biggest cities. Five years ago, the average cost of a two-bedroom apartment in Montreal was $760 a month, compared with $1,375 in Vancouver.
But a series of trends has started to dismantle Montreal's bragging rights. Renovictions are halfway between symptom and cause, but the growth of Airbnb, a lack of new building in fashionable neighbourhoods, a provincial economic boom and a global trend toward investing in real estate have all contributed.
Not even a pandemic could stem the tide. The average rent in Greater Montreal increased by 4.2 per cent in 2020, the largest jump in almost 20 years, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. The cost of available apartments, meanwhile, was 46 per cent higher than rented ones.
Numbers can only hint at the local angst about what feels like the slow death of a renters' city. In a place where artists, newcomers and blue-collar workers alike could generally count on living affordably, everyday conversation is increasingly dominated by real estate. Local governments, especially at the city and borough level, are frantically trying to encourage the construction of affordable housing, or slow its removal, with some of the continent's toughest bylaws.
Montreal is at risk of becoming more like any other Canadian city, argues Véronique Laflamme, spokesperson for the tenants' rights group FRAPRU.
"There's a panic among people who say, ‘I can't afford a $1,500 rent,' " she says. "We're getting dangerously close to Toronto and Vancouver."
The housing market finally might seem to be turning on Montreal, but the primal forces of supply and demand have done their part to keep the city's rents affordable.
Large swaths of Montreal were built in the early 20th century, before the era of mass home ownership and suburban flight, guaranteeing a permanent stock of apartments near the city centre. (Picture the kind of triplex whose outdoor staircases are a visual emblem of the city.) As a result, the greater Montreal area contains more than 600,000 purpose-built rental apartments, compared with slightly more than 100,000 in the Vancouver area - a bounty that has helped control costs.
The relative antiquity of Montreal apartments is also a reflection of its bygone heyday, another factor holding down rents. For decades, the city's population has stagnated relative to its Canadian neighbours. In 1981, the Montreal and Toronto metro areas were roughly the same size, with populations of about three million.
Since then, Toronto has added nearly two million more people than Montreal has. Slower growth in la métropole has meant less competition for housing.
But market forces alone can't explain the charmed existence of Montreal renters. They have also fought to keep their city affordable, pressuring the provincial government to institute some of the country's toughest rent controls - a generally tenant-friendly tribunal, the Régie du logement, was established in 1980 - or else simply taking matters into their own hands.
Sometimes the city's renters have seized whole neighbourhoods. In the late 1960s, a group of developers planned to tear down most of the Milton-Parc area, a patch of shabby-genteel stone apartments near McGill University, and build a modern complex of luxury high-rises, offices and shopping facilities known as La Cité. When residents rebelled, they managed to not only stop most of the development, but establish a land trust that created communal ownership of the land and buildings. Dimitrios Roussopoulos, an old lion of the left who described himself as the "general strategist" of the effort, is one of about 1,500 people who now lives in the community's 16 co-ops and six non-profit housing associations. He shares a four-bedroom, two-storey apartment that costs $800 a month.
"Within the six-block area, the real estate industry has no place," he says. "We've taken it off the market."
Outside of the Milton-Parc bubble, the market is currently doing strange things to Montreal rents.
By many indications, they should be falling, not rising. The pandemic kept thousands of immigrants and international students away from the city last year, while the Montreal census area added more new rental units - 10,600 - than it has in 30 years. The supply-anddemand factors are all trending in favour of tenants.
Instead, renting in the city is more expensive than ever: Available apartments were going for an average of about $1,300 last year, compared with less than $900 for ones that were occupied. That suggests rents could shoot up faster when the normal pace of new arrivals returns.
One factor seems to be a piece of otherwise good news: Quebec's vibrant economy. After decades of anemic economic growth - between 1981 and 2006, the province's real GDP grew 77 per cent, compared with 110 per cent in the rest of Canada - Quebec is experiencing a prolonged boom. Its jobless rate fell below the national average in September, 2016, and has mostly hovered under that threshold since. A tech explosion has seen Montreal become a global hub for video games and artificial intelligence. Royal Bank of Canada expects economic growth of more than 6 per cent in Quebec this year, the best in the country.
Montreal is now attracting a growing number of big-fish property investors, says David Wachsmuth, a professor at McGill's School of Urban Planning. Exact numbers are hard to come by, but he estimates thousands of units have been bought up in recent years by real estate investment trusts, or REITs, which take a systematic approach to squeezing the maximum legal revenues out of their buildings.
Another nagging problem for renters is the rise of Airbnb, which has taken a chunk of housing supply permanently off the market.
As many as 10,000 short-term rentals cater to tourists during the summer festival season, Prof.
Wachsmuth says - and the platform's effect is most acute in trendy neighbourhoods where competition for apartments is already heated.
The dwindling number of small buildings with small-time landlords - the bread and butter of Montreal housing - is not being replaced fast enough, either.
Housing construction is increasingly concentrated in single-family suburban homes or high-rise condo towers downtown, rather than low-rise walkups in the city's traditional residential neighbourhoods, Prof. Wachsmuth says.
(Montreal still builds fewer single-family homes than Toronto, he says, but the gap is shrinking.)
That pattern reminds him of another overheated Canadian market, and not in a good way. "Toronto is not a housing model for us to be emulating," he says. "So that's pretty worrying."
It would be impossible to mistake Mile End for anywhere but Montreal. The neighbourhood is all spiral staircases, cyclists and bilingual crosstalk; the yeasty smell of St- Viateur bagels floats on the air.
It doesn't look like a battleground against aggressive real estate capitalism, nor does Sean Michaels look like much of a field marshal. The Giller Prize-winning novelist wore a cheeky "À louer" (For Rent) pin on his overcoat on a recent spring afternoon and a baseball cap whose magic-wandand-sickle logo seemed to capture his slightly whimsical brand of leftism.
Casualties were everywhere, though, as he toured the streets he's seeking to preserve as a member of the activist group Mile End Ensemble. There was graffiti on the wall of the high-end fashion boutique that read, "There was $4 sandwiches here." A former bakery nearby was shuttered not because of the Mafia extortion that stings some Montreal businesses, but because of a rent increase.
"He survived the mob shakedowns, but not the landlords," Mr. Michaels says.
Higher rents are making life difficult for small businesses that give neighbourhoods their character, he argues. Local landlords have made it common practice to buy retail space, price the current tenant out and then hold onto the property until a richer business can take its place. That's how Mile End got its Lululemon, but also how it ended up pockmarked with vacant storefronts, Mr. Michaels says.
Among the casualties along Saint-Viateur St., however, is a notable survivor. After a public-pressure campaign led by Mile End Ensemble, the Montreal real estate company Shiller Lavy abandoned a reported 150-per-cent rent increase on the bookstore S.W.
Welch in March, allowing the neighbourhood stalwart to stay open.
The victory energized anti-gentrification campaigners, who have promised to keep up the fight. But Mr. Michaels acknowledges pitched battles against landlords to save individual businesses is not a sustainable solution.
"Shame did seem to work with Welch, but I was surprised by that," he says.
More government intervention in the rental market is the key to keeping the Shiller Lavys of the world at bay, Mr. Michaels believes, and with a municipal election in November, followed by a provincial contest next year, Mile End Ensemble is calling for a range of tougher policies from all levels of government, including a commercial vacancy tax and better protections against renoviction.
Premier François Legault has been ridiculed in recent months for being out of touch with the plight of Quebec renters. In April, he said he guessed an average rent in the province was $500 or $600 (for student housing with roommates, he later clarified), which opposition parties pounced on.
His government has also been attacked for refusing to call the current situation a "housing crisis."
The province hasn't been completely idle, however. The Legault government committed to building 6,000 affordable housing units in the province during its first mandate, while the Ministry of Housing and Municipal Affairs has signalled its intention to raise the burden of proof for landlords who claim they are evicting tenants for the sake of a renovation.
(Currently, they often perform minor cosmetic work before hiking the rent on the next tenant, advocates say.)
In Montreal's highly decentralized system of governance, some boroughs, such as the rapidly gentrifying Villeray-Saint-MichelParc-Extension, have taken the dramatic step of restricting when families can convert duplexes into family homes, as a way of preserving apartment stock.
The city's left-leaning mayor, Valérie Plante, meanwhile, has moved aggressively to build affordable housing with a series of unorthodox policy tools. Since 2018, the city has had the right of first refusal on certain lands for the purpose of building public works, and last year it identified more than 300 lots that it would consider buying to erect public housing if they came up for sale.
The city's so-called 20-20-20 bylaw, which came into effect on April 1, will also require developers to include up to 20 per cent each of social, family and affordable housing when they build new projects of more than about five units in certain parts of the city (social meaning governmentsubsidized, family meaning of a certain size and affordable meaning below market value). The mayor's administration has called it probably the most powerful such bylaw in North America.
Ms. Plante's opponent in the mayoral race, Denis Coderre, has his own provocative ideas for easing the city's rental crunch. He has floated the possibility of allowing towers to be taller than Mount Royal, which is currently forbidden. (Phyllis Lambert, the noted architect and preservationist, told the Montreal Gazette the notion went against the city's "DNA.") Despite this flurry of proposals, many of Montreal's activists fear local politicians aren't acting fast enough. Véronique Laflamme, of FRAPRU, called on governments to build 50,000 affordable apartments in the next five years - far more than currently envisioned.
"The logic of profitability is overcoming the basic needs of a large share of the population," she says. "For us, the solution is ambitious investments in public housing."
In the meantime, Montreal renters are, as usual, fending for themselves in creative ways. Tenants are increasingly using Facebook to pass on their leases as a way of thwarting big rent hikes.
Mutual aid societies have sprung up in some neighbourhoods to help keep local renters informed about their rights. There's also a growing "solidarity" between anglophone and francophone activist groups such as Mile End Ensemble and FRAPRU, Ms. Laflamme says.
The fate of Manoir Lafontaine, however, suggests activism might not be enough to stop Montreal's slide toward higher rent. At the protest in April, a tenant named Renée Thifault spoke to dozens of supporters over a bullhorn about the "predators" of Hillpark Capital, who didn't think residents like her were "human."
"When we're attacked, we have two choices - to flee or to defend yourself," she said. "I chose to defend myself."
A week later, she received her eviction notice.

Full text: Rescue workers continued the painstaking search for survivors amid the rubble of a collapsed Miami-area condominium tower, as an investigation begins into what caused the four-decade-old building to crumble.
Along with an examination of maintenance shortcomings, that will likely include a focus on the construction of the Champlain Towers South - which was spearheaded by a Canadian lawyer and businessman, Nathan Reiber, for whom the project was a major foray into Florida real estate.
As of Sunday, nine people have been confirmed dead and more than 150 are missing.
Authorities have collected DNA samples from family members of the missing to aid with identification.
Global Affairs Canada said at least four Canadian citizens are unaccounted for after the collapse, affecting three different families.
They did not release the names of the individuals, but a spokesperson said Canadian consular officials in Miami are in contact with local authorities.
Hope is dwindling for family members, as nobody has been found alive within the wreckage since the immediate hours after the building fell last Thursday.
Relatives, who have been kept from the site, have been frustrated with what they say has been a slow recovery effort.
"My daughter is 26 years old, in perfect health. She could make it out of there," one mother told rescuers during a weekend meeting with family members. A video of the meeting was posted by Instagram user Abigail Pereira.
People moaned and wept as Miami-Dade Assistant Fire Chief Raide Jadallah explained why he could not answer their repeated questions about how many victims they had found.
"It's not necessarily that we're finding victims, OK? We're finding human remains," the official said, according to the video.
But even as the search continues, authorities are already looking at what may have caused the disaster.
Late Friday, town officials in Surfside Florida released a 2018 structural engineering report that had identified a "major error" with part of the design around the pool deck, as well as "abundant" cracking in the parking garage's concrete columns.
The report was prepared by Morabito Consultants for the condo association, ahead of a mandated recertification process. In this Florida county, buildings must be shown to be structurally safe after reaching 40 years of age.
Evan Bentz, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Toronto, said that from the documents he's seen so far - including the 2018 report - nothing explains what could cause the collapse.
"I read that document and it is typical for a structure of that age to have the problems that this project had prior to collapse," he said.
"These are all important issues that need to be fixed. But what the report didn't say is that there were problems of sufficient magnitude to threaten the safety of the entire building."
Prof. Bentz says ultimately there are four reasons why the structure could have failed: a mistake with the original design, a problem with the materials, an issue with construction or poor maintenance.
"Usually when there's an engineering failure to this extent - and this is on the same scale as an airplane disaster - it's often the case that there's more than one cause," he said.
The aftermath of the building's collapse has brought attention to Mr. Reiber, the Canadian who was the most prominent of its developers.
Mr. Reiber, who died in 2014 at the age of 86, was born in Poland and raised in Montreal. After earning his law degree, he spent the bulk of his career in Toronto, before moving to Florida in the early 1980s.
As recent U.S. media reports have noted, Mr. Reiber faced significant legal and ethical troubles around the time of his move, including allegations of tax evasion related to previous business ventures. In 1984, he was allowed to resign from the Law Society of Upper Canada after failing to cooperate with an investigation into income-tax charges against him.
Those battles continued well into his time in Florida. In 1999, he won a Canadian tax-court appeal involving a 1974 assessment related to his involvement in the buying and selling of luxury boats, despite the judge in the appeals case calling the manner of the transaction "professionally and ethically bereft."
But with the Champlain Towers as a springboard, along with other new developments and apartment-to-condominium conversions, Mr. Reiber also successfully established himself as a Miami-era business-community leader and philanthropist.
In a glowing Miami Herald obituary after his death, Mr. Reiber was described as a family man with a sharp business sense who never lost touch with his immigrant roots. It described his role as a board member or benefactor for an array of charities, including those focused on health care and the arts, and noted that he addressed NATO while serving as executive vice-president of the Jewish Institute of National Security Affairs.
Mr. Reiber was not the only Canadian who was involved in the Champlain Towers' development. Another now-deceased Toronto businessman, Nathan Goldlist, was listed as president of the complex's management group during its early days.
Details of the Canadians' respective roles are now difficult to discern. Attempts to reach surviving family members of Mr. Reiber and Mr. Goldlist on Sunday were unsuccessful.
However, it appears that the Canadian developers' involvement in Champlain Towers, as well as their undertaking of new projects in Florida, ended many years ago. A corporate listing shows that Mr. Reiber's construction company, Nattel Construction Inc., was dissolved in 1999.
According to Donna DiMaggio Berger, a lawyer representing the condo association, on the original declaration of condominiums, two development companies are listed: Sannat Investments Inc.
and CAN-FLA Developments Inc.
John Pistorino, a prominent structural engineer in Miami, who wrote the region's 40-year recertification program, said he has been retained to investigate the cause of the collapse.
Mr. Pistorino designed the recertification process as a young engineer, after the collapse of a federal building in downtown Miami in 1974, which left seven people dead.
"The concrete was compromised because the steel was corroding inside of it. No one fixed it or took care of it. It was a little over 30 years old," he said. A key pillar of the recertification program was that a building needs to be constantly maintained.
Miami has an aggressive climate, he said. The air is full of salt from the ocean and that salt attacks concrete.
Mr. Pistorino estimates it may take three months to determine the cause of the collapse. He and his team will be looking at any available documentation that's still available such as drawings and permit applications, correspondence with residents - there have been complaints from owners in the past about water - as well as evidence from the site.
From what he's seen so far, Mr. Pistorino noted that there seems to have been "a lot of delayed maintenance of the building, which should never happen."
Questions have been raised about why the condo association waited so long to act on the consultant's report. But Ms. Berger said that characterization is unfair.
Ms. Berger said it took time to secure a US$12-million line of credit to complete the repairs, as well as find a contractor, plus COVID-19 caused delays. Moreover, she said, there was nothing in the report that warned of imminent danger.
In November, 2018, a town official reviewed the document and concluded that the building was in "very good condition," she said. One telling detail, she said, is that the board members continued to live in the building.
"Would any rational people who read a report and thought ... it was a hazard, continue to live there, with their children? It's not logical," she said. "And by the way, the vice-president and her two adult sons and their families are missing right now."
