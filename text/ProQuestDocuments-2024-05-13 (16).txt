Full text: The San Francisco Examiner's publisher has testified that he offered Mayor Willie Brown favourable treatment in editorials if Mr. Brown would support Hearst Corp.'s purchase of the San Francisco Chronicle. Hours later, the publisher said he misspoke.
Timothy White testified Monday that he told Mr. Brown at a lunch meeting last August, several weeks after the $980-million (Canadian) purchase of the Chronicle had been announced, that the Mayor could expect "more favourable treatment" in Examiner editorials if he supported the sale.
In an e-mail sent afterward to the head of Hearst's newspaper division and read in court, Mr. White said: "I asked Willie how I was going to justify to my superiors in New York wanting to support him and co-operate with him when he was seeming to go out of his way to make our lives difficult." Mr. Brown did not immediately return a call for comment yesterday.
Mr. White's testimony in federal court was later recanted by both the Hearst Corp. and Mr. White.
"It is not now -- nor has it ever been -- a policy of the San Francisco Examiner to trade favourable editorial coverage for any gains, including political influence," Hearst said in a statement.
In a statement distributed by Hearst, Mr. White said: "I was tired and confused by the question. The implication of my answer that the pages of the Examiner can be influenced, under any circumstances, is absurd."
Mr. White was the first witness in a lawsuit challenging Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle. Clint Reilly, a real-estate investor, losing candidate for mayor and unsuccessful bidder for the Examiner filed the suit.
Mr. Reilly's lawsuit contends that Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle was rigged and its transfer of the Examiner to a local publisher is a sham designed to give Hearst a local newspaper monopoly.
The Justice Department found no antitrust violations in the sale and approved the dissolution of the joint operating pact under which the Chronicle and Examiner have been published since 1965. But U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker issued a restraining order against the Chronicle sale on March 30, a day before it was to be completed.

Full text: Plan to defraud NHL leads straight to prison
When a little-known businessman from Hull, Que., is sentenced this summer to a prison term, it will mark the final chapter in a bizarre saga, which features not only hockey legend Phil Esposito but also Angus Charles Drogo Montagu -- His Grace, the 12th Duke of Manchester.
How the three intertwined in the Americanized version of Canada's favourite game sheds some light on the precarious nature of NHL franchises and on some of the fascinating figures who are drawn to them like kids to a ball hockey game.
Carroll Tessier, 48, the Quebecker, was convicted last month by a Florida jury for his part in a bungled attempt to defraud the NHL's Tampa Bay Lightning out of millions of dollars. He is scheduled to be sentenced in July.
But this story began nearly nine years ago at a groundbreaking ceremony in 1991 for a hockey arena in Tampa that was never built. Mr. Esposito, a founder of the then-new NHL franchise in Tampa, met Mr. Tessier, a Canadian businessman working out of Orlando.
Although Mr. Esposito's ambitions for the burgeoning U.S. hockey market were huge and his hockey talents legendary, raising money was not his forte. He had only weeks to come up with the $22.5-million (U.S.) balance on a $50-million franchise fee to NHL headquarters.
With no cash infusion, the fledgling franchise was on the brink of collapse.
Out of the sub-tropical woodwork stepped what looked to be a saviour, Mr. Tessier, a multilingual investor acting on behalf of an Irish corporation whose head was a British peer with illustrious forebears.
"Where's Lord Stanley?" Mr. Esposito joked. "We want the cup here."
What followed, according to U.S. federal prosecutor Jay Hoffer, was a "string of lies, misrepresentations and falsehoods" by the duke and Mr. Tessier to defraud Tampa Bay banks and other institutions "to get a foothold in the Lighting organization."
Both Lord Montagu, 61, and Mr. Tessier were indicted on fraud charges in 1995 for their parts in the swindle. Lord Montagu was convicted the following year and sentenced to 33 months in prison, prompting the Daily Mail of London to write the following on his bedraggled return to England: "Rarely in the thousand-year history of the British aristocracy has a duke been brought so low."
The life of the thrice-married duke, the Fleet Street tabloid said, "is a one-man argument against the hereditary rights of peers."
Unlike the duke, his erstwhile partner, Mr. Tessier, did not want to face the music. He jumped bail and fled overseas. But the long arms of U.S. law nabbed him in Rome last fall and returned him to Tampa for his trial, which has just now wrapped up.
Court documents and evidence in both trials laid out the scam, which went something like this: With the duke as the front man, the two accused used false statements about the supposed financial underpinnings of Link International Ltd., their Dublin-based company, to try to raise money from Tampa-area banks.
Mr. Esposito, 58, was so taken in by all the smooth talk that he allowed Mr. Tessier to use Tampa Bay Lighting offices and secretaries to cut a financing deal with the banks.
"See, he's a titled member of the English aristocracy and that conjures up visions of castles and huge estates and vast wealth," one of the prosecutors explained at the duke's trial. "Now, the Lightning were not aware, no one was aware, as they say in Texas, this man was mostly all hat and no ranch."
Indeed, it turned out that even though the duke signed an agreement with the Lighting franchise to buy $50-million in its assets, Link, the company he headed, only had a few thousand pounds in a London account.
The wary Florida banks never gave them any money, but the Lightning ended up paying $30,000 to a Colorado financial broker and $20,000 for Mr. Tessier's expenses.
Mr. Tessier even tried, unsuccessfully, to get a line of credit from Toronto-based CIBC Woody Gundy Securities Inc., which at the time was doing financing for the Ottawa Senators. That came to naught after Woody Gundy officials could not reach the duke, who was at Ascot, and "vague statements" from his London office about his overall net worth.
But when Link signed an agreement to invest in the franchise, Mr. Esposito, a larger-than-life figure with a propensity for bombast, proclaimed at a ceremony that the franchise's money problems were over.
"This is a very big day in franchise history because we no longer have any debt, and that is most important," he said, handing the duke a team sweater. "I think the National Hockey League will be very, very happy with us."
Brent Armstrong, Mr. Tessier's court-appointed lawyer, tried to argue that his client was innocent and that Mr. Esposito was a neophyte when it came to complicated investment deals.
"Despite Mr. Esposito's athletic prowess," Mr. Armstrong said, "he was not a man of business."
A bit of due diligence might have uncovered that in the mid-1980s, the duke had a brush with the law when charged with conspiracy to defraud a British bank. He was acquitted, but the judge minced no words about the duke's character.
He said that appointing him to the board of directors of a company could send "shivers down the spine of any investor. On a business scale of one to 10, he is one or less, and even that flatters him. He was absurdly stupid."
What is more, it was clear, according to the Daily Mail, that the financial rot had long ago "struck the Manchesters' genealogical roots."
The duke's grandfather was declared bankrupt three times and his own father sold Kimbolton Castle, the ducal seat where Catherine of Aragon died, for a pittance.
The duke's annual income was a mere $235,000 when he wrote a letter assuring the Lighting of his "personal investment" in the team of $25-million. He signed a bogus $3-million cheque that was used in an attempt to get the Lightning to advance more than $2-million in fees to Link.
At the duke's trial, his lawyer argued that his client had been made the "fall guy for a group of very sharp, evil men" who preyed on the duke's vanity, gullibility and foolishness.
The jury didn't buy his pitch, and the duke was taken away in handcuffs to a federal prison.
Mr. Tessier -- now being held in the Tampa's Morgan Street Jail, a federal detention centre -- is facing a long prison stretch, not only for the fraud charges but also for skipping bail.
Despite the court record, he remains a mystery man, partly because it is extremely difficult to communicate with U.S. federal inmates. They may not take incoming calls and may only make outgoing collect calls. Attempts to reach him were unsuccessful. His court-appointed lawyer declined comment.
The court records suggest that Mr. Tessier, who apparently was a junior hockey player in Hull, was involved in some dubious real-estate ventures in Orlando where he lived.
An acquaintance in Orlando said that Mr. Tessier, who told her that he spent most of his life in England and Indonesia, made all sorts of questionable claims. These included that his wife was an Indonesian princess and that he worked for the Sultan of Brunei.
"There was so much fantasy," she said, "that I think he does not have a clue of what's real and what isn't. He lives in a fantasy world."
As for Mr. Esposito, he is avoiding comment on the notorious case. Under his direction, the Tampa franchise did get off the ground after its Japanese investors -- who were extremely leery of Mr. Tessier and the duke -- eventually came through.
But the team has since been sold twice and Mr. Esposito was fired as general manager.
Last summer, Mr. Esposito, who lives in Tampa, married his long-time girlfriend, a local hair stylist, and he's working the NHL playoffs for FOX television as a colour commentator.

Abstract: ($10.25), which is almost as much fun to say as to drink. It's an offbeat, Spanish blend of parellada and muscat. The former is better known as the tart, aromatic component in most cavas, Catalonia's sparkling wines. The latter is responsible for, among other things, Italy's popular bubbly Moscato d'Asti. The result is a delicate, crisp, still wine with the muscat's pronounced grapey flavour.

Full text: As wedding season approaches, so come the perennial questions: How much do you have to reveal about what happened at the stag? and Where can you get a crowd-pleasing white for under 10 bucks?
The answer to the first question is, or course, the inverse of how much did happen. The answer to the second is your local Vintages outlet starting next Saturday.
The LCBO's monthly release features a terrific-value white (reds will be covered next week), Stony Hollow Chardonnay 1998 ($9.95). It's rich and butterscotchy, with plenty of gripping acidity. Don't let the English name fool you; the wine's from value-oriented Chile (San Esteban winery in the Andes foothills). Medium-bodied, it's versatile and could pair well with light appetizers, lobster, poultry, vegetarian dishes, even salmon or pork. And there's enough in stock -- 400 cases -- for a few weddings at least.
The other big chardonnay value is Gino Fasoli Le Perantonie Chardonnay 1998 ($12.70) from Veneto. It's organic, with negligible sulphur, which is good news for sensitive asthmatics. The wine is uncharacteristically concentrated for an Italian white, with a velvety texture and lemony zip.
Another bargain, though in a lighter, patio-sipping style, is Vallformosa Claudia 1999 ($10.25), which is almost as much fun to say as to drink. It's an offbeat, Spanish blend of parellada and muscat. The former is better known as the tart, aromatic component in most cavas, Catalonia's sparkling wines. The latter is responsible for, among other things, Italy's popular bubbly Moscato d'Asti. The result is a delicate, crisp, still wine with the muscat's pronounced grapey flavour.
The wines of Alsace have given Ontario winemakers a model for some of their best-value whites, especially dry rieslings and gewürztraminers. Cave Spring Auxerrois 1998 ($10.95) takes another cue from that white-wine-lover's mecca in northeastern France. The auxerrois grape is often used in Alsatian blends but here makes an admirable solo appearance, medium-bodied with a crisp, green-apple finish. It would pair well with shellfish. The full name of the grape is auxerrois blanc, an important qualification, since "auxerrois gris" is confusingly used as a synonym in France for pinot gris and "auxerrois" in the region of Cahors refers to the (red) malbec.
From Alace itself comes a different take on the same grape, this one from the concentrated fruit of old vines, Albert Mann Pinot Auxerrois 1998 ($14.85). Pay no heed to the price-inflating term "pinot" here; auxerrois is not a member of the noble pinot family. (The French may be sticklers about labels when it comes to freezing Canadian icewine out of their market, but they have no problem taking artistic licence with scientific nomenclature.) The wine is soft-textured and ever so slightly off-dry, with an intense peachy-pear flavour and clean finish.
Sauvignon blanc is the quintessential wine of spring, the best match for asparagus, with its bold, grassy-citrus flavour. The finest traditional sauvignons are said to be made in France's Loire valley, home of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé. Very fine, affordable stuff is made down-river, too, on the cheaper real estate around Tours. One good example is Guy Saget Sauvignon 1998 ($11.35). At about half the price of a good Sancerre, it delivers probably 75 per cent of the pleasure, with plenty of bright, lemony-apple flavour and fresh herbaceousness. If you can afford to venture up-river, consider Pierre Cherrier & Fils Sancerre Domaine de la Rossignole 1998 ($19.70), lemony, elegant and beautifully structured.
From an excellent Australian producer, Cape Mentelle Semillon/Sauvignon Blanc 1999 ($17.95) plays with the classic white Bordeaux blend but is grassier and more complex than most of its French counterparts. It is Pacific Rim sauvignon blanc with a Liz Taylor twist -- fuller bodied and elegantly perfumed.
Bollini Pinot Grigio 1998 ($11.60), from a reliable bottler of reasonably priced wines in northern Italy, does it again. Good balance here, though it's rounder, not as racy, as most pinot grigios.
The best chardonnays of the release come, not surprisingly, from Burgundy: Faiveley Montagny Les Joncs 1997 ($22.90), concentrated and crisp; and Pierre André Meursault 1997 ($49.90), creamy, peachy, smoky and lovely.
And riesling fans should consider Gräflich Schoenbor'scher Eigenbau Johannisberger Riesling Kabinett 1997 ($19.90), off-dry, rich in stone fruit and tart apple flavours. bcrosariol@globeandmail.ca

Full text: Getting there. Prepare yourself for a long haul. I flew Air Canada to Los Angeles (five hours) and connected with a Qantas flight to Sydney (15 hours), passing through 15 time zones. Qantas service in business class was excellent and helped time pass as comfortably as possible. Spacious, reclining seats had personal entertainment systems with non-stop movie features. Recently, the airline introduced menus created by celebrated Sydney chef Neil Perry, whose signature restaurant Rockpool is one of the best in the city. Earlier this month, Qantas said it would launch its own service from Canada in July, following the merger of code-share partner Canadian Airlines with Air Canada. The airline will offer daily Boeing 767 service via Honolulu, four return flights to Toronto and three to Vancouver.
Qantas Vacations is offering special air fares Down Under, with weekday prices starting at $1,199 from Vancouver. Other available fares include $1,299 from Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Regina, Saskatoon and Thunder Bay, $1,399 from Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, and $1,499 from Halifax, Quebec City and St. John's. Travel must take place between July 3 and Sept. 10 with a minimum stay of seven days (maximum one month) in Australia. A free stopover is also permitted in Los Angeles or Honolulu. Contact a travel agent. Air Canada/Canadian will start Toronto-Honolulu-Sydney service July 3. For other flight options with Air New Zealand and Canada 3000 contact a travel agent.
First-time visitors to Australia should also consider using a tour packager familiar with Sydney and Australian attractions and lodgings. There are a number of Canadian tour operators offering Australia packages. One of the largest is Goway Travel (800-387-8850, or www.goway.com). Travellers can find the "Aussie specialist" nearest them at the Web site: www.australia.com. . Getting around. Don't even consider driving a car when you're touring central Sydney. At any time, traffic is heavy and parking facilities are jammed. During the Olympics, private cars won't be allowed within kilometres of Homebush Bay, site of most events. Spectators will be transported there from the city centre by trains, ferries and huge fleets of buses on roads closed to other traffic.
Invest instead in a Sydney Pass ($85 for three days, $135 for seven days with discounts for children and families) that allows unlimited travel by bus, train or ferry to most popular attractions. (All prices are in Australian dollars, which are roughly on par with Canada's.) The pass can be purchased from kiosks at Circular Quay or at any CityRail station.
If you want to visit the Olympic site before or after the Games, take a half-day Red Terra Tour ($65 for adults, $45 for children) with pickup from, and return to, most city hotels. A great option is returning from the Olympic site to Circular Quay by Rivercat ferry (an additional $5). For an additional $145 a person, you can take a 30-minute helicopter flight over the Olympic site, Sydney Harbour and the Northern beaches. You can also take a ferry from Circular Quay to Homebush Bay and hop on a State Transit bus to the heart of the Olympic site.
For a good overview of the city's attractions, take a Sydney Explorer, red buses that stop at 24 area attractions ($35 a person for a day pass). You can get off anywhere, stay as long as you want, or get on the next one passing by every 20 minutes. Where to stay. One of the newest, most luxurious and convenient places to stay in central Sydney is the Quay Grand, with balconied housekeeping suites either looking west over Sydney Cove and Circular Quay, or east over the Royal Botanical Gardens. It is a short walk away from the Opera House, The Rocks and the ferry wharves. Cost for a one-bedroom suite with fully equipped kitchen is $350 for garden view, $405 for harbour view. Phone (61) 29256-4040; e-mail: resqg@miravachotels.com.au; . Web site: www.miravachotels.com.au.
Other hotels can be found at www.hotels-in-australia.com/sydney/. .If you plan to spend most of your time exploring central Sydney pick a hotel as close as you can afford to Circular Quay. Where to eat. Until the late 1970s eating in Sydney was, as one New York critic put it, as exciting as a two-note symphony. Things have changed. The city has become a magnet for great chefs and the restaurant scene is booming, egged on by a newly cosmopolitan horde of foodies. Here are some excellent eateries. Look for many more in local guides, newspapers and magazines:
* Rockpool (107 George St., The Rocks; phone 9252-1888). Sydney super-chef Neil Perry's signature restaurant, specializing in seafood with an Asian or Mediterranean twist. Great views of Sydney Cove.
* Sydney Cove Oyster Bar (1 Circular Quay E.; phone 9247-2937). Sit at the waterside tables, order a dozen rock oysters and enjoy the passing parade.
* Bennelong Restaurant (Sydney Opera House; phone 9250-7578). Dine here as much for the quality of the food as for the drama of the location: Located in one of the Opera House shells, it occupies what may be the choicest real estate in the city.
* Forty One (41st floor of the Chifley Tower, Chifley Square; phone 9221-2500). Enjoy impressive views of Sydney Harbour over a crown roast of hare if it is available.
* International (14th floor of the Top of the Town Hotel in the funky King's Cross district; phone 9360-9080). Terrific food, great vistas of the nighttime cityscape and a lively, youthful clientele. Festivals . This is a year of special events in Sydney leading up to the climax of the Olympic Games. Here are three special festivals yet to come:
Sydney Writers' Festival (May 15-21) will showcase the work of more than 100 international writers. There are more than 100 events planned, most free, at various venues throughout the city. Information: 9566-4158; Web site: www.swf.org.au. .
2000 Feast of Sydney (June 17-July 2) will see a range of respected foodies and organizations joining forces to deliver 16 days of culinary pleasure at various venues throughout the city. Ticket prices will vary. Information: www.australia.com. .
Olympic Arts Festival (Aug. 18-Sept. 30) will be a city-wide celebration featuring more than 3,000 Australian and international artists. Information. Australia is well into the Internet revolution. Good Web sites for general information are: www.australia.com and www.tourism.nsw.gov.au. . Phone (800) 369-6863 for a free vacation planner. Reading .

Full text: Company to sell other assets to fund new focus on higher-margin business customers
Call-Net Enterprises Inc. has taken itself off the auction block six months after dissident shareholders forced the telecommunication company's board to shop for buyers.
Toronto-based Call-Net, owner of Sprint Canada Inc., said yesterday that a special committee overseeing the sale of the company made a "unanimous recommendation" to the board that it no longer actively pursue a buyer.
The special "sale" committee was set up on Oct. 18, four days after rebel shareholder Crescendo Partners LP of New York and Call-Net's board struck a deal that put the company on the auction block.
"The board feels this decision [to take the company off the block] will create greater value for Call-Net shareholders, employees, customers and business partners, than will the sale of the entire company," Call-Net said in a statement yesterday.
Still, chief executive officer and president Kevin Bennis said Call-Net's 11-member board will continue to review the company's non-strategic assets -- including real estate and its U.S. fibre-optic network -- and sell them as required.
Analysts say Call-Net will need cash to fund its transformation into a full-service telecommunications company that focuses primarily on the higher-margin small and medium-sized business market.
The company recently abandoned attempts to compete against Bell Canada in the residential local services market, claiming that the regulatory playing field wasn't level.
Meanwhile, analysts say it's no surprise that Call-Net took itself off the block, since there was no evidence the company had any serious bids.
Dvai Ghose, a telecommunications analyst with CIBC World Markets, said the company's new strategy as a stand-alone business is sound, but its long-term future is questionable unless it manages to raise $600-million in capital.
"In order to make that transformation the company has to strengthen its balance sheet," Mr. Ghose said. "The ability to access that capital in the public markets is zero, so really it does have to come from asset sales."
He estimates the company can raise up to $400-million by selling its U.S. fibre-optic network, but the process might be slow because there is an oversupply of unused fibre south of the border.
George Karidis, an analyst at the Brockville, Ont.-based Yankee Group in Canada, said Crescendo president Eric Rosenfeld "didn't understand the market at all" when he led a group of disgruntled shareholders in an attack against Call-Net's board.
"They realized after the fact that they were in a position where the buyer was in control rather than the acquisition target," Mr. Karidis said.
Crescendo launched a bid last August to oust Call-Net's directors -- including chairman, chief executive officer and president Juri Koor -- and put the company up for sale. They argued that management had failed to maximize shareholder value.
What followed was a two-month drama involving a war of words between Crescendo and Call-Net's management, and changes within the company's executive ranks -- including the forced resignations of Mr. Koor and chief financial officer Vincent Salvati.
Call-Net reported late Wednesday night that its first-quarter loss had widened to $100.7-million or $1.11 a share from $65.7-million or 73 cents a year earlier. Revenue fell nearly 5 per cent to $325.4-million from $340.7-million.

Full text: It is no surprise that a hotel room in Paris or London costs more than one in Edmonton or, for that matter, in Bordeaux, France. The reasons -- supply and demand, but also the high costs of land and services, local market conditions and, in the case of Paris, a premium for accommodation in a city that all the world wants to visit.
According to Runzheimer International, a consultancy based in Rochester, Wisc., that tracks transportation, travel and living costs for business, government and the public, a day in Paris with lodging in a business-class hotel and three meals, including all taxes, gratuities and service charges, costs the equivalent of about $359 (U.S.) or $530 Canadian. That's a bargain compared to London, England, where the same room and board, tips and taxes will come to $445 (U.S.). By contrast, in inexpensive cities such as Bordeaux, where the same accommodation and tips and service charges will ad up to a relatively modest $157 (U.S.) or Edmonton, among the least expensive cities in the world to visit, where a night in a business-class hotel and three squares and all associated charges will be $122 (U.S.). Prices are based on a survey published March 6, 2000.
"In general, metropolitan areas on the eastern and western seaboards and in the northern half of the United States are pricer than those in the midwest or the south," says Runzheimer consultant Thomas Peiffer. The price variances extend as well to long-term accommodation. Notes Runzheimer, rental of a three-room apartment with one bath in San Francisco will cost $13,100 (U.S.) per year compared to $4,860 (U.S.) for the same accommodation in Dubuque, Iowa. Fancy turf means fancy prices.
Abroad, standard executive accommodation prices are also far higher than in Los Angeles, the baseline city for the recent survey. In mid-1999, Runzheimer reported that in comparison to the $24,771 (U.S.) that buys a years' rent for a four- to six-room rental unit with utilities and appropriate insurance in Los Angeles, equivalent accommodation costs $102,527 (U.S.) in Seoul, South Korea; $91,351 (U.S.) in Tokyo, Japan; $82,958 (U.S.) in Moscow, Russia; $62,814 (U.S.) in Geneva, Switzerland but only $12,532 (U.S.) in Montreal.
Savvy business professionals in Canada are well aware that Canada is one of the least-expensive countries in which to travel frequently on business.
Food adds to per diem costs, depending on where one has to eat. Most expensive in Runzheimer's February, 2000 is Copenhagen, Denmark where a cheeseburger and fries will cost 63-per-cent more than the same food costs in Los Angeles. Other cities with expensive meals include London, England where the standard quarter-pound cheeseburger with large fries and medium soft drink costs 18 per cent more than in Los Angeles, the baseline city in the survey.
In contrast, low-cost cities in which to eat include Toronto, where the test meal costs only 88 per cent of the Los Angeles price on a currency adjusted basis. Cheaper still are Sydney, Australia, 80 per cent of baseline, Hong Kong, 54 per cent of baseline, and Rio de Janeiro, 44 per cent of baseline. Cheapest of all -- Warsaw, Poland, where a meal will cost only 34 per cent of the price in Los Angeles, according to Runzheimer data.
For daily costs of three meals, Runzheimer reports that New York tops most lists at $79.90 (U.S.), followed by Chicago at $55.95 (U.S.) in a mid-range of pricing, and Macon, Ga., at $29.70 (U.S.), the low-cost winner in the U.S. survey.
And rental-car costs vary as well. In September, 1999, Runzheimer reported that costs within the United States alone has a range of variance of more than 100 per cent from Honolulu where $38 (U.S.) per day buys an intermediate-sized car without taxes, fuel, or insurance to New York, where the same car costs $92 (U.S.) on the same terms.
Adding it up, Runzheimer says that, as of January, 2000, a day of business in Moscow should cost $400 (U.S.), $383 (U.S.) in Tokyo, $252 (U.S.) in Sydney and only $196 (U.S.) in Toronto. Why the huge variances? According to Runzheimer senior travel consultant Rolf Schellenberger, "lodging expense, which comprises the largest portion of daily travel costs, reflect worldwide pricing by the hotel industry, which is essentially a real estate operation." And there are political factors as well, he notes. "In Moscow, the situation changed from a state-run economy to a private economy where local business people establish their own prices."

Full text: Calgarian real-estate investor Bart Maybie is putting the shine back on the Moulin Rouge, one of the oddest artefacts of racial history in North America
Even in broad daylight, taxi drivers won't take you here. If you ask the concierge at one of the theme-park hotels along the strip for directions, you'll be urged not to drive into this neighbourhood. A desolate slum of decaying one-storey housing projects, Westside is deliberately omitted from Las Vegas travel guides and bus tours.
Yet in the heart of this parched ghetto sits a bizarre reminder of an alternate universe, a promising side trip briefly taken by the world of popular culture. The words "Moulin Rouge," in huge scroll letters, cover the front of an empty white building on a dusty road. Poke your head inside, and amid the rubble you'll see the mahogany walls, the mural paintings of exotic showgirls, a vacant proscenium stage.
You're also likely see Bart Maybie, a soft-spoken Calgarian who looks like the sort of guy who'd be more at home at some suburban barbecue holding a bottle of Ex than he does at the centre of Black Las Vegas. Yet here he is, a long way from Alberta, with one of the oddest pieces of racial history in his hands.
The Moulin Rouge was the black casino back when Las Vegas was officially segregated, and for a brief flash 45 years ago, it was the most exciting entertainment venue in North America. White men would flock here from the strip to shoot craps alongside black women and a mixed crowd would dance to all-night gigs by Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, Lionel Hampton and Count Basie. In the crowd, you could spot Cary Grant and Jack Benny sitting near Tallulah Bankhead and Harry Belafonte. At a time when Vegas was overtly racist, known as the "Mississippi of the West," this was a centre of tolerant cosmopolitanism unknown anywhere else. It was the first hotel here, and possibly anywhere, to allow guests of either colour. For awhile, you could believe that such black-neighbourhood venues would become the polychromatic heart of a new United States of Entertainment.
It did not work out that way. Alarmed by the casino's crossover success, the mob pulled out its stake less than a year after it had invested $3-million, then an enormous sum, into what it had hoped would become a place where black employees would spend back the money they'd earned in white casinos. Then segregation ended in 1960, on the white casinos' terms, and the Moulin Rouge has mouldered in utter obscurity for nearly half a century, along with its surroundings.
Still, as a property listed on the U.S. National Registry of Historic Places, developers have not been able to demolish it or molest its interior. As a result, it resembles a dust-caked slice of mid-fifties decadence trapped in aspic. A good view of its interior was provided in the 1994 Martin Scorsese movie Casino -- it was in the Moulin Rouge, with its murals in the background, that Joe Pesci's character stabbed a rival with a pen.
Under a series of impoverished owners, its elegant interior turned into an increasingly sleazy watering hole. It reached an oddly cinematic nadir in 1997, when a transient who'd been sleeping there was stabbed to death in the bar by a man with a mental disorder. Black historians and preservationists have struggled to bring back some of its prestige for decades, but it has only begun to come back to life this year, thanks to Bart Maybie.
Mr. Maybie seems as surprised by this development as anyone else. As he watches carpet installers do their work in the barroom, part of his effort to make it a reasonably comfortable working casino by fall, he wears a T-shirt and jeans and shows none of the flash or bravado of a Vegas businessman. "I kind of came into this place by accident," he says in his soft-spoken voice, which still carries a faint hoser accent. "This was quite a place when it opened in '55, and a lot of the original fittings are still here. I consider it my little pet project, something that the people in this neighbourhood could use." And this is a matter of some concern to him, since he happens to own the neighbourhood.
Mr. Maybie's career has been a sequence of happy accidents. After studying at Calgary's Mount Royal College, he went into real estate, performing the transformation that has become his trademark: He buys up run-down properties in lacklustre neighbourhoods, fixes them up and rents them to somewhat better-heeled tenants. He began doing this just as the Alberta oil boom of the 1970s was beginning, and sold most of his holdings before oil prices collapsed. He made enough money to "semi-retire" in Hawaii before he was 30. Bored after a few years of that, he moved to California's Orange County in the early 1980s, just as that region was about to boom, and made another fortune improving low-end properties and shopping malls there. In 1988, he and his wife Linda moved to a large house in Las Vegas, a town they've always loved.
In a series of swaps, he acquired a good chunk of low-rent Vegas property just as the town was changing from a sleazy travelling-salesman gambling outpost into North America's biggest family-vacation destination. Soon, he had made another fortune and he could take some risks.
"I'd been working in this area and I'd done well. But here -- I saw something here and I really thought it could be unique. By taking over properties and cleaning up the area, I could really see this coming back again." Mr. Maybie's block looks like an oasis. Two blocks away, the projects look burned-out and they're peppered with stray dogs, crack dealers, very low-rent hookers and other unsavoury characters. His properties are painted a sunny white, their air conditioners work, they're surrounded by a security fence and very visible guards. His tenants aren't well off -- units rent as low as $300 a month -- but they're not depraved, either; one woman, a janitor who lives here with her two toddlers, says this is "the only place around here that you'd want to have children living."
With the exception of a small restaurant he once owned in Calgary, Mr. Maybie had never done anything retail, to say nothing of running a gambling house. But here he was in possession of a huge city block of especially slummy housing, and in the centre of it sat a strangely well-preserved ruin bearing the name Moulin Rouge. He thought: Why not?
"By now, I own all the residential property in the block," Mr. Maybie says, walking up the stairs from the long bar to the mahogany-panelled executive offices, which have a wheeler-dealer streamlined look, but have been used only by a church for meetings in recent years. "It's probably good timing to get the casino running. It'll be a local place -- there's a shortage of local places for lunches and dinners, a void in this part of town. And I think a lot of people will be coming out here to see what the Moulin Rouge originally looked like."
Indeed, several African-American groups have approached him about expanding the place into a larger black-history museum. None have had any money, but this is an ambition he supports. "I really want to see a museum, and I'll open a small one this fall," he says. "I'm not saying I wouldn't want to sell this, and ideally I'd sell it to an African-American group."
For now, it is a bizarre museum of the old Las Vegas. This is not a city that preserves its history: First-generation gambling houses like the Sands have been blown up and knocked down to make way for imagineered palaces like Venice and Paris and New York, New York. But time has passed the Westside by, and with it, the Moulin Rouge. It still looks like a mothballed version of the lavish casino that made the cover of Life magazine when it opened on May 14, 1955 (the opening-night show featured Dinah Washington, Lionel Hampton and The Platters). Here is the 350-seat night club, with huge black-leatherette banquettes in terraces around the big stage. There is the long, swank bar, here the sprawling kitchen facilities (it was known for its food) and the sun-drenched gambling hall.
Mr. Maybie's goals are very modest: He will open it this fall with 75 slot machines and a sports book. There will be decent food, the promised small museum and perhaps the odd live show on special nights. If this attracts visitors from out of town -- black-history aficionados, in other words -- he will add 325 more slots and some blackjack tables, and get the shows running regularly again. The hotel, with its deco swimming pool, could turn into a hotel again, instead of low-rent apartments (for now, he assumes people may want to poke their heads into the Westside by day, but it'll take time before people want to spend the night there).
Of course, it also helps that the Moulin Rouge is a historic property. On every dollar Mr. Maybie spends improving the non-moneymaking parts of the property, the state will give him a 20-per-cent tax credit that can be applied to the whole housing operation. And the Nevada State Historical Society has given him grants to help build the museum, fix up the sign and the windmill tower that once graced the entrance (it was struck by lightning a few years ago and now looks like a strange, burnt-out wooden cube). And there are encouraging signs: Already, several couples have asked Mr. Maybie if they can marry here, at one of Nevada's few sites of African-American heritage. "Of course I let them, and I wouldn't think of taking money when the place looks like this," he says. Like most Vegas hotels, it may feature a wedding chapel. For now, a few slots and new carpet on the floor would be a milestone. "I'm going to push ahead, no matter what happens," he says. "To get it going takes a believer, and I'm a believer in this thing."
Which is just as well, since most of the world has a hard time believing it exists.

Office towers turn to clicks from bricks

Abstract: They're also pitching the sense of kindred spirit shared by people trapped in the same building staring at computers all day. "Through the Internet we're allowing occupants within a building to look at themselves as a community," says Michael Roppolo, EggSystems.com's vice-president of business development. "It's like having a customized browser" for the building.

Full text: Web sites for buildings tap into billions spent on-line at work
Attention office workers: Your building may soon be turning into a Web portal.
A handful of Internet startups are being very literal about using bricks and mortar to lure customers in cyberspace. They are creating Web portals customized for employees in the same office building: a single place where workers can go to call a messenger, order a pizza, stock up on business cards or even turn up the heat in their cubicles.
More than merely high-tech amenities, these targeted Web sites offer dot-coms and their commercial-landlord customers entry into the billions of dollars of purchasing that takes place within office walls every year. Under the business model in use by one Web site for three buildings in Toronto, the dot-com and the landlord share a cut of as much as 5 per cent of the revenue from purchases made on the sites.
Modern offices, as everybody who works in one knows, are teeming with Web surfers, making them rich e-commerce hunting grounds. "You're not going to capture all the spending that goes on in the building," says Maurice Gatien, president of e-Space Connexions Inc. "But you have a pretty good shot at capturing some of their spending, particularly as it relates to business-to-business buying."
In December, e-Space Connexions launched tectowers.com, a Web site to service three Toronto office towers owned by Toronto real estate company Cadillac Fairview Corp. The company says it has contracts to establish Web portals for another 98 buildings throughout Canada and the United States by the middle of May.
VIPdesk.com Inc., a Washington-based on-line firm, plans to begin launching Web portals later this month for 78 office buildings in and around the District of Columbia. EggSystems.com Inc., of Minneapolis, has a site up and running for two buildings in Singapore, and says it has an agreement with one real estate customer in the United States and expects to announce two more shortly.
Most Internet users already know how to find CDs, books or flowers on-line, says Daniel Levy, the 28-year-old founder and president of Real Estate On-Line LLC, a New York firm that is planning to announce deals with several big landlords soon. But people are often at a loss when it comes to gym memberships, parking spaces, child care and dry cleaning, Mr. Levy adds. "[People] don't instinctively know where to get these types of services."
Tony Leadman works in one of the Cadillac Fairview buildings as vice-president of television sales for MGM Studios of Canada, a unit of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., of Santa Monica, Calif. He recently visited e-Space's tectowers site, where he found information about his hobbies -- skiing and motor racing -- and checked the value of his stock portfolio. While he was there, he ordered an umbrella from the building's concierge desk, which he picked up at a desk in the lobby in time for lunch.
He says he would use the site more if it had even more buying options. "If I could go on my computer and order cleaning supplies for the house, or things like washing soap, toothpaste and dental floss, I would absolutely do that rather than run down into the mall to get it," Mr. Leadman says.
Most of the new building portals are employing a business model in which shoppers get discounts on office supplies and from local merchants. The sites also offer local event listings and building services.
They're also pitching the sense of kindred spirit shared by people trapped in the same building staring at computers all day. "Through the Internet we're allowing occupants within a building to look at themselves as a community," says Michael Roppolo, EggSystems.com's vice-president of business development. "It's like having a customized browser" for the building.
But it's the discounts that will have to set the building sites apart from the vast selection of other portals already out there, e-Space and its competitors say. So far, e-Space Connexions has agreements with 31 vendors, ranging from such national marketers as Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. to local players like Your Butler Drycleaning. Tenants using the Web site get a 15-per-cent discount at Your Butler Drycleaning, and they can rent a car from Ferraro's Exotic Car Rental for $65 (U.S.) an hour when the regular rate is $86.
When e-Space started out in the early 1990s, it was an on-line commercial real estate listings service. But it found brokers and landlords didn't want to pay to post their listings. So in 1998, the company re-evaluated.
"We realized we were focused on the 4 to 5 per cent of the box that was empty," says Mr. Gatien, 53, referring to the vacancies posted on the site.
Four private investors have pumped a total of $1-million into the venture. The company says it expects to secure more in venture capital.
VIPdesk.com is an offshoot of 13-year-old Capitol Concierge, which places human concierges in office buildings. Like e-Space, it has been negotiating for discounts from merchants based on the purchasing power of multiple tenants. VIPdesk.com has lined up 28 vendors of flowers, chocolates and gifts, as well as 40 suppliers of business products and services. The list includes Musicland Stores Corp.'s Sam Goody chain, Sunglass Hut International Inc., Prudential Insurance Co. of America and International Business Machines Corp.
Merchants see the building portals as a way to target new buyers. "There are customers out there that the office-building portals can reach which we haven't yet," says Joe Meyers, senior account manager at Omaha Steaks, the direct marketer of filet mignons and T-Bone steaks, which plans to have a presence on the VIPdesk.com sites.

Full text: A good old-fashioned "ordinary Ontarian" made his presence known at a political event in Markham on Friday. (You know it's political when the "ordinary Ontarian" shows up.)
This ordinary Ontarian attended a press conference held by federal Fisheries Minister Herb Dhaliwal at Buttonville Airport. The minister came to the area to examine the welfare of the fish in the creeks and streams that are about to be bridged by the eastward extension of Highway 407.
He is currently considering whether it is possible to settle the fate of said fish without ordering a thorough environmental assessment of the 407 extension. Unless some senior government decides to throw a large procedural spanner into the works, that stretch of new superhighway is scheduled to start immediately.
The feds have already infuriated their local political rivals in Hamilton by discovering nationally significant fish in that city's Red Hill Creek, thus managing to delay the imminent construction of a controversial expressway in its valley.
Mr. Dhaliwal assured reporters there was nothing political about his visit to the eastern reaches of Toronto. His only concern was the fish.
(It would be far too controversial for a federal minister to openly express concern about the fate of the people in this region, of course -- not when the bottom-feeders of Duffin's Creek are crying out for attention.)
But anyway, the "ordinary Ontarian" is at the press conference, remonstrating with local Liberal MP Dan McTeague about federal interference in local affairs. We local yokels are solidly in favour of the new highway, he said.
His neighbours recognized this ordinary Ontarian as a local real-estate agent, one who has been hired by the Ontario Realty Corp. to help sell provincially owned lands in the undeveloped areas through which the new highway will pass.
Everybody has an angle, it would seem, and there are too many angles to count in the current wild-eyed rush to pave every green acre between Toronto and Lake Simcoe. Toronto's urban fringe at the turn of the century is like Dawson City a hundred years ago, before the arrival of the Mounties.
Who are the legitimate stakeholders? Who gets a say in what happens? Who makes the law? Who enforces it? All these are open questions in this area, where the lure of big money coincides with the presence of deliberately small government.
The developers who have banded together at the Ontario Municipal Board to demand the unfettered right to pave are aghast that the City of Toronto has asked to join the proceeding. Toronto is way down there, south of Steeles, they cry. Toronto has no right to take part in the discussions that will so decisively shape its future for the next century.
"The health and well being of the City of Toronto is intrinsically tied to the protection of the countryside," city lawyer Brendan O'Callaghan replied this week.
The city's intervention recalls the very early days of Metro Toronto, when the same OMB (with close direction from the government of premier Leslie Frost) gave the new municipality complete planning control of an area that spread far beyond its own borders, encompassing all the lands currently in dispute.
Who could deny the local residents? Does it follow, then, that their legitimate right extinguishes the right of Torontonians to have a say in decisions about the fate of the farmlands? After all, a former Tory government once considered that involvement so essential it gave the city extraordinary powers.
The reasons for that haven't changed. They have become even more pressing over the years.
The Harris government is attempting to sidestep these questions by asking the tribunal to chew them over while it sells off prime development lands or quietly abets the cause of its friends and fundraisers in the subdivision business. That won't work for long.
The reason is simple: Some of the strongest opponents of perpetual pavement are in fact ordinary Ontarians who live in the 905 suburbs -- and otherwise strongly support the government. They are the only ones with the real power required to make a difference now.

Full text: Across Nova Scotia, creative chefs like Dale Nichols and Tom Kennedy are shaking up kitchens that haven't stirred since the Scots took over in the 18th century. With spring in the air, expert epicurean Jeremy Ferguson delivers the verdict on fusion-inspired lobster sandwiches, fat raviolis stuffed with lobster and shrimp, and good old-fashioned lobster boils on the beach.
At the Delta Halifax hotel, chef Dale Nichols, formerly of Toronto's Canoe and a man known for sporting trousers festooned with lobsters and crabs, is giving a fresh halibut the sort of respect it deserves, but rarely gets.
Nichols cradles the fresh fish like a baby. Fastidiously, he checks the mouth and jowls for worms, a nasty phenomenon rampant in cod and still more common in warm-water fish. He fillets the halibut. He pan fries the fillets just so. He plates simply and artfully, the fish atop yellow beans and curried sweet potatoes. He drizzles with a sauce of white wine, cream and Annapolis Valley herbs. He garnishes with macadamia nuts. Voila .
Used to be, the gastronomic reputation of Nova Scotia, like other Atlantic Provinces, was, well, lamentable. The locals, we were told, were fixated with incinerated bricks of beef. The best fish, we were told, was whisked off to big-money markets in New York and Toronto. Good seafood? Shut up and eat yer chowder.
Now tourists in records numbers are demanding fresh fish, and fresh fish properly cooked -- which is to say, not much at all. We hear, too, that local palates are finally snapping out of their Van Winkle slumber, and that with-it chefs are shaking up kitchens that haven't stirred since the Scots took over in the 18th century. Co-existing with gluey chowders and fried, fried, fried slabs of haddock, there are wonders to be had.
And so we undertake a foodie's ramble. Having experienced his restaurant, one morning we drive with Dale Nichols out to Sambro Fisheries. The town of Sambro used to be the "swordfish capital of the world," but no more. Indeed, Sambro Fisheries owner Jim McPhee used to send out four tractor-trailer loads of fish a day. Now, on a good day, maybe one. With fish stocks where they are, no surprise there.
But McPhee has other surprises. A lobster, he tells us, should be eaten at the time of the full moon, when the flesh "is so packed you can't get at it." He shows us the candling of the cod: the icky chore of removing worms, armies of them on each fish, with pincers. McPhee is even selling a cusk, a little-known cousin of the cod. Even Dale Nichols has never cooked a cusk.
Yes indeed, food is hitting the streets of Halifax. Into its second season is Lobster Tails at Spring Garden and Queen, a fast-food eatery boasting the "best tail in town." Fusion-inspired lobster sandwiches are the specialty of the owners -- the Swim family, no kidding. The buns themselves are lobster-tail shaped and the sandwich of choice is the Asian, containing lobster, bok choy, scallions, sesame seeds, lettuce and spices.
Outside the library, we run into Bud the Spud , chip wagon extraordinaire. Owner Bud True tells us he's spent the last 24 years trying to perfect the chips half of fish and chips. He sells only fresh, hand-cut fries, never the frozen crap. He uses only canola oil. He loves chips. He's travelled the planet eating chips, as far off as Europe and South America, and still can't get enough. He also sells poutine , but do you want to know?
Our first dinner is at McKelvie's , located in the 1902 firehall for the past 18 years, not a new restaurant, but solid: The room looks good, in the exposed-ducts, sand-blasted-brick mode. McKelvie's crabcakes are crisp, meaty and loaded with real crab, not the fake stuff, with curry mayo on the side. There is Willy Krauch smoked salmon, a continuing tribute to the late salmon king's international reputation.
A mixed platter of fish and seafood brings generous salmon, scallops, tiger shrimp and haddock sauced in melted asiago cheese, nothing overcooked, and fashionably garnished with Thai greens and purple basil. Nottage Hill chardonnay from a decent wine list rounds out dinner. Sweet-toothers could do worse than a cranberry crème brûlée that garners a seven on my wife's 1-10 scale.
Our second Halifax dinner is at Da Maurizio in the Farmers' Market, and it's wonderful -- easily a candidate for best restaurant in the province. The exposed-ducts-and-sand-blasted brick look is a bit much by now, but high ceilings, designer grappa bottles and high spirits soon distract. The most sophisticated menu in town prompts indecision: Salmon comes napped with black caviar sabayon. Halibut is pan-seared with porcini mushrooms. Fat raviolis stuffed with lobster and shrimp arrive sauced in ginger and sherry, practically levitating with finesse.
Me, I've never been able to say no to duck two-ways, a marriage of confit (the juicy thigh preserved in crinolines of its own fat) and magret (melt-in-the-mouth breast, herein sauced in wild cherries and port wine). Okay, it's not a fish, but it swims, doesn't it?
Now we toodle around the countryside from Cape Breton to the Lighthouse Route. Our first overnight is Liscombe Lodge ,east of Halifax, its dining room a plushly rustic affair graced by a real piano player. The menu has something for everybody from tots to grannies, which is usually the kiss of death, but not here. The restaurant bakes its own individual loaves of bread and oatmeal biscuits. It serves thick-cut smoked salmon served with pumpernickel bread. Its seafood chowder comes packed with halibut, scallops and crabmeat. Rack of lamb is the whole rack, not a paltry chop, and pink and juicy all the way.
But the restaurant is really about chef Steve Conway's dazzling planked salmon. I pooh-pooh any salmon that's been cooked more than three minutes. Now I wind up eating my words: Conway's salmon, strapped to 15-year-old oak planks and frequently basted with butter and herbs, sits over an open fire for 45 minutes and yet emerges miraculously juicy, its underpinnings sweetly seductive courtesy of a curing in dark rum and maple syrup.
We forge on through a terrain of lobster traps and tumbledown shacks and the same "world-famous Chinese and Canadian food" you find on every other crossroads in rural Canada. At one point, we drop into the Margaree Salmon Museum, which is mostly about the nature of Atlantic salmon and the sport of catching it. I find myself mentally undressing the fish.
Arriving on Cape Breton Island, we settle into the Point of View Suites , a peculiar marriage of RV park and fully outfitted beach houses within sight of the great fortress of Louisbourg. Owners Tom and Linda Kennedy do a nightly lobster or crab boil. In this case, Tom Kennedy boils 110 pounds (about 50 kilograms) of local snow crab.
For $22, you get about a kil of crab with drawn butter, slaw and potato salad on the side; it's bring your own wine. Dinner takes place in an octagonal seaside dining room, but we hustle our crab back to the comfort of our room, move a table to the balcony to watch the sunset paint Louisbourg gold, uncork a bottle of plonk and tuck into our massive portions of crab. The latter calls for surgical skill, but it's worth the effort, the crab fresh and full and sweet as summer.
Cape Breton's grand hotel, in the government-owned tradition of the Pines at Digby and Liscombe Lodge, is Keltic Lodge, a sprawling resort on Ingonish Beach at the start of the Cabot Trail. We drop by for lunch at the hotel's secondary Atlantic Restaurant . The Atlantic proudly upholds all the traditions that disgraced Down East in the first place. Fish and chips are fresh out of the freezer. One bite and you've choked back half a litre of cooking oil. Chowder is a gruel, its paltry shreds of fish stuck to the outer sides of the bowl, its biggest bite a lump of undissolved flour. In every direction, half-finished plates are being carted off to the kitchen. Nobody cares.
We return for dinner at the Purple Thistle , the lodge's premier restaurant. It recalls a cruise-ship dining room, with 160 diners, 75 per cent from the U.S. and flying on a 65-cent dollar, sitting down to a four-course prix fix menu. It's predictably big on lobster, but the runaway bestseller is Alberta beef.
We figure we can't lose with smoked salmon, inventively paired with pickled cattails, and we're right. Mesclun salad arrives neatly bundled in cucumber, dressed with honey vinaigrette, and sided with red and yellow tomatoes. Lovely. Bouillabaisse is loaded with mussels, scallops, shrimp, salmon and smoked halibut in a saffroned fish stock. If this is bouillabaisse, I'm Bud the Spud, but the dish is pleasant enough.
I order lobster, a crustacean of sea-monster proportions, and what's more a female packed with roe, but the kitchen murderously overcooks it. There's no greater disappointment in foodiedom than overcooked lobster. My poor gums throbbing from the attempted assault, I welcome the distraction of dessert, a deftly executed terrine of peaches and nasturtium petals sitting in a fruit coulis.
Nova Scotia has country inns the way October has falling leaves, but cobbling together a good meal is a shaky prospect. At Sydney Mines we eat at the Gowrie House Country Inn , one of those private-estate environments where one dines in the parlour, as preciously as in some Agatha Christie contrivance in which one of the guests keels over into the soup. Mushrooms in a flaky vol-au-vent and juicy roast chicken convince me I'll survive the night, but an exciting fish dish would be nice.
At Lane's Privateer Inn in Liverpool, a town in which you want to make a down payment on every cedar-shake manse for sale, mixed results again: Seafood chowder shows more seafood than flour. Mussels arrive in garlic butter, baubles of pleasure. Bay scallops, with just a kiss from the pan, melt on the tongue. But dammit, the hallowed salmon arrives cremated, is sent back, and another cremation is sent out in its place. If salmon is our prince of fishes -- and it is , by gawd -- where's the respect?
Lowly haddock gets respect. Toward the end of our journey, we dip into Murphy's Fish and Chips in the Truro train station. Fish and chips may not represent cuisine , but on the other hand, just try to find good fish and chips in this country. It says here the best fish and chips in the land are in fact at Ossie's, on the way to St. Andrews-by-the-Sea in New Brunswick; but Murphy's gives Ossie's a run for its money with its light, crisp batter, generous haddock fillets and chips that have never seen a freezer. VIA Rail's gloriously scenic Ocean , the overnighter from Halifax to Montreal, passes through the Truro Station. I have visions of Murphy's staffers, in hats and aprons, running alongside the train, dispensing deep-fried paradise to passengers in every coach.
Unfathomably, this doesn't happen. But it does give me an idea. Before departing Halifax for the homeward journey west, we hop out to the hamlet of Tangier, for a quick raid on the Willy Krauch smokehouse. Willy arrived from Denmark in 1951, opened the smokehouse in 1956 and quickly became the darling of U.S. presidents and British royalty, who couldn't get the spelling of his name right and addressed him as "Crouch". He died in 1993. Now the venerable operation proffers the world's most celebrated smoked salmon at a bargain $21 a pound.
We fork out the 21 bucks and leave with a pound of the maplewood-smoked, tangerine-hued fish, pre-sliced and ready to eat. We pause at a bakery for fresh rye bread. We find a bottle of riesling in the government store. Snuggled into our cozy VIA bedroom, we unfurl the picnic. The wine, chilled in ice from the bar coach and served in plastic cups, stands up to the fish. Willy's salmon is as unctuous and deeply smoked as it was the day I met him in the summer of 1972. Nova Scotia rolls by, green and gold as dusk comes on, and we tip our glasses to Willy's ghost.

Full text: This week the smouldering scandal -- and police investigation -- fuelled by Globe and Mail reporting of windfall private profits from sales of public property sparked calls for housecleaning and a minister's resignation. Outraged by the multimillion-dollar real-estate 'flips,' opposition politicians are relentless in their cries for blood. Will the Harris government emerge unscathed?
Six years ago, nobody paid much attention when little-known Ontario politician Mike Harris promised to refill the province's drained coffers by selling off surplus government-owned real estate.
Of all the controversial promises unveiled in the soon-to-be-famous Common Sense Revolution, that one was the least noticed -- both before and after the 1995 election that swept Mr. Harris and the Progressive Conservatives into office at Queen's Park.
Indeed, the Common Sensers were in charge of a seasoned government that was cruising easily toward re-election in 1999 when the policy first became widely known -- the result of a sudden flurry of lawsuits involving the sale of government land, all of them alleging impropriety on the part of the Ontario Realty Corp., the Crown agency handling the selloff.
The charges had no effect on last year's election. Since then, however, the first whiff of impropriety has grown into a genuine stink.
Besieged by criticism, the Harris government has asked the Ontario Provincial Police to investigate several transactions made by the ORC, including at least two in which developers made millions of dollars by "flipping" government property -- buying it from the province one day and reselling it soon after for massive profits.
In one 1999 sale, developer Frank Gabriele bought industrial land in Mississauga from the ORC for $1.9-million, putting $500,000 down, with the government taking back a mortgage for $1.4-million. A few months later, Mr. Gabriele sold the land, unimproved, for $4.3-million.
Joseph Chetti deposited $250,000 on an industrial property in Brampton, with the government financing the balance of the purchase by taking back a mortgage worth more than $1-million. Six days later, Mr. Chetti sold the $1.3-million property for $3.9-million.
With a police investigation now under way and both opposition party leaders hammering the Harris government daily in the legislature, the ORC has become the focus of the first major scandal to blemish its otherwise pristine reputation for tough but fair dealing.
The government skated close to scandal last fall when the Urban Development Institute, a powerful industry lobby group and one of its strongest allies, complained that newly installed municipal affairs minister Steve Gilchrist was telling developers that if they wanted to meet him regarding development on the Oak Ridges Moraine, north of Toronto, they should first speak to his personal lawyer, Peter Proszanski.
Mr. Gilchrist was cleared of wrongdoing after an OPP probe, but he was still dumped from the cabinet by Mr. Harris.
Later, his successor as Municipal Affairs Minister, Tony Clement, ran afoul of editorial writers and conservationists when, as environment minister, he interceded with a regional government on behalf of a Toronto developer eager to pave over a large tract of supposedly protected land on the Oak Ridges Moraine.
Together, the incidents have created the strong impression among many Ontarians that the Tory government is far too eager to wheel and deal in the booming Toronto region real-estate market. In that sense, the ORC scandal has become emblematic.
So far, however, Mr. Harris and his government are strongly resisting demands that ORC president Tony Miele and Management Board Chairman Chris Hodgson, the minister responsible for the agency, resign their posts.
It is Mr. Hodgson, a handsome young real-estate agent from the vacation land of Central Ontario and a personal favourite of the Premier, who is blowing the whistle on alleged grafters, Mr. Harris said.
Mr. Hodgson hired Mr. Miele to reform the agency one year ago, the Premier told the legislature on Monday, "and thank goodness he's there, overseeing it."
Mr. Harris's revelation that Mr. Hodgson is acting as a "whistle blower" in the ORC scandal has done little to silence the critics, however.
They point out that as late as Nov. 3, Mr. Hodgson told the legislature that he had never heard any allegation of wrongdoing within the agency. Indeed, the record of government statements about the ORC clearly contradicts its claims that Mr. Hodgson has been busy ferreting out corruption over the past year, beginning with his decision to hire Mr. Miele.
In any case, it was the arrival of Mr. Miele that marked the beginning of many of the problems now besetting the ORC.
A young real-estate professional working for the federal government's Canada Lands Co., he was hired as ORC vice-president by CEO John Bell in the fall of 1998. At the time, his résumé included long descriptions of the posts he had held as an organizer and activist in the Progressive Conservative Party.
Within a few weeks of Mr. Miele's arrival, Mr. Hodgson fired Mr. Bell and handed the reins of power to the young executive, who ran the corporation until his formal appointment as president took effect at the beginning of the 1999 fiscal year.
Three members of the company's board resigned in protest against Mr. Bell's firing and Mr. Hodgson's concomitant cancellation of long-standing plans to reconstitute the ORC as an arm's-length agency less closely controlled by the cabinet.
But the turmoil within the ORC remained unknown to the public until later that spring, when an upstart property developer launched a lawsuit against the corporation alleging major improprieties in the attempted sale of a coveted property in downtown Toronto.
The Jarvis Street property contained two historic mansions once owned by the Massey family and included ample room for the construction of new housing. In the booming downtown condominium market, it was considered a rare prize; a "landmark property," according to ORC marketing brochures.
But the competition among local developers to buy the property went seriously awry when the company that appeared to have won, Cityscape Development Corp., accused the ORC, Mr. Miele and powerful Conservative fundraiser and lobbyist Jeffery Lyons of cancelling Cityscape's deal and instead steering the deal to Renoir Building Corp., a Lyons client.
The complicated details of the botched transaction reflect "political corruption at the absolute highest level," Cityscape president John Berman alleged in court documents.
Both the ORC and Mr. Lyons have denied the charges of political interference, which have not been proved in court. But the initial proceedings in the lawsuit, which focuses on alleged deals made between the two Conservatives involved, Mr. Miele and Mr. Lyons, have opened up a fascinating view of backroom decision making in Mike Harris's Ontario.
Cityscape's determined (and expensive) assault on the power brokers is mirrored by at least two other actions involving similar charges. Andrin Muskoka Ltd., another development company, is suing the ORC over another last-minute cancellation of a deal it had made to acquire vacation property on Lake Muskoka.
At the same time, real-estate consortium Brookfield Lepage Johnson Controls is taking the ORC to court over the process by which the agency attempted to privatize the management of government buildings in Northern and Eastern Ontario.
Brookfield is suing the government for $25-million, claiming it had won the contract to manage the buildings only to see it cancelled at the last minute by the ORC.
With Mr. Hodgson, Mr. Miele and their lawyers vigorously denying wrongdoing on a number of fronts, the exposé of another controversial sale of a building in downtown Toronto dragged them into an even messier situation.
The Ontario government became the owner of a self-storage warehouse at 145 Eastern Ave. in the course of a massive 1989 expropriation for an ultimately aborted housing development. It paid $11-million for the property in 1989 and agreed to sell it for $4-million in 1997, a price that mysteriously rose to $5-million by the time the deal closed last year.
The sale angered many participants in the city's competitive self-storage business, who say the prime property was worth far more than that. At the same time the ORC sold the property, a similar warehouse in a less desirable location, one-third smaller than the Eastern Avenue facility, sold for more than $7-million.
Just as seriously, the businessmen complained that they had been frustrated in their ability to bid on the property, and it was never properly marketed.
The successful buyer, All-City Storage, was a California-based company originally incorporated by Mr. Lyons, who served as a founding director and secretary-treasurer.
Although Mr. Lyons is no longer a director of the company and has denied any involvement in the sale, documents obtained by The Globe and Mail under the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act make it clear that All-City consulted Mr. Lyons during its protracted negotiations to buy the warehouse.
A series of often-conflicting statements from the government and the ORC indicates that all the most controversial deals are now under investigation by government auditors and OPP fraud investigators.
Whether the investigations result in criminal charges, they are certainly creating a new and unfamiliar image of the Harris government in the early years of its second mandate. John Barber, The Globe and Mail's Toronto columnist, brought the ORC's affairs to light last year.

Full text: This week the smouldering scandal -- and police investigation -- fuelled by Globe and Mail reporting of windfall private profits from sales of public property sparked calls for housecleaning and a minister's resignation. Outraged by the multimillion-dollar real-estate 'flips,' opposition politicians are relentless in their cries for blood. Will the Harris government emerge unscathed?
Six years ago, nobody paid much attention when little-known Ontario politician Mike Harris promised to refill the province's drained coffers by selling off surplus government-owned real estate.
Of all the controversial promises unveiled in the soon-to-be-famous Common Sense Revolution, that one was the least noticed -- both before and after the 1995 election that swept Mr. Harris and the Progressive Conservatives into office at Queen's Park.
Indeed, the Common Sensers were in charge of a seasoned government that was cruising easily toward re-election in 1999 when the policy first became widely known -- the result of a sudden flurry of lawsuits involving the sale of government land, all of them alleging impropriety on the part of the Ontario Realty Corp., the Crown agency handling the selloff.
The charges had no effect on last year's election. Since then, however, the first whiff of impropriety has grown into a genuine stink.
Besieged by criticism, the Harris government has asked the Ontario Provincial Police to investigate several transactions made by the ORC, including at least two in which developers made millions of dollars by "flipping" government property -- buying it from the province one day and reselling it soon after for massive profits.
In one 1999 sale, developer Frank Gabriele bought industrial land in Mississauga from the ORC for $1.9-million, putting $500,000 down, with the government taking back a mortgage for $1.4-million. A few months later, Mr. Gabriele sold the land, unimproved, for $4.3-million.
Joseph Chetti deposited $250,000 on an industrial property in Brampton, with the government financing the balance of the purchase by taking back a mortgage worth more than $1-million. Six days later, Mr. Chetti sold the $1.3-million property for $3.9-million.
With a police investigation now under way and both opposition party leaders hammering the Harris government daily in the legislature, the ORC has become the focus of the first major scandal to blemish its otherwise pristine reputation for tough but fair dealing.
The government skated close to scandal last fall when the Urban Development Institute, a powerful industry lobby group and one of its strongest allies, complained that newly installed municipal affairs minister Steve Gilchrist was telling developers that if they wanted to meet him regarding development on the Oak Ridges Moraine, north of Toronto, they should first speak to his personal lawyer, Peter Proszanski.
Mr. Gilchrist was cleared of wrongdoing after an OPP probe, but he was still dumped from the cabinet by Mr. Harris.
Later, his successor as Municipal Affairs Minister, Tony Clement, ran afoul of editorial writers and conservationists when, as environment minister, he interceded with a regional government on behalf of a Toronto developer eager to pave over a large tract of supposedly protected land on the Oak Ridges Moraine.
Together, the incidents have created the strong impression among many Ontarians that the Tory government is far too eager to wheel and deal in the booming Toronto region real-estate market. In that sense, the ORC scandal has become emblematic.
So far, however, Mr. Harris and his government are strongly resisting demands that ORC president Tony Miele and Management Board Chairman Chris Hodgson, the minister responsible for the agency, resign their posts.
It is Mr. Hodgson, a handsome young real-estate agent from the vacation land of Central Ontario and a personal favourite of the Premier, who is blowing the whistle on alleged grafters, Mr. Harris said.
Mr. Hodgson hired Mr. Miele to reform the agency one year ago, the Premier told the legislature on Monday, "and thank goodness he's there, overseeing it."
Mr. Harris's revelation that Mr. Hodgson is acting as a "whistle blower" in the ORC scandal has done little to silence the critics, however.
They point out that as late as Nov. 3, Mr. Hodgson told the legislature that he had never heard any allegation of wrongdoing within the agency. Indeed, the record of government statements about the ORC clearly contradicts its claims that Mr. Hodgson has been busy ferreting out corruption over the past year, beginning with his decision to hire Mr. Miele.
In any case, it was the arrival of Mr. Miele that marked the beginning of many of the problems now besetting the ORC.
A young real-estate professional working for the federal government's Canada Lands Co., he was hired as ORC vice-president by CEO John Bell in the fall of 1998. At the time, his résumé included long descriptions of the posts he had held as an organizer and activist in the Progressive Conservative Party.
Within a few weeks of Mr. Miele's arrival, Mr. Hodgson fired Mr. Bell and handed the reins of power to the young executive, who ran the corporation until his formal appointment as president took effect at the beginning of the 1999 fiscal year.
Three members of the company's board resigned in protest against Mr. Bell's firing and Mr. Hodgson's concomitant cancellation of long-standing plans to reconstitute the ORC as an arm's-length agency less closely controlled by the cabinet.

Ottawa facing painful space crunch

Author: Gillespie, Gina

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/ottawa-facing-painful-space-crunch/docview/384423383/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "We've never seen such a lack of space," says Paul Hindo, vice-president of Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.'s commercial operations in Ottawa. "We're aware of four major corporations looking to establish call centres in Ottawa. That's taking up space that's very scarce right now."

Full text:   Rapid expansion of high-tech firms fuels shortage; 'We've never seen such a lack of space,' one expert says
Land developers and money lenders must start adopting dot-com thinking, or Ottawa's tight rental market could kill its booming economy. Availability of office space is at an all-time low, with vacancy rates for class A office space at 4.6 per cent region wide, and at less than 1 per cent in the high-tech epicentre of Kanata.
"We've never seen such a lack of space," says Paul Hindo, vice-president of Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.'s commercial operations in Ottawa. "We're aware of four major corporations looking to establish call centres in Ottawa. That's taking up space that's very scarce right now."
Fuelling the shortage is the rapid expansion of local high-tech firms, both small startup companies and space-devouring giants such as JDS Uniphase Corp. and Nortel Networks Corp.
JDS Uniphase alone occupies office space in excess of 1.2 million square feet in 18 owned or leased buildings in the area. They have grown from 600 employees in 1996 to the current 7,000, hiring an average 88 employees a week during the past year.
And every high-tech job creates three spin-off jobs, putting pressure on the already tight rental market. Areas outside the west end are ready to pick up the slack, but also suffer from low vacancy rates. In fact, there have been no new office towers built in the downtown core for eight years, resulting in a landlords' market. Rental rates are increasing as tenant inducement packages decline. Rents in the west end of the city are 20 per cent higher than a year ago.
But according to Mr. Hindo, money lenders still insist on prelease commitments as high as 40 to 50 per cent prior to funding construction costs.
This creates a choice for prospective tenants -- locate elsewhere, or commit to a future lease in anticipation of company growth.
"For companies coming in from the outside, they're starting to look at other centres where there's a little bit more competitive space available for them," says Mr. Hindo.
He personally knows two companies that favour the Ottawa area, but need space faster than the five-to-nine months it takes to build from scratch. And whereas a few years ago they would have had 10 locations to choose from, today they might have two.
"Nobody predicted that the growth, the pace of the economy was going to be as good as it is, and we're starting to see the infrastructure not being able to cope with it," he says. According to Jim Shotton, vice-president of the commercial real estate group CB Richard Ellis Ltd., the economic climate calls for companies willing to take a risk.
"You've got to step up to the plate because the space shortage in the Ottawa market is going to impact on the company's ability to grow." He says it's difficult for companies to commit without knowing future growth plans. "The issue that is going on now is if they don't commit, in the future they're not going to have any growth plans. They are very much forced to take that risk."
He is seeing companies commit to leases as far ahead as 2001.
Russ Jones, chief financial officer of Watchfire, an Internet software company, searched for a new location when the firm exploded to 85 from 26 employees during the past year. With everyone looking for space, he found builders favouring larger, more-established companies. From his fledgling firm they demanded six months to one year's rent in advance. In the end he committed to leasing two-thirds of a 50,000-square-foot building that had not yet reached the design stage.
And Nicholas Koumenides, co-founder of the software company WebHancer Corp. spent four months looking for 10,000 square feet of decent office space in an accessible location with parking.
"I thought I would walk out and say I'm looking for 10,000 square feet and it would be easy," he says. "Well, it was not that easy." Several times deals fell apart when bigger fish came on the scene. "You have to move fast," says Mr. Koumenides. "If you want to negotiate, negotiate that afternoon."
It is a dilemma with which Andrew Katz from Skypoint Capital Corp. is painfully familiar. He finances startup companies, taking them from one or two employees to 25 or 30 in the first year.
"What we are experiencing daily is the challenge of finding quality space for companies that we're investing in," he says. The answer may lie in building incubators -- large warehouse buildings with common services such as lawyers, accountants and technical support. Startup companies rent space by the month, then move out once the company expands, without signing leases they'll soon outgrow.
Mr. Katz says local developers express interest in the concept, but are unwilling to open their wallets.
He says developers are used to dealing with government departments and 25-year-old companies with triple-A covenants on their lease. They're slow in adapting to a couple of 21-year-olds who have just raised $4-million dollars and want to rent space.
But he points out that for every startup company that fails, there's another willing to take its place, as long as building plans include flexible space configurations.
"My point to developers is get on with it guys . . . you need to adapt," he says.

Abstract: By paying tribute to such people by naming streets after them, we'd break the tired tradition of naming streets after the children of developers, British bluebloods who never set foot in Toronto, and sylvan groves no longer extant. In my opinion, Toronto is not made a better place by having yet one more Mapleridge (or Oakridge, or Elmridge) Crescent. It would be a much more interesting place with a Frederick Banting Boulevard or Morley Callaghan Avenue.

Full text: What's in a (street) name? Plenty, including memory and civic pride, says literary impresario Greg Gatenby
All cities in English Canada have shown a lamentable disregard for their historic citizens. Compared to Montreal or European cities we do an abysmal job of celebrating hometown heroes. Even the naming of streets and squares in their honor seems beyond the ken of Vancouver, Halifax, and Calgary. Nowhere is this neglect more noticeable than in Canada's largest city.
Toronto City Council is about to face an exciting and, in many ways, unparalleled opportunity to change the names of about 100 streets -- street names which are now duplicates due to Toronto's recent amalgamation.
Thus far, Toronto has not distinguished itself in recognizing people who have been historically important it. The list does not have to be parochial or simply limited to folks who lived here; the music of Bach and Beethoven has meant a great deal to many Torontonians -- including Glenn Gould -- and a judicious blend of streets named after such geniuses as well as local heroes would demonstrate to the world that, like all internationally significant cities, we are able to pay homage to our own as well as to the best of the rest.
And by paying tribute to such people by naming streets after them, we'd break the tired tradition of naming streets after the children of developers, British bluebloods who never set foot in Toronto, and sylvan groves no longer extant. In my opinion, Toronto is not made a better place by having yet one more Mapleridge (or Oakridge, or Elmridge) Crescent. It would be a much more interesting place with a Frederick Banting Boulevard or Morley Callaghan Avenue.
Some people agree, but say, "Okay, let's name streets after prominent historical figures -- but let's just use the last names." To me this is a misguided half-step. Simply calling a street by the last name of the honored personage quickly ensures that the context -- and even the reason -- for naming the street is quickly forgotten.
Imagine that Toronto wanted to honor swimmer Marilyn Bell, the teenager who swam across Lake Ontario while the whole city cheered. If people in subsequent generations walk down a street simply named Bell Avenue they're likely believe the street was named not in honor of a once-famous Torontonian but, heaven help us, the phone company, or (the way things are going with the American dominance of our perception of our history) after the Liberty Bell.
When I was writing Toronto: A Literary Guide I had occasion to examine every street in what used to be known as Metro. And I cannot tell you the frustration I felt when confronted with both the plethora of thoroughfares named after trees, and the poverty of streets named after illustrious Torontonians. After all these years, alas, we still do not have a street named in full after our first mayor -- and the leader of the Rebellion of 1837 -- William Lyon Mackenzie.
It's recently been suggested by some city councillors that the streets which currently have the most residents are those thoroughfares that will be allowed to keep their names. Such an impulse is dangerously reckless with our history.
Take Peter Street for example. This downtown street was named after the second Governor of Upper Canada, Peter Russell, and the name of this street was chosen with great care by the surveyors and politicians of the day because it was the next street in sequence from the three roads named in honor of John Graves Simcoe. (Graves Street was eventually renamed because those who lived there claimed its name affected real estate prices -- buyers, not knowing the origin of the name, feared coffins would emerge in their basements and backyards).
The downtown Peter Street has a history more than 200 years old -- by Toronto standards, an incredibly long-lived name. A decision to obliterate such a name in order to keep "Peter" for some suburban route a few decades old is to play fast and loose with our history.
But then, I take issue with the very process by which streets are named. Just as the city has a committee of learned and concerned citizens who make recommendations to City Council on issues of public art, I believe the naming of public streets is too important a task to be left to developers, or even to the residents. For one thing, the residents don't own the street -- we all do. And given Canadians' peripatetic nature, current residents will likely move on -- yet all of us will be stuck with the recommendations.
I'd like to see council create a street-naming committee comprised of interested members of the public, along with one council member and one or two appropriate city staff. In addition to the City's looming need to change the names of 100 roadways, in years to come there will undoubtedly be new streets to name; such a committee could make informed recommendations, based on ideas from those who live or work on the street but also other interested parties, including the Historical Board.
If council is feeling adventurous, it might even ask this committee to oversee suggestions for the naming of public parks, squares, or other public spaces. By having this wider compass, the committee could make even more informed recommendations to council and so do more to celebrate people who have been important to Canada's largest city and to Canada.
Just around the corner from where I live, a developer of townhomes has created a small street where none existed before. No street sign yet adorns this cul-de-sac, but I fear that it will soon be known as "Debbie Lane," perhaps, or "Sprucevale Gardens." Yet this new street is just a block or so away from where Emily Murphy lived.
Emily Murphy was not only an important writer in Canada -- author of the Janey Canuck series -- she later became a leading judge. Her greatest contribution to our lives came though her spearheading, along with Nellie McClung, the legal suit which Ms. Murphy took all the way to the Privy Council of Great Britain, and the case by which every woman in Canada was finally granted legal, independent standing under the law. Surely "Emily Murphy Lane" would be a far more fitting appellation for this new street than the apparently inevitable MapleElmOakSumachCedarSpruce Gardens.
Toronto has not had the chance to name or re-name so many streets in its history as it does this month. Another such chance may not appear for decades. Let's hope that council does not waste this singular chance -- but rather, that it takes a simple step, believes in the merit of its finest citizens, and names its streets in their honor.

Full text: Every April, from coast to coast, the Canadian Cancer Society's residential and daffodil campaigns bring a personal message of hope into homes across Canada. In addition to Cancer Awareness Month, there are many ways that Canadians can give to the Society:
Planned giving: Design charitable gifts that fulfill your philanthropic objectives as well as maximize your tax and estate-planning benefits. Your gift may be an immediate gift of cash, securities or other real and personal property, or it may be a deferred gift, whereby the proceeds go to the Society sometime in the future. Planned gifts are often made from assets that have taken many years to build and the donation is made because it will have important, long-term meaning for both you as the donor and the Canadian Cancer Society. You are able to create a legacy while still maintaining the value of your estate for your heirs.
In Memoriam gifts: In times of loss, many families request that In Memoriam donations be made to the Society. By doing this, they enable the family and friends to make a meaningful gesture of sympathy and remembrance.
Special events: These raise money and provide important information to the public about cancer control. The Society's national signature events include Cops for Cancer, Jail-N-Bail and Daffodil Days.
To find out more about how you can donate to the Canadian Cancer Society, contact your local office of the CCS listed in the phone book, or call the Canadian Cancer Society's Cancer Information Service, 1-888-939-3333, to find your nearest CCS office.
On-line donations: Some of the CCS's provincial offices can accept donations on-line. Please go to the CCS's web site -- www.cancer.ca -- to find out how you can donate to the CCS to help continue the fight against cancer.

Palm Springs set to become ground zero for gambling

Abstract: "We don't want to be compared to Las Vegas," says Howard Jacobs, acting general manager of the Palm Springs tourism bureau. "We have a very different atmosphere."

Full text: It's a fast-growing desert getaway, a place to escape the sprawl of Southern California. Frank Sinatra lived here, and it was a playground for the rest of the Rat Pack. It even draws the Las Vegas lounge acts of Wayne Newton and Tom Jones.
In fact, Palm Springs is beginning to look a little like Las Vegas, and locals are testy about the idea that their quiet city of 43,000 might potentially turn into a California version of the Mecca of sin.
"We don't want to be compared to Las Vegas," says Howard Jacobs, acting general manager of the Palm Springs tourism bureau. "We have a very different atmosphere."
But the comparison is hard to avoid these days. Voters recently legalized Nevada-style gaming on California Indian tribal lands and the Palm Springs area, just a two-hour drive from Los Angeles, is expected to be ground zero for a major expansion in casino gambling.
The Agua Caliente tribe says it will spend at least $150-million (all amounts in U.S. dollars) to overhaul and expand its casino in downtown Palm Springs and an additional $80-million to build a new casino 20 minutes up the road in Rancho Mirage that is expected to open in spring 2001.
Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc. and the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians have announced plans for a $60-million casino expansion near Palm Springs in the Coachella Valley.
Their announcement came a day after voters approved by a 2-to-1 margin Proposition 1A, which amended the state Constitution to allow a dramatic expansion of Indian gambling endeavours across California.
Analysts expect more deals and expansions in a region that already lures three million tourists a year for its golf, natural spas, weather and more limited gambling at five casinos. It also helps that the valley is right in the path of Southern California motorists headed toward Nevada.
"This place will be California's closest thing to Las Vegas," says Vincent Battaglia, who sells commercial real estate in the Coachella Valley and sees a boon in the making.
It would be hard for the valley to match the dense glitz of Vegas. But at the very least, it will siphon gamblers from the less showy Nevada casino towns such as Reno and Laughlin that will no longer offer the kind of wagering Californians can't get at home.
Proposition 1A allows the tribes to replace their video-game-like machines that spit out paper instead of money with the standard, and more popular, coin-dispensing slots, whose numbers could jump more than five-fold across the state. For card games, the casinos will be allowed to eliminate fees charged for each hand and to run house-banked games.
With 2,000 slot machines, 70 table games and off-track betting at its two Coachella Valley casinos, the 350-member Agua Caliente tribe will be able to offer about the same as a Las Vegas mega-casino like the Paris, which is licensed for 2,100 slots and up to 90 table games.
Richard Milanovich, the Agua Caliente tribal chairman, says he expects to divert Nevada-bound gamblers, but stressed that his architects and landscape designers -- both with Vegas casino experience -- will make sure their Rancho Mirage projects blend in with the desert.
"It won't be another Las Vegas, nor will it become Atlantic City," Milanovich says.
Bob Thomas, a 68-year-old retiree, doesn't see it that way. He spends eight hours and $300 day in the Agua Caliente's Palm Springs casino.
"I don't go to Vegas anymore," says Thomas, who lives in nearby Cathedral City.
The increase in gambling could bring rising crime, indebtedness and addiction, says state assemblyman Bruce Thompson of Fallbrook.
"Nevada is not exactly something we should aspire to here in the Golden State," he says.
Palm Springs officials and residents are ambivalent.
City manager Dallas Flicek welcomes the tourist dollars and notes that the crime and social ills predicted five years ago, when the downtown Agua Caliente casino opened, never materialized. Councilman Jim Jones grumbles that the city has no power to control or tax the activities of the tribe, a sovereign nation that saw a city grow up around its reservation.
The downtown casino's brightly lit marquee seems to be a particular source of contention.
"It would be okay in Las Vegas, but not in Palm Springs," says Frank Tyson, owner of a nearby bed-and-breakfast.
In addition to the draw of the casinos, the Coachella Valley is expected to grow fast as more baby boomers retire. Officials expect the valley's population to jump from 235,000 to 300,000 in five years.
The combination may be too much for some residents, says Mimi Aiken, a business owner playing video slots at the tribe's downtown casino.
"If it got as big as Vegas, the locals would move out," says Aiken, who moved from Orange County a decade ago.
"The reason we live here is because it's peaceful and quiet," she says. "If it changes, I think you'll see people move out to Arizona."

Abstract: One of McQuade's clients, Tennessee businessman Michael Carrasco, thought nothing of plopping down $5,000 a week on the so-called Gold Inn Bear house during Whistler's winter high season, for a ski trip with a few buddies. He was so impressed that he's toying with coming back this summer. "I fell in love with it," drawls Carrasco on the phone. "Now that I'm an older fart, I like playing golf. I loved the place and it was a great deal."

Full text: Canadian holiday properties are booked solid for this summer, and two-year waiting lists are commmonplace. Competition for the perfect cottage is so intense that many prospective renters don't even ask prices -- or flinch when the tab is as much as $10,000 a week.
Something crazy is happening in cottage country.
Lured by pristine pines, sun-drenched beaches, clear lake waters and majestic mountain views, well-heeled holiday seekers from around the world are forking out eye-popping sums to rent Canadian retreats this summer.
Realtors across the country say demand for the cream of vacation homes has been overwhelming, particularly in the hoity-toity havens of Ontario's Muskokas and Georgian Bay, Quebec's millionaire-per-mile Eastern Townships, Nova Scotia's tony town of Chester ("the Riviera of the Maritimes"), and British Columbia's Gulf Islands and recreation capital Whistler.
Angela Ruffer, president of Whistler Executive Accommodation Ltd., says her clientele often doesn't even ask prices. "We have no trouble renting out homes at $1,800 to $2,500 a night," she says.
Agents say they've been inundated for months by calls from people across Canada, the United States, Europe and elsewhere, seeking posh pads with perks -- five bedrooms, Jacuzzis, four baths, maid service -- or else heritage homes with old-world cachet and, usually, the best location on the shore.
Summer-home rentals, realtors estimate, have jumped 5 to 25 per cent this year over last, and one- or two-year waiting lists are commonplace. Indeed, it's de rigeur for some renters to cough up $2,000 a night for a log cabin on a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course in Whistler, or $7,000 a month to gaze out over the blue-green waters of Mahone Bay, N.S.
Last year, Toronto artist Diane Hancock, better known as Dolly to her friends, came back to rent in Mahone Bay, after years of holidaying on the shores of Nantucket. The Brit-by-birth returned to Chester, she says, because rents in the U.S. resort community had become "so hideously overpriced and outrageous.
"There's no parking, you can't get a dinner reservation. It's nuts there."
So, Hancock and some family now reside during the month of August in a three-bedroom, 240-year-old Colonial cottage called T'Other End, located at the end of Chester's Pig Loop Road. They pay $5,500 a month, hardly a bargain, but still a fraction of what the 37-year-old shelled out in Nantucket, where owners are getting $17,500 (U.S.) a week for the smartest digs.
"The house we rent is sweet, and charming, but there's nothing luxurious about it," says Hancock, who first got acquainted with the town as a kid, vacationing at her grandmother's summer house. "I love it here because [the area] has lots of old, kooky charm. But if it turns out like Nantucket, I'll move on."
In Canmore, Alta., heat-fatigued Texans are snapping up the best summer rentals in the Rockies for $1,200 a week, and calling it a steal. Ontario's Muskoka agents say they can't come close to filling requests from people (many of them retired Canadians who now live south of the border) who want the biggest and best lake homes and don't flinch at rents between $5,000 and $10,000 a week.
And in Georgian Bay, your best shot this late in the season is perhaps a four-island compound, accessible only by helicopter, that rents for $50,000 a month. Although even the Rolling Stones reportedly balked at the price a few years ago, the owner apparently has takers this summer.
"The clientele I cater to want something nice and they don't mind paying for it," says Ruffer. "They don't want any surprises and they like comfort." Her company regularly provides five-star chefs or secretarial services, makes dinner reservations, hires caterers for cocktail parties, and delivers groceries. Tenants include comedian (and die-hard golfer) Bill Murray and Roots co-founder Michael Budman.
"We get so many requests that, at times, I have to go to the owners and beg them not to come up and use their place," Ruffer says.
Whistler log-home owner Michael Chamberlin is one such owner. The Seattle businessman owns the 3,500-square-foot log cabin on the greens that Murray inhabited last summer, and he's been hard-pressed to squeeze in a few days for his family the past year. Not that he's complaining.
He bought the house for $1.6-million a year ago, and says the rent he hauls in means the five-bedroom, four-bath with a hot tub on the terrace, basically pays for itself (even with a property management company taking roughly one-third of his rental income).
"During the high seasons -- summer and winter -- I can barely get my foot in the door," says Chamberlin. "According to my broker it's appreciated $750,000 since then."
Why do people spend that kind of dough to sit on a dock, laze on a beach or gaze at a golf course? Because they can. While the high-tech stock bubble may be starting to deflate, Canada just came off its 18th straight month of economic expansion, the longest run ever. In executive ranks these days, the bonus cheques are humungous.
Add to that the low Canadian dollar, which has made our properties a relative bargain for international vacationers, and Internet accessibility, which means they can take a good gander at what they'll be getting, and it's no wonder this phenomenon is exploding.
"For the right house in the right area, we probably have half a dozen people on a waiting list," says Scott McQuade at Mountain Memories Accommodation in Whistler. "In the winter, our units are jammed, and in the summer we've got people vying for the best properties to host weddings, things like that."
One of McQuade's clients, Tennessee businessman Michael Carrasco, thought nothing of plopping down $5,000 a week on the so-called Gold Inn Bear house during Whistler's winter high season, for a ski trip with a few buddies. He was so impressed that he's toying with coming back this summer. "I fell in love with it," drawls Carrasco on the phone. "Now that I'm an older fart, I like playing golf. I loved the place and it was a great deal."
And realtor Laura Gustaffson says that any of the prime rental properties (in the $3,000-a-week-plus range) on Ontario's Lake Rosseau, Lake Joseph and Lake Muskoka were long gone months ago. "Trying to find anything high-end up here is like finding a needle in a haystack," she says. "Every year rents go up, and supply has shrunk.
"We've got million-dollar properties that are for sale, but they don't rent them because they don't need the money. And the cottage owners who used to rent aren't taking tenants anymore because, with the economy booming, they no longer seem to need the extra cash."
Rob Macaulay, a real estate agent who specializes in listings in and around the sought-after Eastern Townships enclave near Lake Memphremagog, says there are simply no primo properties to rent at all. He can think of one nice five-bedroom place that rents periodically for $1,000 a week, but mostly to the owners' friends.
Shirley Moody, a rental agent for Tradewinds Real Estate in Chester, says she's been besieged by calls from around the world for the 20-odd properties in her community that rent from $3,000 to $7,000 a month. Many enquiries are from Toronto, loads are from the U.S., some hail from Germany and there's a burgeoning contingent of wannabe renters from, who knew, Bermuda. And all these folks, she says, are basically after the same thing.
"They want two or three bathrooms," she says, "an ensuite off the master bedroom, grand views, a fax machine, a second phone or plug for the Internet, a Jacuzzi and a smashing kitchen.
"The reality is, many of our places have only one bathroom and an antique claw-foot tub. That doesn't usually go over well, and I'm having to ask some of the owners to install a shower faucet to placate these people."
Audrey Ogilvie, a long-time summer resident, is dismayed by the go-big-or-go-home mentality that seems to be taking over the town. But for every person who wants "high-end everything," she says, there are vacationers who are still down-to-earth, seeking a summer respite in places like her family's 210-year-old cottage. At $3,000 a week, its three bedrooms, one bath and access to a small beach, don't come cheap.
"It doesn't have a Jacuzzi, and there's no nanny's quarter," she says. "But it's Nova Scotia by the sea, and the intelligent, sensitive people get it."

A year later, ORC's sale of warehouse still raises eyebrows

Author: Barber, John

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/year-later-orcs-sale-warehouse-still-raises/docview/384486603/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: It's interesting to note that Appraisal A makes no mention of deferred maintenance, presumably for the reason that, in virtually every arrangement of this type, day-to-day maintenance is the lessee's responsibility. If there was something different about this deal, it would surely show up in both appraisals. The fact that just Appraisal B includes a deferred maintenance cost is mysterious.

Full text: The Ontario Realty Corporation has released two appraisals of the self-storage warehouse it sold last March in a deal that raised eyebrows in the local real estate business.
They make interesting reading.
Both appraisals make wildly different assumptions about the value of the property, but they miraculously conclude that it is worth just about the same amount of money: $5.1-million in the case of Appraisal A, conducted by Lebow, Hicks & Katchen Ltd., and $5-million in the case of Appraisal B, conducted by Rajesky & Associates Ltd.
Neither appraisal notes the fact that a similar property, just two-thirds the size of the 145 Eastern Ave. property and located in a less desirable area, was on the market for $7.9-million -- and quickly sold for $7.2-million.
Nor does either appraisal include a calculation of how much it would cost to build the Eastern Avenue warehouse from scratch. (Based on prevailing industrial land prices in downtown Toronto and construction costs of $50 a square foot, the replacement cost would be about $7.2-million.)
Despite the fact that they arrive at almost identical conclusions, just one of the two appraisals has any credibility. The other, Appraisal A, is laughable.
To understand why, one must understand how such properties are evaluated. It has little to do with land value and everything to do with financial performance. Buyers look at a business's net operating income (NOI) and capitalize it at a rate that reflects the inherent risk in that business. That tells them how much a revenue property is worth.
In Appraisal A, the appraisers apply a very favourable capitalization rate of 9.25 per cent to the business's NOI, reflecting less risk than many other investors in the self-storage business perceive. In the normal course of things, that rate would have the effect of pushing up the value of the property. It doesn't because of the bizarre method the appraisal uses to calculate the business's income.
In a typical self-storage warehouse, 35 to 45 per cent of gross revenues are eaten up by operating expenses. But Appraisal A calculates operating expenses to be 80 per cent of 145 Eastern Ave.'s $1.26-million revenue -- an astonishingly high number. Despite the use of a favourable cap rate, the price comes out low.
The reason the expenses are said to be so high is because the property was leased from the government for $348,316 annually. Even though the sale was putting an end to the lease and all rent payments, the appraisers discounted its value as though the buyers were going to be paying $348,316 a year forever.
That is plainly ridiculous. Applying Appraisal A's cap rate to a more sensible estimate of operating expenses, 40 per cent of gross revenues, yields a value of $7-million, $2-million more than it actually sold for.
Appraisal B doesn't fall into the same trap: It sets up another. While Rajesky & Associates Ltd. makes no mention of lease costs, it does discover $681,000 worth of deferred maintenance on the 10-year-old building, which it deducts from its final estimate of value.
It's interesting to note that Appraisal A makes no mention of deferred maintenance, presumably for the reason that, in virtually every arrangement of this type, day-to-day maintenance is the lessee's responsibility. If there was something different about this deal, it would surely show up in both appraisals. The fact that just Appraisal B includes a deferred maintenance cost is mysterious.
Appraisal B further drives down the price of the property by applying an extremely high cap rate of 12 per cent (compared to the 9.25 cap rate used by Appraisal A), which yields an estimated value of $5.7-million. Once the mysterious maintenance costs are deducted, the price drops to $5.1-million.
Many owners and investors in self-storage facilities contacted by The Globe and Mail say the proper cap rate for a fully leased building located downtown is between 10 and 10.75 per cent. If Appraisal B's estimate of NOI was capitalized at 10.5 per cent, the price would have been $6.5-million before any deductions for maintenance.
In the end, the value of anything can only be determined when someone steps up and pays for it -- and that leads to the biggest problem in the sale. The property was never properly exposed to the marketplace. In its marketing, the government and its agents never even mentioned that it included a self-storage warehouse.
Contrary to all norms in the real estate business, the facility itself was never advertised, and several investors told The Globe they were unable to obtain any information about it. Over two years the government received only one offer. That says it all.

Full text: The latest Web-enabled wireless devices are bringing together two of the world's fastest-growing industries -- the Internet and mobile telecom. In the process,they're revolutionizing e-business
Driving along the highway on his way home from work, Mark Bregman suddenly remembered that he wanted to buy a CD containing The Who's Goin' Mobile .
Taking the song title literally, he pulled over, reached for his cellphone and used it to connect to the World Wide Web. Once on-line, he tapped into Amazon.com's Web site, placed his order, then continued heading for home.
Mr. Bregman's shopping experience is an example of how the latest Web-enabled wireless devices are bringing together two of the world's fastest-growing industries -- the Internet and mobile telecommunications -- to create a wireless revolution for electronic business. And that revolution may be even more profound and far-reaching than the advent of the Internet itself.
It is a revolution that will take e-business into the streets, free from the shackles of the wired network, making it a tool for the masses of people who don't want to go to their desktop computer every time they want to shop or do business.
The vanguard of this revolution is a handful of services that can put the World Wide Web in the palm of your hand by providing access to Internet banking, shopping and business portals through Web-browsing mobile phones, pagers or organizers.
This is the way most e-business will be conducted in the future, according to Mr. Bregman, general manager of pervasive computing at Armonk, N.Y.-based International Business Machines Corp., who notes that cellphones and other mobile devices tend to be cheaper, handier and easier to use than personal computers.
"Today, most people think of the Internet as something you get to by means of a PC and a browser, but within a couple of years that's going to be an uncommon way to get to the Internet. The common way is going to be through a cellphone on your belt, a digital organizer in your pocket or something built into your automobile, " he says.
"Our grandchildren will look at us like we're crazy when we tell them we used to do e-commerce by going home and going to a specific room to turn on the PC, dial up an Internet service provider and boot up a browser. It's like going to the phone on the wall and turning the crank and asking the operator to connect you," says Alistair Rennie, senior vice-president of marketing at Toronto-based 724 Solutions Inc. , which develops Internet infrastructure for financial institutions.
The wireless revolution probably will transform not only e-business as we know it today but also the way we do business in the bricks-and-mortar world.
Already, in Europe, where the new technologies are taking hold more quickly than in North America, there are pilot projects in which shoppers use handheld organizers to scan the bar codes on items they pick from grocery-store shelves and pay electronically without unloading their carts at the checkout counter. As well, vending machines are being equipped with technology that makes it possible for people to use their cellphones to buy pop and pay for it on their phone bill.
Sean Dalton, vice-president of business development at Montreal-based wireless-service provider Microcell Solutions Inc. , expects similar payment systems to be in place for parking lots, movie theatres and a host of other everyday situations within the next two years.
"We envision the cellphone as becoming the Swiss army knife of your life. This tool could replace just about everything you have in your wallet. It will become your tool of payment for whatever you want to buy," he says.
Jordan Worth, telecommunications and Internet analyst with Toronto-based International Data Corp. (Canada) Ltd., says the wireless revolution will "liberate people's ability to spend liberally, quickly and possibly indiscriminately."
And it will give rise to new services and new business models that are not even conceivable with today's technology, Mr. Bregman says.
For example, it will soon be possible for a wireless service provider to pinpoint the location of a cellphone call. This will allow the development of location-based services providing Internet links to information about what is on sale at nearby stores, what specials are being offered at neighbourhood restaurants or what's showing at local cinemas.
Salman Mufti, a professor of information technology at Kingston, Ont.-based Queen's University, says consumers will eventually be able to use their phones or pocket computers to obtain information about products in stores simply by scanning their bar codes. They may be able to find out, for example, whether the same product is available at a nearby store for a better price.
"It will make everyone a smarter shopper because people will have information at their fingertips," he says.
The possibilities are unlimited, but the amount of information that can fit on a handheld screen is not. Mr. Bregman says this could mean the evolution of new business models involving practices such as service providers calling for bids from local restaurants for the right to send a message to a subscriber who has just asked for a suggestion about where to eat.
IDC projects that the number of mobile-phone subscribers in Canada will rise to 16.6 million by the end of 2003 from seven million today, and manufacturers anticipate that almost all new phones will soon be capable of browsing the Web.
This represents a huge opportunity for service providers and e-commerce companies, many of which are forming alliances and developing solutions aimed at capturing a share of the few inches of real estate on each of these 16 million or more phones.
John Riddell, a telecom analyst for Ajax, Ont.-based Angus Telemanagement Group Inc., says he observed an air of exuberant enthusiasm at a recent conference attended by companies interested in getting involved in mobile commerce.
"There was a strong feeling that this thing is going forward, that it is unstoppable and ways will be found to make it a commercial success," he says.
But there are many factions within the wireless revolution -- and obstacles that must be overcome before the information workers of the world unite behind a common technology standard so that end-users can lay down their desktop chains. Technologies of the world, unite Like most winning technologies, mobile wireless commerce is coming together under the banner of a couple of acronyms. Without WAP and WML, the wireless revolution may not have got off the ground.
Wireless applications protocol (WAP) is a universal standard that mobile devices can use to access the Internet through wireless networks. It has allowed the development of Web-browsing phones, pagers and handheld computers that will all work with the same services on the same networks.
Steve Asbury, vice-president of engineering at Markham, Ont.-based Centrinity Inc. , formerly known as MC2 Learning Systems Inc. -- which is incorporating WAP in its collaborative software applications -- says this universal standard is as important as the development of the Web browser in the wired Internet world. That's because it provides a common language to replace a hodgepodge of proprietary devices and services that split the market into many different fragments, none of which could gain a critical mass.
Meanwhile, wireless markup language (WML) is an agreed-upon method for paring Web-site content so it can be transmitted over wireless networks at half the speed of even the slowest dial-up Internet connection and displayed on handset screens that may have room for only a few lines of text.
But it is not easy to translate into XML from the standard language of the Internet, and any company that wants to engage in mobile commerce therefore needs to reconstruct its Web site, according to Mr. Asbury. "And that is clearly a big stumbling block at the moment."
"The problem with wireless is that the bandwidth is so low. You can't look at a small screen on a Palm device and expect to browse the Web," says Michael Moskowitz, president and general manager of Mississauga, Ont.-based Palm Canada Inc. , which uses a technology called "Web clipping" to present edited versions of Web content to wireless users of Palm organizers.
In spite of the emergence of common standards, companies that want to offer mobile-commerce solutions must still grapple with the fact that there are several wireless carriers in Canada using different and incompatible transmission standards, says Ian Collins, chief technology officer at Wysdom Inc. , a Toronto-based wireless Internet application service provider that helps companies deal with "the nightmare of trying to extend beyond the desktop to get into wireless."
Mr. Collins says the security of wireless transactions is a huge issue for would-be mobile-commerce operators because not all devices have built-in security and this is a problem that WAP does not necessarily solve.
According to Steve Baker, president and chief executive officer of Ottawa-based Chrysalis-ITS (Information Technology Security) Inc. , it is possible to achieve the same level of security in the wireless environment as in the wired world of e-commerce, but the technologies for doing it are different and it is important to create seamless links between the two.
Another unifying technology that will soon be ready to move from the lab to the marketplace is Bluetooth, a standard named after a Danish king who united warring factions in the 10th century. Bluetooth provides short-range wireless communications among various devices so that they can exchange data.
Bluetooth makes it possible for phones to communicate wirelessly with laptops, handheld computers, vending machines or point-of-sale devices in stores. It could eventually be used to transmit electronic cash from one phone to another so that people could transact complex e-commerce deals anywhere and at any time. The wireless revolution today Mr. Asbury describes the state of WAP technology today as being "very much at the geek stage."
There has been a flurry of announcements about new services in the past few weeks, most of them coming from Bell Mobility, a unit of Montreal-based BCE Inc. , the first carrier in North America to offer commercial services for Web- browsing digital phones.
And there are some Web-enabled phones and other handheld devices on the market, but most of the handsets -- devices such as the NeoPoint 1000 from La Jolla, Calif.-based NeoPoint Inc. , which is a sleek, silver-coloured flip phone with an 11-line screen, selling for $499 -- are still in the hands of industry insiders, analysts and journalists.
Responses to the handsets have been mixed as users tend to be impressed by the ease and speed with which they can access information from Web sites, but are disappointed by the difficulty of entering text to search or surf the Web.
"The hitch is that you still have no efficient way to enter text on these devices," says Mr. Riddell, who recently watched a telecommunications- company representative demonstrate the art of using a numeric keypad to enter text, and timed his speed at two words a minute.
What is a disadvantage to subscribers can be an advantage to service providers, which are able to offer a series of menu-driven options leading subscribers directly to certain preferred vendors rather than encouraging them to surf the Web on their own.
Bell Mobility subscribers equipped with a WAP-enabled phone can scroll through an on-screen menu to click on one of a number of mobile-commerce options. These include Bank of Montreal ,as well as the brokerage services of Charles Schwab Canada and TD Waterhouse Group Inc. , where registered clients can access their own accounts and carry out financial transactions over the wireless network.
Subscribers can also buy books, compact disks and flowers from Toronto-based Indigo Books Music & more Inc. in a service that was jointly developed by Bell Mobility, 724 Solutions Inc. and Bank of Montreal's Veev e-commerce service. Indigo president Heather Reisman says she expects customers to catch on quickly to the convenience of being able to order goods on the spur of the moment.
"You may be sitting at lunch with a friend and he says, 'I just read this new thing and it's fantastic.' Or you're dashing off somewhere and you realize it's your wife's birthday tomorrow. The phone's right there and you pick it up and you order," she says.
With this service, as with most current mobile-commerce offerings, customers do not send credit-card numbers or any other information over the wireless network. They identify themselves by means of personal identity numbers and passwords, and payments are made through an account that they have already set up by phone, in person or by means of a wireline Internet connection.
National Bank of Canada gives customers wireless access to information about their accounts through Microcell's Fido service. They cannot actually do banking with their mobile phones, but they can check to see how much money is in their accounts and what their most recent transactions were.
"People are using it before they make purchases or pay bills to see how much is in their accounts," says Mr. Dalton, who notes that this is the first stage in a plan that will soon give customers the ability to transfer funds and pay bills with their Fidos.
As new technology becomes available in the next two years, the bank and the mobile-phone company plan to introduce services to let customers download electronic cash and use their phones as digital wallets, he says.
Mr. Dalton says the technology used in Fido phones makes it possible for all customers to use e-commerce services, rather than limiting access to people who can afford the latest handsets.
Rogers AT&T Wireless, a division of Toronto-based Rogers Communications Inc. , has yet to introduce its Web-based e-business services, which will include enhancements in May to existing two-way paging using Research In Motion's BlackBerry pager and WAP services on its nation-wide digital PCS services later in the summer.
David Neale, the company's vice-president of new-product development, says "the technology is still in its infancy. We feel we have a great opportunity to develop our service and bring it together satisfactorily as opposed to rushing it to be in market." Mobile e-business Mobile data communications are by no means new to business. Wireless phones and other devices have been used for years by sales forces, transportation companies and other industries with mobile workforces. But these applications have generally involved expensive custom-built solutions, often using proprietary technologies and specially adapted equipment.
What is new for business is the ability to give sales forces and other workers access to corporate intranets using off-the-shelf consumer products. Software companies such as Oracle Corp. of Redwood Shores, Calif., and Toronto-based SAP Canada Inc. are offering services that make use of Web portals through which companies can create wireless links with employees, customers, suppliers and partners using phones, Palm organizers and other Web-enabled devices.
On-line auction service Bid.com has announced that users of RIM two-way pagers will soon be able to make wireless bids. Jeff Lymburner, Bid.com's president and chief executive officer, says this will mean that "people can participate in one of our auctions regardless of whether or not they are tied to a desk. Say someone is pricing out a job site and figures that he needs x number of thousands of square feet of drywall. He may want to get bids on materials without having to go back to the office to log on."
Though few people yet have the hardware to use any of these services, Internet companies are rushing to develop new offerings and climb on the mobile-commerce bandwagon. As Mr. Riddell puts it, "The mood out there is one of, 'We will build it and they will come.' "

Abstract: At publicly traded Sceptre, a $19-billion money manager that offers both pension and mutual funds, Mr. [Rick Knowles] will be trying to return some lustre to a franchise that's had recent performance problems. A $40 stock two years ago, Sceptre has seen its price slide to $16 this week. For investment bankers, helping to sell a company is a mixed blessing.

Full text: To borrow a phrase from the U.S. Army, John MacNaughton is looking for a few good women or men. Four of them, to be precise.
The recently appointed president and chief executive officer at the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board faces one of the more unique challenges in the world of money management. Over the next decade, he is going to be handed upwards of $100-billion, money meant to help fund the golden years of every Canadian outside Quebec. It's pretty much inevitable that the CPP will become one of the largest capital pools on the planet.
Since joining the fund last June after a distinguished investment banking career that included a stint as president of Nesbitt Burns, Mr. MacNaughton has been working with his board of directors on a mandate that will guide how all this money is deployed. Last month, the board signed off on a broad framework that allows the CPP to explore the full spectrum of investment strategies and pursue those opportunities it finds attractive.
Mr. MacNaughton said that in simple terms, the mission is to invest in the best interests of the folks kicking money into, and drawing benefits from, the CPP, matching the best-run funds in the world by posting solid performance without taking on undue risk.
Past these motherhood goals, the slate is almost blank. Besides Mr. MacNaughton, the only major hires at the fund are vice-president of finance Jane Nyman, an accountant who worked at the Ontario Teachers fund; fellow financier Henry Kim, who was at OMERS; plus office manager Barb Sharp.
Next week, the CPP starts a search for a small but sophisticated team of in-house experts, who will then decide what money management skills should be developed internally, and what's best delegated to outside experts.
The four top jobs up for grabs at the CPP are:
* Vice-president of research and risk management. A touch of rocket science is involved in this job, as it requires setting risk guidelines in all areas, including derivatives, then making sure the systems can explain what's going on in the portfolios.
* Vice-president of public market investments. This job ties together equity, fixed-income and derivative portfolios, along with responsibility for origination and arbitrage.
* Vice-president of private market investments. Here, we're talking about merchant banking, real estate, venture capital and infrastructure financing.
* Vice-president of communications and stakeholder relations. When 70 per cent of the public is invested in your fund, you want to do a good job of explaining what you're up to.
For those interested, executive recruiter Ray & Berndtson of Toronto has been hired to find this four-person team. Another Nesbitt Burns alumnus has landed a plum money management job.
Sceptre Investment Counsel welcomed Rick Knowles this week as its new chief operating officer. Mr. Knowles left the top job at Jones Heward Investment Counsel , Bank of Montreal's money management arm, a few months back. Prior to that, he ran the fixed-income department at Nesbitt Burns and both the bond and equity desks at predecessor Nesbitt Thomson.
At publicly traded Sceptre, a $19-billion money manager that offers both pension and mutual funds, Mr. Knowles will be trying to return some lustre to a franchise that's had recent performance problems. A $40 stock two years ago, Sceptre has seen its price slide to $16 this week. For investment bankers, helping to sell a company is a mixed blessing. These assignments tend to pay slightly better, especially if you defend a company that's facing a hostile bid, but once the transaction's over, you've lost a client.
RBC Dominion Securities appears to be finessing its way around this problem. In December, the firm helped Shaw Communications sell its local phone network to GT Group Telecom . This week, GT Group Telecom picked up Moffat Communications' fibre-optic business for $118-million, and RBC Dominion had switched sides to help out GT Group Telecom. On the other side of the table, TD Securities worked with Moffat on the deal. The Rangers, Devils and Islanders aren't the only hockey teams to cheer for in the Big Apple.
Last weekend saw the New York-based staff of the Canadian investment banks lace on their blades and do battle in the 10th annual Scotia Challenge Cup Tournament.
The round robin tournament saw Nesbitt Burns and Scotiabank in the opening rounds. In the tournament final, TD Securites faced off against CIBC World Markets -- that would be the bank that's got a guy named Gretzky as its spokesman.
The Great One must have been busy, because a four-goal binge by TD Securities USA president Peter Bethlenfalvy helped the team that calls itself "Gang Green" to a 7-4 victory. TD's Manhattan trading room shut down briefly early Monday for the obligatory victory parade.

Abstract: In less than a month, it probably will become clear whether the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Task Force has a hope of seeing its vision realized. As I've seen through my research on waterfronts in New York, London, Boston and Toronto, there is a narrow window of opportunity early in a waterfront project when the political consensus is strong enough to empower an agency to get on with the job.

Full text: Toronto has long neglected its waterfront. Now it must act quickly to save it, says a planning expert
In less than a month, it probably will become clear whether the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Task Force has a hope of seeing its vision realized. As I've seen through my research on waterfronts in New York, London, Boston and Toronto, there is a narrow window of opportunity early in a waterfront project when the political consensus is strong enough to empower an agency to get on with the job. Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, Ontario Premier Mike Harris and Mayor Mel Lastman stood shoulder to shoulder last Nov. 3 pledging support for the regeneration of the declining waterfront of Canada's largest city. The plan they commissioned was unveiled on Monday. If we don't see them together again in the next few weeks, promising legislation, power and money, then we can expect this waterfront plan to drift away until after the next round of federal and local elections.
To implement a vision such as the one unveiled Monday, it's necessary to get at least three things right for 20 years: planning, politics and finance. The planning is in good shape today. The best urban designers and engineers in central Canada were aided by strategic advice from Barcelona, London and Manhattan, cities that have had great success in transforming their waterfronts. They produced a compelling vision to transform an industrial waterfront into parks, new neighbourhoods and business districts, connected by boulevards and canals. Similar in scope to the 1909 plan for Chicago, it expands on 30 years of planning for Toronto's central waterfront and the consensus-building of David Crombie's Waterfront Regeneration Trust. The next steps are clear: public consultation and fine-tuning. Unfortunately, planning is the easy part, even if it is the most time-consuming. The political and financial arrangements are far more important and less likely to be approved, since they require that governments give up power and money.
The most important recommendation of the task force report (chaired by Robert Fung) is that a Toronto Waterfront Development Corporation be formed by the federal, provincial and city governments to implement the plan. If only one or two of these governments are represented on the board of this agency, we will soon see political support evaporate, despite the warm glow at last November's press conference. Local governments do not have the resources or the jurisdiction to develop large waterfront projects, but unilateral action by upper-tier governments leads to years of delay.
In 1966, when New York governor Nelson Rockefeller seized the initiative on Battery Park City, mayor John Lindsay's staff learned about it by reading The New York Times en route to work. The resulting confrontation with the Lindsay regime delayed the project for years, even though both men were members of the Republican Party. Similarly, Pierre Trudeau's 1972 election gift of a waterfront park touched off six years of conflict with Toronto mayor David Crombie.
The powers granted to the new agency in the next few weeks will determine its success or failure in the years ahead. It should be handed the ability to hire the best talent available at market rates, rather than forced to rely on staff seconded from other governments. The agency must own the land it is mandated to develop. Co-ordination simply does not work. Other owners will pursue their own agendas, such as developing big box retail stores on sites across the street from the intended site of an Olympic stadium.
This sort of embarrassment is common when the implementing agency does not own the land. In London, the local boroughs never surrendered their land to the Docklands Joint Committee in the 1970s. In New York, the state-sponsored Battery Park City Authority tried to implement its plan on land leased from the city government, with the city throwing up obstacles every step of the way. Nothing happened for years until the lands were expropriated and handed to the agencies in both cities.
In Canada, we have the 40-year-saga of the National Capital Commission trying to redevelop LeBreton Flats, when the Ottawa city and regional governments owned key parcels. The Waterfront Regeneration Trust made little progress in central Toronto, even with Mr. Crombie, Toronto's most revered politician, at the helm for 14 years. With no land and limited funding, they produced fine studies and many kilometres of trails, but little urban redevelopment. It is remarkable how much Mr. Crombie accomplished with such inadequate support.
But the $5-billion plan unveiled Monday will require entirely different powers and governance. Large, early expenditures are required for land assembly, site clearance, environmental remediation and new infrastructure on the waterfront. These costs make projects unattractive to the private sector, as it may take years until land is ready for redevelopment.
While all three governments will have to support infrastructure for the waterfront, the key financial strategy is not big cash grants, but granting the agency the power to borrow money, lease assets, and recover revenue from tolls and taxes. In New York, the Battery Park City Authority issued long-term bonds to finance its infrastructure program. This strategy matched long-term capital requirements with long-term financing, allowing the agency to reduce its cash demands on its sponsoring government and build a high-quality infrastructure.
In the four cities I studied, private investment came late, built slowly and cycled with the local property market. The lesson is that the big deals such as the World Financial Center (New York), Canary Wharf (London) or Queen's Quay Terminal (Toronto) did not arrive until later. The waterfront agency had to demonstrate its credibility with site improvements, small developments and other changes to the image of the waterfront. The private projects also had to wait for a positive point in the real-estate-market cycle, or risk bankruptcy, as happened to the Reichmanns in the case of Canary Wharf.
The flow of private investment could also be impeded if the agency's developer-selection process is too slow, or the municipal-building-approval process too cumbersome. A slow process could miss the market window, as in the case of Boston's projects in the 1980s. A streamlined development-approval process allowed the New York and London agencies to react quickly to market conditions and take advantage of developer interest during the brief boom periods in a local real-estate cycle. This agility was a major financial advantage.
Toronto witnessed this level of operational independence before, in 1910. Faced with threats to its economic competitiveness due to an outmoded port, the federal and municipal governments stopped jousting and joined forces to create the Toronto Harbour Commission. It hired outstanding engineering staff, retained the famous Olmsted firm as landscape consultants and borrowed money to transform the entire waterfront from the Humber River to the Don. New parks, Lake Shore Boulevard and the new port rose out of the water in less than a decade. Ironically, it was the port that had the shortest useful life. Still, this model of a successful implementation agency should be considered for the future. If the imminent deadlines of the Olympics are a factor, there really is no choice.

Abstract: Here are some of the proposals in yesterday's report on revitalizing Toronto's waterfront: Increase public access to the central waterfront through walkways, trails and piers. Major north-south streets would end at public plazas at the water's edge. Tear down the Gardiner Expressway and replace it with a series of street-level roads, at a cost of $1.2-billion.

Full text: But finding the $12-billion to achieve that dream is down the road
A sweeping blueprint to transform Toronto's languishing waterfront into an urban jewel won near-universal praise yesterday, but the political and financial commitments to realize the $12-billion dream lie down the road.
Yesterday, all three levels of government expressed their enthusiasm for the broad concepts delivered by the eight-person Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Task Force. It calls for a $1.2-billion initiative to tear down the Gardiner Expressway and replace it with a ground-level road system; a $1.2-billion environmental cleanup of the Don River and contaminated Port Lands; 200 more hectares of parkland; the creation of new neighbourhoods the size of Oshawa and Brampton in the waterfront area; and a variety of commercial, retail and new media activities.
Overseeing this massive undertaking would be a new super-agency, acting for the federal, provincial and city governments, that would be the key deal-maker with private-sector investors.
In a 70-page report that spells out how to pull off the long-deferred dream of remaking the city's "front yard," the chairman of the task force warned that time is of the essence.
"There's an urgent need to get on with this," Robert Fung told a crowded room of reporters at the CN Tower, which offered a commanding view of the waterfront's potential below.
If the federal, provincial and city governments fail to work together to make the dream a reality, Mr. Fung warned that "Toronto will decline as other cities move ahead. We are falling behind other cities."
The first test, he said, would be a commitment by all three levels of government to pay, over the next three years, for the environmental cleanup and other work needed to make contaminated port lands ready for development by private industry.
In Ottawa, federal Transport Minister David Collenette, who is also responsible for the Greater Toronto Area, said the recommendations of the Fung task force could transform Toronto.
"If this goes ahead, this will be the largest urban development in world history, twice as large as [London's] Canary Wharf," he said. "The government of Canada will want to work with the local authorities to realize this dream."
But he cautioned that the report is still a concept. "It's exciting, and we have to examine all the details," he said, adding that it is premature to talk about federal funding.
Mitch Patten, president of the new Ontario government agency assigned to work with the Toronto Olympics bid and waterfront development, was also enthusiastic without making pledges for the province's future role.
"It is far-reaching and ambitious, with a pretty exciting array of projects," he said. "We want to take time to go through the report." He said a response could be forthcoming in a matter of weeks, not months.
Toronto Mayor Mel Lastman said he was confident that this time, the city's big dream of remaking its waterfront can be achieved.
"I think we can do it. It'll be the biggest and best anywhere in the world."
But he was reluctant to commit the city to put hard dollars on the table in the short-term. "Our money is strictly land we own there," he said of city-owned real estate in the waterfront area. "Because we have no money."
Private-sector investors, who the task force expects could put in $7-billion of the total $12-billion, praised the report for offering opportunities for private-public-sector partnerships.
"It's a huge leap forward," said Barry Lyon, a real estate development consultant, praising the potential for the private sector to work with all three levels of government.
Bud Purvis, senior vice-president for TrizecHahn developers, said the task force report recommendations offer the potential of certainty -- a key missing ingredient for developers now.
However, the report was not without its critics. The Canadian Automobile Association complained that motorists would be penalized if tolls were applied to the Gardiner Expressway to finance its $1-billion overhaul into a network of street-level roads.
Councillor Jack Layton, an advocate of affordable housing, urged that the task force guarantee in writing that its proposal for 40,000 housing units include a component of low-income rental units.
WHAT WOULD CHANGE
Here are some of the proposals in yesterday's report on revitalizing Toronto's waterfront: Increase public access to the central waterfront through walkways, trails and piers. Major north-south streets would end at public plazas at the water's edge. Tear down the Gardiner Expressway and replace it with a series of street-level roads, at a cost of $1.2-billion. Create a so-called "convergence centre" for new media and technology business and residential housing, tapping into new-economy opportunities for the city. At the site of the proposed Olympic village in the Port Lands area, construction of 40,000 housing units, including some affordable rental accommodation. Clean up the Don River and contaminated soil in the Port Lands and West Donlands areas, at a cost of $1.2-billion. Set up a new super-agency, the Toronto Waterfront Development Corp., with wide powers to buy, sell or lease land to implement the broad vision of waterfront development. The corporation should be given at least $2-billion over three years from the federal, provincial and city governments to get the Port Lands ready for development. The agency would fold after the waterfront has been redeveloped, in 15 to 20 years. Governments could look at a variety of possible revenue sources to finance the replacement of the Gardiner Expressway and other projects. The options include levying tolls on the Gardiner, parking surcharges, a gasoline tax, and sale or lease of residential and commercial land. Set aside 200 hectares of new parkland in both the west and east ends of the city. Hamida Ghafour

New databank primed to help investors

Author: King, Deborah

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/new-databank-primed-help-investors/docview/384340451/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The information in the databank will be for investors only. "It looks at things in a macro sense," Ms. [Patricia Arsenault] said. "There's no information released other than back to the person providing that information on individual properties, so it's not like a broker's database on individual properties and what the characteristics of those are.

Full text:   ese days, the words "consolidation" and "amalgamation" are apt to produce feelings of trepidation and anxiety in most people, who worry that application of those terms will mean job loss or overwork -- at the very least, insecurity.
In some cases, however, those words take on an entirely different meaning, and many benefits ensue. Such is the case with a new joint venture being developed by Clayton Research Associates Ltd. of Toronto and Investment Property Databank of London.
IPD, which provides comprehensive information on real estate investment in seven countries, and Clayton Research have formed the Canadian Property Databank. It will be an annual, comprehensive and integrated real estate property databank to provide information for investors that will consist of property characteristics, vacancy data, income data, expense/operating costs data, lease profiles and investment performance data. The properties in the database will include retail, hotel, office and industrial properties, as well as multi-unit rental investment properties such as condominiums.
"Essentially, we're talking about something that IPD has already been providing in other countries," said Patricia Arsenault, senior vice-president with Clayton Research. "They actually got it going in the U.K. in 1985, so it's been running for quite some time now, and they've slowly been expanding."
IPD's British service contains data on 14,000 properties, or 80 per cent of institutional holdings. Expansion has taken place in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa and Ireland, using local partners.
IPD ( www.ipdindex.co.uk )brings to the Canadian joint venture its methodology, standardized data compilation, data editing and verification, and production of analytical tables and charts. Clayton Research's contribution lies in client contact, portfolio analysis and reports and presentations.
According to a report by Clayton Research, "historically, institutional real estate investment decision-making has been largely a deal-by-deal approach, focused on individual property acquisitions rather than the portfolio. The result often was a collection of ad hoc individual deals."
Now, though, the report adds, "proactive portfolio management is replacing the deal-by-deal approach. There also is increasing investment sophistication among real estate market participants, plus new analytical tools. And the globalization of real estate investment has increased the need to compare performance in different countries."
Ms. Arsenault says the databank will be a "benchmarking service for real estate investors. "What it does is collect very detailed information on individual properties in investors' portfolios and amalgamates this into a databank where they can do overall analysis of what's going on.
"For example, individual investors know how they're doing, but they don't necessarily know how they're doing relative to what the industry as a whole is doing."
To that end, Clayton Research says, the new databank is primed to supply benchmarks for investment performance, income and expenses; to be a diagnostic tool for determining reasons for differences between portfolio performance and the benchmarks; and to be a tactical tool to determine the type of actions needed to improve portfolio performance.
The information in the databank will be for investors only. "It looks at things in a macro sense," Ms. Arsenault said. "There's no information released other than back to the person providing that information on individual properties, so it's not like a broker's database on individual properties and what the characteristics of those are. It uses the individual properties, but to build up to what the whole sector is doing as opposed to providing information on individual properties."
In terms of the participants, she said, "it shows how they're doing relative to other investors, and it's not just over all. It zeroes in on, 'Is my performance different because I have more office [properties], and office is doing less well than somebody else's breakdown?'
"It serves that function for specific investors already involved, but it can be used as well for people not currently involved because one thing they do is publish overall results of the survey. You don't have to subscribe; it's a freebie. It's called the overall market index and it looks at how the total returns come out for the properties. The goal of that sort of thing is to generate interest in real estate. If people have more information on what's going on, they're more likely to consider getting into it."
The database also will be able to compare properties in different countries for people with investments here and abroad, and may increase foreign investor interest in Canada. The service also will form a basis for evaluating past, current and future market trends. Regular property evaluations will be included, and the partners promise full confidentiality and reliability in client interaction.
For now, Ms. Arsenault says, the Canadian service will be done on an annual basis, although in some countries they have refined it down to a quarterly accounting of results. "That also means participants have to report information on a quarterly basis, so there's a tradeoff there."

Razing the roof in casual Seattle

Full text: BLOWN TO KINGDOME COME Reactions are mixed as explosives topple mammoth sports monument to seventies
The Kingdome, one of North America's most imposing sports stadiums, came crashing down with an ear-splitting roar yesterday, reduced to rubble in a spectacular implosion demolition lasting 16.8 seconds.
As the huge concrete-domed stadium was blown to kingdom come, the earth shook, windows broke and towering clouds of thick dust rolled over the city like tidal waves.
Television announcers, broadcasting live, groped to describe the scene.
"Kawoomph, it's gone," one shouted.
"Kerblooey," another yelled.
Thousands of spectators answered the thunderclap of noise from the demolition with a roar of their own -- at least until they began choking on the dust.
"My knees were shaking," one said. "I loved it.
"Then I saw all this dust coming right at me. You could taste it. It was awesome."
Afterward, the man in charge of the demolition, Mark Loizeaux of Controlled Demolition Inc., said the dome's demise, one of the largest and most difficult implosions ever attempted, had gone even better than he expected.
"It wasn't perfect, but it was close," Loizeaux said. "I think maybe the flagpole tilted a little bit. Sorry."
Nearly 6,000 carefully placed explosives brought the dome down. The 7.8-acre (3.16-hectare) roof was collapsed first, turned into concrete Jello by a series of clearly visible charges. The detonations went off right on time, just after 8.30 a.m.
With the arched dome gone, the Kingdome's supporting pillars quickly fell inward, as they, too, were exploded into rubble. Reverberations were felt far from the site. One expert likened the impact in the immediate area to an earthquake of 4.5 magnitude.
For many of those watching, it meant the proverbial end of an era.
"I know it's just a building, but all of a sudden I got all these memories," said Molly Stickrod, 29, who viewed the demolition from a harbour park near the city's renowned Pike Place Market. "It's weird to look down there and see it gone."
Almost 80 metres high, the stark, circular Kingdome had dominated Seattle's harbour skyline for 24 years. Like so many other ungainly relics of the 1970s, however, its relative youth was no protection against current trends, in this case toward comfy, more profitable outdoor parks.
Few denied the Kingdome was a gloomy place for professional sports. On nice days, crowds dwindled. The Seattle Mariners of the American League now play baseball outdoors in nearby Safeco Field, while an outdoor stadium for the National Football League's Seahawks will be ready in 2002. Both stadiums were approved, despite their massive cost, after the owners of both clubs threatened to move their franchises out of Seattle.
The city's lively media gave the demolition blanket coverage in the past week, dubbing it variously as Dome to Dust, the Last Blast and the Super Bowl of Demolitions. A newspaper article suggested a "fallen souffle surrounded by bangers" as the meal of the day.
Thousands ignored advice to watch the blast at home on television. Although police kept the public at least 1,000 feet away from the Kingdome, people perched on rooftops, crowded elevated highways and bridges and packed city parks.
Several hundred pleasure boats jostled in the harbour for a ringside view.
Stickrod seemed representative of many watchers in this high-tech, easygoing urban community, which hasn't had this much excitement since the "Battle of Seattle" during the World Trade Organization meetings in November.
Clutching a takeout cappuccino, Stickrod talked on a cellphone to her family in the San Juan Islands as the dome went boom.
"They don't have a television." she said. "I told them it kind of reminded me of [the volcanic explosion on] Mount Saint Helen's. All that history gone. But I guess we're now onto the next thing."
Late Saturday afternoon, there had been a surprisingly mournful air outside the sturdy but mostly unloved structure.
More than the stadium itself, people said they will miss what it stood for.
"The Kingdome has been part of my life for 25 years, and that will die," said Ann Babb, a 34-year-old real-estate agent who was among hundreds of Seattle residents posing for one final picture in front of the old stadium.
"It's sad. I think the Kingdome was a good representation of Seattle. Gloomy and imperfect, but one always had a good time."
Becky Barnett's eyes welled with tears as she cradled her three-year-old daughter. "I never really liked the building, but 10 to 15 years ago, I loved coming here. We'd sit out in the right field bleachers, the cheap seats, and you'd always see the same people. We had such fun. It was a whole different part of my life."
Pam Bowman said the Seattle skyline will not be the same without the Kingdome. "Even though it was not beautiful, it was a real part of Seattle. I took my daughter to her first rock concert there. She was in Grade 4. We saw the Rolling Stones together. It was great."
Bowman's husband, Richard, said that demolishing the dome after less than 25 years of service was ridiculous. "It seems in America we can't let anything get old. It's a good thing Americans didn't build the pyramids, because they would have been gone long ago."
Few regular fans of the Mariners and the Seahawks, however, shed any tears.
"Good riddance," declared antiquarian bookseller David Ishii, who specializes in local baseball lore.
"I didn't realize how bad the Kingdome was until I was sitting in the sun at a baseball game at Safeco Field. How could we have endured over 20 years there, watching baseball indoors?"
Vancouver law professor Joe Weiler, who has held seasons tickets for the Seahawks since 1979, said he can't wait until the new, outdoor football stadium is finished.
"I look forward to being outside and seeing natural grass. At the Kingdome, it never felt real. I'm not going to miss it one bit."
Wags were never short of irreverent descriptions of the Kingdome: from a grapefruit rind to a giant hamburger designed by artist Claes Oldenburg.
Local historian Walter Crowley called it "a concrete carbuncle on the backside of downtown Seattle."
Now, Crowley wonders at the logic of destroying the Kingdome for the dubious pleasure of watching football outdoors in the chilly November rain of the Pacific Northwest.
"We're blowing up our white elephant, but a lot of us are scratching our heads," he said.
Still, Crowley said he wasn't surprised by the enormous public interest in the demolition.
"We don't blow up public buildings very often," he said. "It's kind of a collective exercise in sanctioned vandalism.
"You get to blow something up and it's all perfectly legal. And it's free."

Couple uses discipline to battle debt load

Author: Mulroney, Catherine

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/couple-uses-discipline-battle-debt-load/docview/384348366/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: This is where [Stephanie Saunders] and [Ian Murphy]'s balancing act comes in. For example, family comes first for the couple and Stephanie would like to take time off to be with the children. That would delay eliminating all debt. Similarly, while the couple is very happy in Saskatoon, "it's not home," Stephanie says. At some point they would like to move back to Ontario, but prices in the Toronto area are significantly higher, with the average house in the $200,000 range, Ms.

Full text: Stephanie Saunders wonders whether saving $1-million will make her money demons go away.
Stephanie, 38, and husband Ian Murphy (not their real names), who is 40, are disciplined savers who have managed in the past eight years to turn their financial world around. In that time, they eliminated credit card debt as well as student and personal loans and have gone from almost no savings to owning a home and holding a total of $125,000 in their registered retirement savings plans. They never carry a credit card balance, are steadily whittling down their mortgage (a secured line of credit) with monthly payments of $1,400, and are saving religiously for their two children's post-secondary education.
The couple's budget strategy received a boost when they moved from Toronto to Saskatoon four years ago to accept jobs in the public sector. The move, which resulted in a combined salary of $99,000, placed them in a city where, unlike Toronto, they felt they could carry a house comfortably. They bought a property for $112,000 which, thanks to a local real estate boom, has appreciated to about $160,000.
From the house it's a short walk to Stephanie's work, which means they only need one car. And there are other money-saving tactics. While there was a time when Ian could spent $30 or more on books weekly, he now knows the joys of the public library. Stephanie gave up a pack-a-day habit at a time when cigarettes cost about $6 a package. For Stephanie and Ian, the focus is on eliminating debt to raise their comfort level and increase the quality of their children's lives by being able to offer money for university and other major goals.
The couple's financial discipline is in large part a result of the profound effect Stephanie's childhood had on her financial thinking. Raised by a single mother, she witnessed firsthand the many money crises her mother endured and describes herself as "debt-phobic." While Ian's childhood was not so stressful, he understands and supports her desire to be on firm financial footing.
While it's important to the couple to be debt-free soon, Stephanie wants to ensure the couple's children have more choices than they did, such as where and when they go to school and whether they would like to travel. "Financial security gives you choices," she says.
She also wants to know whether she and Ian can ease up on saving to improve cash flow.
"We've been on a bit of an austerity campaign, watching every cent go out the door," she says. While she and Ian say they are quite comfortable living "a responsible lifestyle," she wants to know whether they can turn their sights to other priorities. For example, Stephanie would like to take some time off to spend with son Michael, who is 3-plus, and daughter Alison, who is 18-months old. As well, the couple talk about taking a leave of absence to travel around North American or for Russell to work in England for a few years, where he was born.
To accomplish this, Stephanie is wondering whether it's possible to scale back or eliminate RRSP contributions either immediately or by age 45. Savings come at the expense of other opportunities, and she is worried her hard-earned savings will ultimately translate to an Old Age Secrutiy clawback and a higher tax bracket. What our expert recommends The key skill Stephanie needs to develop is a sense of balance, weighing how hard it would be to alter her financial plans to accomplish other goals, says Mary Chan, a financial planner with Edward Jones in Mississauga, Ont.
The couple "is absolutely on the right path," Ms. Chan says. "Pat yourself on the back, especially because you've started the kids on the right path."
However, it's not time to relax yet, she says. Stephanie has only just started a company pension and Russell's began at age 37. That puts added pressure on their RRSPs to perform. If the couple were to keep up their monthly contributions of $900 for the next 20 years, at an average annual return of 8 per cent, they would see $1-million on retirement, Ms. Chan says. Given that Stephanie says she thinks about money all the time and says "If I had $1-million I hope [the worry] would go away," a strong RRSP is vital.
While Stephanie worries about the tax hit in retirement, and the possibility of losing out on OAS because of her income, Ms. Chan advises her not to let those issues cloud her savings strategy.
"She's worrying far too early. Government policy may change significantly in the next 20 years," she says, adding that because the couple can't control government policy, it's smart to have control over their investments and it's better to overestimate their needs rather than struggle.
Also important to Ian and Stephanie is the goal of being debt free in five years. While the current secured mortgage will be paid off in that time if the couple maintains the current payments, there will still be debt owing on the $20,000 in renovations planned for this spring that will extend that period, Ms. Chan says.
And this is where Stephanie and Ian's balancing act comes in. For example, family comes first for the couple and Stephanie would like to take time off to be with the children. That would delay eliminating all debt. Similarly, while the couple is very happy in Saskatoon, "it's not home," Stephanie says. At some point they would like to move back to Ontario, but prices in the Toronto area are significantly higher, with the average house in the $200,000 range, Ms. Chan says, and that likely means carrying debt longer than they would like.
Because the couple envisions extended travel when the children are older, Ms. Chan suggests starting to save for that now. Travel would mean being off work and bringing in no income. It would be preferable to pay for the trip from savings rather than paying for it through the line of credit, she suggests.
Ian went back to school in his 30s and that has prompted Stephanie to wonder whether they should stop contributing to the childrens' registered education savings plans and start new plans. As each plan has a 25-year limit on using the funds, this would expand the children's time frames. Ms. Chan acknowledges this as a possibility, but reminds the couple to change institutions with each new plan. She also says such a move would create administrative headaches. She urges the couple to use a family plan so that should one child not use the funds, the money could roll over to the other.
The couple wants to have money to help the children with their needs in early adulthood and Ms. Chan suggests starting informal trusts now that could be used in future years to help buy a house, start a business or accomplish other goals for the children.
One of Stephanie's investment aims, to play the stock market using the couple's secured line of credit, was nixed by Ms. Chan, who says it's generally not a good idea to leverage investments. It's particularly not suggested for Stephanie, who needs to sleep at night.
Also on Stephanie's list of goals is buying a four-plex, although Ian isn't keen on this idea. Ms. Chan cautions that it would be crucial to ensure the rental income from the building could carry the mortgage and that Stephanie realizes it could result in expenses, which would come from their personal funds.
On Stephanie's pie-in-the-sky list is the figure of $2-million on retirement.
"I don't want to disappoint her and it can be done," Ms. Chan says. "But it will mean either increasing savings, working longer or increasing rate of return, which could mean worry with increased risk. Stephanie has to balance her goals."

Full text: What do architects, teachers, real estate developers and bankers have in common? A little round pill named ecstasy. The rave-scene standby is becoming the new middle-class cocktail of choice
It's another sluggish Friday night in Toronto. Nick, a 37-year-old teacher is unwinding after a long week of marking exams. Sal, his sweetheart since high school, is boiling a pot of noodles in the kitchen of their comfortable downtown condo. The lights are low, the candles are burning, yet those crystal glasses on the table hold not wine, but mineral water.
Nick and Sal retire to the living room after dinner, turn on some music and pop two little white pills for dessert. About 40 minutes later, this perfect picture of domestic calm suddenly sizzles into the erotic.
Welcome to the middle-aged, middle-class world of ecstasy. For a growing number of 30- and 40-something devotees, the transcendental drug of our times earns its name. In an era of long work hours, high technology and, often, strained personal relationships, otherwise-conventional professionals are finding in "the love drug" an oasis of connection and sensuality.
"It heightens all of your sensations and removes all of your inhibitions," says Nick, who hadn't so much as smoked a joint before a lawyer friend introduced him to "E" a year ago. "It makes you very tactile and very chatty. You talk about everything: your relationship, your feelings, places you would like to go, things you would like to try. And then it leads to the best sex you've ever had in your life."
For many, that's exactly the draw. Dennis Thompson is an addiction counsellor with Bellwood Health Services in Toronto, who also runs a private practice in the bedroom community of Newmarket. He has several suburban clients who get ecstasy at strip clubs and bring it home at the end of the night. "These guys are stagnant in their jobs, their kids are moving on and life with the wife is dragging. . . . 'What the heck,' they say, 'let's put a little spark back into our dinner parties and our sex lives.' "
Nick and Sal don't have any such problems. But even this happy couple are so enthusiastic about their weekend lubricant that they talked a conservative bank executive into trying it on New Year's Eve (she loved it) and recently recommended it to a frazzled construction manager who's going through a rough divorce.
"I have this overwhelming desire to give it to all my friends who are having marital problems," says Nick. "I really think it would help."
As the rave kids usually associated with the drug would say: How wacked is that? The increasingly corporate rave scene is now scrambling to swear it off. Police have been cracking down on suppliers: In Toronto, chief Julian Fantino announced last week he was setting up a "strike force" to deal with club drugs. Yet respectable professionals in their nice, clean neighbourhoods are only now turning on to ecstasy's blissful high.
Detective Rick Chase of the Toronto Metropolitan Police's downtown drug squad puts it plainly: "Wake up. Everybody's doing it."
That includes Jeff, a 32-year-old architect who has taken ecstasy about 10 times in the last two years (almost always under starry skies up at his cottage in the Muskokas). He says it's better than any other drug he's tried. "When you're on E, there's nothing in the world that makes you mad or upset. There's none of the paranoia that comes with mushrooms and acid. It's the same euphoria, but all that stuff is stripped away.
Jeff's far from alone. "We're finding it more and more with this upwardly mobile crowd," says Chase. In the United States, ecstasy seizures increased 450 per cent between 1998 and 1999. Health Canada reports a similar growth here between 1996 and 1999. "It's not restricted to any one age group anymore. These are people with good jobs. People who look good and want to take a pill that will make them feel good. . . . They've decided they don't need the scotch-and-beer hangovers anymore."
Nick certainly believes that ecstasy is a "great clean drug" for people his age. "You take it on Friday night, you experience this really clear, positive feeling for four, six, eight hours. Then you wake up in a happy mood on Saturday, or at least I always have. You remember everything you discussed the night before and you just pick up your life and go out and have brunch with your friends."
Where younger users saw a social drug, a music enhancer, older professionals may see a much needed spiritual (and sexual) mini-vacation. The appeal is obvious for aging boomers who long ago traded in their idealism for responsibility and unfulfilled expectations.
Irvin Wolkoff, a clinical psychiatrist in Toronto, says that this "anti-professional" age is taking its toll on his generation. "Those of us who became doctors, lawyers, dentists, teachers, we made our trade-off. We never wanted to be worshipped, but we did think we would be regarded as hardworking men and women. We never expected to become despised individuals who are causing peril to federal and provincial economies and considered a threat to our patients or clients. . . .
"A drug that gives the illusion of loving and being loved could be very attractive."
Take Peter, for instance. For the past two years, this New York TV producer has come to Toronto with six other guys for the Molson Indy. These annual weekend retreaters, who range in age from 39 to 47, include a doctor, a lawyer, a real-estate developer, a screenwriter, a film editor and a venture capitalist in biomedicine. They are all married or in long-term relationships; four have kids. They come for the noise, the rush, the frat-boy comraderie -- and the E.
Last summer, after a day of sucking up exhaust fumes beside the track, they all headed back to their four-star hotel and swallowed some pills. Then they went out clubbing and danced with silly smiles on their faces until dawn. "What do you do if you're 46," asks Peter, "and you feel like your career's peaked? Everyone around you is getting richer and richer and the world's getting faster and faster. But you're not making millions. How do you escape? Chemicals."
In a sense, ecstasy, or MDMA as it is clinically classified, is returning to its roots. It was first produced as an appetite suppressant in 1914, but went unmarketed and largely forgotten until the 1970s, when a small number of psychotherapists and marital counsellors in the United States began to use it in therapy. Then, in the early eighties, it briefly appeared as the stimulant of choice in certain Texan night clubs frequented by upstanding young professionals. It was legal in the U.S. until 1985, though Canada had restricted it in 1976.
"You could buy it with your credit card," explains Simon Reynolds, a former editor of Spin magazine and the author of Generation Ecstasy. "There was this whole circuit of yuppie parties where you could buy MDMA and fruit juice, but no alcohol. They had a very clean image; you wouldn't find any coke or bongs or other drug paraphernalia there. People didn't think of it as a drug. Maybe it's going back to that sort of thing."
Soon thereafter, of course, ravers found that ecstasy enhanced the sensation of high-decibel electronic rhythms. In her book Writing on Drugs , British academic Sadie Plant,argues, "There's something about the clean precision of the MDMA experience that seems to fit digital technology, the same technology that enabled the creation of that very precise rhythmic dance music."
When ravers become enraptured by the drug, she writes, they are not just merging with the music and the crowd, but also with the machinery -- the sound system, the laser light effects and all the other high-tech elements used to "engineer atmosphere." She calls it "positive self-destruction."
Ironically, professionals who would rather pop their pills on beaches and in bedrooms are latching on to ecstasy just as warnings surface about the drug's possible self-destructive effects. Regular users have reported increased physical discomfort or hangovers, as well as weight loss, exhaustion, flashbacks, irritability, paranoia, depression, and even psychosis. Long-term use may cause jaundice, liver damage and possibly neurological damage -- an isolated case in the U.S. suggests the drug could cause a form of Parkinson's disease.
There were nine ecstasy-related deaths in Toronto last year, mostly due to its dehydrating side-effects, especially in hot, sweaty clubs -- that's why ravers always carry bottled water. Ontario's deputy chief coroner will be holding a special inquest this spring to look at the death of one man who died at an all-night party on Oct. 10.
So why is ecstasy bigger than ever? The mainstreaming of rave culture has certainly helped. Today's techno-music club events are a far cry from the rave parties once thrown illegally in warehouses, in fields and under expressways, where ecstasy was sometimes given out for free. Crackdowns have forced promoters into sleek modern nightclubs, where popular DJs can command a $25 cover.
So it's no surprise the drugs -- often mischievously marked with corporate logos like "ferrari" and "mitsubishi," to distinguish quality product from garbage cut with speed and from newer, riskier drugs such as Special K and GHB -- have gone upmarket too. "Six months ago the one you had to have was the Mitsubishi logo, but it changes every couple of months," says a 45-year-old Toronto dabbler. "Nowadays pills come with logos. That's how mainstream it's become."
But will this collective trip last? "Hmm," replies Malcolm, an Toronto university professor and longtime counterculturalist, in his late 40s, who scored some "blue butterflies" (a local brand of E) from a Queen Street waitress last year. It was a positive experience, but he wouldn't exactly call it an "intellectual" drug.
"For people beginning to get stressed out and lose touch with their bodies, ecstasy gets you right back to first base. The closeness is extraordinary. But it's sensual, not pounding away to orgasm. But in a funny sense, it does make it more innocent."
And such a "new earnestness" and "healthy hedonism," he mused, may be just what a cynical society is looking for. "I think we're all tired of the ironic position."

Full text: Provincial regulators charged with protecting consumers encounter tough choices when dealing with e-commerce.
Paving a clear path for e-commerce is a key goal, and a hands-off approach is often appropriate. Excessive regulation can stifle e-commerce growth, but laws must also be applied, on-line and off-line, to ensure regulatory fairness.
The key to it all lies in consumer education and fraud prevention -- providing people with the information and safeguards they need to make informed choices.
I recently completed a study for the Ontario Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations that addresses this policy dilemma. Consumer Protection and Licensing Regimes Review: The Implications of Electronic Commerce looks at the effects of e-commerce on several provincially regulated sectors, including automobile sales, travel, real estate and debt collection.
The study's main goals were to identify current e-commerce business models in these sectors, look at the rules governing them, and provide recommendations.
Most sectors use a variety of business models, each resulting in different legal implications. The motor vehicle sector, for example, features at least five different business models: on-line referral sites such as www.Autobytel.ca that direct prospective customers to dealers; reverse-auction referral sites that include an element of price negotiation prior to the referral (www.Priceline.com); private car sales (eBay); direct on-line sales through manufacturer referrals (Access Toyota); and direct on-line sales through third-party sites (CarsDirect.com).
Since several business models raise different regulatory concerns, a single legal solution for all would be unrealistic. Although on-line referral sites are currently unregulated, we could follow the lead of several U.S. states and adopt rules that would protect consumers from fraudulent referrals while ensuring marketplace fairness for motor vehicle dealers.
Existing legislation already covers private motor vehicle sales, since the law permits sales of personal motor vehicles without a licence. However, the ability to use on-line sites such as eBay to sell large numbers of vehicles without a licence (a practice known as curbsiding) is of real concern to regulators.
Direct on-line motor vehicle sales are causing the biggest regulatory headache. Current Ontario legislation features several provisions that require a physical office and the use of paper-based signatures for a valid sale. As on-line motor vehicle sales grow in popularity, the ability of regulators to enforce these laws -- and ensure that Ontario consumers enjoy equivalent protections on-line and off -- becomes very doubtful.
These challenges are by no means limited to motor vehicle sales. The travel and real estate industries also expect the Internet to play a key role in transactions in the near future.
For these reasons, changes may be needed to existing regulation. Regulatory change is a challenge, however, since it must be balanced with the competing interests of maintaining consumer protection and facilitating e-commerce.
The cornerstone of the changes would be a seal-of-approval program sponsored by the semi-private regulators that govern each sector.
This program would require provincially regulated businesses to display an icon on their sites (dubbed a Trillium Trust mark) that would provide consumers with an easy method of identifying local businesses, together with the assurance that they still enjoy regulatory protection. Unlike other seal-of-approval programs such as TRUSTe and BBBOnline (two private sector U.S.-based programs that have been criticized for their lack of regulatory muscle), this program would carry legal weight by becoming North America's first regulator-backed seal program.
Although first envisioned as an Ontario-based program, the seal program could be extended to out-of-province businesses. Regulatory co-operation across Canada and the United States would be essential.

Full text: From fridge magnets to T-shirts, there are thousands of products that can help small businesses
The next time you look at your refrigerator, consider the landscape of competing messages. "They are competing for real estate on the door," says Richard Nemes, president of Winnipeg-based Promotions Plus and an officer of the Manitoba chapter of the Promotional Products Association of Canada. From small plaques with the name of your plumber to miniature doll houses, espresso machines, oil derricks and model skyscrapers, the variety of these devices is as vast as the ingenuity of the firms that make them.
Promotional products are widely used throughout business, but they offer an edge to smaller firms that can afford novelty items but find air time on television or large newspaper ads too costly. A campaign to increase sales of a local merchant's goods may cost a few hundred dollars in promotional products, though costly products would, of course, cost more, while newspaper display ads are priced in the thousands and broadcast air time, depending on the slot, can cost from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Promotional products are a large and growing industry, Nemes says. As of 1998, the industry sold more than $1.2-billion of products. Tops in popularity are wearables such as caps and clothing, especially golf shirts. Then come pens, glassware and ceramics, long-service awards including watches and rings, towels, and calendars, he says.
Promotional giving is an ancient custom, though in a rigorous, commercial sense, today's plethora of functional promotional products can be traced to the fountain pen's introduction in the late 19th century, Nemes says. "The pens were valued merchandise and the custom developed of giving them as gifts. Eventually, they were printed with commercial messages. The industry expanded to add business gifts to decorate the desk top or fill pockets, hang from pockets like a key chain, or later, to be worn as recreational gear like golf shirts."
"Promotional products work," says Peter L. Smith, an account development manager for the Lipton tea unit of Unilever Canada. "They give consumers a good feeling about the products they buy. For example, Red Rose, one of our brands, has used small statues of animals and nursery rhyme characters. When we have used them, sales have shown a definite sales spike. Shoppers are interested in collectibles and our figurines give us a competitive edge."
Promotional products continue to grow because the basic concept of something personal that you want to keep continues to identify the products, Nemes says. "You give a person a useful item and the person will see the advertiser's name every time it comes into view."
The psychology of promotional products is subtle, says Kurt Reckziegel, president and COO of the Promotional Products Association of Canada in Montreal. "Promotional products leave a lasting impression. They are useful and every time they are used, they create name awareness," he says. "For advertising they are important. And that's because they are targeted. Each goes to someone who can buy a designated product or service."
Promotional products have a wide range that includes fine leather jackets and fine jewelry and accessories and also paperweights and trophies and sunglasses and mousepads and boxer shorts. Snowmobiles have been given as promotional products, Reckziegel says. As have fine crystal glassware and fine writing instruments, he adds.
New products are being put into the category. These products include high-technology devices as their prices tumble, Reckziegel says. And just as ashtrays were core promotional products, screen savers and computer peripherals are now coming into vogue as promotional products.
In the end, whether the golf tee in Lucite item on your desk is schlock or a precious gift depends not only taste, but association, says Reckziegel. In the language of the promotional products business, each object can be a tangible symbol that provokes associations.
Each can have the power to motivate its possessor to patronize the giver.
But are promotional products overdone? Products like the pine scented hula girl that reads "Bob's Garage" hanging from a rear view mirror have given promotional products an image of bad taste. But Richard Nemes argues that the major categories of products, particularly what he calls "wearables" like golf shirts, don't justify that description. In his view, the value of the promotional product is its appropriateness and function.
"What promotional products are doing is providing something useful," Reckziegler says. "They don't invade your sight the way billboards can do. The recipient of a promotional product is made to feel important by the giver, the advertiser, because the product either says please do business or thank you for doing business with us."

Bam! Have we got a home for Drew!

Author: Dixon, Guy

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/bam-have-we-got-home-drew/docview/384462002/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Real-estate marketers now work closely with developers, architects and interior designers every step of the way, critiquing plans and drawing up profiles of prototype home owners to target a particular kind of buyer. Yet you can imagine an architect's eyes rolling at the Crandall Building's inclusion of another "definitely sexy" glass wall, as the brochure notes, between the "be sleepy" room and the "be washed" room.

Full text: If you want a cool pad where you can 'be sleepy' and 'be washed', you're just the kind of condo-buyer realtors are looking for
Would you want Emeril Lagasse as a neighbour?
In the brochure for a new condominium building in Vancouver's Yaletown, the boisterous, Type-A chef with his own cooking show -- the anti-Julia Child who shouts "Bam!" when spiking a dish with chili powder -- is made to feel right at home.
The kitchens in the converted warehouse are equipped with "brushed stainless steel countertops and backsplash -- the kind that Emeril would want," the brochure says. In fact, the kitchen isn't really a kitchen at all, but a place to "be Emeril," according to the floorplan.
It's something of a leitmotif throughout the apartments.
Near the kitchen is the area to "be lounging," once known in more staid homes as a living room; next to that is the place to "be formal," the dining room, providing any would-be Emeril room for an easy audience. And when Emeril gets tired, a glass wall next to the kitchen allows dishwashing guests to watch him in the "be sleepy" room.
The Crandall Building in the high-density, Yaletown apartment district is clearly catering to a certain type of home buyer -- someone who has watched the Food Network, and yet someone who is also aware that he's "bored of hardwood and berber." Not to mention someone willing to pay between $162,000 and $384,000 for a condo.
The attention to detail, the active voice and the assumption that home buyers like role-playing games combine in the new art of condominium marketing in Canada. It's something that has evolved a long way from merely stenciling "Bayview Apartments" or "The Yorkshire" in gold script on the front door.
Real-estate marketers now work closely with developers, architects and interior designers every step of the way, critiquing plans and drawing up profiles of prototype home owners to target a particular kind of buyer. Yet you can imagine an architect's eyes rolling at the Crandall Building's inclusion of another "definitely sexy" glass wall, as the brochure notes, between the "be sleepy" room and the "be washed" room. (However, there is the huge bonus of allowing natural light to carry through the apartment.)
This is all meant to please the prefab buyer, a figment of marketing imagination.
His name is Drew. He listens to Fat Boy Slim and works at the Vancouver-based, Internet financial information company StockHouse Media Corp. He's single, and if he has a girlfriend, "she models part-time or is in the entertainment industry."
Drew spends a little beyond his $60,000 base salary, given his preference for shopping at Barney's in New York or in L.A. and his plan to trade in his Saab 900 for one of those new Beetle-like Audi TT.
His mindset, the profile says, is that "being surrounded by expensive things and beautiful people is de rigueur," and this apparently has something to do with the apartment's bamboo flooring. (The marketing profile even goes into such detail as his preference for drinking vodka and sodas and the fact that he carries a money clip instead of a wallet.)
Perhaps most importantly, Drew would catch the drift of an ad which ran in the local Georgia Straight entertainment newspaper showing the Crandall Building's European-style tilting windows with the caption "Good looking. And willing to try new positions."
"We try to speak the language of the people who are going to buy," said Cathy Grant, a vice-president at Maverick Real Estate Corporation. "I think you have to make sure the people who you're targeting, or who you're speaking to as potential purchasers, have a really good feeling about what the personality of their building is going to be.
"And I'm starting to talk some flaky stuff here," she added, but "the idea of slapping together a brochure and saying, 'hey, come to my project, it's really great and the prices are good,' I think those days are gone."
Creating some connection with the buyer, however tenuous, is key. It requires more than putting up a bunch of "For Sale" and "Now Showing" flags flapping in the wind.
Drew would probably never admit, especially to his part-time model girlfriend, ever actually wanting to be Emeril. But while walking through the condo and reading the brochure, he may still experience an epiphany.
Maybe it's the Details and GQ magazines placed strategically in the corner of the model apartment. Maybe it's the attractive receptionist in the showroom.
These little touches might spark a vague sense of recognition that perhaps this would make a good place to be unlike Emeril, to be oneself, and possibly to call home.
That's of course the goal. Condo marketers are selling an interactive setting, not just empty apartments. In self-referential Toronto, they typically show pictures of athletic or trendy people, not just bare rooms. Ultimately, these marketing photos suggest a lifestyle, not a place to start from scratch.
Much of this changes according to the building's location. The neighbourhood around Toronto's downtown Queen Street West area, for instance, has for months been a gallery of condo marketing targeted to different buyers, based on tiny nuances in each block.
Billboards in front of The Morgan on Spadina near Queen, in Toronto's fashion district, has huge, freshly-scrubbed faces with big toothy grins and the caption "it's you." Over the months, the neighbourhood has blackened the teeth with graffiti.
Two blocks east near CITY-TV and MuchMusic, along a central corridor for prepubescent ravers, punk squeegee kids and older media types, stands the lone showroom: a condominium complex behind an HMV record store. Its image tries to be edgier, showing us two large black and white photos of a male and female model glaring, posing separately, and of course, wearing black.
A few blocks closer to Bay Street are billboards for Axis condominiums with a none-too-swift-looking besuited guy gazing up at the sky with the caption "who has time to commute." (Here, too, the neighbourhood has had its input, pelting the photo with a gooey substance.) Ms. Grant back in Vancouver avoids pictures of models. "I personally hate lifestyle photos," she said. "I think you can represent the people coming in by what they do as opposed to what they look like." Indeed the Crandall Building delves much deeper into a buyer's self-identity.
Central to this is the massive blackboard in the model apartment, leaning against the wall like a giant things-to-do checklist and pretty much dominating the "be formal" room. The list includes hockey with a friend (possibly a hint that Vancouver's GM Place is only a short walk away), a long list of Italian ingredients to be bought specifically at Urban Fare (a trendy grocery store nearby) and at the bottom is the single question "Vegas? ? ?"
The buyer is told, as every young, urban Fat Boy Slim listener likes to believe, that he's multifaceted -- in this case, part-Canadian, part-Emeril or Goodfellas extra and partly a character from Swingers .
But even this is still only a rough sketch. The building, despite all the efforts to appeal to male tastes, has attracted some women buyers, as neighbours bump into each other in the hallway, knowing that they've bought the marketers' home-owner profile, but seeing how they've managed to take it that much further.

Full text: Developer David Butterfield may be regarded as one of North America's leading experts in the creation of sustainable buildings and communities, but it wasn't easy getting his newest project past a weary city council.
Any high-density residential development project in a quaint area like Victoria's James Bay is always a hard sell, especially if the neighbourhood plan lays out an alternate vision to revitalize the industrial site. It's more complicated if the proposed $90-million residential and commercial development featuring 150 upscale units priced as high as $1.75-million will sit on the city's prized waterfront known as Shoal Point, minutes away from the inner harbour accented by the historic Empress Hotel and the stately Parliament Buildings.
But Mr. Butterfield pulled it off, barely: When city councillors were split down the middle, the mayor weighed in to break the tie, voting to rezone the industrial land to accommodate the 260,000-square-foot development, the largest new residential project in Victoria.
Today, phase II of the project has just begun; 75 per cent of the units in Phase I have already been sold. According to the local real estate board's multiple listing service statistics, the Shoal Point at Fisherman's Wharf development has captured 55 per cent of all condo sales in the $350,000 plus range in Greater Victoria in the past 18 months.
Although it may cost more to build and live in one of the most environmentally and technically advanced buildings of its type in North America, Mr. Butterfield's newest project is testimony to the success, and popularity, of green development.
"I believe in it," says the developer. "It's a state of mind when you look at a project."
Shoal Point is designed to use about 50 per cent less energy than a similar-sized conventional building, but Mr. Butterfield's approach to sustainable development is much more holistic.
The project may mirror the look and feel of Victoria's famous -- and dated -- landmarks such as the Empress Hotel with its classic arches and brickwork, but Mr. Butterfield combines older architectural stylings with state-of-the-art building materials and technology.
"Beauty is a highly underrated value," says Mr. Butterfield, who sees developing visually appealing buildings as a social responsibility.
Developed in partnership with the non-profit Trust for Sustainable Development, environmental features include high efficiency fans, motors and pumps, as well as high-performance, double-pane low E-glass windows.
All suites feature nine-foot ceilings and full-height windows.
On the sides of the south-facing U-shaped project, there will be greenery growing in specially irrigated built-in planters. A series of greenhouses are being built on the roof. These innovative features, which took the design team 22 months to complete -- 16 months longer than usual -- are part of Shoal Point's auxiliary passive solar heating system.
Shoal Point's emphasis on energy efficiency and reduction of greenhouse gases has earned it recognition and support from Natural Resource Canada's C-2000 program for advanced commercial buildings, designed to encourage Canada's buildings industry to design and construct a new generation of commercial buildings with exceptional levels of energy efficiency and indoor air quality.
Mr. Butterfield, one of Vancouver Island's largest developers, has spent the last decade developing showcase examples of sustainable buildings and communities throughout North America, including the creation of Civano, a community of 2,400 homes near Tuscon, Ariz. He has new town projects in the design stage in Massachusetts and Baja, Calif.
Jennifer Uncapher, a consultant with the Colorado-based Rocky Mountain Institute, a research and educational foundation established in 1982 to foster the efficient and sustainable use of resources, says green development is "on its way to becoming mainstream."
The challenge, she says, is to identify "green wash" developers who try to cash in on the trend. "Green development is more than just a retro lighting fit."
Roger Colwill, a 30-year veteran in the commercial real estate business, can tell the difference. Mr. Colwill worked as a consultant on Mr. Butterfield's Bamberton project on Vancouver Island a decade ago, a planned community designed to be one of the continent's most livable and ecologically responsible communities.
"Not one of the developers measured up to David in their commitment to things green," says Mr. Colwill of his lengthy career. "He has been consistent and made the commitment to showcase how we can be stewards of the environment."
That may be the case, but there is always a hefty profit to be made when any developer converts industrial land to a successful high-density residential development. Tim Van Alstine, chair of the James Bay Neighbourhood Environment Associate, fought the Shoal Point project to the bitter end.
"There's fabulous money to make when you're upscaling the zoning. You purchase it for next to nothing and make a hell of a whopping profit when you wrap yourself in green," Mr. Van Alstine says.
In this case, he says, "it broke the back of the neighbourhood plan." The associate wanted to reinvigorate the harbour with modern industrial projects to accommodate neighbourhood-based jobs.

Probe of developer didn't halt association with Ontario agency

Full text: An Ontario government agency was still working closely with a Woodbridge developer months after it reportedly called in forensic accountants to investigate how its staff handled a previous deal with the same developer.
Several months after Ontario Realty Corp. president Tony Miele reportedly asked forensic accountants to investigate his company's sale of public lands to Woodbridge developer Frank Gabriele, the government real-estate company was actively involved in a partnership with Mr. Gabriele to rezone and sell another provincially owned property in Aurora.
Confronted with details about the partnership yesterday, ORC vice-president Christopher Barry said the sale of the Aurora property, located on the Oak Ridges Moraine at the corner of Bloomington Road and Yonge Street, is also being investigated.
"There are a number of properties under review," Mr. Barry said. "This is one of those properties. Further steps will not be taken until the auditors have directed us to take them."
Mr. Barry would not comment on when the pending Aurora sale came under review, however, or when the ORC decided not to take "further steps."
The issue is important because, as late as January, the ORC was busy helping Mr. Gabriele obtain a severance and rezoning for the property at the Ontario Municipal Board.
As owner of the property, the ORC had appointed the Gabriele-controlled firm Landcrest Development Management to represent its interests at the OMB. Landcrest was attempting to sever and rezone the property in order to complete the sale of the land from the province to P. Gabriele and Sons, according to Landcrest lawyer Nicholas Macos.
"I don't know if I'd call it a partnership," Mr. Macos said, describing the relationship between Mr. Gabriele and the ORC. "From my own perspective I'm working for both."
Mr. Macos added that he is not certain who is paying for the legal work required to rezone and develop the land.
"I send my bills to Landcrest," he said. "I don't know what the financial details are in terms of whose obligation [the legal work] is."
In the files of the OMB, where Mr. Macos recently obtained consent to sever the property, the appellant is described as "Ontario Realty Corporation by its agent, Landcrest Development Management."
Landcrest is a Richmond Hill firm that lists Frank Gabriele of Woodbridge as its sole officer.
Mr. Gabriele is one of two developers whose spectacularly lucrative dealings with the government agency were highlighted in The Globe last week.
One year ago, he bought approximately nine hectares in Mississauga from the ORC for $1.9-million, putting $500,000 down and taking a $1.4-million mortgage from the vendor to finance the balance. In November, he sold the same raw, unimproved land for $4.4-million.
In the wake of that news, Mr. Barry said that ORC president Tony Miele had launched an investigation into the Mississauga transaction shortly after he was appointed to his position in April, 1999. (Mr. Miele had served as acting president of the provincial real-estate firm since January of that year.)
Subsequently, Mr. Miele told The Globe that he ordered an independent audit of the Mississauga deal, along with at least one other, last fall.
In January, however, his company went to the OMB seeking concessions on behalf of one of the developers that was already a prime subject of investigation.
Mr. Barry refused to describe the financial arrangement underpinning ORC co-operation with Mr. Gabriele, saying only that the deal is in abeyance. He would not say when it was called off, nor would he disclose the price or conditions of the pending sale.
The land in question comprises approximately 14 hectares on the north side of Bloomington Road.
Represented by Mr. Macos at the OMB, Landcrest and the ORC gained permission to sever it from a larger government-owned property by offering concessions to the Town of Aurora and local ratepayers.
Yesterday, however, Susan Walmer, chairwoman of the local ratepayers group, asked Management Board chairman Chris Hodgson to cancel the severance deal "until a full investigation can be completed."
Despite approving the severance, the municipal board did not grant the official plan amendment and rezoning Landcrest was seeking. Those measures would have permitted Mr. Gabriele to build houses on the site immediately.
The future of the sensitive moraine lands in southern Aurora is still under study, according to town officials. Until the ORC called off the process yesterday, all parties had expected to meet at the board this June to determine the issue.
Mr. Gabriele was not available for comment yesterday. His lawyer, Philip Macdonald, refused to discuss the matter.

Stroke of genius or Pandora's Box?

Author: Priest, Lisa

Abstract: At first pass," said Dr. Hugh Scully, president of the Canadian Medical Association, "Mr. [Ralph Klein]'s proposal looks very benign. . . . But one of the first questions that has to be asked is: Has the public-system capacity been used as well as it could be?" Certainly there is lots of extra space in Edmonton, if the Charles Camsell Hospital is any indication.

Full text: The gloves are off. This week, Ralph Klein finally unveiled his legislation to let private clinics offer surgery requiring an overnight stay. It's all above board, he says. Yet a tour of the province shows that Albertans are anything but convinced
How did this get here?" Elisabeth Ballermann asks, waving a piece of paper in the air.
Ms. Ballermann, who is on the board of Friends of Medicare, has travelled to the heartland of northern Alberta's prosperous oil-sands country to strike a blow against a provincial government plan that she believes will destroy universal health care.
The paper in her hand is a government news release that was found tucked among the flyers and the "Save Medicare Action Kit" on display at a town hall meeting.
It charges that a study the Friends of Medicare are using to point out the dangers of for-profit care is flawed and, as Ms. Ballermann reads to the audience, "has little value or relevance."
The government is keen to ensure the success of the legislation Premier Ralph Klein introduced on Thursday that would allow what has long been considered a medicare taboo -- the contracting out of some overnight surgeries to private clinics. So keen that people at the meeting assume that it has resorted to infiltrating the enemy camp.
Make no mistake about it, this is trench warfare. Television ads, paid for by the Canadian Union of Public Employees, have shown footage of the government's 1998 demolition of the Calgary General Hospital to drive home the point that Canada's most cherished social program will explode if the proposed legislation goes through.
After Mr. Klein complained about the use of "malicious information" to counter the Health Care Protection Act, also known as Bill 11, a provincial "truth squad" was formed to plead the government's case. (Later renamed the "health information panel," it now appears to have been reeled in and will go out only when requested.)
The single greatest fear about the legislation, which would see private, for-profit clinics compete for public dollars, is that it would create two levels of health care: one for the rich and another for the poor.
Yesterday, federal Health Minister Allan Rock, through his spokesman, Derek Kent, said he would not comment until he had finished reviewing the legislation.
Alberta associate health minister Gene Zwozdesky, co-chairman of the so-called truth squad, insists that there will be no hidden fees and no queue jumping.
"We want people to know fully that we will not allow private, American-style hospitals in the province," he repeatedly stressed in an interview. "We're talking about contracting out a very limited range of lower-risk surgeries which will first have to be approved by the College of Physicians and Surgeons," which regulates the province's doctors.
The final step would be the health minister's personal approval of the surgeries and all contracts would be made public and include details on how much money each facility is getting from the public purse.
But to some, such as Fort McMurray resident Maxine Copeland, now is an odd time to start saying private in the same breath as health care.
Given that Alberta is flush with oil and gas revenues, and Mr. Klein recently announced that he would pour $1-billion more into the health-care system over the next three years, some people wonder why the Premier doesn't just spend more money.
Especially since he joined with other premiers in attacking Ottawa's health-care financing after the federal budget this week. Mr. Klein said provincial leaders are demanding a meeting with Prime Minister Jean Chrétien to press for a bigger increase than $2.5-billion over four years to transfer payments to the provinces for health, education and social services.
Yet, at the same time, he wants the private sector to play a much bigger role.
Ms. Copeland told the town hall meeting that "I don't understand why he's doing this," but like many Albertans, she has her suspicions. "It's about making the rich richer. I'm proud of Canada and I'm proud of medicare."
At first glance, this town of 44,000 seems just the kind of place where Mr. Klein's plan would fly. Times are booming in the sticky sands, which boast more oil than all the known reserves in the Middle East, and it's on Reform Party turf.
But throughout the province it's difficult to get an accurate picture of what the public thinks of it all.
In January, the Friends of Medicare, a 21-year-old lobby group financed by individuals, social-justice groups and unions, released a survey showing that 52 per cent of Albertans oppose a law that would allow private, for-profit hospitals to carry out overnight surgery.
But a government survey found that 73 per cent of Albertans felt they had not received enough information about the proposal. And 59 per cent of those surveyed either strongly or somewhat agreed with the plan.
The issue consumes the airwaves. There are flyers, brochures and handouts on the plan. One Edmonton homeowner pitched a large, white bed sheet on the front lawn with "stop for-profit hospitals" written in red ink.
"There are so many groups getting organized," Mr. Zwozdesky said in an interview in his office at the Alberta Legislature in Edmonton. "As a result, there has been a lot of misinformation" about the proposal, which will include a written promise to abide by the principles of the Canada Health Act.
There will not be two kinds of care -- one for the rich and one for the poor, he said, adding that not one cent will come out of a patient's pocket for medically insured services and the government has no plans to drop any health-care services.
So why does the public seem so mistrustful? Maybe it has something to do with the history of Alberta's semi-private clinics. Perhaps private care's most visible figure is Dr. Howard Gimbel, a well-respected ophthalmologist and pioneer in cataract surgery. In 1984, he established the first eye-surgery site outside a hospital in Calgary and he was the first surgeon in Canada to use ultrasound to remove cataracts.
Until a few years ago, patients were charged a "facility fee" of about $1,000, meant to cover disposable equipment, nurses and other overhead of the clinics, while Alberta Health covered the operation, lens and anesthetist fees.
The federal government said such fees, charged by about 40 semi-private clinics of all types in Alberta, including those that do abortions, were against the Canada Health Act and created a form of two-tier care. To halt the practice, it started to levy a hefty monthly fine against the provincial government.
Initially, the Alberta government refused to budge, saying some clinics had been charging such fees for 12 years and it was unfair to start penalizing them now. Finally, in 1996, it relented and paid $3.6-million in fines, and now both the facility fees and medically insured services at all of the clinics are covered by the province.
However, in some clinics, cataract patients still pay for "extras," such as access to an off-site diagnostics lab in addition to special foldable lenses, which are not covered under medicare.
In an interview, Dr. Gimbel said contracting out to for-profit clinics should be seen as an "innovative way to achieve efficiencies and a good use of taxpayer dollars."
But a recent survey done by the Alberta branch of the Consumers Association of Canada had some disturbing findings about the contracting out of cataract surgery to private clinics. It found that the growth of such clinics increased waiting lists and out-of-pocket costs to patients.
In Calgary, where virtually all eye surgery is contracted out to private clinics, patients wait 16 to 24 weeks for a cataract operation, said Wendy Armstrong, the report's author.
(The current wait for a cataract removal at Gimbel Eye Centre is about 12 months because patients from all over the province seek his services, Dr. Gimbel said.)
In Edmonton, where 80 per cent of the work is done in public facilities, patients wait five to seven weeks. One of the shortest waits is in Lethbridge, where all cataract surgeries are done in public hospitals and patients queue for an average of four to seven weeks.
The eye-care issue flared up again this week when Alberta Health Minister Halvar Jonson said he would ask the College of Physicians and Surgeons to investigate a CBC-TV report that a Calgary man with cataracts paid a Gimbel clinic $3,800 for an uninsured procedure that would correct his vision problems and also happened to remove his cataracts in the process.
However, college registrar Larry Ohlhauser said Mr. Jonson has not yet asked him for a review.
Karen Gimbel, president and chief executive officer of Gimbel Eye Centre, said she welcomes a probe, adding that "no one is going to find we've done anything outside of the Canada Health Act."
The Alberta government also said its plan is within the Canada Health Act, and it is merely about finding a new way to deliver some surgical services efficiently to patients, hopefully with shorter waiting lists.
Exactly which surgeries will be contracted out have yet to be determined, but Mr. Zwozdesky suggested hernia repairs, some ear, nose and throat procedures (such as ear tubes in children) and elbow, knee and shoulder replacement could be candidates.
He said that "24-hour acute care, transplants, heart surgery -- those things will not be part of this plan," which is being driven by unprecedented population growth, an aging population and an influx of people into Alberta.
"If we unclog some of the waiting lists, every one will benefit."
This is the third time that Mr. Klein, who successfully privatized liquor stores and the motor-vehicle registry, has tried to expand the private sector's role in health care.
In March, 1998, the government introduced Bill 37, which would have given the health minister the authority to approve "alternative-treatment" facilities. Albertans saw the bill as a move toward private, for-profit hospitals and after an outcry, it was withdrawn.
That fall, Bill 37 was reintroduced and withdrawn again after public opposition.
"Why change it, if it ain't broke," asked Richard Plain, a University of Alberta health economist, who says the Premier "is opening up Pandora's Box." Once private clinics start overnight surgeries, he argues, the entire system could land in entrepreneurial hands.
"At first pass," said Dr. Hugh Scully, president of the Canadian Medical Association, "Mr. Klein's proposal looks very benign. . . . But one of the first questions that has to be asked is: Has the public-system capacity been used as well as it could be?" Certainly there is lots of extra space in Edmonton, if the Charles Camsell Hospital is any indication. Off and on since it closed in 1996, the Alberta government has been trying to unload the empty 7½-storey hospital with a current price tag of $5.9-million. Real-estate agent Garf Bennett said the "great building" would be suitable as a seniors home.
Although there is interest, there are no takers in what may be illustrative of the resistance to for-profit medicine in the capital.
The story is quite different in a buoyant Calgary, whose population climbs by about 30,000 a year. Even so, one major hospital has been destroyed and two others have been sold.
Brothers Peter Huang, an ophthalmologist, and Ian Huang, an ear, nose and throat specialist, purchased the 180-bed Holy Cross Hospital through their corporation, Enterprise Universal Inc., in 1997. They paid $4.5-million after the hospital had been closed by the Calgary Regional Health Authority.
Even though the authority stripped the hospital of all medical equipment, including $40-million worth of operating-room equipment installed shortly before the closing, the $4.5-million price tag seemed low to some. The Huangs refused repeated requests for an interview.
Also in Calgary, the former Grace Hospital, closed in 1995, is now home to Health Resource Group Inc., which operates its surgery clinic on its third floor. It is considered ready to roll on overnight surgeries if Mr. Klein's proposal goes through.
In fact, Health Resource Group applied to the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1997 for approval to open the first, for-profit clinic to do overnight surgeries in Canada, but the request was denied. It applied a second time in 1998, also without success.
The college was asked once again in the summer of 1999 to approve standards for "long-stay, non-hospital surgical facilities," but it declined in the absence of a political decision.
"We've got 37 empty beds," said Tom Saunders, president and chief executive officer of Health Resource Group, which currently does day surgeries.
If the provincial plan goes through, "it would allow us to be able to fill those beds and to provide surgery to out-of-country patients. To do a total hip replacement in the States is four or five times the cost in Canada," Mr. Saunders said in an interview. "This plan would help take off some of the burden from the health-care system."
Meanwhile, Surgical Centres Inc. has three sites in Calgary and one in Edmonton where many surgeries, including knee arthroscopes, vasectomies, ear-tube implants for children and cataract operations, are performed.
Anesthetist Mohamed Nanji, the company's president and chief executive officer, said surgery volumes have doubled over the past two years at the Calgary clinics, 65 per cent of whose operations are covered under the health insurance plan. The rest is cosmetic surgery and other uninsured services.
"We are efficient, cost-effective and far cheaper than the hospital," Dr. Nanji said, adding that contracting out overnight surgeries is not "the thin edge of the wedge. It would be irresponsible [for the government] not to look at the cheaper rate."
And that's how the Alberta government sees it. Not only will contracting out mean the best service to patients, who are having operations done by skilled surgeons, it could also be less expensive and more efficient, it says.
But it has been a constant uphill battle for a determined Mr. Klein. For every benefit he sees in contracting out, there are academics, health-care analysts and lobby groups who say otherwise.
Kevin Taft, who co-wrote a report published by the Parkland Institute, a left-of-centre University of Alberta research organization, said Albertans "will not benefit from the Klein government's proposal, and will likely suffer."
Mr. Taft just finished travelling with Friends of Medicare chairwoman Christine Burdett, giving presentations to residents in nine towns and cities across the province -- a total crowd of about 2,000 people.
If the proposal goes through, there is "clear evidence that waiting lists will lengthen, costs will rise and the general public will be worse off," he said.
One of the greatest unknowns is what the Americans will do. Some believe that the legislation is a form of welcome mat for giant U.S. health maintenance organizations that will set up in Canada and potentially edge everyone else out of the medical system.
Barry Appleton, who specializes in international trade law, said that once Mr. Klein's plan goes through, it can't be undone.
"No one would have cared about NAFTA if it was 10 years ago," Mr. Appleton said in a telephone interview from Toronto. "Now, Canada looks like a good market. The whole Canadian market is like one, good-sized U.S. state. We're very appetizing. He's [Mr. Klein] completely wrong if he doesn't think NAFTA will have an impact.
"The fact is, this isn't part of public opinion, it's a question of law."
Morris Barer, director of the Centre for Health Services and Policy Research at University of British Columbia, said that if the Alberta plan goes through, other provinces will follow suit.
"Every one will want to try it," Mr. Barer said. "Once you start opening it up, you can't get back."
But Mr. Zwozdesky, co-chairman of the truth squad, said that when the public sees it in law, he thinks they will be all for it because most of the fears will be answered.
"We need to be proactive and have more, better and faster services to meet patients' needs," he said.
The battle over the government's plan will escalate another notch next week, when the province mails a copy of Bill 11 to every household in Alberta.
But there are limits to what Mr. Klein and his so-called truth squad will go to win this fight.
By the end of the Friends of Medicare meeting last week, a local resident had quietly pulled Ms. Ballermann aside and admitted to putting the news release there, just to let every one know what the government had been up to.
So much for secret agents and government infiltrations. Lisa Priest reports on health care for The Globe and Mail.
INSURANCE HISTORY
1919: Mackenzie King makes the first promise to build a form of national health insurance. 1946: Saskatchewan's Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, the political party of Tommy Douglas, passes the Hospitalization Act, which provides public insurance for hospital care. 1948: The federal government implements the National Health Grant Program, almost all of which goes to construct hospitals. 1957: Parliament passes the Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act, which provides money to any province that creates its own hospital insurance program.
Provinces have to provide comprehensive, universal care that is reasonably accessible to all residents and portable enough that citizens from one province can be covered for medical services they receive in other provinces.
Eventually, all provinces join the program and Ottawa picks up the tab for half of the cost of services to hospitals. However, costs for treating patients in doctors' offices are not covered. 1962: Tommy Douglas leads the way again by devising the Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act, angering physicians and prompting 90 per cent of them to go on strike. However, Mr. Douglas prevails and Saskatchewan becomes the first province -- and the first jurisdiction in North America -- to have a tax-supported universal insurance program. 1977: Parliament passes the Established Programs Financing Act, which kills the 50-50 split in funding between the federal government and provinces. In its place, Ottawa provides block funding for health and post-education programs, which allows it to control the increase of its medicare spending. However, the act contains a clause preventing the federal government from reducing payments to any province or group of provinces without their consent before 1982. Early to mid-1980s: Concerns surface that patients without cash can't get the same access to doctors who are "extra-billing" their patients. Although governments and provincial medical associations negotiated fees for services, they aren't engraved in stone and doctors are able to charge extra. 1984: Extra-billing is abolished by the Canada Health Act, which penalizes any province that allows physicians to charge above the negotiated fee. Lisa Priest
THE PRIVATE PLAYERS
Gimbel Eye Centre: In1984, ophthalmologist Howard Gimbel established Alberta's first eye-surgery clinic outside a hospital (he also was the first surgeon in Canada to use ultrasound to remove cataracts). Though cataract operations are covered under Alberta Health, patients pay extra if they want access to an off-site diagnostics laboratory or special lenses Dr. Gimbel offers that aren't covered by medicare.
He also established Gimbel Vision International Inc., a public company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which owns or works with surgical centres throughout the Americas and Asia. Health Resource Group Inc: Incorporated in 1996, Health Resource Group leases the third floor of what was Calgary's Grace Hospital, which was closed during cutbacks.
In 1997, it received full accreditation as a day-surgery facility, which triggered a $10-million investment. However, it has been turned down three times in its bid to provide overnight surgical stays.
If Premier Ralph Klein's plan flies, Health Resource Group would specialize in shoulder, knee and hip replacements -- operations that now require excessively long waits, according to president Tom Saunders. Enterprise Universal Inc: Run by publicity-shy doctors Peter and Ian Huang, the company bought the 180-bed Holy Cross Hospital in southwest Calgary for $4.5-million in 1998 to use for condominiums and health services. The hospital had been closed in 1996 by the Calgary Regional Health Authority, which awarded Enterprise Universal a contract to perform eye, nose, throat and foot operations. Surgical Centres Inc: This 12-year-old company operates three clinics in Calgary and one in Edmonton that provide many day surgeries, including cataract operations, vasectomies and hernia repairs. Roughly 65 per cent of its business is covered through Alberta Health. Business is thriving, but president and chief executive officer Mohamed Nanji said he has no interest in expanding to include overnight stays. CommunityFirst Health Centres: Developer Fred Johnston plans to invest $100-million in nine "superclinics" in the Calgary area, with the first expected to open next January. "They will be a large-scale version of walk-in clinics," with house physicians, X-ray technicians and various specialists, including those in gynecology and pediatrics, he said. Mr. Johnston is not planning to offer overnight accommodation, but others have expressed interest in building such a facility near his clinics.

Abstract: Now, 106 of the CREA's 114 boards list properties on the Net, as do hundreds of real estate brokers, agents and individuals who use Web pages and e-mail to sell homes. Surfers can examine more than 250,000 Canadian properties and thousands of others around the globe, says Peter Simpson, manager of multiple listing service research and development for the Canadian Real Estate Association in Ottawa.

Full text: Buyers are hitting the clicks instead of the bricks, saving time finding home, sweet home
When Tom Cox relocated to Burlington, Vt., from Toronto in 1995, his search for a home for his family lasted three weeks. Before finding the right place, he drove hundreds of kilometres, traipsed through 26 open houses and spent hours on the telephone describing properties to his wife Dianne, who was still in Ontario.
"It was exhausting," he recalls.
Last fall, when Mr. Cox landed a job in Kanata, Ont., the couple's house hunt was far simpler: They bought a home less than 48 hours after touring their first open house, and by the time their offer was accepted, they knew the name of their children's school, how long it would take Mr. Cox to get to work, and where the nearest building-supply store was located.
Pretty impressive, considering that a month earlier the couple knew nothing about house prices, neighborhoods, schools and the various styles of homes that were available in the Ottawa suburb where they purchased a 2,500-square-foot home.
Like a growing number of buyers, the Coxes were able to find a home and make a smooth transition into a new city by doing much of their research on the Internet, which in the past five years has become a hot tool for real estate agents and consumers.
From their home computer in Vermont, the Coxes searched the Ottawa area for a community that suited their lifestyle, studied house prices, neighbourhoods and bus schedules, lined up a real estate agent, and viewed colour photographs of Kanata and dozens of homes.
By visiting the city's Web site, they pinpointed the closest shopping centres and discovered they'd be living a few minutes from the Corel Centre, home of the National Hockey League Ottawa Senators. They even used the Internet to register their children in school and sign up for utilities.
"The Internet gave me real-time data that I could use, instead of having to wait for it to arrive in the mail," says Mr. Cox, a Hamilton, Ont., native who moved his family back to Ontario after landing a job as director of strategic marketing for Tundra Semiconductor Corp. in Kanata.
In early 1995, when real estate listings were first posted on the Internet, buyers could examine a few thousand homes advertised by a smattering of real estate companies. Less than a year later, electronic listings swelled to more than 20,000 when the Canadian Real Estate Association www.mls.ca launched a pilot project involving member boards in Calgary, Halifax, Oakville, Ont. and Barrie, Ont.
Now, 106 of the CREA's 114 boards list properties on the Net, as do hundreds of real estate brokers, agents and individuals who use Web pages and e-mail to sell homes. Surfers can examine more than 250,000 Canadian properties and thousands of others around the globe, says Peter Simpson, manager of multiple listing service research and development for the Canadian Real Estate Association in Ottawa. The CREA site can link browsers to between 9,000 and 11,000 properties in Ottawa, 25,000 in the Toronto area, and more than 2,000 in Halifax.
No one knows how many people use the Net to buy or sell homes , but based on the increase in visitors to Canadian real estate Web sites, it's in the thousands. The CREA site, which has more than 90 per cent of all homes listed on the Multiple Listing Service, receives about 20,000 visits a day, nearly four times as many as at this time last year. In 1999 , about 672,000 visits were registered on the Real Estate Board of Ottawa-Carleton Web site at www.ottawarealestate.org , eight times as many as in 1996.
This surge in electronic researching and shopping for homes has some agents giving the Internet direct credit for closing deals on as many as half the homes they sell.
It's attributable in large measure to the phenomenal increase in the number of Canadians connected to the Net, real estate officials say. In 1998, there were 4.3 million households on-line, 24.6 per cent more than in 1997, according to Statistics Canada. Another factor is that with more real estate boards and agents connected, 97 per cent of all listings held by licensed realtors in Canada can be viewed electronically, says Mr. Simpson of CREA. By comparison, someone using newspaper ads to shop for a home has access to only 30 per cent of all homes currently listed, says Don Kottick, vice-president of technology and business development for the Toronto Real Estate Board.
Equally responsible for increased Internet use in the real estate industry are the improved service and user friendliness of the Web. Graphics have been fine-tuned, more tools have been added and software has been upgraded. At the same time, computer users have installed faster modems and Internet service providers have greatly increased the speed at which data can be found and retrieved.
When the first listings went electronic, buyers were able to view photographs and listing information 24 hours a day, narrow their search to a handful of specific houses and contact an agent by E-mail, but only in certain communities.
Now, information on homes in almost every corner of the country can be researched and photographs are better quality and more plentiful. Browsers see as many as 20 pictures for each listing, and depending on the site, they're given a 360-degree view of a room or a property and can move the camera up and down and zoom in or out on various features such as fireplaces, even homes across the street.
The whole process is speedier than ever: Pages of information that once took up to two minutes to appear on a computer screen often arrive instantaneously, while photographs that used to appear in five minutes show up in less than 60 seconds. On the Real Estate Board of Ottawa-Carleton site, agent and past board president Chris Hoare estimates it takes five to seven minutes to examine 10 homes compared with 15 minutes or more five years ago.
HOW TO RESEARCH A MOVE ON-LINE
Use an Internet search engine to link to educational information about buying homes found on Web sites such as the Ontario Real Estate Association www.orea.com or local board sites like the Calgary Real Estate Boardwww.creb.ab.ca . Before shopping, have money preapproved so you can pounce when you find a home. Links to lenders are found on most real estate Web sites, or at www.canadamortgage.com , a national on-line mortgage system with links to more than 40 financial institutions. Pinpoint your search by starting with a "gateway" site, such as the Canadian Real Estate Association www.mls.ca , where you can visit provinces, cities and neighbourhoods and find information and photographs about specific homes that meet your needs. Find information about schools, public transit, shopping, even the mayor's name, at sites such as www.ottawa.com or www.montreal.com , where you can read local newspapers, check transit schedules and link with schools. Before you hire an agent, check out credentials by surfing to his or her company or personal Web site, or by checking with independent advisers who recommend experienced home sellers, such as veteran industry analyst Ozzie Jurock www.jurock.com in British Columbia. Don't hire an agent until you have met, or spoken on the telephone. Use the Internet to communicate with your agent but don't expect to send offers and counter-offers electronically. Paperwork must be signed and initialled, so this part of negotiations must still be done in person or by fax. Once you've inked a deal, contact cable and telephone service providers, lawyers and movers via links found on agent or real estate board Web sites, or on the providers' own sites. Randy Ray

Abstract: The case, he says, was eventually thrown out of court. "When you're successful, you're a target," says [Kenny Rogers], his blue-green eyes growing cold. "What I did wasn't wrong. Who I did it with was wrong. It was blackmail, and it didn't work. That's history."

Full text: T he perfect place to lunch Kenny Rogers would be Kenny Rogers Roasters. Alas, the last of his chicken-and-biscuits restaurants in Toronto has shut down and the chain is in bankruptcy protection.
Anyway, it's 3 p.m. He's just finished a photo session at a local Wal-Mart. And his private bus is leaving for Kitchener, Ont. So we settle for iced tea and a bowl of lobster bisque at the Sutton Place Hotel. "I'll get some chicken wings on the bus," says the country crooner, whose voice sounds like he gargles gravel and honey.
Rogers once filled giant arenas in Dallas and Atlanta. These days, he's reduced to playing Ontario hot spots like Barrie, North Bay and Orillia's CasinoRama. Hence the bus for Kitchener.
"I still enjoy performing. I just hate getting there. But once I walk on stage, there's no place I'd rather be," says Rogers, who is dressed in a ribbed T-shirt and a grey three-piece suit.
For part of the 1980s, he was the highest-paid singer in the world. In all, he has sold 100 million albums, as much as Celine Dion. But these days, he mostly sells his albums on the Home Shopping Cable Network, he doesn't get much air play and he hasn't had a mega-hit in nine years. His 1999 album, She Rides Wild Horses , made No. 6 on the country charts, his highest debut in more than 15 years.
At lunch, he pours two bags of Sweet 'N Low into his iced tea, takes a sip and crunches the ice between his white, white teeth. "What kind of interview is this where you care that I use two bags of Sweet 'N Low?" he demands.
The kind where he's asked if five marriages are a lot.
"Not when you're my age," says Rogers, who is 61.
His sideburns are white. But his mane, which curls around his collar, is reddish brown. He dyes it, he says, to keep his hair from disappearing when he shoots a music video. His skin is a matching mahogany, thanks to a tanning bed he keeps at home.
Rogers has nearly recovered from a phone-sex scandal that derailed his image as a wholesome, hurtin' superstar who didn't even smoke or drink. In 1992, three Dallas women sued him for millions, alleging he caused them emotional distress. Unfortunately for him, they had tapes. Even more unfortunately, A Current Affair broadcast excerpts.
The fantasies, like his hit songs, turned out to be firmly middle-of-the-road. Instead of bestiality, Rogers can be heard chatting about filmy lingerie, tans and semen disguised as massage oil.
The case, he says, was eventually thrown out of court. "When you're successful, you're a target," says Rogers, his blue-green eyes growing cold. "What I did wasn't wrong. Who I did it with was wrong. It was blackmail, and it didn't work. That's history."
The lawsuits helped destroy what was left of his fourth marriage. Incessant touring, he admits, didn't help. Absenteeism also wrecked his relationships -- since mended -- with his first two children. (He's closest to his third and youngest child, Christopher, now 18.)
"This job is not conducive to a good marriage. I've learned that I take her everywhere with me." By "her," he means his fifth wife, Wanda Miller, a former restaurant hostess 28 years his junior. (She skipped this particular Ontario bus tour, he explains, because her twin sister is recovering from surgery.)
Rogers grew up in a grimy Houston housing project. He was the fourth of eight kids of an alcoholic shipyard worker who played a mean fiddle. When Rogers was 13 and bedridden with the measles, he taught himself the guitar. A few years later, he recorded Crazy Feeling . It sold a million copies.
Rogers wanted to drop out immediately. Under pressure from his folks, he finished high school, the first in his family to do so, and went on to university. But he quit after a year to join a jazz trio, then a folk group and finally a psychedelic rock band.
In 1976, he re-invented himself as a country singer. Three years later, his annual income was $7-million. Within a few years, he was earning $20-million a year, then $30-million.
He diversified into real estate, a 2-per-cent share of the Golden Nugget Casino in Las Vegas and that roast-chicken chain. Mindful of his past, he also did charity work for public housing.
He also spent lavishly. He bought a yacht, a yellow Rolls-Royce and a 35-room Beverly Hills mansion with a 13-car garage. Along the way, he acquired three planes, including one outfitted in velvet, wood and brass to resemble a railroad gambling car -- homage to his mega-hit, The Gambler .
Now, he's just sold off the last plane. He drives a Jeep. And he's selling his current home in Athens, Ga., a 1,200-acre farm with its own 18-hole golf course, equestrian centre and two tennis courts. And although his restaurant chain is in trouble, he still controls his own recording label, Dreamcatcher Entertainment.
Rogers once said he was afraid of "being old, alone and broke." He says he's still that way. "Isn't everybody? That's the common denominator we all have. That's why country music is accepted all around the world."
Rogers hopes he won't be alone when he's 80. He's also revised his opinion of aging. "I don't mind getting old because the alternative is dying young."
He's philosophical about falling out of fashion. "When you set a style or a trend, when the trend changes, you're not the trend. I try not to take it personally. I was lucky enough to have my turn. The trick in this business is to be able to sustain through the lows."
Yes, indeed, the sweet n' lows.

Romance and rubber gloves

Author: Allemang, John

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/romance-rubber-gloves/docview/384343634/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: In tonight's breezy first episode, 30-year-old Fay (Catherine McCormack) decides it's time to have a baby. It's not that she desperately wants to be domesticated: Just the sight of her contentedly pregnant relatives makes her gag. Nor does she long to have a meaningful relationship, let alone be a wife -- "Blokes are a total waste of time." And as for kids, it's only through sheer force of will that she can make herself coo at a helpless little one.

Full text: What's love got to do with it? The title of WTN's latest British import may read Love in the 21st Century (tonight at 10:30 p.m.), but the urges that drive the new era's women are much more self-serving.
The one-word titles of the six half-hour episodes say it all: Reproduction, Threesomes, Masturbation, Fantasies, Commitment and Toyboys. This is a series in the influential tradition of Sex and the City that shows modern women looking after their own needs first. Self-gratification takes pride of place.
In tonight's breezy first episode, 30-year-old Fay (Catherine McCormack) decides it's time to have a baby. It's not that she desperately wants to be domesticated: Just the sight of her contentedly pregnant relatives makes her gag. Nor does she long to have a meaningful relationship, let alone be a wife -- "Blokes are a total waste of time." And as for kids, it's only through sheer force of will that she can make herself coo at a helpless little one.
But all that's incidental. Reproduction at this stage in female sexual history is really about taking control and asserting independence. Marching proudly through an unnaturally bright and sunny version of Manchester -- no stereotypical British gloom in the 21st century -- Fay strides into the city's lesbian resource centre for all her pregnancy needs.
Well not quite all. Sperm jars, rubber gloves, turkey baster -- check. Handy advice to use only non-spermicidal condoms. (This new-era love is a highly technical business.) The deterrent of the lesbian resource person's own child, who's a product of the sperm bank's last-minute-club sell-off ("Don't leave it till too late like we did").
But there's still the age-old problem of a sperm donor, a.k.a. a man. Fay's a lusty hetero who isn't going to let the advances in reproductive technology get in the way of a good time. Knowing she wants to become pregnant allows her to be even freer in finding pleasure, and after each sperm-collecting encounter she rates her prospects on a vast chart, with gold stars to the top performers in such crucial categories as charm, honesty, hygiene and penis.
And then things start to go badly wrong, turning Love in the 21st Century into a kind of comic Twilight Zone . Having basted herself with her unsuspecting winner's donation, she falls in love with him, or at least in lust. Bad enough that she's broken her vow never to get attached to a guy: Now she has to reveal she's not a classy downtown dame like the Sex and the City professionals but just the assistant fryer in a low-rent fish-and-chip emporium.
This is a self-conscious British sex comedy, after all, and even with a brassy Latin soundtrack, there's no escaping the complications of class and guilt and retribution. All the episodes of Love in the 21st Century come with an inbuilt warning that women liberate their desires at their peril. In next week's more sombre second episode, for example, the girlie urges that makes two best friends cruise by fire stations to eye the talent turn self-destructive when they both fall for the same guy.
It's one of the odd pleasures of being Canadian that we have access to this very British series, and can even understand most of the muttered slang. For our American brothers and sisters, it's all too foreign. While recognizing the instant appeal of pretty young women letting themselves go, the U.S. networks aren't prepared to accommodate themselves to outsiders, however horny.
But desperate for original ideas, they're now plundering Britain for new series, buying up the plots and formats of established shows, and then hurrying back to Hollywood to remake them for American audiences with American stars. (As if Vanity Fair 'sNatasha Little catching Horatio Hornblower 'sIoan Gruffudd in the act of masturbation during episode three just doesn't cut it.)
Columbia TriStar studios has dutifully bought Love in the 21st Century ,and so you can expect the Americanized, centrally heated version of these uncomfortably liberated women sometime before the new century turns old. Watch the British version now, so that you'll know what the Americans had to leave out. FINE TUNING The Adventures of Pete & Pete. This engaging comedy series, a kind of real-life cartoon about suburban life, ran from 1993 to 1995 on the U.S. children's channel Nickelodeon, and finally makes its Canadian debut tonight. Think of it as The Wonder Years crossed with Malcolm in the Middle , and add a little self-conscious hipness from Chris Elliot's Get a Life . ( Family, 6 p.m. ) the fifth estate: Ty Conn.

Tonight, McIntyre talks about their relationship, and considers the fate of the man he tried to help. ( CBC, 8 p.m. ) In Search of the African Queen.

Full text:   Developers target the winners of the 'new economy,' high-tech urbanites enamoured with industrial chic
Loft living no longer means what it used to.
Long gone are the days when impoverished New York artists, desperate for large, cheap space, turned rundown cast-iron buildings in SoHo into multi-purpose lofts. They may have been grungy, but they were as authentic as the working-class culture that thrived in the industrial buildings a century earlier.
Much has changed since the early 1960s, when New York became the first noted case of gentrification by loft-dwellers, an East Coast phenomenon that swept westward.
Today, in a finite world of convertible warehouses, real estate developers keen to cash in on loftomania are trying to recreate the old magic in brand-new buildings. Their target market? The winners of the "new economy," high-tech urbanites enamoured with industrial chic.
"Some are called lofts, but they're just glorified condos. Some buyers probably don't know the difference," says Katherine Stone, host of the television show Lofty Ideas on the Home and Garden specialty channel, which examines trends in the loft market.
Original lofts, built for non-residential use, have all the markers of their rugged, industrial past: up to 16-foot ceilings, concrete floors, giant warehouse windows and wooden beams.
"The challenge is whether you can find a building that's convertible," says Kathy Kinnear, president of the Toronto-based Cresford Developments.
New buildings, which are cheaper to build, rarely surpass the 12-foot ceiling threshold. Industrial-style windows, exposed brick, faux-beams are typical. Some apartments with a mezzanine bedroom are marketed as lofts.
"High ceilings is the one thing they can duplicate. You get the volume, but of course, you don't get the character," Ms. Kinnear says. "The word loft has become really broadly used. It's a trendy word right now."
When developers do find a run-down warehouse in a gritty urban district and convert the rare gem into trendy lofts in a revitalized neighbourhood, its authenticity is the cornerstone of the marketing pitch.
In other words, developers are engaged in a war of words. History gives one side the upper hand.
Take, for example, Cresford Developments' transformation of the Robert Simpson Mail Order Catalogue building into the Merchandise Building Original Lofts. "Always buy the original," states the marketing material of one of the city's industrial "jewels" built in early 20th-century Toronto.
Ms. Kinnear adds, "It's a historical building, it's a landmark building. It's a beautiful industrial icon."
Real estate developer Craig Callan-Jones works in an even more restrictive market in Ottawa, where there is a small inventory of convertible historical warehouses. Mr. Callan-Jones, a loft specialist, admits the marketing pitch for his newest project, the conversion of an industrial building about 100 years old, is "a little over the top."
But it stands out among the new developments. Located in "a historic working neighbourhood, with roots dating back to Ottawa's rough-and-tumble lumber years . . . it's not pre-packaged, pretentious nor predictable," reads the marketing material of this "industrial-era jewel."
"Each space draws power from the history of its elements: huge beams, crafted from centuries-old trees that thrived in ancient forests long before the first steel axe blade rang out; exposed clay bricks baked in vanished local yards," the material states.
"People want the look," Mr. Callan-Jones says. "It's a tremendous urban lifestyle because of the volume of space."
Robin Fyfe, co-owner of the Ottawa-based Routeburn Urban Development, was banking on it when he built the city's first brand-new lofts to serve Ottawa's "new aristocracy," the high-tech professional with disposable income.
"What was incredibly special and unique was that it was new," Mr. Fyfe says of the first project. "At the time, the industry thought we were crazy."
Today, the brand-new loft pitch is increasingly common. So is the ever-expansive definition of the authentic loft. For example, Routeburn's conversion of a 30-year-old office building is marketed as "Real lofts at 120 Holland."
Stan Sipos, president of Dynam Developments, hit a similar snag in Victoria, B.C. "There are no buildings here."
Yet, Victorians are "crying out for innovative design. Conventional buildings are on every corner. There are a lot of people out there who want a funky space to live in," Mr. Sipos says.
Dynam has just completed its first brand-new loft building, modelled on Toronto's original lofts and marketed as "New York-style warehouse lofts."
The sheet metal siding gives it the desired warehouse look on the exterior. High ceilings, polished concrete floors, wooden beams and exposed sprinklers "give it an industrial feel," Mr. Sipos says.
The "big and boxy" building is called the Edge, "because you're just too cool to live anywhere else," states the marketing material.
Despite attempts to recreate the warehouse look, some purchasers will never go for the modern reincarnation of urban gems. "They are looking for the real thing. People often buy because of the feeling they get. You can't describe authenticity," says Cathy Grant, vice-president of the Vancouver-based Maverick Real Estate Corp., which markets both new and authentic lofts.
The problem, says Ms. Grant, is the aging warehouse with 16- to 18-feet ceilings, real brick and beams is nearly extinct. "That creature just doesn't exist any more."

Full text: The posh Toronto district has a little-known underbelly that no one talked about until a man was stabbed to death there last month
At 3 o'clock on a Saturday morning last fall, two men in their early 20s appeared at the entrance of a Yorkville nightclub in midtown Toronto. They asked to go inside to search for their girlfriends. The doorman said they would have to pay the $10 cover charge first.
The two refused, a fight ensued and the doorman was shot in the stomach. By the time police arrived, the club was empty except for its staff.
All but ignored by the media, the shooting evoked little public response.
Five months later, a man was accosted not far from the club while walking down a well-travelled, cobbled laneway to a restaurant. He was stabbed and, unlike the doorman, eventually bled to death.
This time, the city was shocked. How could something like this happen in Yorkville, with its high-priced boutiques, upscale restaurants and a history as rich as many of its residents?
Death is bound to alarm a community, but close observers of the famous district say the killing should not have been such a big surprise. After the sun goes down, they say, Yorkville's narrow streets can be anything but peaceful. The past 18 months has seen a string of unrelated attacks, mostly shootings, that have gone unsolved and drawn little attention, partly because few talk about the district's seamy side.
"In Yorkville, there is a conspiracy of silence," long-time club manager Boris Khaimovich says. "Yorkville never gets a bad rap. Everyone thinks it's quaint." The Jan. 31 stabbing death of John Francis Garrish, 38, on Old York Lane near Remys Restaurant capped a series of violent outbursts, often linked with the clubs that dot the area and attract patrons until the early-morning hours. Here is a sampling:
* On Nov. 28, at 3:30 a.m., a man in his late 20s was refused entry to Ivory Supper Club on Yorkville Avenue and told the doorman, "I'll be back. I'm going to get my gun." He returned about 10 minutes later and fired five shots from the street into the club's window.
* On Sept. 25, the doorman of the Infinity Nightclub (now Bubbles) was shot after asking two men to pay the cover before letting them in.
* On Aug. 9, bullets were fired into the Starbucks coffee shop on Yorkville Avenue during a late-night drive-by shooting. A former Yorkville waitress said the gunman was known to many in the area and had been sitting at one of the local bars 20 minutes earlier. Panhandler Brian Davis says he was almost killed. "The guy . . . emptied the whole clip into the window. The bullets went whizzing right by my head, I fell on the ground."
* At 1:10 a.m. on July 18, 1998, a man carrying a gun in his right hand walked along Yorkville Avenue and stood outside the Statik Nightclub, staring at the club. The man, who wore a black hat covering part of his face, yelled, "Hey, yo," to a group of waiting patrons and then fired four shots in their direction. The district has adopted several different personas since the Village of Yorkville was founded in 1830 by entrepreneur Joseph Bloor.
By the middle of the 20th century, Yorkville had turned bohemian. In the 1960s, when marijuana was the drug of choice, Joni Mitchell and Neil Young sang in low-rent folk clubs.
A decade later, Yorkville began evolving into a metaphor for Toronto chic. It has also developed a split personality. By day, it remains the upscale shopping mecca -- clean, respectable, awash in money.
Rents have doubled to $50 a square foot today from about $25 eight years ago, and commercial vacancies are few and far between, real-estate broker Sam Wygodny says. "This area contains some of the best stores in the world, mixed in with very hard-working, independent business people."
But by night, it is an altogether different neighbourhood: Wander through some of the late-night bars and clubs and a discernible crime culture is evident. Yorkville's underworld is easy to spot when it comes out to play.
"It's a well-known fact," says Detective Sergeant Mike Hovey of Toronto Police, who specializes in organized crime. "High rollers go to Yorkville from all over."
On any given night, expensive cars cruise Yorkville Avenue and Cumberland Street, the area's two main drags, then abruptly peel away into the night. Neon-lit massage parlours have proliferated, often in the guise of beauty salons.
By every estimate, Yorkville is also the place to go for cocaine. "For a place that purports to be a high-end area of Toronto, there are a lot of drugs and a much higher incidence of violence than you'd expect," says Staff Sergeant Bob Ellis, who is in charge of foot patrols for 52 Division, which includes Yorkville.
"I haven't identified any bars down there [in the entertainment district] where the drugs are flowing like they are in Yorkville."
The ethnic mix is as cosmopolitan as Toronto. In one bar, hard-faced men with Eastern European accents mingle with flashily dressed Jamaicans, Italians and Colombians. Well-heeled bikers rub shoulders with high-priced call girls.
On one recent evening, a steady trickle of tough-looking visitors made its way to the bar's upstairs area, where a diminutive figure and his entourage of muscle men and young women held court around the pool table, eyeing strangers suspiciously.
The man vanished for a moment into a washroom cubicle with one of his clients. They emerged shortly afterward, laughing. The man stepped up to the bar, casually pulled out a fat roll of cash and counted it.
It's familiar a scene that has played out over and over for the past 10 years, says club impresario Charles Khabouth, who used to own several clubs and bars in the area, including Ivory Supper Club, Boa café, Skorpio nightclub and Acrobat restaurant.
"Hang around Yorkville for a couple of nights and you'll figure out who's involved," he says.
Many residents and merchants say they are fed up with watching the erosion of their beloved neighbourhood, traditionally viewed as the cultural and social centre of Toronto. Where, they ask, are the police?
Mark Breslin, owner of Yuk Yuk's comedy club, where tourists and locals flock to see famous and soon-to-be famous comics such as Jim Carrey and Mike Myers, moved his club out of Yorkville in 1993 because he says the area has become too dangerous.
"Anything goes in Yorkville because there is no control over the area," says Mr. Breslin, who also has lived there for two decades but now plans to move. He says he has become used to being kept awake by music from the clubs until 3 or 4 a.m., and from his apartment he has heard gunshots on several occasions.
"It's a miracle the residents have been mercifully spared from being shot."
Area booster Bud Sugarman, a decorator who has lived and worked in Yorkville since 1947, says a greater police presence, specifically more foot patrols, is needed greatly.
Police are rarely, if ever, seen in the area, Mr. Khabouth adds. He moved his business out of Yorkville last year and refuses to return, mainly because he is afraid of being shot.
"At Ivory, I had two shootings when I was there," he says. "One time, a firebomb was thrown in through a window and did a couple of hundred thousand dollars in damage. It happened because we threw out people who didn't belong."
During that shooting, Mr. Khabouth says police took 20 minutes to respond to his 911 call. When a patrol car finally did arrive, the officer "stayed inside for at least 10 minutes as I pounded on his window to do something. He was afraid. There was a huge brawl outside the club."
Glen McLaren, a cab driver who has lived and worked in Yorkville for the past 20 years, now refuses to drive down the posh, boutique-lined streets after 2 a.m., when club goers are emptying into the streets. "The warmer it gets, the crazier it gets," he says. "I prefer to stay away."
During the day, one uniformed officer is assigned to patrol what is termed Area 5204, a few square blocks bounded by Yonge Street, Avenue Road, Davenport Road and Bloor Street. At night, the presence is supposed to double.
Yet over the course of several evenings spent in Yorkville by two reporters, not a police officer was to be seen.
"You'll see police driving past, but not walking around," says Ross Karayianni, proprietor of Brave Heart's Medieval Pub on Cumberland Street. "I wish you did."
Inspector Randal Monroe of 52 Division concedes that Yorkville could use a more visible police presence. Resources are limited, he says, because the division has to patrol the entertainment district -- Toronto's focal point. The division had to supervise 500 parades and demonstrations last year, he says.
However, he adds, not all the division's policing efforts are obvious to the public because they involve undercover operations. "There are issues in Yorkville that demand undercover investigation. [Visible] officers are only part of the dynamic."
If police rarely visit the late-night clubs in which much of the trouble is said to foment, the same is true for the licensing authorities. Several years have passed since any of Yorkville's six or seven clubs were penalized for any legal infractions, according to a spokesman for the Ontario Alcohol and Gaming Commission.
John Adams, city councillor for Ward 23, which includes Yorkville, said the community is increasingly concerned about the escalating violence in the area. "In the past 18 months, a fresh neighbourhood concern has developed in Yorkville."
He has spoken to police and says they are currently investigating local establishments and looking into laying misconduct charges with the Alcohol and Gaming Commission against some businesses.
Despite the sporadic mayhem, Constable Dave Fletcher, one of two foot-patrol officers who work the area, says Yorkville is still one of Toronto's relatively low-crime areas.
Indeed, the number of reported non-violent crimes, such as car thefts, has decreased in the past two years. Violent crimes rose slightly to 105 incidents last year from 91 in 1997. Prostitution offences in the area increased to 16 in 1999 from 10 in 1997.
Police also say there are many pockets of Toronto, such as the east-central Regent Park housing project, that are more violent and act as a constant drain on law-enforcement resources.
Nonetheless, police are well aware of the steady stream of wealthy visitors and club goers, some whom are characterized as shady, and Constable Fletcher concedes: "Sure, certain clubs draw the undesirables for one reason or another. Where there's lots of money, there can be trouble." Natalie Southworth is a member of The Globe and Mail's Toronto bureau. Timothy Appleby is a national crime reporter for the Globe.

Think Bouchard's gonna quit? Think again

Author: Gagnon, Lysiane

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/think-bouchards-gonna-quit-again/docview/384364605/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: This may explain why resignation rumours started floating in Quebec City last November, less than a year after his election victory. Mr. [Lucien Bouchard] tried to squelch the rumours by saying he would lead his party into the next election. But the rumours intensified in January, when Bob Dufour, the Parti Québécois's chief organizer and a close associate of Mr. Bouchard since the early days of the Bloc Québécois, announced his resignation -- "for personal reasons," as they say.

Full text: Last Monday, at the end of a busy day, Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard went to a cocktail party attended by a large part of the province's nationalist elite in honour of Yves Michaud, 70, a well-known figure of the sovereigntist movement.
Mr. Bouchard stood on his one good leg, barely leaning on his cane, for almost two hours, as he listened to a series of tributes in praise of Mr. Michaud.
Trays of fancy canapés and glasses of champagne were circulated by tuxedoed waiters, but the Premier had none of it. Other guests looked for a seat, but the Premier stood up through the whole ceremony.
Looking at him from the other side of the hall, I reflected on the miseries of political life. Why do people want to serve as elected officials, at such great cost for their personal life? After a hard day's work, wouldn't Lucien Bouchard prefer to be sitting at home with a good book, chatting with his wife and kids?
Even though he refuses to let it interfere in his work with a doggedness bordering on stoicism, here is a man with a relatively severe handicap -- and two young boys, Alexandre, 11, and Simon, 8. A man who spends at least four days out of seven away from his Montreal-based family, in a hideous government building aptly called "the bunker"; this is where he sleeps, too, in a room that is said to be as cozy as a monk's cell.
A brilliant lawyer, he could make much more money outside politics than as Premier -- a thankless job if there is one. These days, what Mr. Bouchard finds on his desk are new problems piled up over old unresolved problems, depressing polls, and the broken pieces of the sovereigntist dream. Mr. Bouchard is 61. How many years does he have to secure the future of his children, whom he'd like to send to the best American universities?
This may explain why resignation rumours started floating in Quebec City last November, less than a year after his election victory. Mr. Bouchard tried to squelch the rumours by saying he would lead his party into the next election. But the rumours intensified in January, when Bob Dufour, the Parti Québécois's chief organizer and a close associate of Mr. Bouchard since the early days of the Bloc Québécois, announced his resignation -- "for personal reasons," as they say.
In the past six months, four senior advisers of the Premier resigned, including Jean-François Lisée, his speechwriter and key strategist, and André Bellerose, a veteran organizer responsible for maintaining close links between the party and the government. Political aides usually don't start leaving the ship three or four years before an election is due.
By the end of January, a prominent columnist wrote that Audrey Best, Mr. Bouchard's wife, who is a law student at McGill University, was about to do her articling for Heenan Blaikie -- one of the largest law firms in Montreal and (wink, wink) the only one that has a branch in California, where Ms. Best comes from and where the family spends most holidays. So, the columnist went on, watch out for the moving van in front of the Bouchard home as early as this summer.
I asked Yvan Bolduc, a lawyer at Heenan Blaikie, what was really happening. Ms. Best, he says, is a third-year student. She will be hired for a summer job, in the Montreal branch of Heenan Blaikie. But she won't be doing her articling before 2002 -- which, as far as he knows, she plans to do in Montreal.
Like many other students of McGill's law faculty, Ms. Best is doing an extra year so she can learn both civil law and common law. This will allow her to practise anywhere in Canada or the United States, as long as she's admitted to the local bar. And, finally, Heenan Blaikie has no branch in California but is associated with a California firm.
So there's not much meat around this latest rumour. In any case, it's hard to imagine Lucien Bouchard ending up as a house husband in Los Angeles.
Actually, the Premier seems determined to fight out the next election. He is busy drumming up support within the PQ in view of the vote of confidence scheduled at the party's May convention. He quickly distanced himself from a group of discouraged sovereigntists who want the referendum to be held on a proposal easier to sell than sovereignty; this should help him win the votes of the PQ hard-liners.
My guess is that Mr. Bouchard will not quit before he has a chance to reap the benefits of the tough, unpopular budget cuts he's been pushing since he became Premier. Why would he want to be remembered solely as the man who erased the province's deficit? Lucien Bouchard is the kind of man who believes that pride and a sense of accomplishment are more important than real estate and stock options. Pride in their father's political record is something he wants to leave to his children. Lysiane Gagnon is a political columnist at La Presse.

JOHN DOYLE'S CRITICAL LIST

Author: Doyle, John

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/john-doyles-critical-list/docview/384353183/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: MASTERPIECE THEATRE: ALL THE KING'S MEN There's a branch of British TV which is insufferable and All the King's Men is produced by that very branch. It's a smug nostalgia trip, a celebration of a group of men, workers on the royal family's Sandringham estate, who went off to fight in the First World War. Their noble leader is Frank Beck, the land agent who is deeply in awe of royalty, deeply sentimental about his men and even more deeply naive about war.

Full text: SATURDAY
10 p.m. (CTV)
COLD SQUAD I'm warning you now, I'm in a mood this week. Just as I started writing this column I'm informed that a certain fella, a cabin boy on that sinking ship, the other national daily, offered
his considered, cabin-boy
opinion that this column is largely unread, unneces-sary and that most readers get their information about television from other sources. Apparently cabin boy currently bestrides Don Mills like a colossus, informing the purveyors of that laughable excuse for a TV magazine that they needn't improve their sorry little rag because nobody wants to read about television. Well that's the attitude that got them where they are today, isn't it? This brings me tangentially to Cold Squad, which is the only one of three CTV dramas now saved from cancellation. The City and Power Play aren't coming back. Fair enough -- The City started out all pompous and preachy about Toronto, a city which the creators seemed to know from reading old issues of Toronto Life magazine on a plane to a business meeting somewhere else. Then it suddenly got soapy and better, but nobody in charge had the wit to make it simultaneously serious, smart and funny. You know, like a good TV soap should be. Power Play started with a bang and then just whimpered. It isn't the first time these opinions have been expressed here. If you read the other rags that come with a Saturday paper, you'd be under the impression that The City was, like, a major achievement in Canadian drama and that you should spend your valuable time watching it. Likewise, Power Play is just teeming with interesting characters. Ain't so. You read it here first.
SUNDAY
8 p.m. (Prime)
PRIMETIME BYNON: HUGH HEFNER AT THE PLAYBOY MANSION Ms. Bynon gets an hour on prime time because she went off and interviewed Hugh Hefner. The short excerpt I've seen is bizarre. Bynon starts by gushing over a pleased Hef, telling him he's "red hot, a sex-god" and the unembarrassed Playboy founder responds with some nonsense about "a whole new generation was waiting for me to come out and play." Fine, whatever you say Mister Pajamas. But really, is anyone interested in what Hefner is up to?
9 p.m. (PBS)
MASTERPIECE THEATRE: ALL THE KING'S MEN There's a branch of British TV which is insufferable and All the King's Men is produced by that very branch. It's a smug nostalgia trip, a celebration of a group of men, workers on the royal family's Sandringham estate, who went off to fight in the First World War. Their noble leader is Frank Beck, the land agent who is deeply in awe of royalty, deeply sentimental about his men and even more deeply naive about war. Oddly enough, Beck is played by David Jason, familiar to us here as Frost and other charming cranks. As Beck, he's too much -- his eyes water above his quivering mustache and he talks to his men as if he'd just done a course in understanding-your-co-workers. All The King's Men looks lovely but only in that sun-drenched, rolling-hills-of-England way that Brit TV offers when there's not much real drama going on. Anyway, when Beck and his chaps go off to Turkey they discover some of the horror of war, but hold onto a naiveté that's blatantly unreal in dramatic terms. This is sentimental, cozy tripe, all dressed up with nice uniforms and stock figures (there's even an upper-class chap with big crush on a young farm hand!), going nowhere except into your allegedly bottomless pit of appreciation for British bathos about patriotism and royalty. When Beck and his men disappear, it's into a fog and, we are informed, into legend. Actually they made a tactical error, went too far and were shot by the Turks. War is ugly, traumatizing and terrible. A much better Brit production, Warriors, is on Wednesday. See below.
9 p.m. (CBS, Citytv)
FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON Elsewhere in this issue you'll find Gloria Slade's story of working on Flowers For Algernon. (Daniel Keyes who wrote the novel, filmed as Charly in 1968, does our TV & Me on Page 7.) It's a slightly better than average TV movie, helped immensely by Matthew Modine's considerable presence as Charlie, the young man whose mental disabilities are eliminated. He briefly becomes an arrogant genius -- here, however, his genius is first signaled by his ability to memorize baseball trivia. He's the kind of hero who would go all the way on Who Wants To Be a Millionaire and annoy you with his cockiness. The swift TV movie pace doesn't allow for much in the way of issue development. Flowers For Algernon is an attack on scientists who lack humanity and that's a big subject for a TV movie. (Tonight's X-Files on Fox/Global, 9 p.m., is a
classic. It's a gimmicky crossover episode in which Mulder and Scully turn up on COPS while looking
into reports of a monster in Los Angeles. The stark, COPS-style video footage puts a very different spin
on the show, which contains this immortal line from
Scully: "Mulder, I don't know if you've noticed, but we're on television!")
MONDAY
9 p.m. (WTN)
h LOVE BITES: IN YOUR DREAMS This Brit TV movie is an issue drama about date rape. It's not, mind you, like some American network flick where Tori Spelling gets to look good for 80 minutes and then cries in court. In Your Dreams is structured to make the viewer unsure of what happened to initiate a court case. We see a date start -- cocky med student Jamie (Oliver Milburn) reluctantly agrees to go out with Clare (Thandie Newton), an old friend of his sister's. Not having seen her in years, he's not enthusiastic. But when he meets her, he sees his mission as one of seduction that will surely end with sex. Clare is cruising on a school girl crush that dissipates quickly as she sees his charmless manner. They have a meal, go to a pub and back to a friend's party. Jamie is angling to get cozier as Clare tries politely to put distance between them. It's her politeness that lands her in trouble. Jamie walks Clare home and leaves, bitter at the lack of any ego-stroking end to the date. Eventually, the couple are in court and, although the viewer has seen the date from several perspectives, you're shocked at the clinical justice system grappling with Clare's hurt and rage. There are scenes that illuminate men's predatory nature and their decoding of simple things into sexual messages -- it's a distressing drama about awful, arbitrary reality.
TUESDAY
8 p.m. (NBC)
h 3RD ROCK FROM THE SUN The American nets are
all gimmicky for this sweeps period. (Paul Reubens, aka PeeWee Herman, is on Every-body Loves Raymond, Monday, 9 p.m., CBS; Dick Van Dyke is on Sabrina, Friday, 8 p.m., ABC; and on Just Shoot Me, tonight, 9:30 p.m., NBC, model Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is back as Finch's ex-wife and is revealed to be a sexaholic with a passion for pirate fantasies! That'll grab the kids.) Anyway, 3rd Rock is a consistently good satire of America and tonight there are two episodes. First on the one at 8 p.m., William Shatner is back as The Big Giant Head. The second episode sounds like a doozy. Apparently Dick (John Lithgow) has fantasies about Nina (Simbi Khali) like what happens in the movie American Beauty. Then Sally (Kristen Johnston) becomes obsessed with becoming a perfect, Martha Stewart-type homemaker. Let the goofiness begin. (At press time, CTV is still schedled to air the Law & Order episode at 10 p.m. based on the Bernardo/Homolka case. NBC is airing it Wednesday, 10 p.m.)
WEDNESDAY
8 p.m. (CBS, CTV)
THE GRAMMY AWARDS Canadian Diana Krall is up for a bunch of Grammys, including the big one, album of the year. Beats having to look at Shania, Alanis and other over-exposed Canucks.
9 p.m. (TVO)
h WARRIORS Three years ago, CBC gave us Peacekeepers, a nice, neat story of Canadian peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia. Gabriel Hogan played the hero as a handsome Canuck, shrewd and sweet. There was a romance with a translator played as a dish by Larissa Laskin. Forget about it. Warriors is a miles-better, two parter (continuing next week) about a bunch of British soldiers sent to Bosnia in 1992. First we see them at home in Liverpool, drinking, dancing, whoring and often being off-puttingly real. Most of them are more concerned with the fortunes of Liverpool's football club than with life in the streets and the army at home or anywhere else in the world. The officers are equally hard to like at first. They all land in Bosnia and move around in gleaming white tanks, facing daily frustrations with murderous Serb soldiers (a scene in which a British officer of Polish parents is questioned by a fascist Serb officer is intricately indicative of what was happening in Bosnia) and terrified civilians. Some of the young Brits are shot dead, randomly by snipers, and there's no room for revenge on a peacekeeping mission. Some are almost broken by the strain of surviving amid all the vicious ethnic hatred and casual deaths. There's one scene of the young soldiers try to rescue a teenage boy from inevitable murder by Serb forces. Then he's taken away. There's no contrived denouement to this, only the looks on the faces of the soldiers who know his fate. You might have trouble initially with the accents in a drama that uses a lot of casual, muttered dialogue. But stick with it -- it's exceptional TV drama.
THURSDAY
8 p.m. (CBC)
h WITNESS: SCHOOLGIRL KILLER You won't see another courtroom drama like this. (Even the paranoid drama of In Your Dreams doesn't come close, but both are linked.) In Ethiopia, 14-year-old Aberash is in court because she shot a man. She killed him because he abducted her in broad daylight, repeatedly raped her and wanted to have her as his wife. In Southern Ethopia, abduction is still how men get a wife. As far as most locals are concerned, abduction is part of the culture. Aberash's reaction to the abduction is the abnormality. According to the parents of the man Aberash killed, she deserves to die for her crime. "My son did nothing unusual," his mother says. "She stole our only means of survival," his father says. The doc is well-crafted and concise, done like a TV drama that flares outward from the courtroom to illuminate an entire society.
FRIDAY
8 p.m. (A&E)
BIOGRAPHY: HEINZ: THE KETCHUP KINGS Apparently they gave money away and were good corporate citizens. How novel.

Abstract: Here's what I mean: Imagine if I sold you a subscription to Maclean's and said I'd come to your door every Tuesday at 8 p.m. and hand you the current copy of Maclean's. Then, regardless of whether you're having a fight with your spouse or the bathtub has overflowed, I will return in precisely one hour, at 9, and take the magazine back. What would be the effect of this distribution? Readership of Maclean's would plummet by 99 per cent.

Full text: The digital revolution is breaking a fundamental constraint on our media, says Mark Starowic
The digital revolution, the capacity for infinite storage and retrieval based on the simple microchip, is as fundamental as the Gutenberg press. It will transform both our physical and mental landscape. As television did, it will shape everything from politics to commerce. And the digital revolution will particularly shape countries like Canada that are defined by the ability of its constituent parts to communicate with each other.
While occasioned by one piece of technology, this is not one revolution; it is a cluster of revolutions -- it has resurrected telegraphy in the form of e-mail, restoring an almost Victorian level of letter-writing; it has saved telephony; it has wrought a revolution in libraries and research; it is transforming commerce and markets and has brought back catalogue shopping in the form of e-commerce. We are actually seeing a migration of television, radio, cinema, the music CD, telephony, the mail, and to a lesser degree print, to this new common carrier, this new highway.
But what's at the core of this exponential change? Time -- We are about to leave behind linear time in communication and its stranglehold on television and radio.
Here's what I mean: Imagine if I sold you a subscription to Maclean's and said I'd come to your door every Tuesday at 8 p.m. and hand you the current copy of Maclean's. Then, regardless of whether you're having a fight with your spouse or the bathtub has overflowed, I will return in precisely one hour, at 9, and take the magazine back. What would be the effect of this distribution? Readership of Maclean's would plummet by 99 per cent. Yet I have just described the fundamental distribution system of television programming. The fifth estate will appear on your TV set at 8 p.m. and regardless of what else is happening in your life, it will end in an hour.
Unlike print, which can be consumed at the reader's pace, broadcasting is a complete hostage to linear time, which is a very inefficient form of distribution. And content is shaped by linear time. Nobody's going to play Death of a Salesman on the radio morning show.
Now, a new, parallel trajectory is emerging, the opposite of linear time, and it holds considerable promise. In 10 years, I predict, my TV set will talk to me -- it will know my usage patterns and remember I've been researching Canadian history, it will remember my daughter was searching the Web for a school project on volcanoes. "Good evening, Mark," it will say. "I have the 6 o'clock news. I have also found three items broadcast today about trends in television, one on the teaching of Canadian History and a documentary on volcanoes."
That's the significance of the digital revolution in broadcasting. The TV set will remember everything that has been broadcast. Television acquires the liberty of print, I can consume it at my leisure, pause it, return to it. And just as I can access any Scientific American ever published on the Web now, so I will be able to access the televisual and cinematic vaults of the world.
Escaping the linear time trap will lead to a flowering of the audio and visual media. Ten years ago, in a program meeting at the CBC, I asked why we didn't have a program like Siskel and Ebert, a movie review show. I was told that research showed only 700,000 people would watch it, and that was too small a community of interest to justify a prime-time slot.
With only 21 hours of prime time a week, television programmers can only afford to broadcast shows that will attract the largest numbers.
For 40 years, this economic law suppressed hundreds of program constituencies. This changed considerably with the multiplication of channels in the past decade. Now, with the digital revolution, it will disappear completely. Any constituency that can be profitably served -- any constituency of more than 500,000 across the continent -- will be served. We're going to see a renaissance in teleplays, concerts, documentaries and art.
Of course, real-time, or linear-time radio and television channels will continue to exist. First, because there are always live events, in news and sports. Also, there is a human need to share certain experiences, gossip and talk about them at the office. But real-time television will be intensely event-based, more aggressive, more sensational. In sport, we are going to see the continued creation of artificial events and sports that resemble more a Roman coliseum, with contrived skating contests, and bizarre endurance competitions.
The blood-and-circus trajectory has already created voyeuristic TV such as a Dutch program, Big Brother , in which a group of 10 people, mostly in their 20s, are shown living in a new house doing everything from taking showers to having sex. All three major networks are bidding for the rights to produce the show in the United States.
Commercial real-time television will gravitate increasingly to this kind of spectacle, becoming the medium's poor neighbourhood. The vast digital universe will be the upscale neighbourhood, where people can afford the technology, and have the money to be billed for every download.
As the audio-visual universe becomes segregated this way, we'll see the ascendancy of special interests.
Until now, there have been regulatory firewalls against powerful lobbies owning television or radio channels. The new information order will leave most television and radio unregulated. So the voices of any industrial lobby which already produces a considerable amount of public propaganda will be amplified in this digital television universe, as the nuclear industry, say, or agribusiness enters into program content production. Just don't look for skeptical journalism about pharmaceuticals in the next generation of specialty health channels, or investigative reporting about Monsanto on the food channels.
The real point here is that the product of commercial television is not programs, it's you. You're being sold to the advertiser; the program is just the bait. Commercial U.S. programs are designed with scientific precision to attract the most lucrative advertising demographics -- say, women 18-35. Access to that demographic may sell at $150,000 per thousand to an advertiser.
You have seen what has happened to the Internet. It has become overwhelmingly commercialized; my e-mail is filled each night with a Niagara of commercial mail. The same will happen with a digital television and radio universe that can observe my viewing habits, co-relate them with my on-line buying habits, and perniciously, with my social and political views.
David Halberstam, in The Powers That Be , chronicled the fundamental change in 20th-century politics: Television created the single mass audience and allowed the executive branch to communicate directly with the popular base without intervening party bosses. Now, with television segmenting, we may be witnessing the disappearance of the majority and its atomization into regional interest, commercial, cultural and demographic clusters. As domestic space is segmented, transnational space is emerging. But it's in private hands, and outside the control of the nation state. If we've underestimated the political and social effects of fragmentation, we should not underestimate the scale of globalization's effect.
Yet the emergence of transnational space is also one of the great democratic forces of history. The circulation of international ideas and debate is inherently toxic to local prejudice and hatred. I believe the ability to bring the world community's attention to dark places will eventually make the Kosovos, the Rwandas and the East Timors less possible. Information becomes harder to suppress, and a world conscience can be brought to bear.
Domestically, the challenge of the great media shift is ferocious. How is Canada going to fare? The record of the past is discouraging.
The first law of television is that expansion of distribution outlets, without a parallel expansion of domestic production, equals Americanization of content. Understanding this, Britain nurtured the BBC, and a few strong private companies, emerging with one of the most powerful television industries in the world. We did the opposite, and dissipated our energies -- winding up with more than 70 channels in some parts of the country, most of them winning less than 2 per cent of the audience, carrying domestic programming thanks to content regulations, but also much imported programming.
And now comes the greatest part of the media shift: Television and radio move to the Internet. Borderless and largely immune from regulation, they will be as impossible to control as the content of a million simultaneous cellphone conversations. The future of Canadian television and radio production can no longer be based on protectionism, or limiting the number of licenses. The only way to survive, and assert our presence, to maintain the arteries of communications that bind this country, is to throw the weight of policy towards production. In the digital universe, you are either a significant producer of content, or a spectator.
The digital revolution is about content -- cultural software -- to feed this infinite spectrum, and to assert our presence and our identity in it. In this coming age we have to compete as Canadians, with great films, documentaries, dramas and series. If we fail to invest in the production of content, in the next generation of writers, designers, programmers, we will shut off our creative valves.
This is where public broadcasting comes in. It's premised on the individual as citizen, not consumer. If we fail to keep a significant social and moral space in this emerging spectrum for those needs which we have as a democracy, and as a community of people, then this digital revolution will stifle this country. We will become merely spectators not producers. Where will the town hall be, Where will the national drama stage be?
Whatever happens, it's clear that we're living a fundamental paradigm shift. It may enrich us with an exhilarating pluralism that will empower a thousand new voices. It may also segment us, isolate us, and cause the disappearance of public space. In our nation, in our democracy, we will need public space. In the global village, we will need an address. Mark Starowicz is the head of CBC television's documentary programming and director of The Canadian History Project. This article is adapted from the first annual Kesterton Lecture, which he delivered last night in Ottawa.

The seamy roots of Haider's wealth

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/seamy-roots-haiders-wealth/docview/384371675/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "The buyer was Josef Webhofer from Brunich in Southern Tyrol," Mr. Roifer said. "[Adolf Hitler] and Mussolini had signed an agreement about the region where he lived, a German-speaking area of Italy. The Germans living in Tyrol could either stay in Italy and become Italians, changing their names and losing the autonomy they enjoyed, or they could emigrate to the Third Reich. Josef [Webhofer] bought this land in order to have some stake inside the Third Reich and move there."

Full text: Austrian right-winger's money is based on property once owned by a Jewish family
When Giorgio Roifer first set his eyes on the beautiful forest of Barental near Klagenfurt in the southern Austrian Tyrol, he thought he had found the perfect estate to expand his burgeoning timber business.
The Russian-born Jewish entrepreneur, who had become a naturalized Italian, lived with his wife and three children in Pisa. They had servants, horses and cars. He had timber and sawmill interests all over Italy and southern Austria, and when he acquired the 1,500-hectare Barental estate at the age of 37, it seemed the ideal addition to his growing empire.
But his wife and children never saw Barental. Less than a year after Mr. Roifer bought the estate in 1937, Adolf Hitler became ruler of Austria under the Anschluss (annexation by Germany). When Mr. Roifer visited Barental in 1938, he found a sign on the door of the Moser Hotel, where he used to stay in Klagenfurt, reading: "Dogs and Jews are not welcome."
The Nazis embarked on a ruthless policy of Aryanization, forcing Jews to sell their property and leave the country. Mr. Roifer died that year, and soon afterward the land was sold to Josef Webhofer, who left it to his son Wilhelm.
Today, Barental belongs to Joerg Haider, leader of Austria's far-right Freedom Party, who received it as a gift from Mr. Webhofer, his great-uncle, in 1986. Worth about $16-million (U.S.), the hunting, fishing, shooting and logging estate is the basis of the vast fortune that has made Mr. Haider one of the wealthiest men in Austria.
The original sale, however, was illegal. If Mr. Haider's family had not deceived Mr. Roifer's widow years after the war, the estate would still belong to her family.
Mr. Roifer's son Alexander, who many believe is the rightful heir to Barental, currently lives in a modest apartment in a middle-class Jerusalem suburb. A professor of Bible studies at nearby Hebrew University, he seems bemused by the sudden interest in his family history, and is reluctant to talk about Mr. Haider.
He tells the story of the estate in measured tones, despite the disturbing memories it stirs. His family was forced to sell the estate for a fraction of its real value and his mother, who died in 1995, never discovered that she had been tricked into giving it up until it was too late, he says.
"I am certainly not happy about what happened, but I do not wake up every morning angry about it," he said. "A man builds his life, and fortunately I have found other things to keep me busy and interested. Of course, I am sorry that the Roifer forest is now the Haider forest.
"The property was sold in October, 1940, under duress. In the course of the sale an illegal act was committed, but the authorities in Karenten induced the sale in order to Aryanize the land. If you ask me, do we have a legal claim, the answer is no. If you ask if I think what has happened was morally right, I think it stinks.
"The acquisition was made in several stages and was completed in 1937. On Aug. 26, 1938, my father died of cancer."
The older Mr. Roifer was 38. His young widow Matilde, and children Noemi, 10, Josef, 8 and Alexander, 6, fled to Palestine to escape the Nazis.
"In October, 1939, we left Italy for Israel," Mr. Roifer said. "My father, who was a Zionist, told my mother on his deathbed to take the family to Israel. It was almost impossible to get visas, but my mother wrote a letter that eventually got to [Israeli statesman] David Ben-Gurion, who made sure we got a visa.
"My uncle in Italy decided to sell the forest. There was all sorts of virulent anti-Semitic propaganda in the press. He was under a great deal of psychological and physical duress. If we had been Austrian citizens and therefore citizens of the expanded German Reich, it would have been very simple. They would have said, 'Here are 10 Reichmarks, the forest is now ours.' But we were Italians and the Italian government would not allow that to happen."
Instead of the estate being confiscated, the family was able to sell it, but the price of 300,000 Reichsmarks, about $1.2-million (U.S.) today, was only about one-tenth of the actual value of the property.
"The buyer was Josef Webhofer from Brunich in Southern Tyrol," Mr. Roifer said. "Hitler and Mussolini had signed an agreement about the region where he lived, a German-speaking area of Italy. The Germans living in Tyrol could either stay in Italy and become Italians, changing their names and losing the autonomy they enjoyed, or they could emigrate to the Third Reich. Josef Webhofer bought this land in order to have some stake inside the Third Reich and move there."
Mrs. Roifer had not wanted to sell the estate and didn't even know of the sale until her brother-in-law wrote to her at the end of the war. Worse was to come. When the money finally reached Italy, it was frozen until after the war, by which time inflation had reduced its value to almost nothing.
In 1953, she returned to Austria to try to get a fairer sum from Mr. Webhofer. To her surprise, he agreed to pay another $100,000.
"When she received that money, my mother signed a paper forgoing all future claims," Mr. Roifer said. "The indemnity was given under restrictive conditions. We were not permitted access to the documentation in the land registry office in Klagenfurt."
Only years later did the family discover why Mr. Webhofer had insisted on that condition and why he had been so willing to pay the extra cash. In 1989, papers were discovered at the land registry that amazed the Roifers.
"The document said that the power of attorney granted by my mother, Matilde Roifer Galichi, to her brother-in-law, Dr. Naphtoli Emdin, was not valid. But because it was desirable to Aryanize the land, the local officials decided to approve the sale anyway. In other words, there was no sale. Until 1953, the forest was legally ours.
"That is why Webhofer agreed to pay, because he knew that if this became known, the deal would be void."

Abstract: RioCan announced yesterday that it has issued more than three million of its units at $9.05 each to OMERS as part payment for its acquisition of the Shoppers World mall in Brampton, Ont. RioCan will finance the balance of the $46.5-million purchase price with an $18.5-million mortgage on the property.

Full text: Adds to investment in real estate entities
Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board has become a major investor in a second domestic real estate entity by swapping one of its shopping centres for a 2.5-per-cent equity stake in RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust .
RioCan announced yesterday that it has issued more than three million of its units at $9.05 each to OMERS as part payment for its acquisition of the Shoppers World mall in Brampton, Ont. RioCan will finance the balance of the $46.5-million purchase price with an $18.5-million mortgage on the property.
Graham Senst, vice-president of real estate investments at OMERS, said in an interview that the pension fund owns equity in several property companies, but the RioCan investment is its second significant one. OMERS, which manages $35-billion in assets on behalf of local government employees in the province, is the largest shareholder of Oxford Properties Group Inc., with an 18-per-cent equity interest.
OMERS is also a big player in the real estate industry, with $4-billion in property assets. The fund has owned Shoppers World for about five years. The 735,000-square-foot mall, which is 25 years old and in need of renovation, is better suited for RioCan because the real estate trust has the expertise to reposition it and attract the tenants that will make it successful, Mr. Senst said.
"Shoppers World is a development opportunity," he said, adding that OMERS expects to earn a better return on the mall through its long-term investment in RioCan rather than by redeveloping the property itself.
RioCan is Canada's largest REIT, with about $2.2-billion in assets, consisting of 130 shopping centres across the country.

Full text: Mother, grandmother, municipal councillor. Born Feb. 26, 1929, in Chilliwack B.C. Died Dec. 12, 1999, in Prince Albert, Sask., of cancer, aged 70.
Described variously as "tenacious," a "pit bull" and "wagon master," Grethyll Adams seemed to take delight in being an irritant. Her abrasiveness and persistence, however, served to bring the Prince Albert council's attention to many public concerns. She had the courage of her convictions and, as the only woman on council, brought a different viewpoint to many arguments, which would often end in her saying, "Oh you guys!"
Yet no matter how heated the debates, Grethyll always ensured that, at the end of the day, the council remained a cohesive, focused group so it could do its job of serving the people of Prince Albert.
Born the youngest of four girls to Daisy and Jim Bray -- they had emigrated from Suffolk, England, in 1925 -- she married Wendell Watson in 1949. The first two of their five sons were born in Chilliwack, B.C., before they moved to Pemberton to start their own restaurant and a gravel-trucking business. Grethyll was kept busy running the restaurant, driving a truck and raising five sons. In 1967, the family moved to Burnaby, where Grethyll worked to become a real-estate agent in Vancouver.
After divorcing her first husband, she married Walter Adams, an electrical contractor in Clinton, B.C. It was her genuine love of people and concern for the community that led to her eventual career in politics. She served as alderman and mayor of Clinton before moving to Prince Albert in 1979.
Grethyll quickly became involved in the community there, supporting many causes as a volunteer. Elected to city council in 1985, she worked tirelessly to serve her constituents and make Prince Albert a progressive community. A great orator, she served on many committees and was chair of several at the time of her death.
In his eulogy, the president of the Fireman's Association of Prince Albert said Grethyll was concerned for the welfare of everyone and would regularly phone the fire department to ask, "How are my boys?" They described her as a "grizzly mother bear" (after TV's Grizzly Adams) because of her efforts to see they were well-equipped for their dangerous duties.
There was a tribute to her on local television, where she was described as "outstanding in council meetings," "always having her homework done," "always persistent and questioning," "always informed and prepared." A street in Prince Albert will be named after her.
Blessed with a rich contralto voice, Grethyll expressed her joy in life through her singing, both as a member of the choir of Wesley United Church and as a soloist at many events.
She looked on cancer as another challenge, and she fought it with her famous tenacity. When told the final prognosis, she said it was God's will. Her faith sustained and comforted her.
Whatever her accomplishments on city council, Grethyll regarded her family as her greatest achievement. She was inordinately proud of her five sons, whom she admonished as passionately as she loved. Grethyll said many times, "I'm lucky to have such a wonderful family and all these friends." In her final days, she found it hard to accept that the love and support she had given everyone all her life was now being returned to her.
The 500 people who attended her funeral were there to express publicly their admiration and love for a respected member of city council and the Prince Albert community. They were all there, family, friends, adversaries and nodding acquaintances, all saddened by the loss of someone larger than life. Rosemarie Spindler is Grethyll Adams's first cousin.

FROM ANARCHY TO UTTER CALM

Abstract: It doesn't take long for a first-time visitor's senses to be pummelled by the city. The previous afternoon, I fought my way past a squad of deformed beggars patrolling the entrance to Malabar Hill's Hanging Gardens, built above Bombay's water reservoir.

Full text: Restrained during the first part of the trip from Bombay to Elephanta Island, the ferry boat's guide became startlingly animated, almost poetic, as we approached our destination.
"Island's setting and caves very significant for Hindu faith," he said. "It is refuge for the spirit on a sea of change, sir. To arrive on rough seas is journey of determination and discovery."
The sea was oily calm, and all my spirit wanted was a little rest. I needed an escape from Bombay's smog-shrouded blitz on the senses. It was also a chance to visit what are considered some of the finest rock-cut Hindu sculptures in India.
I had spent the previous day touring Bombay (the city's name was changed to Mumbai four years ago, but locals seem nonchalant about it) and was exhausted by its demands.
India's largest city is an anarchic megalopolis of close to 16 million inhabitants, crammed into an area smaller than Toronto. Almost four million of them (imagine the combined population of Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg) live on the street, or in slums of cardboard and tin. In this economic powerhouse -- a city that handles half of India's foreign trade, generates more than a third of its income, and has some of the most expensive real estate in the world -- hundreds of thousands have no access to a toilet or clean water.
It's a seething, hustling stew of a place where shiny new Murati hatchbacks, Mercedes and BMWs share the streets with bullock wagons and handcarts pulled by lean men in loincloths and flip-flops; where the oddly mutated Gothic architecture of the Raj's Victorian heyday jostles with modern office towers and crumbling tenements. Hives of rusty shacks cringe in the shadow of buildings where some of the world's best computer software engineers toil and wait for a call from Silicon Valley. The air is thick with the mingled smells of diesel and ozone, dead fish and frying chickpea batter, incense and excrement, jasmine and bidis, the poor man's cigarettes.
Author David Collins described it perfectly. Bombay, he wrote in Lonely Planet 's new guide to the city, is where "Indian fantasies of wealth and glamour engage in a macabre dance with poverty and slums, and where economic boom flirts with social collapse." Wealth and glamour can be found in Malabar Hill's enclaves of the nouveau riche , Bollywood's movie-industry hangouts, or even lounging at the Taj Mahal Hotel; social collapse can be glimpsed from the edges of Dharavi, an enormous concentration of misery Bombay Ice 'sauthor Leslie Forbes called "the slum equivalent of the Great Barrier Reef."
It doesn't take long for a first-time visitor's senses to be pummelled by the city. The previous afternoon, I fought my way past a squad of deformed beggars patrolling the entrance to Malabar Hill's Hanging Gardens, built above Bombay's water reservoir. Sitting on a bench -- flanked by aromatic flowers and meticulously trimmed bestial topiary -- I watched well-dressed young couples courting while others chattered on cell phones. And there, above us all, fat vultures circled lazily, waiting to devour the next naked corpse placed inside one of the nearby dakhmas , or Towers of Silence, by Parsee followers of the 5,000-year-old Zoroastrian faith.
Contrasts, found everywhere in India, seemed to me at that moment condensed to a white-hot essence.
The small ferry for Elephanta left from docks near the Gateway of India, a looming arch built in 16th-century Gujarat Muslim style to commemorate the 1911 visit of George V and Queen Mary. We chugged across the glass-smooth harbour, past rusty freighters from around the world waiting to unload their cargoes. The nine-kilometre trip took about an hour and I spent some of the time wondering how the dolphins I saw breaching in the foul harbour could survive in the fuel-rainbowed water.
As the boat tied up at the long concrete pier that ran across the island's black-mud flats at low tide, the guide tried again to nudge me toward a more spiritual view of things before I left his boat.
"When you come to the caves of Elephanta, sir, you are making three journeys," he said. "You travel across the water, then you climb a mountain. And, lastly, you must pass through the entrance of the caves themselves. It is proper preparation to be in the home of Shiva."
On the mudflats, island fishermen were swarming around their boats, scraping and caulking hulls in a race with the tide that would refloat the vessels in a few hours. Here and there, women squelched through the black muck, digging elbow-deep for shellfish.
The island's mountains are really only hills, and you climb to the caves up more than 100 sloping concrete steps edged on both sides by stalls selling knickknacks and souvenirs. At the bottom, touts waded into the stream of visitors to offer palanquin rides up the hill. There were some awkward moments. Four sweating and heaving men struggled to carry an enormous French tourist, but could only stagger part of the way up before dumping him rather unceremoniously from the litter and scurrying back down for a lighter load. The outraged tourist hurled some spicy language after them. Another time, palanquin wallahs racing back down to catch another fare almost trampled a little old lady shopping at a stall.
The next act in the circus starred the monkeys.
It is estimated that Elephanta is infested with more than 10,000 monkeys, which probably explains why its 1,600 human inhabitants have given up trying to grow vegetable crops and now rely almost entirely on a dwindling fishery and tourism for their income.
At the top of the steps, and in the area fronting the caves, visitors are accosted by aggressive gangs of brown monkeys the size of large cats. They try to pry into bags, reach into the pockets of people sitting down for a rest, and horrify elderly European ladies by casually copulating near their feet. When threatened with a stick or a camera tripod, they bare their teeth, growl and threaten to bite.
"Animal lovers do not survive long in India without a few monkey bites," wrote Forbes in Bombay Ice . She may have gained some insight on the matter on Elephanta.
Once past the nuisance of the monkeys, a visitor is finally ready to enter one of Bombay's most popular attractions: cave temples dedicated to Shiva, the Hindu deity with more than 1,000 names, the destroyer without whom creation could not have occured.
The caves, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984, were carved out of a steep basalt cliff between 550 and 750 AD by the Chalukyas based in northern Karnataka. They occupied Elephanta when what is now Bombay was little more than a series of mosquito-infested islands connected by swamps. Once called Gharapuri, it was renamed Elephanta by Portuguese invaders in the early 1500s when they found a large stone elephant here. What's left of that crumbling elephant has been moved to Victoria Gardens in central Bombay, but the name was left behind.
The main cave is punctuated by 24 decorative pillars and its walls contain nine rock-carved images depicting episodes from Shiva's life. Described as a stylistic fusion of South Indian Hindu sculpture and Buddhist Gupta art, the carvings are sinuous and powerful even in their damaged state. Portuguese soldiers, billeted on the island during monsoons hundreds of years ago, vandalized the carvings, managing to desex the images while using them for target practice. The British also damaged and partially looted the site.
But what is left of the carvings more than hints at their original magnificence. Here is Shiva as Nataraja, the cosmic king of dancers; as Yogishvara, the ascetic yogi held aloft by nagas , mythical snakes so common in South Asian art; and as Ardhnarinateshwar, the androgynous lord uniting both sexes in one body. Elsewhere, on four sets of twin panels lining the cave's walls, are images depicting Shiva marrying Parvati, Shiva killing the demon Andhaka, and as Gangadhar, with the holy waters of the River Ganges flowing into his hair.
The cave-temple's most imposing carving, the six-metre-high Trimurti, is a depiction of a triple-headed Shiva representing the deity as creator, preserver and destroyer. It is considered to be one of the finest examples of Hindu rock-cut art in existence. The large, central head of the trinity -- with elongated earlobes and wearing an elaborate crown -- is a model of serenity. A smaller, youthful head to the right emphasizes the feminine features of creation, while a nasty looking old man's head to the left represents destruction. Unfortunately set in a gloomy recess at the south end of the cave, the carving's details are best seen using a flashlight.
The main cave's other major feature is a rectangular shrine, the four sides of which are guarded by what remains of enormous dvarapalas (doorkeepers) and their attendant dwarfs. Unfortunately, these figures suffered more than their share of ancient vandalism and look to be near collapse.
To the east of the main temple is a courtyard and the entrance to a smaller cave containing a shrine to the Saptamatrikas, or Seven Mothers, a group of minor deities associated with Hindu cults. On the larger cave's western side is a rough courtyard containing a deep and shaded cistern carved out of the rock. Occasionally, a workman appears, lowers a bucket at the end of a rough rope and draws water in a scene that probably hasn't changed for a millennium.
Wandering around the cave to study the carvings, I found myself repeatedly drawn back to the Trimurti.
Even in that gloomy corner of the cave, the three-headed image's personality seemed to change with the amount and quality of daylight that filtered into the temple through its three entranceways. Benevolent calm could turn into frightening malevolence with a cloud moving over the sun; the passage of hours could draw attention to the soft face of creation, or the snakes in the hair of the old man.
The stone image from the ancient past seemed to have a lesson for the future, but its articulation escaped me. I was, however, refreshed and ready to return to the chaos of the city. A fleet of almost 100 small ferry boats shuttles back and forth between the Gateway of India and Elephanta between 8:30 and 5 p.m. Cost is about 100 rupees (about $3.35). If possible, avoid going to the island on weekends, when it is swarmed by Bombay daytrippers.

Abstract: "I'm a bit of a traditionalist in my thinking as far as the game goes. It's our job to report the game, not be in the game. If we get involved in a Stanley Cup championship game and we're talking to the coaches, perhaps we're crossing a line that we shouldn't cross."

Full text: William Houston's world of sports Slagging columnists
This feud involves Gary Mason, the Vancouver Sun sports columnist, and David Pratt of TSN, who writes a column for the Vancouver weekly Sports Vue.
After the goalie swap that sent Felix Potvin to the Canucks for Kevin Weekes, Mason broke two key pieces of information in a column that largely discredited Weekes: (1) He refused to play after being cleared of an injury by team doctors; and (2) He showed up late for a game claiming he had been abducted and robbed. A police report was not filed and the story was perceived by the club to be bogus.
Because Mason is Canuck general manager Brian Burke's principal media pipeline, the column drew criticism, particularly from Pratt who compared Mason's ethics to those of mass murderer Charles Manson, a picture of whom ran with the column.
Insiders say Mason was shocked, but unsure whether to respond publicly. He did, defending in a column his sources and stating that Pratt's attack had offended his family.
Snubbed by own station
During his seven years as a radio host at The FAN in Toronto, Spider Jones, a former golden gloves champion, says he was excluded from boxing discussions on the station's syndicated show Prime Time Sports.
"I'm a former champion, a member of the hall of fame, a broadcaster and I follow the game, but I was never used," said Jones, now with Talk 640 in Toronto.
"I guess I wasn't part of [host] Bob McCown's old boys club. I felt like I was slapped in the face, like the black quarterback. You know, he has the talent, but not the brains to run the team."
Said McCown: "By no stretch of the imagination was I intending to slight him. I like the guy."
McCown says his two regular boxing experts are The Globe and Mail's Stephen Brunt, who usually covers the big fights, and New York commentator Bert Sugar.
Mellanby for hockey hall
Mark Askin, the producer of Toronto Maple Leaf local TV games, asks: Why isn't veteran producer Ralph Mellanby in the Hockey Hall of Fame?
Answer: Induction into the broadcasting section of the hall is limited to on-air personalities.
However, the builders category is available to Mellanby and a good case can be made for his membership.
As Hockey Night In Canada 'stop producer for almost 20 years, Mellanby recruited Dave Hodge, Dan Kelly, Bob Cole, Brian McFarlane, Howie Meeker, John Davidson and Don Cherry.
Canadian TV sports today is run, in large part, by people Mellanby brought into the business. They include Rick Briggs-Jude, the head of TSN's Blue Jay telecast; John Shannon, executive producer of HNIC ;Doug Beeforth, vice-president of sports for CTV; and TSN president Rick Brace.
Mellanby also headed up several Olympic hockey productions, including the 1980 miracle on ice for ABC Sports.
A future for miked coaches?
One of the features of the NHL all-star game telecasts on Sunday is miked coaches answering questions from the broadcast booth.
Could this become standard procedure in game coverage? John Shannon, the head of Hockey Night In Canada, says perhaps, but he's not enthusiastic.
"I'm a bit of a traditionalist in my thinking as far as the game goes. It's our job to report the game, not be in the game. If we get involved in a Stanley Cup championship game and we're talking to the coaches, perhaps we're crossing a line that we shouldn't cross."
The real skating story
Last week's the fifth estate piece on corrupt ice-dance officiating ( Deception on Ice )reported new information, but it also stated self-servingly that the skating world had "never really revealed what happened until now."
Not true. In fact, allegations of fixed dance judging were reported first in the print media, specifically by Beverley Smith in The Globe and Mail. Truth and Rumours can be reached by phone (416) 585-5335; fax (416) 585-5290; e-mail: truth@globeandmail.ca

Brit wits

Author: Parpart, Lee

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/brit-wits/docview/384528650/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: For those whose tastes run more to repartee than to ray guns, the BBC has just released new home video volumes of its popular comedies To the Manor Born (1979-1981) and As Time Goes By (ongoing since 1992). These are wonderful examples of the kind of gently loping, character-driven shows that the Brits do so brilliantly, when they're not telling naughty jokes about women's underwear or running through all of the adjectives used to describe a dead parrot.

Full text: Fave British TV shows available as video sets
It used to be that you couldn't get your favourite TV shows on home video. Television was such a throw-away medium that for years nobody even thought to archive shows properly, let alone re-package them as collector's items or gift box sets. Today, of course, the pendulum has swung in the other direction, and all manner of crap and worthwhile TV trinkets are being recycled from the airwaves to the video stores. Studios and distributors (ever mindful of a new way to rake in profits) are busy raiding their vaults to put out home video versions of classics such as The Mary Tyler Moore Show, That Girl and WKRP in Cincinnati, while the hottest current shows tend to get released on tape before the they've even finished their initial run.
As usual, commercial appeal often speaks louder than critical acclaim when it comes to deciding what gets released. A few outstanding shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer meet both criteria and wind up in the pipeline for a video release, but for the most part, studio execs seem to think that what the world really needs is more Ally McBeal. (Twentieth Century Fox has saturated the market with three videos, a box set, a DVD and a soundtrack, all in honour of the twitchy attorney). Meanwhile, a brilliant series like Homicide: Life on the Street not only gets bumped from the airwaves but remains scandalously underplayed on video. Two episodes of the Baltimore-based detective series (two little trial balloons, it would seem) will finally be released on Feb. 22 from Vidmark/ Trimark, nearly a year after the show was cancelled.
The Brits, it turns out, are doing a slightly better job of making sure quality programs wind up on video. In addition to bringing out box sets of screamingly funny work from shows like Fawlty Towers, Monty Python's Flying Circus and Absolutely Fab-ulous, BBC Video recently released 14 episodes of the long-running veterinarian drama All Creatures Great and Small, and has started to revive some of its older sci-fi favourites. September saw the release of nine new episodes of the campy, low-budget sci-fi comedy Red Dwarf, starring Craig Charles as Lister, a confused nonconformist with a passion for curry, and his crew of human, robot and animal eccentrics. Also recently issued was a rare, vintage black-and-white story from the earliest years of Doctor Who, starring Patrick Troughton as The Doctor in what was originally a six-part series about a race of frozen warriors unearthed by scientists during the third ice age. A collector's edition of the restored story includes an audio soundtrack of the missing second and third episodes and a book featuring a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the series. I'm no Doctor Who aficionado, but even I remember being amazed as a kid by the weird creatures in this story, with their fishy mouths and their fake-looking Styrofoam claws. Watching it again recently was a surreal trip down memory lane, although I was struck by how much of the show is devoted to mindless techno-babble and other things deemed titillating to teenaged boys.
For those whose tastes run more to repartee than to ray guns, the BBC has just released new home video volumes of its popular comedies To the Manor Born (1979-1981) and As Time Goes By (ongoing since 1992). These are wonderful examples of the kind of gently loping, character-driven shows that the Brits do so brilliantly, when they're not telling naughty jokes about women's underwear or running through all of the adjectives used to describe a dead parrot. To The Manor Born centers on a long-running, flirtatious feud between recently impoverished aristocrat Audrey Forbes-Hamilton (Penelope Keith) and the nouveau riche businessman (Peter Bowles) who buys her country estate, while As Time Goes By gradually unfolds a mesmerizing story about a love affair interrupted during the Korean War and resumed 38 years later. Dame Judi Dench stars as Jean Pargeter, a hard-working widow who runs a secretarial business with her daughter Judith (Moira Brooker), while Geoffrey Palmer plays Lionel Hardcastle, a former army officer who returns to England after a career growing coffee in Kenya. The writing is superb, with punch lines floating in naturally the way they do in a normal conversation, and the story of this couple's love affair is genuinely addicting. I can't put it better than the Australian fan who wrote that "if [Jean and Lionel] were real, I think I should like to invite them to tea." Quite.
All of the BBC tapes mentioned here are being distributed in Canada by Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment. If you can't find them in your local video store, visit BBC Worldwide America's video web site at www.bbc-worldwide-americas.com or call 1-800-216-1BBC.

The key to Internet power? Many talk to many

Abstract: Commerce One is the software partner in GM's corporate auction site and, to facilitate its own global bazaar, Commerce One is making national alliances with local companies worldwide. The Canadian partner is TD Bank Financial Group, which announced its deal in December.

Full text: The most significant economic news of the past year appeared on Dec. 3, 1999, in The Wall Street Journal: "How GM, Ford think the Web can make splash on the factory floor." Many people have been wondering how the Internet will really change the economy. On-line bookselling and grocery shopping isn't it. This is it.
GM and Ford are setting up massive business-to-business auction sites, or bazaars, where they will do much of their own real-time purchasing worldwide among competing bidders. More radically, GM and Ford will require all their outside suppliers to use the same central auction site to purchase their inputs, believing that this will lower their suppliers' costs, and therefore their own.
This marks a revolutionary improvement in the efficiency of markets, and should noticeably cut the cost of producing cars and trucks. People have been saying for years that computers would lead to big productivity gains outside the computer business itself, and we are now about to see this through the expansion of business-to-business Internet auction sites.
This will contribute much to the low-inflation environment that is sustaining the longest economic bull run in American history. Unleashing the computer through the Internet will reduce costs across so wide a swath in so many fields that many prices will fall even in the face of rising demand and employment -- a golden source of prosperity as long as we avoid general price deflation.
The Wall Street Journal notes that GM spends some $87-billion a year through 30,000 suppliers, and that Ford spends about the same. Throw in other major purchasers in the private and public sectors, and American business Internet commerce could explode from $200-billion to $1-trillion annually in three years. Save 10 per cent annually on $1-trillion, and watch the economy soar.
Going far beyond the significance of consumer-oriented sites, Internet business-to-business bazaars exist through companies such as Ariba Technologies, 1Point Commerce and Commerce One Inc., selling everything from furniture to heavy equipment, chemicals and even companies.
Among its global bazaar departments, 1Point Commerce lists transportation, utilities, accommodation and food services, education, construction, health care, mining and real estate.
Commerce One declares that "through its products, portals and services, Commerce One creates access to worldwide markets, allowing anyone to buy from anyone, anytime, anywhere in the world." The benefit is lower costs through much wider access to product suppliers. "Moving to the Commerce One solution was more than a good idea," says the director of procurement for UCLA in a typical advertising blurb. "It was a question of survival" -- meeting her budgets.
Commerce One is the software partner in GM's corporate auction site and, to facilitate its own global bazaar, Commerce One is making national alliances with local companies worldwide. The Canadian partner is TD Bank Financial Group, which announced its deal in December. TD chairman Charles Baillie pointed out that "we save costs on TD's internal procurement" by doing so, but more ambitiously, the TD-Commerce One site will offer auction services across the breadth of business-to-business e-commerce in Canada, "the growth of which is expected to outpace that of the on-line business-to-consumer sector."
Several years ago, the president of the Royal Bank told The Globe and Mail's editorial board that he had come to the realization that he was in the information business. Now, when TD executives face the classic question in their management retreats -- "What business are we in?" -- they will have to answer, in part, that they are in the wholesale trading business through information technology. A bank, once just a lender to business, is seeking to become the dominant broker between Canadian businesses as they buy and sell anything, taking a percentage of the gross in each transaction.
Inventors of radical technologies almost never know their technologies will bloom. (Edison thought that phonograph records would be used for office memos.) The key to the Internet's power comes in the understanding that, unlike the printing press, which allows one person to talk to many, and unlike the telephone, which allows one person to talk to one, the Internet allows many to talk to many.
That's why the early expressions of Internet commerce have been so awkward and economically disappointing. They have replicated the one-to-many or one-to-one service aspects of the printing press or the telephone, which the Internet allows, but they have missed the unique, transforming aspect of the Internet itself. The many-to-many character of the Internet shows its real economic power in the many-to-many world of the global marketplace. The Internet's perfectly matched ability to facilitate truly efficient markets promises the greatest economic dividend to date from the invention of the computer. E-mail: wthorsell@globeandmail.ca

Full text: Toronto's Wellspring plans to eventually support those fighting the disease across Canada
It was a beautiful, warm August day, and Trish Gibney was sailing peacefully across Lake Ontario when a sudden, violent thunderstorm erupted.
It was a scary, eerily portentous moment. Mere hours later, she was being rushed to emergency with intense abdominal pain caused by a cancerous tumour on her ovary. Within the week, she had a hysterectomy, and started planning for intense chemotherapy and radiation treatment.
"One day I'm out there sailing, and the next I'm in a fog because I've just been told I have cancer," she said in an interview. "The diagnosis just plunked down in the middle of my busy life and stopped everything."
A cancer diagnosis is, at the best of times, devastating, but Ms. Gibney was still recovering from years as a caregiver -- her father died of cancer in 1994, and her mother in 1996. At age 39, her plans to have children were dashed. She had to quit her job as a film producer. Ms. Gibney was thunderstruck by the diagnosis, which brought with it a torrent of physical, emotional, psychological and financial pain.
She turned to Wellspring, a support centre for people with cancer and their families.
"The first time I walked through the door, this heavy burden was lifted from my shoulders. When I go to Wellspring, I feel normal again," she said.
Since 1992, the charitable group has operated a single location in downtown Toronto. Today, Wellspring is opening a second facility, a comfy home on the campus of Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre in Toronto.
Within the year, similar facilities will open in Oakville, Ont., and London, Ont., and, eventually, across Canada. The idea is to set up close to cancer treatment centres, but only where local support and funds are available. (The group, a registered charity, does not receive any government funds and charges no fees.)
"Our philosophy is that there's a wealth of practical wisdom that comes from sharing with your peers, and there is tremendous benefit in getting support outside the traditional medical setting. We think the programs we offer are a highly beneficial complement to the existing system," Lynda Morrison, executive director of Wellspring, said during a tour of the newest facility.
She sees the centres as an outgrowth of the consumer movement in health care. Cancer patients used to be passive recipients of medical treatment, but today they are demanding, and participating in, holistic care delivery.
"Beyond what it does to your body, cancer really does something to your sense of self. By coming to Wellspring, many people are empowered. They focus on living with cancer, not on dying from cancer," Ms. Morrison said.
The charity was established by Anne Armstrong Gibson, a Toronto real-estate agent. After she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma -- she got her test results on Christmas Eve from a doctor who said he didn't have time to talk because he was late for a party -- she was overcome with feelings of fear and isolation.
Realizing this was common among cancer patients and that, like her, most did not have easy access to supportive care, she set out to fill the void.
"Anne was a dynamo, someone who was always in control of her life and she couldn't believe how cancer made her lose control," Ms. Morrison said. "But she was strong enough to get help and, piece by piece, she built on that and was determined to share it with others."
Ms. Gibson first travelled around the United States and Canada visiting other cancer programs, and then she created Wellspring. She enlisted the support of cancer patients, oncology doctors, chemotherapy nurses, radiation technicians and corporate sponsors.
However, she did not live to see her dream of expanding the centre become a reality.
Wellspring's offerings include support groups, stress management, relaxation and educational seminars. Patients can take courses and complementary therapies such as yoga, qi gong (a meditative exercise), Reiki (a form of healing touch), visualization, art therapy and journaling.
Marc Pearsall, a commercial real-estate agent who has been battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for a decade, was an acquaintance of Ms. Gibson who was diagnosed at almost the same time. He was one of the first patients to use Wellspring.
"I know it sounds New Age-ish and esoteric, but it works, it's a big help," he said. "I've been a pretty sick little puppy and I can honestly say I wouldn't have got through all the treatment without Wellspring."
Wellspring has many kinds of support groups for cancer patients -- based on type of disease, severity of illness and language spoken -- as well as those for caregivers and children of cancer patients.
Mr. Pearsall is now a volunteer counsellor at the centre. "I've been through every treatment imaginable, and I've had every problem imaginable so I think I can help." Above all, cancer patients want someone to talk to, and advice on dealing with things like hair loss, insomnia and nausea, the most common side effects of chemotherapy. The volunteers are all cancer survivors.
"When you've just been diagnosed and you think your life is over, just meeting someone like me makes a difference," Mr. Pearsall said.

Full text: The revolutionary genetic technique is suffering setbacks and even patient death. Even so, some researchers are tinkering with the idea of using some of nature's most devilish viruses
The potential for gene therapy to alleviate human illness is proving nothing short of spectacular. It also raises spectacular concerns -- and spectacular debate.
At one extreme are proponents who say that "all disease is genetic" and predict that GT will soon dominate medicine. Other clinicians define GT more narrowly and are cautious about its future. So far, the only consensus among scientists is that GT uses genetic material to address the symptoms or causes of human disease.
The bolder scientists have one point on their side -- every illness has some genetic component. In the so-called "genetic diseases," the link is obvious: Patients lack some normally functioning gene that healthy humans take for granted. If their genome can't break down sugar properly, they have diabetes. If it can't assemble a proper retina, they are color blind, and so on. But even in infectious diseases, genes play a role. People blessed with genetic immunity may shrug off the most vicious pathogen. Millions of children have ingested live polio virus and escaped with a sniffle. A group of Kenyan prostitutes have immune systems that eat HIV for lunch. The life-and-death differences lie in the genes.
Cancer has a particularly high genetic component. Most cancers arise when something in the environment stresses the genome, reactivating a fetal gene that had been mothballed. Here again, only some people succumb. Current theory calls cancer a matter of statistics. Each human has fifty trillion cells. Most of these divide fiftyfold in an average lifetime: whoever reaches age 70 thus experiences 2,500,000,000,000,000 cell divisions -- the number of stars in 10,000 Milky Ways. If only one division per billion slips up and leads to carcinoma, the average person generates over 2,000,000 cancer cells in a lifetime. But though all of us are constantly getting cancer, our genome has methods to blow it away. Some genes manufacture chemicals called tumour necrosis factors, or TNFs, which butcher cancer cells. Other genes encode for substances that attract TNFs, or that starve tumour cells for blood.
Only when this complex, effective system gets overwhelmed -- by the onslaught of carcinogens in tobacco, or by a defect in a cancer-fighting gene -- does the scale tip and someone "gets cancer." GT began when experimental clinicians wondered what would happen if they could alter the living genome. The result, they felt, could be a radical new surgery at the molecular level-filling gaps, making repairs and strengthening defences. In attempting this, the GT pioneers not only fell over unforeseen obstacles: They made triumphs that proved to be as baffling as their failures.
Dr. French Anderson, an American scientist called the "father of GT," was the first to score a success. In 1990, he took on the case of two four-year-old girls who suffered severe combined immuno-deficiency disease, also called SCID. In his clinical protocol, Dr. Anderson inserted modified genes so that the girls developed healthy immune systems. While it was of irrefutable benefit to the two patients, it's debatable whether Dr. Anderson's first huge success was good for GT. It raised GT's profile from nascent and experimental to that of a saviour. Overnight, dozens of new GT companies sprang up; investors fought over who would bankroll them. Daily press releases trumpeted the discovery of genes "causing" an array of disorders, from MS to osteoarthritis.
Inevitably, setbacks followed. For example, genes implicated in genetic diseases often proved not to be the sole cause. Just as infectious diseases had a gene component, genetic disorders were often mere predispositions which might never erupt without some environmental trigger. Dr. Anderson still predicts that GT will cure other diseases as it cured SCID. He has even proposed GT for the unborn. But as a group, gene therapy researchers received a sharp lesson in the basic motto of science: It's Not As Simple As You Thought.
Consider the "vector," the means by which GT material finds appropriate target cells and invades the cell nucleus. If you think this process sounds familiar, you're right: The common virus has done it from time immemorial. The scientists' conclusion? Enlist the virus as a GT vector.
This poses problems. A virus, observes the Nobel laureate Sir Peter Medawar, is neither dead nor alive: it's "a bit of bad news wrapped up in protein." It's a stripped-down, free-floating genome that can't even reproduce alone. What it is good at -- enough to have imperilled humanity at several junctures -- is invading living cells, cramming its genes into the host nucleus, and remaking the host cell into a high-powered virus factory. But if a virus does this to humanity's peril, the scientists mused, it may also be coaxed to do it to humanity's profit.
Such ideas sound abstract, but their human consequences are profound. This was illustrated in September by what has proved the most tragic check so far to overoptimism about GT -- the death of Jesse Gelsinger, the first person to perish in a GT clinical trial. Mr. Gelsinger had a genetic disease called OTC, which occurs once every 25,000 births. OTC compromises production of a liver enzyme, so that the GT team at the University of Pennsylvania injected a functioning enzyme gene directly into Mr. Gelsinger's hepatic artery. The vector chosen to deliver this gene to his liver cells was a bit of bad news called adenovirus, which in healthy humans causes only a severe cold. In one sense, adenovirus is an efficient vector. It's a master at breaching cellular defences and foisting its genes on human cells. Unfortunately, adenovirus may also provoke a violent immune reaction. The preliminary post mortem suggests this happened to Mr. Gelsinger. "The drug used in the trial," reports the team, led by Dr. James Wilson of the university's Institute for Human Gene Therapy, "initiated an unusual and deadly immune-system response that led to multiple organ failure and death." Because of this catastrophic failure, the U.S. government a few days ago shut down further clinical trials on GT at the university.
In the team's defence, however, animal studies and 17 other human volunteers in the same trial gave no indication that Mr. Gelsinger was at risk before the fact. Further, biotechnologists had attenuated the adenovirus beforehand by deleting critical genes. Still, even that process was a trade off. Dr. Anderson himself wrote in a review paper that "Deleting more and more viral genes may not always be advantageous . . . these genes may have beneficial attributes, for example suppressing an immune response against the vector." As the old saying goes, he who sups with the devil needs a long spoon. In Mr. Gelsinger's case, adenovirus may have been a spoon too short.
GT has arrived in Canada, too. Earlier this month, doctors at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto announced that a local real-estate agent had become the first Canadian to receive gene therapy for coronary disease. Grenville Dungey was given an injection of a DNA-based substance into a part of his heart that was too clogged for surgeons to perform a conventional bypass operation.
The important difference in the Toronto experiment is that doctors did not use a virus to deliver the genetic material. Surgeons simply injected "naked DNA" into his heart to promote the growth of new blood vessels and bring much-needed blood supply to an area of the heart that cannot be operated on in the conventional bypass manner. Heart muscle is one of the few areas in the body where injected DNA can penetrate cells and be beneficial without a special vector.
So far, doctors say Mr. Dungey is making an excellent recovery but that it is too early to say whether GT is responsible. He will return for a full examination in March. In the meantime, he has already returned to work (though only on a part-time basis).
Elsewhere in Canada, several laboratories are also pursuing GT work. One of the most advanced trials is at NeuroVir, a GT company spun off from the research lab of Dr. Frank Tufaro, a professor of Microbiology at the University of B.C. Wisely, the NeuroVir team has chosen a target cell they do not mind destroying: cancer. They have developed a clinical protocol that exposes tumours to Herpes simplex virus. Anecdotal evidence from two clinical trials confirms one fact: HSV hits cancer like a high explosive.
NeuroVir first attenuates HSV by removing critical genes so that the virus cannot replicate unless conditions are optimal -- as they are inside cancer cells. One natural gene left intact is gamma 34.5, which prevents cell death long enough to let the virus replicate. It is, Dr. Tufaro notes, a treatment of last resort for those whom the cancer would otherwise kill in weeks or days.
"We don't fully understand how it works," he confesses. "But it seems clear that HSV has no toxicity to normal organs. It's not even an opportunistic pathogen in cancer patients whose immune systems have been compromised by radiation and chemotherapy. HSV is selectively toxic to cancer cells."
Because of this, he says, HSV dosage appears to have no upper limit. "Since there are no adverse effects on normal cells, there seems to be no such thing as a maximum dose."
How about lingering effects in a patient whose life has been prolonged? That's unlikely, says Dr. Tufaro. "When HSV kills a cancer cell, it also destroys itself."
For all its promise, Dr. Tufaro is very cautious in his claims. "I'd even be tempted not to call it GT," he says. "It's a precursor to the true GT that will occur when we stitch in an oncotoxin [cancer poison]. Now we're just using naturally occurring genetic material for therapy."
Not all scientists share Dr. Tufaro's caution. At Bio 99, a world biotechnology congress held last May in Seattle, one researcher enthusiastically outlined how his company creates artificial chromosomes and inserts them into host cells using Epstein-Barr virus.
A hand rose in the audience. "Epstein-Barr causes mononucleosis and is a suspect in human chronic-fatigue syndrome. Have you had any reservations about using it as a GT vector?" "Nope," said the scientist, without looking up. "Next question."

Montreal building to keep historic feel

Abstract: "We don't intend to renovate the building," said Jean Turcotte, the company's vice-president of development and leasing for shopping centres. "It's so beautiful outside and inside that we really don't need to touch it."

Full text:   Ste-Catherine St. landmark considered architectural gem and new owner plans to keep it that way
Location, location, location. That's the mantra of every real estate agent in the country. And, when you add history, it's a mix that's hard to beat.
That's why the Alexis Nihon Group ,one of Canada's top property managers and landlords, acquired the building at 777 Ste-Catherine Street West in the heart of Montreal last November.
Alexis Nihon is a privately held real estate company based in Montreal that is involved in the development, ownership and management of high-quality office, retail, industrial and residential properties.
The company owns and/or manages buildings and lands that total 15 million square feet. The majority of the properties are located in the Greater Montreal Area. Alexis Nihon said at the time of the purchase that 777 Ste-Catherine was an excellent fit for its portfolio.
The three-storey downtown landmark, built in 1931 on the corner of McGill-College Avenue, is considered an architectural gem. And Alexis Nihon plans to keep it that way.
"We don't intend to renovate the building," said Jean Turcotte, the company's vice-president of development and leasing for shopping centres. "It's so beautiful outside and inside that we really don't need to touch it."
In fact, the building has been so well maintained that it doesn't even require sandblasting or any other cleaning of the exterior or other maintenance work. In addition, it comes with modern HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning), plus electrical, mechanical and security systems.
However, Alexis Nihon will do a bit of work on the inside in preparation for converting the building into a retail site. Currently, the occupant is Laurentian Bank, which sold the site to Alexis Nihon for $12-million, including a $2.5-million balance of sale payable in five years under certain conditions.
The bank will move its branch to its head office and will become a much smaller tenant for the next five years.
"We're in the final stages now of negotiations with a major prospective retail client," Mr. Turcotte said. "We expect to have the building put to retail use by next September. The bank will be there for the next couple of months, then it will lease office space on the second floor."
One change will occur below ground. "There are two basement floors," Mr. Turcotte said, "and we're going to demolish one. That will give us an exciting, 22-foot-high ceiling. The basement, the ground floor and mezzanine will all be linked by escalator."
No blasting is needed to accomplish the new look, he added. "We'll simply cut out the floor. It's concrete, about a foot thick. We'll cut it away to open things up."
At the time of the sale, Paul Masicotte, Alexis Nihon's president, described some of the building's attributes. "Anyone can see at first glance the great attention to detail that went into this building -- its cathedral-like ceilings, its magnificent woodwork, the marble floors, the original brass fixtures, the huge stained-glass windows and the outstanding staircase leading to the mezzanine.
"There is no question this is a highly prestigious location that is bound to attract one or several equally prestigious retail establishments."
Alexis Nihon plans to spend $3-million to convert the site to retail space, and had set a deadline of this spring to find a major new tenant.
"We will keep all the heritage [associated with the building]," Mr. Turcotte said. "The new tenant will occupy the total retail area, and will be allowed to advertise that way. In terms of signage, that will be up to the retailer. They can certainly advertise the site under their name.
"We'll retain ownership and negotiate long-term leases with the new tenants."
He also said the site offers the new tenant -- and any others who may come on board -- more than simply a place to do business.
"This building is a premier business address that has always been the envy of local retailers. It is actually a high-visibility building because of its outstanding location at the heart of Montreal's busiest commercial district and in the immediate neighbourhood of Place Ville-Marie, Place Montréal Trust and the Centre Eaton."
Among Alexis Nihon's other shopping-centre and multi-use properties are: Centre Laval in Laval, Que., at 653,358 square feet; L'Acadie I, II and III in Montreal, at 118,222; Place Alexis Nihon in Westmount, Que., at 1,768,841; and South Common Mall in Mississauga at 236,358.

Full text: With failing hands they passed the flaming sambuca at the Londoner early yesterday.
The 20th anniversary of Ken Read's historic World Cup win on the famed Streif may have faded into memory, but the party triggered by that victory lives on at the tiny Kitzbuehel pub, a tradition on the Hahnenkamm weekend and a rite of passage for the new generation of Canadian downhill skiers.
It was on the Streif, the most treacherous piece of alpine real estate on the World Cup circuit, where the Crazy Canucks -- Reed, Steve Podborski, Dave Murray and Dave Irwin -- forged much of their daredevil reputation. But it was at the Londoner that Canadians made a more lasting impression with their happy-go-lucky nature, becoming the toast of the World Cup.
While a stop at the Londoner on Saturday night remains one of the must-do things on the Hahnenkamm party scene, more has changed over the years than the pub's location and the music pounding out of dozens of speakers. The doormen still cram in far more people than the bar can hold, but the crowd now seems more interested in being seen than seeing.
Now, women who strip get a free bottle of champagne.
Although there are few takers, there are enough clothes found at the end of Saturday evening to call a local charity to pick them up.
"I can't believe how many clothes we find and what kind," said Nina Gunnell, who has taken over as manager from her father, Rick. "Bras, panties, garters, expensive ski jackets, pants, socks . . . you wonder what people wear home.
The once traditional champagne shower has also all but disappeared, replaced with spraying of beer.
It was a case of champagne that sparked the Londoner tradition. Owner Rick Gunnell, now 70, offered the bubbly to any English-speaking skier if they could win the Hahnenkamm downhill race.
Of course, there has been little to celebrate in recent years, Todd Brooker being the last Canadian to tame the Streif, in 1982. Rob Boyd, with a third place, in 1991 and American A.J. Kitt, second the next year, brought renewed energy to the party, but that heat soon faded.
Whether the Canadians return to the Londoner each year out of obligation or tradition, those who do wander in spend little time mingling with the crowd, moving directly behind the bar, where their shirts are ripped off, before being put to work serving drinks.
But unlike past years when recognizable Hahnenkamm Siegers such as legendary Austrian Franz Klammer, Frenchman Luc Alphand and Italian Kristian Ghedina played barman to the sweaty crowd, the downhillers behind the bar on Saturday were mostly those of the World Cup circuit's faceless grinders.
Luke Sauder, a nine-year veteran of the Canadian team and likely unrecognized outside his hometown of Cambridge, Ont., was pouring draft alongside American Daron Rahlves, who has had more success racing personal watercraft than on the World Cup circuit.
A few other equally anonymous racers, such as Kevin Wert of Rossland, B.C., worked the room, unnoticed.
The only buzz that swept through the bar occurred when Josef (Pepi) Strobl, second in Saturday's downhill, maked a surprise visit. Canada's top downhiller, Ed Podivinsky, who has seen it all before, was at the casino.
And the man who started it all, Read, in town for the Hahnenkamm's 60th anniversary and the legends race, was tucked away in a quiet pension on the outskirts of Kitzbuehel, untempted to revisit the past.
"The nice thing about it is that it still seems like yesterday," said Read, one of the few legends skiers who was able to fit into a racing suit.
"I can't believe it's been 20 years. I can still feel that feeling when I ski past the Steilhang.
"But what I appreciate the most about the Londoner is that it was nice that we started it.
"What's special about it was that so many of the skiers -- at some point in time -- ended up going there after the race, and not just the English racers.
"I've got a picture of Klammer and I sipping a beer. Steve [Podborski], Klammer and I were 1-2-3 in 1982."
The few aging people who do make it to the Londoner every year, most of them ski representatives and service men, trade well-worn tales of excess.
A favourite memory involves Alphand, who celebrated his back-to-back downhills on the Streif in 1995 at the Londoner and was found passed out in the corner under a pile of coats by cleaners as they removed the broken bottles and glasses the next morning.
In 1997, the U.S. ski team banned its racers from the Londoner after Olympic champion Tommy Moe slashed his right thumb on broken glass and missed the remainder of the season. The Americans were only allowed back to the bar this year.
"I actually have no memory of going to the Londoner," Brooker said with a laugh. "All I can remember is that we left for Sarajevo the next morning at 5 a.m. and I was driving the equipment van. That was one hell of a drive."
The only permanent reminder of Canada's role in the pub is a beer-stained photograph of a group of Canadian skiers standing naked in front of Toad Hall.
When one partygoer was asked whether he knew who the skiers in the photo are, he looked intently for a minute, then slurred his answer.
"I'm not sure," he said, taking a gulp of beer. "But they look crazy."

Bryden not packing it in -- yet

Abstract: "So it's going to take a few days to assess that and to determine what do we do," [Rod Bryden] said. "And by a few days. It might be 10, but it's not 30. It's not one, so please don't call every day and [ask] if it's the day."

Full text: Senators' owner to figure out whether tax relief from other governments enough for team to stay in Ottawa
Ottawa Senators owner Rod Bryden declined to throw a tantrum in the face of the stunning turnaround by the federal government on a subsidy for Canadian-based National Hockey League teams.
"I almost wish I could say we're out of here . . . or we're not," Bryden said to a room full of reporters yesterday. "Because if you're tired of reporting this, you're not half as tired as I am delivering it.
"However, this is a very serious issue, and it's one you cannot deal with by petulance. By saying, 'I'm leaving.' It's too important to this community and it's too important to me to do that."
Bryden said the government's decision to renege on a handout plan that could have given $3.5-million a year to his team does not mean the franchise is for sale again. He said that may happen, but he wants to take the next several days to see whether it's possible tax relief from the Ontario and local governments and a strengthening economy in the Ottawa area will be enough to prevent him from moving the team.
"I did not begin the debate [concerning tax relief from the government] in order to provide a public cover for a desire to leave," Bryden said. "I will personally consider it a personal failure if this hockey club does not remain in Kanata, at least for this year, and [in the future].
"I believe that this city has the strength to maintain a National Hockey League team, and the only reason it will have to leave is as a result of inappropriate and an unfair level of public costs."
The bottom line, Bryden said, is to determine whether he can still trim $10-million to $12-million from his total annual tax bill of $37-million. If so, he indicated, the team may not have to be sold and moved.
He isn't sure the move by the Ontario government to tie a reduction in the property taxes on the Corel Centre to approval from the municipal government is still in place. "But I think it is," Bryden said, adding that he will still pursue negotiations with the province to cut the Senators' amusement tax by operating games under the umbrella of a charity.
"So it's going to take a few days to assess that and to determine what do we do," Bryden said. "And by a few days. It might be 10, but it's not 30. It's not one, so please don't call every day and [ask] if it's the day."
However, Bryden said, his decision has to be soon because if it's negative, the plan to move the team for next season will have to be put quickly in motion.
The official reaction from the NHL was sharper. Commissioner Gary Bettman said he was "not as optimistic as I was Tuesday," when federal Industry Minister John Manley said the government would negotiate individually with the six Canadian NHL teams for aid that could have been worth a total of $20-million.
While Bettman said the NHL's first priority will be to work to keep any of the six Canadian teams from moving, he hinted the league could consider legal action against the federal and provincial governments. This move would concern sports lotteries based on NHL games.
While the NHL said last fall it would be willing to take a share of the lottery proceeds to help the Canadian teams, it remains opposed to the idea of gambling on its games. But the bigger issue is that none of the governments pay a licensing fee to the NHL for using its games.
"For me to say now we're going after the lotteries would be petulant," Bettman said, echoing Bryden. "But I will say that at the appropriate time we will review our options."
Bettman also said the NHL's Canadian Assistance Plan, which has paid several million dollars to the small-market teams in Canada over the past few years, could be in jeopardy. The NHL board of governors approved a five-year extension on the plan last month, but that was conditional on the three levels of government in Canada chipping in tax money.
Now, Bettman said, "in order for the plan to be acceptable for next year I have to go back to the board of governors for their approval."
Bettman danced around the question of whether the league would seek to reopen the collective labour agreement before it expires in 2004. Before breaking its promise to the NHL teams, the federal government had said the aid would be available only until 2004. Manley said that was to tide the Canadian teams over until the NHL could get its own house in order by putting salary caps and revenue sharing in a new collective agreement with the players.
"I'm not going to try and throw down a gauntlet to challenge anyone," Bettman said when asked whether he would seek the NHL Players' Association's permission to reopen the agreement. "The union will respond when it sees fit."
The union has already refused one management request to reopen the deal. That came late last year when the NHL was discussing possible participation in the 2002 Olympic Games.
NHLPA executive director Bob Goodenow's only reaction yesterday was to issue a statement saying each Canadian team has to once again "deal with the issues of Canadian currency and taxation on an individual basis."
However, no NHL observer expects the NHLPA to agree to renegotiate the collective agreement before 2004.
The government's reversal spurred at least one Senators fan into action. Charlie Sezlik, an Ottawa real-estate agent and Senators season ticket subscriber, feels that the government is being penny wise but pound foolish. He spent part of the day on the telephone yesterday to give local MPs exactly that message. A recent father, Sezlik joked that he was taking the stand so his son would have a local team to root for.
"The cost of losing the teams is greater than the cost of the subsidy," he said in an interview. "What about the tax base the team provides? The lost taxes from the players' salaries alone [if the team was moved] is substantially more than the subsidy. From a business standpoint, it's a terrible decision."
Loyal fans such as Sezlik are why Bryden is not immediately saying the team is for sale again, although he revisited his remark from earlier in the week that the For Sale sign was put away in his garage.
"The sign must still be in the garage, but it's probably useful that we didn't burn it," Bryden said.

Full text: Tofino, the internationally renowned tree-hugging capital of Canada, is embroiled in a debate over preserving the town's symbol after a developer chopped down a 1,000-year-old red cedar.
A delegation of citizens is planning to lobby the town council at a meeting today to protect the trees of Tofino after the so-called millennium tree was reduced to wood chips last month.
"It's a monument to ecological illiteracy," said Joe James, who formed the Tofino Heritage Tree Project and who filmed a short documentary about the red cedar called Tofino Giant , which premiered last fall at the town's film festival.
"Everyone thinks Tofino is tree friendly. But it's like a frontier. Trees are getting whacked left and right. It's kind of embarrassing," he said.
Tofino, a community of 1,100 on the edge of Pacific Rim National Park, is the home of Clayoquot Sound, the pristine Vancouver Island site of massive environmental protests in 1993. In one of Canada's largest acts of civil disobedience, more than 800 people were arrested for blocking loggers from harvesting old-growth rain forests.
Last month, residents held a candlelight vigil to mourn the loss of Tofino's oldest tree. The municipality does not have any bylaws to protect trees on private and public property.
"It's sad, but it was certainly not a viable tree," said Tofino town councillor Jim Schwartz. "It was a dead tree. There are millions of other trees to look at here."
Town council has not yet received a development proposal for the half-acre lot on which the cedar stood, Mr. Schwartz said.
The local real-estate agent said he is against any bylaws that would prevent landowners from developing their own property.
"What we have is an idealistic fringe who want to impose their views on a community," he said. "If you name a tree Herbie or give it a personality, it doesn't mean it's yours."
But newly elected town councillor Sergio Paone, the former director of the Friends of Clayoquot Sound, said it's time the town considered ways of protecting heritage trees.
"I was very sad to see that tree go," Mr. Paone said. "Maybe it is time we should seriously consider a bylaw."
Tofino Heritage Tree Project's Mr. James, a 35-year-old local restaurant worker who runs the town's cinema, said his group, having lost the battle for the millennium tree, will seek a heritage designation for another red cedar, which is on public land and is estimated to be about 700 years old.
"It was an incredible work of art," said Mr. James of the felled tree. "But it's toast now, so we're focusing on the ones we can save."

Full text: PACK OF THIEVES: How Hitler and Europe Plundered the Jews and Committed the Greatest Theft in History By Richard Z. Chesnoff Doubleday, 325 pages, $42
The final and complete audit will never be performed, so let's go with Richard Chesnoff's educated and conservative guesstimate: Between 1934, the year after Hitler's National Socialists came to power in Germany, and 1945, the Third Reich and its beneficiaries looted somewhere between $8-billion and $10-billion (U.S.) in cash, stocks and bonds, gold, real estate, art, jewellery, furs, antiques, furniture, carpets and other valuables from its European victims.
By any measure, it was the heist of this or any other century; compared to it, the Great Train Robbery was a Sunday mugging in the park. Perhaps the Venetians, in their heyday, looted their maritime empire for more, but they took the better part of a millennium to do it. The Nazis and their allies did most of their thieving in six hurly-burly years -- and they did it largely against a single ethno-religious group, the Jews.
Chesnoff, a senior correspondent for U.S. News and World Report, lays out the crime in stunning, if not exhaustive, detail. And, as he makes clear, the orchestrated impoverishment of European Jewry was simply the first in a series of ever-more-menacing measures designed to demonize and dehumanize Jews, eradicate their identities and prepare them for the Endlosung , Hitler's Final Solution.
Everywhere, the Aryanization process was conducted with speed, ruthless efficiency and thoroughness. In one country after the other, Jews were forcibly evicted from the economy and stripped of their holdings.
In Slovakia, for example, it took a single year to liquidate more than 10,000 businesses owned by Jews and "transfer" them to Aryan owners. In the neighbouring Czech Republic, where the notorious Adolf Eichmann set up headquarters, Jews were required -- under threat of violence or imprisonment -- to surrender any property worth more than 10,000 Crowns (about $300 today); to sell all precious metals and jewellery to a Nazi-controlled agency; and to turn over all stocks, bonds and securities to a foreign-currency bank.
In the Netherlands, the bureaucracy of theft was so well organized that a new word was added to the Dutch language -- pulsen -- meaning to systematically loot a house. It derived from the name of an Amsterdam moving company whose trucks were used to empty Jewish homes of their contents, as soon as their former residents had been shipped off in trains to the death camps.
In Amsterdam, too, the Nazis seized a mid-sized Jewish-owned bank, the Liro, turned it over to a local sympathizer and ordered all other Dutch banks to transfer known Jewish accounts to its ledgers. Further restrictions followed: cash, cheques, gold, silver, jewellery, bonds, insurance policies -- everything had to be on deposit at the Liro. By 1942, the Liro had absorbed assets worth the contemporary equivalent of $1-billion (U.S.), not including some 19,000 real-estate properties that were also confiscated.
Chesnoff properly accords a special seat of dishonour to the Swiss, who opened their banks to Jewish money -- though not their borders to the persecuted owners -- in the late 1930s, then proceeded to steal it, and covered up the theft for five decades. Swiss banks also served up hundreds of millions of dollars in credit to the Third Reich, and provided convenient laundering facilities for Nazi gold bullion thefts from various occupied countries. The Swiss, as World Jewish Congress president Edgar Bronfman concluded, "were the biggest bastards of all."
But the story is the same everywhere; only the currency changes, from Dutch guilders to Norwegian kroners to French francs to Hungarian pengos. All too often, Jews who went into hiding to avoid the one-way express to Auschwitz were informed on by non-Jewish neighbours, who would then try to loot Jewish apartments before the authorities arrived. Sometimes, they looted first and then bought permission to keep the booty by disclosing the whereabouts of Jews.
In fact, this blurring of lines between official and sanctioned freelance theft has complicated the challenge of those attempting to recover stolen assets or seeking to document the totals. Chesnoff quotes one French historian who asked: "How do you estimate the cash stolen from apartments, the monies confiscated from people rounded up, the amounts handed over to non-Jews for 'safekeeping,' the amounts taken from safety deposit vaults . . . the value of tons of stolen jewellery . . . furniture and personal effects . . . the contents of all those ateliers, shops and studios . . . the machines, the tools, the raw materials?"
Here and there, a few survivors managed to be recompensed in some measure for their wartime losses. Various countries, including Canada, have established commissions to investigate the issues involved, with mixed results. And after thorny negotiations, Swiss bankers finally agreed in 1998 to a combined restitution valued at $1.25-billion (U.S.) for the families of thousands of account-holders -- a payout that has inspired an unseemly dispute about how to distribute these funds . But the vast majority of victims, especially those East Europeans for whom Nazi terror was quickly followed by Communist tyranny, will never be compensated.
Chesnoff leavens his narrative with several personal stories that poignantly register the enormity of the individual losses. I could have used more of these humanizing details, in fact, because there are times when the accumulated weight of the numbers begins to stupefy. There are also a couple of curious omissions from the survey, including the fate of properties stolen from Italian and Belgian Jews.
Perhaps it is too soon, even now, to produce the definitive account of history's greatest act of plunder. Chesnoff concedes as much. Perhaps there can be no final reckoning until the many accomplices, including supposedly neutral nations and prominent bankers in the Western hemisphere, have been fully investigated and exposed. In the meantime, this sobering interim report will more than do. Michael Posner is an arts reporter with The Globe and Mail.

Britain counts the costs of Pinochet case

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/britain-counts-costs-pinochet-case/docview/384383164/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The foundation is also expected to pay for his living costs. Gen. [Augusto Pinochet] has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds renting a luxury mansion at Wentworth, an exclusive estate near London, where he has been under house arrest. Rents in the area range from £6,000 to £10,000 a month, according to local real-estate agents.

Full text: U.K. taxpayers will pick up most of tab for general's stay
Few people given an official welcome to Britain by the Foreign Office leave behind a multimillion-pound bill when they go, the bulk of which is to be paid by British taxpayers.
Yet that is the likely scenario in the case of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who is expected to fly home within a few days, more than 15 months after he walked into the VIP lounge at London's Heathrow airport.
He had no idea then that he would be held by police and forced to wage an intense legal struggle to avoid extradition to Spain.
Barring an unlikely about-turn, the head of a former military regime blamed for the deaths of more than 3,000 people will be able to return home shortly, now that British Home Secretary Jack Straw has said he is inclined to release the 84-year-old general on health grounds.
The bill that General Pinochet has run up during his enforced sojourn here is estimated by the British press, in the absence of any official figures, at considerably more than £10-million ($24-million) in legal and security costs.
The legal bill alone, in a case that has gone all the way to the House of Lords, the highest court in the land, is put at more than £6-million.
Gen. Pinochet chose one of London's leading, and more expensive, law firms -- Kingsley Napley -- to defend him.
Last year, the House of Lords agreed that the state should pay most of the costs of four hearings that debated the general's claim to immunity against the charges of human-rights abuses brought by Spain.
Gen. Pinochet himself, surrounded by British and Chilean lawyers, is thought to have accumulated a personal legal bill of around £2-million, some of which will be paid by the British taxpayer.
He can, of course, count on the Pinochet Foundation, set up in Santiago by his friends and headed by a former minister in his 1973-1990 dictatorship.
Its funds have come from former leaders and sympathizers of his regime, as well as British firms seeking to retain friendly links with influential figures in Chile, according to press reports.
The foundation is also expected to pay for his living costs. Gen. Pinochet has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds renting a luxury mansion at Wentworth, an exclusive estate near London, where he has been under house arrest. Rents in the area range from £6,000 to £10,000 a month, according to local real-estate agents.
Gen. Pinochet may, of course, seek to claim back his living costs from British authorities, further burdening taxpayers here.
One portion of the bill that he will not have to pay is security. It has been estimated at £4-million to £5-million.
Three specialized police protection officers occupy one room in the Wentworth mansion 24 hours a day, while other armed police and guard dogs are on permanent patrol around the perimeter.

Full text: After 25 years as CEO, Bill Gates is stepping down to return to what he started in his teens: developing software. But the world and his life have changed a lot since then.
He is said to have taken only six days off between 1978 and 1984. Now the world's richest man is going back to where it all began.
Bill Gates, who wrote his first computer program at age 13, said he will become "chief software architect" at Microsoft Corp. after stepping down as chief executive officer, a role he has held for 25 years.
Mr. Gates will continue to oversee Microsoft's operations as chairman, but said yesterday that he will spend most of his time doing what he loves best -- "focusing on technologies for the future."
Whether you love him or hate him, you're probably familiar with the story of Bill Gates -- the American icon who dropped out of Harvard University during his junior year to co-found Microsoft with Paul Allen, a hometown friend.
Together, they took BASIC, a computer language used on large computers, and adapted it for use in programming the first microcomputers.
A few years later, they got their big break in a deal with International Business Machines Corp. Microsoft licensed the MS-DOS operating system for use on IBM's first microcomputer.
Over time, Mr. Gates was able to secure a stranglehold over the entire computer industry as the IBM PC -- and MS-DOS -- became the industry standard. The operating system is still used in more than 85 per cent of all personal computers.
Through his Windows operating software, then through his Internet browser Explorer, Mr. Gates was able to ensure that Microsoft remained the dominant force in the computer industry.
Mr. Gates' roots in software development go back to his teens.
In high school Mr. Gates turned a quick buck by founding Traf-O-Data, a company that sold traffic-counting systems to local governments.
By 1986, he had become a billionaire. And in 1995, Mr. Gates became the world's richest man when his personal wealth reached $12.9-billion (U.S.), displacing Japanese real estate magnate Yoshiaki Tsutsumi.
In his 1995 book The Road Ahead, Mr. Gates reveals that his 1994 taxes totalled "more than $100-million." His personal fortune is now estimated to be worth about $85-billion.
He has spent some of his wealth on a collection of expensive sportscars and a $50-million computer-controlled private complex on a bluff overlooking Lake Washington.
The house has a reception hall big enough to entertain 100 people comfortably for dinner and a trampoline room, according to The Road Ahead . In the book, Mr. Gates describes his home as "about average for a large house."
While Mr. Gates has certainly been lucky, he has also worked hard for his money.
And he expects as much from his employees -- dubbed "Microserfs" by company critics -- who are expected to work 80 hour weeks.
In 1994, Mr. Gates married a fellow Microserf -- marketing director Melinda French, who is 10 years younger than he is.
A private individual by nature, Mr. Gates has reluctantly become a more public figure in recent years as Microsoft's power and reputation grew. He has also had to respond to attacks from the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division. May 22, 1990: Microsoft releases Windows 3.0, the operating system that hands it domination of the computing industry. Aug. 24, 1995: Windows 95 was launched to the tune of The Rolling Stones Start Me Up. Dec. 7, 1995: Bill Gates proclaims "We're hard-core on the Internet," endorsing the medium he had dismissed just months earlier. Aug. 6, 1997: Microsoft invests $150-million (U.S.) in Apple in exchange for non-voting stock and says it will produce more of its software for use on Macintosh computers. May 18, 1998: The U.S. government and 20 states launch a landmark anitrust case against Microsoft. Sept. 14, 1998: Microsoft becomes the world's most valuable company. Nov. 5, 1999: Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issues a stinging rebuke to Microsft in the antitrust trial, saying it is a monopolist that abuses its power.
BILL GATES
Founder and chairman, Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash. Born: Oct. 28, 1955, Seattle, Wash. Education: Dropped out of Harvard University in his junior year. Career: Founded Microsoft Corp. in 1975 Quotable: "Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose." Career 1975: Bill Gates co-founds Microsoft with high school friend Paul Allen. He becomes chief executive officer. 1980: Microsoft licenses MS-DOS to IBM, the world's biggest computer supplier. 1981: The IBM PC is released. Microsoft retains the right to sell MS-DOS to other suppliers. 1983: Microsoft introduces Word, a word-processing program, and starts work on Windows. 1986: Bill Gates becomes a paper billionaire as Microsoft goes public. 1999: Microsoft is found to have a monopoly. 2000: Bill Gates steps down as CEO to become Microsoft's "chief software architect."

Full text: U.S. investors are becoming increasingly attracted to the province's potential, analysts say
The new investment into Vancouver-based Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Tuesday by the other, less-famous Microsoft Corp. co-founder, Paul Allen, was more than just a big vote of confidence in the struggling young television and film concern.
The $33.2-million (U.S.) stake by a group that included the Microsoft billionaire is the latest chunk of American capital to land in British Columbia.
While the flow of Asian capital into B.C. real estate provided plenty of international investment into the province during the eighties and nineties, observers say that is now being supplanted with capital from south of the border. And more often than not, it is landing in the province's blossoming high-tech sector -- software, Internet companies, biotechs and the like.
A breakdown of the exact amount of American investments into individual provinces is not done by the provincial or federal governments, economists say, but they've noticed trends.
"With the combination of the Asian crisis and the souring of [Asian] people on British Columbia because of its business climate, there has definitely been a falling off of Asian capital into B.C.," said Jock Finlayson, vice-president of policy and analysts at the Business Council of British Columbia, an employers' group. "The main foreign investment we've witnessed in recent years is from U.S. to B.C. businesses."
The money isn't coming in the form of new projects, such as aluminum smelters the likes of which former premier Glen Clark liked to boast about, "it's from takeovers," Mr. Finlayson said.
The province's resource and other sectors have certainly been recipients of U.S. takeover money. Weyerhaeuser Co.'s stock purchase of British Columbia's icon of the woods MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. last year was the most spectacular example. Even Microsoft indirectly invested in the resource sector when an investment company of co-founder Bill Gates bought $12-million worth of Pan American Silver Corp. of Vancouver, giving him a 10-per-cent holding.
But analysts believe the incursion of the greenback is destined mainly for the B.C. tech sector, a $5.2-billion (Canadian) industry that boasts 46,100 jobs.
"There's no question that there's an increasing amount of interest from U.S. investors in the high-potential technology deals in B.C.," said Steve Hnatiuk, a technology executive with consulting company PricewaterhouseCoopers in Vancouver. "B.C. companies are finding their way on the radar screen in the U.S."
"High tech is the only game in town," agreed Maria Pinelli, a partner in the high-tech group of Ernst & Young in Vancouver. "It sure is hot."
Some recent pricey acquisitions by U.S. players of B.C. companies include California high-tech company Broadcom Corp.'s purchase last summer of HotHaus Technologies Inc., a small Vancouver software company, for about $414-million. And in the fall, Redback Networks Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., merged with the 40-employee Vancouver software development office of Mountain View, Calif.-based Siara Systems. The deal was worth $4.3-billion (U.S.).
B.C. companies are well aware of the strong U.S. interest in the province's tech companies, so many have chosen the Nasdaq Stock Market -- rather than a Canadian one -- to list their shares. Creo Products Inc., a digital printing company in Burnaby, and Pivotal Corp., a software and E-commerce systems provider in Vancouver, are two examples.
Even star high-tech American executives are feeling the lure of B.C.'s tech world. Former Microsoft chief financial officer Greg Maffei quit that job to head Worldwide Fiber Inc., a much smaller Vancouver company that makes high-speed fibre-optic networks.
The appeal is this: "We have a lot of world-class technology being developed here," PWC's Mr. Hnatiuk said. And with competition to get in on Silicon Valley tech deals getting more fierce, Americans are looking up the coast and across the border for opportunities, he added.
With the low Canadian dollar -- relative to the U.S. greenback -- the price tags on Canadian companies are more realistic than the stratospheric valuations of some American firms. And venture capital companies scouting for deals get a good hearing in British Columbia, Mr. Hnatiuk said.
Foreign investment can profoundly affect a local economy. The last time a bullish Asia-Pacific economy woke up to British Columbia -- the invasion of Hong Kong and other Asian money in the eighties into the province's real estate sector -- a sleepy housing market became the most expensive in the country, and the Vancouver skyline was forever changed. Concord Pacific, a state-of-the-art condo community on the shores of Vancouver's False Creek, got started through Asian billionaire Li Ka-shing.
But when Hong Kong reverted back to Chinese rule in 1997, and some investors got fed up with the province's high taxes and choking bureaucracy, many investors and their capital departed.
Observers see major differences between the Asian money and the high-tech investments now entering. While a byproduct of the wash of Asian capital was the creation of a great deal of housing -- much of it prohibitively expensive -- analysts believe the wealth being flung off by the hot American economy into British Columbia will help ease its deficit-wracked, overtaxed economy, which is struggling with a downturn in the resources sector.
"High-tech generates high-paying jobs," Mr. Hnatiuk said, "and in terms of the spinoff benefits for the broader B.C. economy, there's no question that will help."
He said tech deals are not being driven by speculation on future prices, as with real estate transactions, "but on the strength of management and the quality of technologies."
Because the tech sector pays high salaries ($56,000 a year on average) and brings about rich deals, wealth generation is a characteristic and another plus for the province, he says.
Also, federal government tax credits give the industry a shot in the arm, Ernst & Young's Ms. Pinelli said.
However, a survey by the British Columbia Technology Industries Association (BCTIA) found that among the 216 chief executive officers of B.C. tech companies polled for its recent ReportCard 99, 80 per cent rated the province as ineffective on that front.
There are always risks that when a U.S. company comes calling, the talent may eventually move from British Columbia. That hasn't happened at Electronic Arts Canada, a division of the California software entertainment giant Electronic Arts Inc. At the company's facility in suburban Vancouver, the payroll has grown to 550 employees from 85, which was the head count when the parent bought out Distinctive Software, an entertainment software company created by EA's current president of Worldwide Studios, Don Mattrick.
Yet Paul Lee, chief operating officer at the Worldwide Studios in Burnaby and chair of the BCTIA, said that when a U.S. firm buys a company in British Columbia, the work force may stay, but the local operations stop growing as rapidly. "Growth here [in Burnaby] has slowed, and we have shifted projects that could have been done here to somewhere else in the EA world."
The ReportCard 99 survey supports that. It found that while the CEOs planned to increase their total employment by 27 per cent in the next year, two of every five new jobs will be created outside of British Columbia, bringing the job growth rate down to 16 per cent.
The high personal income tax rate in the province (the top marginal rate is over 52 per cent) is the main culprit that risks making the sector uncompetitive, Mr. Lee said. When a high-tech employee can take home 30 to 40 per cent more pay just by crossing the border, "you get concerned about the risk [of losing talent]." Mr. Lee would rather see tax breaks than incentives. "We need these handcuffs taken off so we can compete."
The ReportCard says CEOs in the sector find it difficult hiring top managers because of the tax rates. Electronic Arts' Mr. Lee agrees: "We've got great people and technology in B.C., but haven't been able to get to the next level, so we sell our companies to those that have management. If we can't get management talent in, we can't get these companies to grow."
Credit Union Central economist Helmut Pastrick said another reality of the sector is that while it is strong, growing and full of quality people and ideas, it doesn't contribute to that much of the overall provincial economy yet.
He pointed to B.C. government statistics that show the sector represented 3.1 per cent of the province's total gross domestic product in 1997. That's in comparison to the U.S. figure of 20 per cent of total economic output.
Ms. Pinelli believes that with the interest from the United States, and the quality of the local industry, the province will have staying power and will continue to grow. But she warned that the vital ingredient in the success of a high-tech company is speed in getting a product to market -- and that depends on adequate financing. The lack of speed is the sector's greatest risk.
"You don't know where emerging technology will come from. If it's brought to market immediately, it could make your product obsolete."

Full text: Troncones is unique for what isn't making waves -- land-title and environmental feuds
Former Alaska fisherman Dewey McMillin has done something unique in the world of Mexican beachfront development. He's made everyone happy.
Mr. McMillin, the first foreigner to settle in this sleepy village in Guerrero state, led local inhabitants through the red tape of getting proper title to their collectively held land, helped them parcel it amongst themselves, and then spearheaded a sales campaign to draw in wealthy foreigners. Since the villagers started selling their land in 1995, the price of a beachfront lot here has risen from less then $10,000 (U.S.) to almost $80,000.
Even though some sold early and cheap, the 60 families of Troncones aren't complaining. They are among the more affluent residents of an otherwise impoverished state known as a hotbed of drug-trafficking and guerrilla activity. Most Troncones families have concrete houses and cars. Several have started their own businesses. Others have jobs in the handful of hotels and restaurants built here on the Pacific Coast about 240 kilometres north of Acapulco.
"It was the gringos that benefited from the run-up in prices," says Mario Izazaga, the current village leader and a local cattle rancher. "But we are satisfied because our quality of life has improved considerably."
The foreign buyers are pleased as well. In Troncones, crime is minimal. There isn't any pollution to speak of. And, perhaps most important, the newcomers don't feel that the locals resent them. "Relations with the community have consistently been good," says Jim Garritty, who owns the Eden Beach Hacienda hotel here with his wife, Eva Robbins.
What Mr. McMillin, 50 years old, has engineered is a world apart from the land-title disputes that have soured relations among locals and U.S. settlers in the north, along the Baja peninsula. It's also a far cry from the nasty clashes taking place on the Caribbean coast between hotel builders and local environmentalists.
The key to achieving harmony, Mr. McMillin says, is a little common sense, an arms-length relationship with government authorities -- and a good lawyer. "You can do business here just like you do in the States," he says. "The trick is not to leave your brain at the border."
Mr. McMillin didn't expect to become a real-estate czar when he and his wife arrived here on vacation in 1983 and decided to stay. Troncones was a remote and poor place then. Although it had a massive beach break that was a favourite of California and Mexican surfers, it hadn't drawn any attention from Mexican authorities, who were concentrating on the development of Ixtapa bay down the coast.
In those days, Troncones was an ejido , a land co-operative owned and farmed jointly by the 60 families. Housed in mud huts without electricity or running water, they eked out a living growing beans and corn and diving for shellfish, or working in construction in Ixtapa.
In 1992, the Constitution was changed to allow ejidos , the principal form of landholding in the country since the Mexican revolution, to be broken up and sold as private land. Mr. McMillin, who at the time was managing a beach bar called the Burro Borracho , or Drunken Donkey, got wind of the change. He went to the nearby town of La Union to find out how land reform worked and then called a meeting of the villagers.
Eliseo Sanchez was skeptical at first. But he also figured he had little to lose. He lived in a small house made of old paper cartons and, because he had burst an eardrum diving for lobsters, was having a tough time making ends meet for his wife and six kids. But as head of the ejido , he had learned to work with Mr. McMillin and the other foreigners who had settled in Troncones and were paying rent to the families. "Dewey was straight," Mr. Sanchez said. "He didn't try and take advantage of us."
The villagers and a team from the agrarian reform ministry began surveying and parceling up about 14 square kilometres of ejido land. Each family got five 1,000-square-metre beachfront lots, two lots in the village, which is set back from the coast, and up to three in the mountains behind the village. Mr. McMillin then brought in bankers from Zihuatanejo, the most-developed town in the area, to explain bank accounts and certificates of deposit.
The villagers got individual title to their land in December, 1995, and Mr. McMillin soon began driving in busloads of visitors from Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa to show them properties. Along with the land reform came speculators: Mark Gibson of Canada and David Brown of England, two long-time Zihuatanejo residents, accumulated 28 lots between them. Mr. McMillin bought five. Meanwhile, $10,000 was such big money in a place where the daily wage is under $4 that several villagers sold their beach lots as fast as they could. Despite Mr. McMillin's urging that the locals bank the money, several of the early sellers literally drank their newfound wealth.
It didn't take long for land prices to skyrocket, as young Americans and Canadians arrived. Mr. McMillin took a 5-per-cent cut of the price of each property he sold, while Mr. Connell, who first came to Troncones to surf as a teenager, did the paperwork. Because foreigners can't own land outright within about 56 kilometres of the coast, Mr. Connell set up corporations and trusts -- which can be wholly foreign-owned -- to hold the property. Both men are now looking to do business with other ejidos .

Abstract: The single most important event of Nortel's journey was its 1969 decision, backed by then-parent Bell Canada, to launch its own research and development lab. Nortel was forced to develop its own technology after its 70-year-old ties with the U.S. Bell system were severed. An agreement between AT&T and the U.S. Justice Department dried up Nortel's access to U.S. product designs.

Full text: It's an exclusive club, with just eight members.
Only a handful of Canadian high-tech firms has broken $1-billion in annual sales, and each has taken quite a different path on the road to a billion -- and the big leagues in high-tech.
Nortel Networks Corp. was the first to join the club, nearly a quarter of a century ago, driven there by a crucial 1969 decision to launch a domestic research program.
It would be more than 10 years before it had any company.
In the late 1980s, CAE Inc. , the aerospace firm, broke the $1-billion barrier.
Next was Newbridge Networks Corp. , in 1997, which breached a billion in spite of a disastrous acquisition a year earlier. A hot pace of internal growth put ATI Technologies Inc. over a billion in 1998. Celestica Inc. had topped a billion well before it went public in 1998.
And 1999 saw two companies join the club: CGI Group Inc. , with its aggressive acquisition strategy; and Mitel Corp. , breaching a billion after 26 years. The newest member of the club, Geac Computer Corp. Ltd. , is also the only Canadian software company to have more than a billion dollars in sales.
CELESTICA INC.
Toronto Computer and telecom equipment manufacturer www.celestica.com Fiscal 1999 revenue (est.): $5-billion (U.S.) The road to a billion: Fuelled by strong internal growth and 17 acquisitions since going public, Celestica has quickly become one of Canada's largest high-tech companies with expected revenue of $10-billion by 2001.
Celestica makes everything from routers to circuit boards, and its biggest customers include Nortel Networks Corp., and Sun Microsystems Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
Eugene Polistuk, Celestica's president and chief executive officer, says the recipe for success has been a combination of good timing and a focused strategy.
"The sector we're in is growing dramatically and the kind of attributes that people are looking for fit nicely with the capabilities we have," he says.
Celestica was a unit of IBM Canada Ltd. until it was acquired by Onex Corp. and institutional investors. Given the freedom to pursue more business, it has thrived since its 1998 IPO.
Now it competes against large rivals such as Solectron Corp. of Milpitas, Calif., and SCI Systems Inc. of Huntsville, Ala. They are reaping the benefits of the growing trend among high-tech companies to use outside manufacturers.
Analysts estimate 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the $500-billion electronics-manufacturing business will be outsourced this year. The market is expected to grow 25 per cent a year.
Celestica, like many of the larger players, is jump-starting its growth with acquisitions so it can offer customers a wide range of services in many countries.
NORTEL NETWORKS CORP.
Brampton, Ont. Communications network equipment maker www.nortelnetworks.com 1999 revenue (est.): $20.9-billion (U.S.) The road to a billion: Canada's largest high-tech company broke through the $1-billion sales barrier way back in 1976.
The single most important event of Nortel's journey was its 1969 decision, backed by then-parent Bell Canada, to launch its own research and development lab. Nortel was forced to develop its own technology after its 70-year-old ties with the U.S. Bell system were severed. An agreement between AT&T and the U.S. Justice Department dried up Nortel's access to U.S. product designs.
Developed in the late 1970s, Nortel's digital switching computer was one of the world's first network routing machines to be powered by silicon and software. It took the U.S. market by storm in the early 1980s, as AT&T spun off local phone companies, which then bought gear from firms such as Nortel.
Yet Nortel was dependent on both a single product and single market, with almost 90 per cent of its 1985 revenue of $4.3-billion (U.S.) coming from North America.
To achieve further growth, the company diversified its products and expanded globally through a combination of R&D and key acquisitions. Nortel boosted its presence in fibre-optics and Europe by acquiring STC PLC in 1987; moved into the fast-growing wireless market in 1990; and emerged as a world leader in optical networking -- a position solidified with last month's $3.25-billion purchase of Qtera Corp.
The advent of Internet protocol networks -- which make voice networks obsolete -- has swept Nortel into another vortex of change. And through the $7.6-billion acquisition of Bay Networks in 1998, CEO John Roth shows that Nortel can keep up.
GEAC COMPUTER CORP. LTD.
Toronto Enterprise software provider www.geac.com 2000 revenue (est.): $1.3-billion The road to a billion: Canada's largest software company squeaked its way into the billion-dollar club this year after its $220-million purchase of the second-largest software firm in Britain, JBA Holdings PLC.
Geac is a provider of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, which automates and manages a corporation's administrative and human resource systems. It had fiscal 1999 revenue of nearly $800-million, but its purchase this fall of JBA is expected to add $500-million to its fiscal 2000 results.
Geac was formed in 1971 to provide mainframe computer systems to libraries and banks. When it went public in 1983, its revenue was $60-million and it was competing with computer giants such as International Business Machines Corp.
Geac found itself in trouble by 1986 after eight years of steady profit. The company lost two major customers after Northland Bank of Calgary and Canadian Commercial Bank of Edmonton folded. Increased competition from IBM meant dwindling market share. By 1987, Geac was on the brink of bankruptcy.
It took venture capitalist Stephen Sadler -- who eventually became Geac's CEO and president -- to turn it around. The new Geac focused on enterprise software, and it got where it is today by making 40 acquisitions over 10 years.
Mr. Sadler earned the reputation of "acquisition ace." His greatest accomplishment was the $191-million (U.S.) purchase of the software unit of New York-based Dun & Bradstreet Corp.
Geac's current CEO, Douglas Bergeron, continued the aggressive acquisition path by orchestrating the JBA purchase. "As long as there are software companies out there that exist within our key application areas, we're going to continue full force with our acquisition program." Mr. Bergeron said the company will continue its push into key markets, such as publishing and real estate, and is repositioning itself to take advantage of the boom in electronic commerce.
CAE INC.
Toronto Aerospace and industrial technologies www.cae.com 1999 revenue: $1.1-billion The road to a billion: CAE first broke the $1-billion barrier in the late 1980s, largely through the sale of its military and commercial flight simulation software.
But in the early 1990s the company had to divest one of its U.S. subsidiaries, CAE Link, because of slower demand for its military technology. "With the end of the Cold War, and other issues, it didn't really work for us," says Robert Waite, CAE's vice-president of marketing.
The sale of CAE Link dropped revenue to $590-million, but double-digit growth internally and through acquisitions helped boost CAE back into the billion-dollar range this year.
Founded in 1947 as Canadian Aviation Electronics Ltd., the company specialized in the repair and overhaul of electronics and electromechanical equipment. In the 1950s it began designing and supplying flight and radar simulators to Canada's defence department, and entered a period of high growth in the 1960s when, by way of acquisition, it entered new industrial markets.
CAE -- which employs 7,000 people in 10 countries and has more than 1,000 engineers in Montreal alone -- does more than just simulation software. The company bought B.C. firm Newnes Machinery Ltd. a year ago, giving CAE a line of technology products for the forestry industry. The new unit is growing by more than 20 per cent a year and brings in more than $100-million in revenue.
CAE also builds marine control systems for ships and is a provider of railway technologies. The company has won large contracts in the United States, Germany and Britain with top customers including Federal Express Co., Ford Motor Co., the German army and U.S. Navy.
Flight simulation software remains its largest business. "Chances are if you've flown anywhere with any of the airlines over the past year, the pilot has been trained with CAE simulation," Mr. Waite says.
NEWBRIDGE NETWORKS CORP.
Kanata, Ont. Communications equipment maker www.newbridge.com Fiscal 1999 revenue: $1.8-billion The road to a billion: Newbridge Networks Corp. vaulted into the big leagues -- and to within shooting distance of the $1-billion club -- with a well-placed bet in the early 1990s.
Terence Matthews, the chief executive officer who founded Newbridge in 1986, hitched the company's future to an updated version of telecommunications networking switches, based on a technology called asynchronous transfer mode.
Known as a technological wizard with a clear eye for forecasting, Mr. Matthews's bet was a very good one. The telecommunications industry turned to ATM to handle voice, video and data communications traffic in a single network.
With a solid base of revenue from its time-division multiplexing (TDM) technology and partnerships with Siemens AG of Munich and 3Com Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif., Newbridge grew rapidly and became an industry darling.
Growth would have been stronger if not for the acquisition of UB Networks Inc. of Santa Clara in 1996. The move, an attempt to make a mark in the local-area network market, proved a strategic disaster. Newbridge shut down the money-losing operation in 1998. Despite its difficulties with UB Networks, Newbridge joined the billion-dollar club in 1997 when it hit $1.4-billion in sales.
Newbridge had been unwilling to sell itself to a larger telecommunications company. But with a string of disappointing quarters in its wake, the company hired a New York banker and put itself up for sale in November.
MITEL CORP.
Kanata, Ont. Telephone system and semiconductor maker www.mitel.com Fiscal 2000 revenue (est.): $1.3-billion The road to a billion: It has been both a glamorous and tortuous road to Mitel's first billion-dollar year.
The company reached that milestone in the year that ended on March 26 -- 26 years after Terence Matthews and Michael Cowpland left Nortel's defunct chip-making arm to create the business phone equipment maker.
Mitel is best known as a designer and maker of private-branch exchanges, or PBXs, which are computerized telephone switches that businesses use to route phone calls to telephone extensions. In terms of revenue, Mitel is one of the world's Top 10 microchip makers and exports semiconductors globally. Phone system sales accounted for 57 per cent of 1999 revenue.
Two decades ago, it was the darling of the high-tech community west of Ottawa. But Mitel stumbled badly in the early 1980s because of product delays, overexpansion and declining margins. Rescued from disaster in 1986 by British phone giant BT PLC, Mitel revamped its product line several years ago. The PBX business has rebounded with double-digit annual growth.
Mitel's strengthened position in the semiconductor industry has boosted sales, helped by the acquisition of British microchip maker Plessey Semiconductors Ltd. in February, 1998, and the purchase of Swedish microchip maker ABB Hafo AB two years earlier.
CGI GROUP INC.
Montreal Computer services www.cgi.ca Fiscal 1999 revenue: $1.4-billion The road to a billion: For Canada's largest computer services company, the path to $1-billion was paved with acquisitions -- 20 of them.
The Montreal-based company went public in 1986 with a plan to use its new-found capital to purchase other companies and that strategy hasn't changed. More than 10 of the 20 acquisitions have been completed in the past four years.
Serge Godin, CGI's founder and chief executive officer, says the 23-year-old company has pursued so many deals because it aims to offer as many services as possible in as many places as possible.
"It's a matter of critical mass."
And that critical mass continues to build -- about 50 per cent of revenue growth has been the result of internal growth and 50 per cent through acquisitions.
The company posted revenue of $1.4-billion during the 1999 fiscal year, almost doubling the $741-million of revenue during the 1998 fiscal year.
Key to CGI's rapid growth was the executive team's decision about six years ago to focus on integrating the computer networks of large operations and its success winning outsourcing contracts within the North American market.
The company had been living off consulting and a less focused approach to the systems integration market.
"We would have been a very strong company anyway, growing at about 20 to 25 per cent a year," Mr. Godin says. "But with the transformation, we changed our relationship with our clientele."
Today, about 75 per cent of the company's revenue is from outsourcing. Mr. Godin says the company's ability to hang on to its employees has also been crucial to its growth.
So what's next? As usual, the company says it's got its eye on three or four possible targets and hopes to pull the trigger again before too long.
CGI is now shooting for revenue of $4-billion by 2002, a target Mr. Godin finds incredible. "We've never dreamed of that type of situation."
ATI TECHNOLOGIES INC.
Markham, Ont. Computer graphics equipment maker www.ati.com Fiscal 2000 revenue (est.): $2.3-billion The road to a billion: ATI, the world-leading maker of graphics equipment that enhances computer displays, didn't creep up on the $1-billion sales barrier -- it exploded through it.
From relatively modest sales of $339.7-million in fiscal 1995, ATI's revenue jumped through the $1-billion mark in 1998 as it leapfrogged over competitors such as San Jose's S3 Inc. and Montreal's Matrox Graphics Inc. to snare the top spot in the fast-growing market.
ATI's secret? Leading-edge research and development, savvy marketing and the ability to offer cost-conscious computer makers bang for the buck. Acquisitions have played only a minor role in the company's growth.
K. Y. Ho, ATI's president and chief executive officer, says the company's competitive edge is its ability to quickly capitalize on new trends.
ATI's initial focus was the desktop market and by 1998 its success was highlighted by supply agreements with the world's 10 largest computer makers. The company then focused its attention on the fast-growing laptop market, taking dead aim at market leader Neomagic Inc., which ATI believes that it finally pulled ahead of late last year.
As the computer graphics market matures, ATI's biggest challenge is finding the next high-growth business. As a result, the company has placed a large bet on set-top boxes.
Although still in the early stages, the set-top box business has significant potential as consumers begin to use their televisions to surf the Internet, play video games, watch movies and shop. Through agreements with hardware makers such as General Instruments Inc., ATI wants to be a key supplier of components.

Full text: City's wealth of design, production and marketing skills in great dot-com demand
A native Angeleno, Stuart Levy wasn't much fazed by the recession, the Rodney King riots, the mudslides or the wildfires that hit this city in the early 1990s. But when the 1994 earthquake destroyed his house, Mr. Levy joined the growing exodus from Southern California.
"It was like a signal," said Mr. Levy, who headed to Tokyo, where he formed his own business.
Today, Mr. Levy is back -- and hiring. As founder of an Internet startup called Mixx Entertainment Inc., he plans to more than triple his work force over the next six months to 80 employees. He hopes that Mixx, which beams Japanese animation and music to U.S. teenagers via the Internet, will be ready to go public by this year's second half.
Why L.A.? "For me, content and entertainment are so much a part of what I'm about, and there's no other city, perhaps with the exception of New York, where you can get this combination of multimedia and the Internet," Mr. Levy said.
The road back has been a long and bumpy one for Los Angeles. Even now, six years after the economy here hit bottom, the city's growth is patchy, and its 5.7-per-cent unemployment rate remains stubbornly higher than the state and U.S. averages, and more than double San Francisco's. As of 1998 -- the latest year for which figures are available -- more people were still leaving Los Angeles County than were arriving. But as the Internet has emerged as an important consumer medium, this pop-culture capital has found an important role in the new economy -- one that goes beyond simply providing films and TV shows for Webcasts.
A Web site's appeal to advertisers and sponsors depends on its "stickiness," or ability to attract repeat visitors. And that's why the skills so abundant in Hollywood -- the design, production, packaging and marketing of stories and ideas -- suddenly have myriad new applications on-line.
The result: For the first time in years, an unmistakable dynamism has returned to the city. "It has taken us some time to get there," said Nick Rothenberg, who runs the local office of Internet consulting firm USWeb/CKS Inc. Just two years ago, when Mr. Rothenberg was heading his own Web design company here, he groused that Los Angeles had "dropped off the digital map" and was losing capital and talent to other places. Now at last, he says, the Internet has become "the new gold rush for our region."
Meanwhile, L.A.'s new Internet entrepreneurs are starting to get themselves noticed in some of the city's most hallowed institutions, including that famed Hollywood watering hole, Spago. "These people are coming to the restaurant because they are the new money -- and they have a lot of it," said owner Wolfgang Puck. "It's definitely a whole new economy."
In fact, the city is already home to some of the Internet's biggest names, including eToys Inc., Stamps.com and idealab!, the Pasadena E-business incubator founded by venture capitalist Bill Gross. With idealab! having given birth to 20 startups since March, 1996, others are now rushing to emulate its model, which essentially consists of taking an idea scribbled on the back of a napkin and, in a matter of weeks, turning it into a company headed for a public offering.
The economic impact of this explosion is hard to gauge because the city's high-tech outposts are so spread out. While the new economy has completely bypassed many parts of town -- especially impoverished immigrant and minority neighbourhoods -- there are sizeable pockets of Internet activity.
Brad Williams, an economist at the state Legislative Analyst's Office, said he is convinced that a major factor in L.A.'s economic recovery is all "the action with the dot-coms."
Los Angeles tumbled into recession in the early 1990s after the end of the Cold War staggered the aerospace and defence industries, the traditional centrepieces of its economy. To make matters worse, the city's real estate bubble popped, and it saw tens of thousands of jobs dry up in other sectors, such as banking. The local economy started to stabilize in the mid-1990s, buoyed in part by the economic expansion in most other parts of the nation. Soon, the entertainment industry began an upswing, fueled by a worldwide surge in demand for films and television programming from all sorts of new outlets.
More recently, Hollywood's growth appears to have peaked, and it is the Internet that is helping propel the economy.
For all its swift progress, Los Angeles's Internet culture is in its infancy. While there now are plenty of high-tech networking groups, some say they aren't doing enough to teach entrepreneurs the fundamentals of building a winning business.
Nonetheless, Mixx's Mr. Levy has noticed a telltale shift in local aspirations. It wasn't long ago, he said, when it seemed like "every waiter in town had a movie script." Now, when strangers discover he runs an Internet company, Mr. Levy says, "they have their dot-com business plans" all ready to go.

Full text: Immigrant entrepreneur Jacob Ghermezian dies at 97
Jacob Ghermezian, a Persian rug merchant who moved to Canada to stitch together a family business empire that is worth billions of dollars and includes the giant West Edmonton Mall, died yesterday in an Edmonton hospital.
Although the secretive family kept its myriad business arrangements private, the elder Mr. Ghermezian, known as Papa, could be seen by shoppers through much of the 1990s motoring around the massive mall on a battery-powered motor scooter. He died after a year-long illness at 97.
A rug merchant and developer, he founded the family business in the 1920s in his late teens in what is now Iran.
He rose to such prominence that his apartment complex in the capital, Tehran, played host to a historic 1943 meeting between Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin that set the stage for the invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe and other Allied actions in the second half of the Second World War.
But Mr. Ghermezian, his wife and four sons left Iran in the 1950s during a period of political intrigue and economic instability.
They have always maintained a strict silence about why they decided to leave.
The family lived temporarily in New York before moving to Montreal "because they felt Canada was a good place to do business," said Travis Reynolds, a spokesman for West Edmonton Mall and the family's Triple Five Group of Companies.
The elder Mr. Ghermezian set up shop initially in Montreal and the family began moving in the mid-1960s to Edmonton, where they snapped up real estate at bargain prices before the oil boom of the 1970s.
While far from penniless when they arrived in Canada, the Ghermezian family knew how to pinch pennies so they could invest as much money as possible to expand their businesses.
They jammed into one home in Edmonton in the early 1970s, even as the family expanded with the arrival of several Ghermezian babies.
West Edmonton Mall, built in stages in the 1980s for $1.1-billion, is the most visible symbol of their wealth.
It includes an amusement park that at one time had more submarines than the Canadian Navy, indoor roller coasters and a full-sized indoor skating rink where Wayne Gretzky and the Edmonton Oilers practised regularly during the hockey team's heyday in the 1980s.
The Ghermezians also have a 22.5-per-cent stake in the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., which opened in 1992. The Minnesota mall recently unveiled expansion plans that would catapult it ahead of West Edmonton Mall for bragging rights as the world's largest shopping centre.
As their wealth grew in the 1970s and 1980s, they bought houses around the original family home and reportedly built secret tunnels to connect them. The Ghermezians have declined to comment over the years on their living arrangements, citing security concerns.
At a memorial service today in Edmonton, family and friends from around the world will pay their respects to Mr. Ghermezian. The service will be held at Edmonton's 300-seat Chesed Shel Emmeth funeral chapel at noon, local time.
While the mall is open on Saturdays, Mr. Ghermezian was a devout Hasidic Jew who "respected the Sabbath. He didn't personally conduct any business then in terms of making phone calls or doing any of those type of things. He spent time with family. The whole family is like that," Mr. Reynolds said.
The family patriarch spent some time in hospital in February and was re-admitted in December, he added.
"It was old age. He was sick," Mr. Reynolds said. "People are saddened by the passing of a great leader at West Edmonton Mall. He will be missed by everyone here."
Mr. Reynolds added that "Papa" Ghermezian, who had been in hospital for three weeks before he died in his sleep at 6:30 a.m. yesterday, was also a philanthropist who helped establish numerous schools for poor children in North America and abroad.
Industry sources said the four Ghermezian sons -- Nader, Eskandar, Raphael and Bahman -- reassured their father last year that the shopping centre would be kept under the family's ownership.
The family also faced some controversy.
Government-owned Alberta Treasury Branches launched a $450-million lawsuit against West Edmonton Mall in August, 1998, alleging that the Ghermezian brothers bribed ATB's former top executive, Elmer Leahy, to approve a $418-million loan package to the shopping centre in 1994.
The Ghermezians and Mr. Leahy denied the allegations and have filed countersuits.
ATB accused the mall's owners of running a retail complex "that's stuck in the 1980s." The Ghermezian brothers have repeatedly maintained that West Edmonton Mall doesn't deserve such criticism.
The legal dispute made the family even more reclusive, although they have designated Nader Ghermezian to take the lead in formulating statements to the media occasionally to counter ATB's allegations.
A statement issued yesterday on behalf of the Ghermezian brothers praised their father for starting "Triple Five's corporate tradition of diversified growth . . . As early as the 1920s, he created a mixed-use complex that consisted of a retail mall and apartment and office tower with a recreational component."
The statement credited the elder Mr. Ghermezian with creating 50,000 jobs during his career.
"Under his guidance, Triple Five has become one of North America's most visionary and diverse group of companies," overseeing ventures ranging from suburban development and amusement parks to hotels and real estate, the statement said.

Full text:   For the contrarians among us, 1999 was a banner year.
High-tech bubble about to burst? Wrong. Global recession looming? Wrong. Deflation set to gut markets, small-cap stocks about to outgun their large-cap peers, emerging markets dead as an asset class?
Wrong, wrong and wrong again.
Think of it this way. The ideal investment strategy to have adopted a year ago would have looked like sheer madness on the surface: Pile madly into the shelled-out emerging markets of Asia and Latin America and make a huge bet on Japan, the sick man of Asia; stick with a narrow band of technology stocks, including profit-light Net plays, and ride them relentlessly forward, using every moment of weakness to load up on more; toss out the rules on valuations that may tempt you to buy so-called "value" stocks and distract you from the pursuit of high-priced technology issues and, finally, keep a chunk of your assets at home, despite slumping commodity prices and a lame duck currency.
As is often the case, the markets reward boldness and 1999 was no exception.
Probably the biggest surprise about 1999 was what a good year it was -- at least as defined by the broad market benchmarks. It wasn't supposed to be that way. While few market watchers were outright gloomy a year ago, many were looking for flat to moderate returns in 1999. What they got was a record-shattering year, with North American and European markets in hyperdrive, led by a worldwide surge in technology stocks.
Only mildly less surprising than the stellar returns was the buoyant relative performance of the Canadian market, a result virtually no one predicted a year ago. The Toronto Stock Exchange 300-stock composite index advanced a healthy 29.7 per cent, compared to just 19.5 per cent for the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index in U.S. dollar returns.
From the perspective of Canadian investors, the domestic returns were even better relative to foreign markets than the indexes suggest thanks to the recovery in the Canadian dollar. The dollar, which was trading below 65 cents (U.S.) in early 1999, rose to more than 69 cents by year end. It also made substantial gains on the weak Euro. A rising loonie crimps returns in foreign markets because it reduces the gains once converted back into Canadian dollars. With very few exceptions -- Hong Kong and Japan being the most notable -- the dollar was a drag on our investments abroad.
That made the Canadian market one of the best places for Canadians to be invested last year. The S&P 500 return in Canadian dollars was just 12.3 per cent, less than half the return by the TSE 300. While European markets did well last year, the sagging Euro seriously hurt Canadians investing there. The Bloomberg European 500 index -- a measure of the performance of the largest companies across Europe -- was up an impressive 36.9 per cent in local terms, but just 10.6 per cent in Canadian dollar returns.
What made 1999 Canada's year? In a word: Inflation, or rather, its survival.
Don't get jumpy. Globally, inflation remains in check. But a year ago, one of the biggest threats was seen as inflation's demise and beginning of a potentially destructive episode of deflation.
Deflation occurs when the general price level actually begins to drop -- when inflation goes negative. That can wreak havoc on markets. It reduces prices that companies are able to charge for goods, putting downward pressure on profits, hammers asset values like real estate so makes individuals less wealthy on paper and causes consumers to delay purchases in hopes of even lower prices, undermining the economy.
The deflationary threat, very real a year ago, was a product of the global tumult of the past couple of years. The Asian currency crisis of 1997 and the Russian economic meltdown a year later sideswiped global economies. Surplus productive capacity, particularly across Asia, put downward pressure on prices as did weaker demand from emerging countries hurt by the turmoil.
Prices for commodities like base metals and oil bore the brunt of the global economic woes, one reason why the resource-heavy Canadian market did so poorly last year and our dollar slipped to a record low.
Entering 1999, most market watchers saw more of the same coming. With deflation looming, the Canadian market didn't look like the place to be. As is often the case, that was the perfect buying opportunity.
Deflation turned out to be one enormous red herring. Led by the United States, economies steamrolled through the year, gaining momentum and pushing commodity prices higher. The surprisingly swift recovery across Asia helped put more muscle into the global economy, further supporting prices.
Once the market sensed the economic winds shifting away from the deflation thesis, investors piled into depressed cyclical sectors. That sent many of the languishing segments of the Canadian market, like oils, base metals and forestry, soaring and gave the TSE a much-needed boost. While the resource rally ran out of steam in late summer, the sectors have held a good part of their impressive gains: Base metals gained 45.5 per cent on the year, oil and gas stocks added 26.2 per cent while forestry issues jumped 47 per cent.
But it took much more than the recovery in resource stocks to lift the TSE above other markets this year. What really put it over the top was Nortel Networks Corp.
The Brampton, Ont.-based telecommunications maker's 272.7-per-cent ascension accounted for a huge chunk of the TSE 300's gain last year. Affiliate BCE Corp. , which along with Nortel accounts for 27 per cent of the TSE 300, rose 126.7 per cent on its 40-per-cent stake in Nortel.
Had it not been for Nortel and BCE, the TSE 300 would have put in a very mediocre performance. In fact, the median stock in the TSE 300 was up a measly 1.1 per cent, which means that about half the stocks in the benchmark index lost ground during the year.
It also posed huge challenges for Bay Street money managers. It was a single-decision year: Outperforming meant making a huge bet on Nortel and riding it all the way. Selling out, or worse still, never having got on board, meant being left staring at the TSE 300's tail lights.
The rise of Nortel was a fitting symbol of the kind of year it was: Technology, technology and more technology.
The real star of 1999 was the tech-laden Nasdaq Stock Market. The Nasdaq composite index surged an eye-popping 85.6 per cent last year, far outstripping the performance of other market benchmarks. Early on in the year, E-commerce stories were all the rage, with eBay Inc. and the like leading the pack. Later on in 1999, the focus shifted toward the hardware makers selling the bits and pieces of the Information Highway. Telecommunications in general, and wireless in particular, caught investors' fancy.
The insatiable appetite for technology, which has always been centred on the U.S. market, spilled over into Canada in a major way. Besides Nortel, a host of previously little-known Canadian names shot up the market's charts: MGI Software Corp. , up 1,071.7 per cent, Zi Corp. , up 1,080.4 per cent, and Research in Motion Ltd. , up 550.7 per cent. The Globe and Mail/Bloomberg TechDex, a measure of the performance of 128 Canadian technology companies, soared 62.8 per cent over the year, better than double the performance of the TSE 300.
Besides the continued dominance of technology, one of the other key themes of 1999 was the recovery of some of the walking wounded of the global economy.
The most radical about-face came in Japan, which is showing early signs of an economic revival after a decade of treading water. While the economic growth remains tepid, Japan watchers believe that the economy has hit bottom and that a longer-term recovery is in the offing. While much of the improvement can be pegged to multibillion-dollar stimulus efforts by the government, significant changes are taking place, including layoffs and streamlining in corporate Japan, things unheard of a decade ago.
The bottom line: Japan's corporate behemoths are beginning to focus more on shareholders and investors are responding. The Nikkei 225 soared 36.8 per cent this year, making it one of the best performing markets in the world.
The winds of economic revival were blowing across the rest of Asia. Despite early fears that the region would take years to recover from the currency crisis of two years ago, many of the economies have bounced back. Investors, who just two years ago watched more than half the value of their portfolios vaporized in the region as economy after economy collapsed, have been quick to forgive. Hong Kong stocks are up 68.8 per cent, South Korean stocks up 82.8 per cent, Singapore stocks up 78 per cent while the Indonesian market has jumped 70.1 per cent.
Europe also participated heartily in 1999's bull market, despite the lame debut of the Euro, which struggled right out of the gate and has yet to find its stride. Morgan Stanley's Europe index surged 27.9 per cent last year, powered higher by a wave of merger and consolidation activity across the continent and the worldwide fever for technology stocks.
The gains in emerging Asian markets and Europe have been matched elsewhere in lesser-developed markets. Latin America has bounced back strongly, led by Brazil, up 151.9 per cent (in local currency) and Mexico, up 80.1 per cent, also in local currency terms.
So, if there's a lesson from 1999, it's that if you run with the herd, you'll often end up headed in the wrong direction.

Abstract: The home was listed on July 1 and has received one offer that was not accepted by the owner, a local entrepreneur. The property next door sold in June for $1.775-million and elsewhere in Whistler 18 detached homes are for sale, all priced between $1.5-million and $3-million. Sixteen properties in the same range have sold since August, 1998.

Full text: WHAT: Four bedrooms, in 3,554 square feet, on a pie-shaped 40-by-165-foot lot. WHERE: In the Bear Creek Estates subdivision in Whistler, B.C., 125 kilometres north of Vancouver and 140 kilometres from Vancouver International Airport. AMENITIES: This place is a 10-minute walk to a ski lift that whisks downhillers to the top of Whistler Mountain. It's a post-and-beam chalet with a media room, floor-to-ceiling main-floor windows, a large deck with a hot tub, and panoramic views of the Tantalus Mountain Range. The price may be as steep as the neighbouring mountains but a two-bedroom suite inside the home generates $1,200 a month in rental income, and will put a dent in the monthly mortgage payment. HOMEWORK: The home was listed on July 1 and has received one offer that was not accepted by the owner, a local entrepreneur. The property next door sold in June for $1.775-million and elsewhere in Whistler 18 detached homes are for sale, all priced between $1.5-million and $3-million. Sixteen properties in the same range have sold since August, 1998. Realtors give credit for Whistler's active market to the high U.S. dollar, which gives outside-of-Canada purchasers -- predominantly from the United States, Europe, Australia and Hong Kong -- more for their money than resort areas in the United States. The average list price of detached homes in Whistler this year is just over $1-million and the average sale price $798,000. Sales are projected to pass the 700 mark this year, considerably better than the 503 homes sold in 1998 but well behind 1997 when 917 homes changed hands. ASKING PRICE: $1.89-million. AGENTS: Elizabeth Chaplin and Cole Shuker, Whistler Real Estate Co. Ltd. 1-800-667-2993.

Toronto scene to sizzle in 2000

Author: Rusk, James; Lewington, Jennifer

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/toronto-scene-sizzle-2000/docview/384497095/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Mr. [Tom McCormack] predicts that Ontario will be increasingly reliant on the Toronto region for jobs and growth. For example, 46 per cent of the province's economic output comes from the GTA, but over the next 22 years the region is projected to have 57 per cent of the province's growth.

Full text: A hot economy, restructuring, transportation and taxes are expected to dominate the 905 region this year
Don't put the fireworks away yet.
The coming year promises to be a lively one in the Greater Toronto Area -- with sparkle and pop predicted on several fronts.
First, the vibrant local economy shows no sign of slackening. If anything, forecasters say, the Toronto area will account for a growing share of the province's economic well-being. Perhaps this will fuel the hopes of those who dream of political independence for the city-region.
There will be plenty of sizzle on the political front.
In the months leading up to municipal elections on Nov. 13, local politicians will have to wrestle with an unusual number -- for an election year -- of contentious issues. Debates about municipal restructuring, transportation and taxes will play out along an active political fault line between the province and local governments.
In Toronto, which took a year to find its feet after the 1998 megacity amalgamation, municipal politics has again been destabilized, this time by the province's reduction of councillors to 44 from 57.
So far, most of the 905-area municipalities have been spared the provincial axe that recently slashed the number of local politicos in four regions from Hamilton to Ottawa. Despite the reprieve (pending recommendations later this year from the Greater Toronto Services Board, a regional co-ordinating body), 905 politicians are beginning to wonder if they would be better off to reorganize themselves first instead of waiting for a move by Queen's Park.
The choices for Toronto politicians are not easy.
Do they make hard decisions in an election year, and risk defeat, or leave the decisions to a provincial government that shows no reluctance to act on municipal issues when it chooses? Leaving the tough choices to Mike Harris's Progressive Conservative government would be an easy way to pass on blame for unpopular, if necessary, actions. But that strategy could mean surrendering the community's fate to Queen's Park.
Here is a run-down of what to look for across the Toronto region this year. Downsizing municipalities: Late last year, the Harris government acted swiftly to order the size of Toronto city council cut to 44 from 57 -- one example of how provincially-dictated restructuring can upset the balance of local government. But the province's current timetable for restructuring 905-area municipalities would effectively delay changes until after the 2003 municipal election.
The province has delayed action on 905 municipalities, pending a report on municipal governance from the Greater Toronto Services Board, a regional co-ordinating body set up the province. That report is supposed to be delivered to Queen's Park by late this year or early next.
But Markham mayor Don Cousens wonders why municipalities such as his should follow the province's timetable. "It [governance] has to be changed. Why wait to the end of the year 2000? Why not do it in the next six months?"
Putting off changes until after another three-year municipal election cycle would demoralize municipal staff and paralyze local governments, he argues. "I'd rather see us shape our own future than stand by and not be leaders," he says.
If Mr. Cousens and a growing number of 905 mayors have their way, municipalities from Burlington to Clarington could get a head start on mergers -- on their terms -- this year, leading to a number of realignments of small cities into larger political units.
A shake-up of 905 municipal boundaries -- and political power -- could be the death-knell for regional governments in Halton, Peel, York and Durham. Rewiring electricity? Every municipality in Ontario that owns a local electricity distribution utility has to figure out this year how to respond to provincial reforms that have opened up the electricity market to competition.
The reforms effectively force municipal governments to choose whether or not to stay in the electricity business. Mississauga and Toronto, for example, are considering the sale of their utilities.
The incentive to sell is high. The sale of local utilities could generate billions of dollars. But the province has not given municipalities a lot of time. They will have to make their decisions before next November or lose the chance to sell without adverse tax consequences.
And they fear regulatory rules to be set by the province for privately-owned utilities could reduce the potential values of the utilities.
Those rules are not yet in place, which means neither municipalities nor potential buyers can put a value on the utilities. Veteran utility executive Tom Drolet, chairman of the Toronto Board of Trade's electricity committee, says: "We have to get the rules of the road straight. . . . If the significant rules could be rolled out by early spring, that is the the date they [municipalities] could be making a decision on the future of their assets." Lifting the lid on taxes? Until the end of 2000, Toronto has a three-year cap that restricts changes to taxes on commercial and industrial property to no more than 2.5 per cent a year, up or down. The limit was imposed because of the province's decision to implement current value assessment.
The province was forced to impose the cap once it found that the new assessments, based on 1996 property values, shifted hundreds of millions of dollars from large commercial and industrial properties to small businesses.
The new assessments, based on 1999 property values, will be released soon. When they are, Toronto has to figure out how to respond. If the tax burden shifts back on to the commercial office sector, as many expect, city council can expect major resistance from the business community.
Commercial real estate taxes in downtown Toronto are already the highest in the country. Despite five years of economic recovery, the city has no new office space being built downtown, while the suburbs, by contrast, boom with new office construction.
This downtown-suburban split is a recipe for disaster, in the view of the Toronto Board of Trade. If there is no tax relief for the commercial sector when the cap comes off, the city could face the kind of downtown erosion experienced by major U.S. cities over the past decade. The workfare puzzle The province sets the ground rules for social welfare and pays municipalities, which administer welfare, 80 per cent of their costs. Recently, the Harris government announced that it would set targets for the number of people that a municipality should put through the province's workfare system.
Municipalities that meet the target will receive an extra $1,000 for each person they place in the workfare program. But it is not clear what penalty will be imposed on cities that fail to the meet the province's target.
The province's proposed changes do not sit well with the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. Michael Power, president of AMO, says local governments had been promised a chance to consult with the province on changes to the Ontario Works program. Instead, local governments did not learn of the edict until several hours after the province's announcement.
The Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represents almost all municipal workers in Ontario, will fight any attempt to place workfare recipients in municipal positions. Even though the province pays 80 per cent of welfare costs, municipalities are on the hook for all the costs tied to the new rules. For example, local governments would have to build daycare facilities for the children of welfare recipients now required to work.
No municipality has more at stake on the workfare issue than Toronto, which has the largest number of welfare recipients in the province. Making tracks Traffic gridlock is bad and getting worse in the Greater Toronto Area. According to a 1999 transportation report for Toronto and four area regions, 70 per cent of the expressway network in the Greater Toronto Area and Hamilton-Wentworth is congested at rush-hour, despite the addition of Highway 407. Capacity constraints at Union Station limit the addition of rush-hour trains on the GO Transit system. Conversely, most locally-operated transit systems operate well below capacity.
Finding a solution to the transit problem is the biggest challenge facing local politicians, but there are some glimmers of light.
York Region recently approved plans to amalgamate its local transit authorities, which would set the stage for closer co-operation with Toronto and other regional governments on transit issues.
There are rumblings that the federal government's February budget could contain some funds for transit-related projects in the Greater Toronto Area. Meanwhile the province, which several years ago ended its support for capital construction projects in transportation, might be lured back to the table. Toronto's role in the economic boom The recession of the early 1990s hit the Greater Toronto Area harder than any other metropolitan area in Canada, but now the region is making up ground, according to economist Tom McCormack, president of Strategic Projections.
Since the 1992 recession, the Toronto region has gained 400,000 new jobs, a pace that outstrips employment growth for the province.
Mr. McCormack predicts that Ontario will be increasingly reliant on the Toronto region for jobs and growth. For example, 46 per cent of the province's economic output comes from the GTA, but over the next 22 years the region is projected to have 57 per cent of the province's growth.
Similarly, the Toronto region has 44 per cent of jobs in the province, but Mr. McCormack predicts the region will be responsible for 65 per cent of the growth in jobs over the next couple of decades.
His one caution is the worsening gridlock in the region. "If we don't solve the transportation problem the jobs and people and output will go elsewhere."

Full text: A 'magic moment' begins the year on remote Pacific island
Many Pitt Islanders were still hung over from partying all night in the wool shed, the corrugated tin hut where they usually shear their sheep. They shivered and stamped their feet in the scrub grass at a Roman Catholic mass before dawn, a few swigging from a Scotch bottle, as one of their neighbours read the command from Genesis: "Let there be light."
And at precisely 5:49 a.m. and 46 seconds local time, about 16 hours and 15 minutes before daybreak in Canada, the heavens complied with a sunrise that would have been the envy of Hollywood.
As the sheep farmers' children sang Amazing Grace , the sun peeked over the curve of empty ocean, transforming the sky's inky black clouds into swirls of blazing orange and yellow.
And then on the opposite horizon, to the small gathering's amazement, a rainbow appeared, a massive crescent that stretched across the west, framing the entire 7,600-hectare island of bogs and windswept hills in a golden light.
"A magic moment, mate," exclaimed Don Armitage, a Canadian who now lives in New Zealand and often works on this lonely island, about 850 kilometres east of the country's major islands. "A pretty good sunrise," agreed Ken Lanauze, relief evident in his gravelly voice.
He owns Mount Hakepa, a 231-metre-high bluff that became a valuable piece of real estate as millennial mania progressed. The Royal Geographical Society ruled Mr. Lanauze's volcano would be the first high point in a populated place to see the first sunrise of the year 2000.
"When I bought this land from my father-in-law 45 years ago, he said if I don't make anything out of it as a farm, I might make something in the year 2000," Mr. Lanauze said. "He told me it gets the day's first sun. I didn't know that, and I didn't think of it again until the Royal Geographical Society said we would see the first sunrise."
But Mr. Lanauze took his father-in-law's advice to heart. He sold the rights to photograph the first sunrise to a U.S. advertising firm, then to a New Zealand TV station for a reported $100,000, and finally to a photographic news agency that peddled the images around the planet yesterday. All the proceeds went into a trust for the Lanauze family.
Most journalists and TV crews, as well as the general public, were refused entry to the island, which is almost completely owned by only 10 families. Only three print journalists and one TV crew were on the island this morning.
But despite this brush with late-20th-century consumerism and marketing, Pitt Island remains the antithesis of modern life. Inhabited by 50 people and 20,000 sheep, the island is an example of a pastoral, unwired existence that has all but disappeared in most industrialized countries.
There are no cellphones here. No bank. The Internet is still a new thing, a connection that works only intermittently. This is a place where there is no crime, no unemployment and an old-fashioned charm, where New Year's Eve festivities still feature old ladies playing the electric organ and singing hymns.
The highlight of New Year's Eve, in fact, was a big bonfire, set ablaze a few minutes before midnight. Despite its status as the place that would usher in the first sunrise of year 2000, the island's "millennial countdown clock" was a mantel clock, carried to the wool shed by Evan Lanauze, the family matriarch.
She dropped it and the battery fell out, throwing the countdown off somewhat. But on Pitt Island, it is generally agreed that precise time doesn't usually matter.
"Our New Year's countdowns are usually off," one farmer confessed, sipping from a wine bottle. "But usually there aren't outsiders here, so nobody really cares."
As sea birds flew around the beach blaze, Mr. Lanauze stared at the red sparks that flew up into the southern stars. "You know, things haven't changed much here. I'm not sure that we want to change that much in the next millennium."
Chances are they won't have to. Pitt Islanders cherish their isolation, and geography helps them retain it.
Getting to Pitt requires an invitation from one of the residents, since it is privately owned. Even with an invitation in hand, getting here can be an ordeal.
In Wellington, New Zealand's capital, you board an aging twin-engined prop airplane. That takes you to the Chatham Islands, where another plane has to be arranged for the flight over to Pitt.
Still, many were willing to make the journey in recent months.
A German sculptor managed to convince the Lanauze clan that he should install a bronze sculpture on top of Mount Hapeka. He built four in Germany, intricate works that now protrude from the lip of the ancient volcano.
Other millennial pilgrims didn't get as far as Pitt Island, since they lacked the invitations. They stayed 22 kilometres away, on Chatham Island. But they didn't mind.
A group of Swedish university students paid $10,000 each to see the millennium's first sunrise. When they found out they would be stuck on Chatham Island, which saw the new year's first light a few seconds later, they were unperturbed.
"This is close enough," said Peter Carlsson. "Decades from now, when people ask me what I did at the start of the millennium, I won't have to be embarrassed. I can say I was one of the first to see the first sunrise and the whole room will go quiet."
A few minutes later, as he drank another glass of beer, he added that being on the lonely chain of islands provided insurance from being affected by some particularly deadly Y2K computer problems.
"If the nuclear missiles start flying, or something like that, this will be the safest place to be. Nobody would ever try to hit this place."

Full text: JAN WONG LUNCH WITH SIR JOHN A. MACDONALD
Sir John A. Macdonald looks confused. "Where am I?" he asks, looking at the blacks, Asians and East Indians lunching around us.
"McDonald's," I say. "In Toronto. Yonge Street."
"McDonald's?" he says. "What's that?"
In 11 days, he turns 185. But he doesn't look a day over 76, the age at which he died in office in 1891. Indeed, he looks exactly like his portrait on the $10 bill: the same unruly hair, the same thin lips, the same purple-veined bulbous nose. No one gives his Victorian frock coat and wing collar a second glance. We are, after all, on Yonge Street.
Clearly, though, Canada's first prime minister is out of touch. He's surprised I'm from The Globe and Mail.
"Last I heard, it was just 'The Globe.' George Brown was my good friend," he says, referring to a fellow Father of Confederation and The Globe's founder, who died in 1880 after a disgruntled former employee shot him in the leg.
Actually, Macdonald and Brown were hardly "friends." In the early 1860s, Brown, a leader of the Reformers, formed a cross-party coalition to work toward Confederation. Macdonald joined only when he realized that a political union would happen with or without him.
In the process, Macdonald grabbed the glory for himself. Brown once noted that his rival's path to power was littered with the broken careers of erstwhile colleagues. By Confederation in 1867, Macdonald was Prime Minister -- and Brown was out of the coalition.
"The public prefers John A. drunk to George Brown sober," Macdonald sneered at the time.
At lunch, he is asked what he wants to drink. "Gin? Champagne? Whisky?" he says hopefully. He is unhappy to learn that McDonald's is dry. "I haven't had a drink in 109 years," he sighs.
He doesn't realize that McDonald's has no waiters. Out of deference to his age, I'll fetch lunch.
"That's fast food," he exclaims when I return in two minutes with two Big Macs, medium fries and Cokes. A picky eater, his normal fare is mutton chops with boiled vegetables. He requests a knife and fork for his burger. Now that turns heads.
"And you," he says, gamely tasting a fry dipped in ketchup, "Where were you born?"
"Montreal."
"No, where were you really born?" he persists.
"The Montreal General Hospital."
Macdonald chokes on his Coke. In 1885, it was his Conservative government that imposed the first Chinese head tax. Both my grandmothers and one grandfather each paid $500 to enter Canada, more than $10,000 each in today's dollars.
My other grandfather arrived even earlier, in the early 1880s. He was a 19-year-old peasant from south China, one of 15,000 Chinese coolies transported here to build the Canadian Pacific Railroad.
"It was all your idea," I remind Macdonald.
Knowing that Confederation would be a mere "geographic expression" unless the new nation could be reinforced with steel from sea to sea, the prime minister had pushed for a transcontinental railroad. Chinese coolies were given dangerous jobs -- placing nitroglycerin and lighting dynamite. Grandfather Chong was one of those who helped blast tunnels through the Rockies.
Andrew Onderdonk, a CPR contractor, estimated that three Chinese died for every kilometre of track laid. My own grandfather survived. But when the railroad was completed, another contractor reneged on a promise to ship him back to China.
Grandfather Chong had the choice of spending his savings on passage home or staying on and working more. He found work as a dollar-a-month houseboy to Col. Josiah Greenwood Holmes, the deputy adjutant-general of the British base at Esquimalt, B.C. By coincidence, it is the same military base where we detained the Chinese illegals who floated here on rusty ships last summer.
Macdonald is upset to learn about the latest migrants. His plan was to keep us all out. That's why, when the CPR was completed in 1885 and coolie labour was no longer needed, his government imposed the head tax. I can't resist telling him that Grandfather Chong became a citizen in 1899.
"Isn't there anywhere I can get a drink?" Macdonald says.
In his heyday, he was famous for his binges. He often showed up drunk in the House of Commons. The final pre-Confederation meeting in England was delayed for weeks, historians say, because Macdonald was on a bender in Ottawa. Once, he even vomited on stage during a debate with an opponent. Later, he asserted that the man's words had turned his stomach.
"And these other people," says Macdonald, gesturing to those eating around us. "Are they Canadians, too?"
Why is he so surprised? After all, he was an immigrant himself, as were both his wives. His second wife was from a British slave-owning family in Jamaica. His first wife (and cousin) was an opium addict from Scotland. She died in 1857 from a Victorian disorder that today might be diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome.
Macdonald himself was born in Glasgow in 1815. At five, he emigrated with his parents to Kingston. He became a lawyer there and, at 28, was elected a city alderman. The next year, he was elected to the legislature of what was then the Province of Canada.
In his day, Macdonald didn't believe in universal male suffrage. He did think that -- as an experiment -- single women with property might be given the vote. But his main interest in females used to be with ladies of the night. (Some historians say that may have accounted for his first wife's bedridden reclusiveness.
Macdonald reddens and changes the subject. "You speak English very well," he says.
"So do you," I say.
On a trip to England, Macdonald once witnessed a lady take a tumble as she alighted from her carriage, her hooped skirt flipping over her head. Macdonald couldn't stop laughing. When the lady finally got up, and dusted herself off, she snapped, "Sir, I can see you are no gentleman!"
Macdonald retorted, "And I can see, Madam, that you are not one either."
After being reminded of this incident from the history books, the former prime minister peers under the table. "You're wearing trousers ," he exclaims. Then he notices that so are most of the other women in McDonald's.
"It is the dead of winter," I explain, before adding gently, "We can vote, too."
"I really need a drink," he says.
Unaware I've already paid for lunch, he gallantly offers to pick up the tab. He was never very good with money. I would ask for a $30,000 head-tax refund, with interest, but he's broke. He frittered away his law practice, lost heavily on real estate speculation and didn't even own the Kingston house he shared with his first wife. In 1868, a year after Confederation, he went bankrupt.
But it was the railroad that proved his undoing.
While the CPR gave my family a chance at a new life, it led to Macdonald's political downfall.
In 1872, when he was both prime minister and justice minister, he made a dark promise to Sir Hugh Allan, a leading Montreal capitalist. Macdonald would make Sir Hugh the president of the company building the transcontinental railroad. In return, he hit up Sir Hugh for $300,000 in campaign contributions, the equivalent of more than $6-million today.
The Pacific Scandal, as it was known, broke in 1873. The opposition unearthed a self-incriminating telegram from Macdonald to the businessman. "I must have another $10,000. Will be the last time of calling. Do not fail me. Answer today."
Macdonald tried to save himself with an impassioned five-hour speech in the House of Commons. It was too late. On Nov. 5, 1873, he resigned. He was the first and, so far, only Canadian prime minister to resign for ethical reasons.
His only regret? "I should never have put it in writing," he says.
Four years later, Canadian voters returned Macdonald to power. His last hurrah was a campaign against free trade. Endearing himself to local manufacturers, he erected a wall of protectionist tariffs against U.S. imports.
"How is the economy doing at the moment," he asks.
"Great. Low inflation. Low unemployment. By the way," I tell him, "it was a Conservative government that signed a free-trade agreement with the United States."
Macdonald has lost his appetite. He hasn't finished his Big Mac. His fries are getting cold. Would he prefer a McDonald's personal pizza instead?
"What's a pizza?" Macdonald asks. He sighs heavily. "What I really need is a drink."
