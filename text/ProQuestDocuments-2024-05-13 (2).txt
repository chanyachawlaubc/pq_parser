Full text: VANCOUVER Vancouver’s super high-end buyers, not your random millionaires – but your centi-millionaire types, appear to be out of hibernation. Despite the foreign buyer ban that went into effect in January, there is an appetite among the uber-wealthy for the splashiest of mansions and penthouses.
Inventory for this market, is, however, low, with about 17 listings for homes above $10-million in the city right now, says realtor Faith Wilson, who has two such active listings.
“One hundred per cent, yes,” she says, when asked if it’s a market showing signs of life. “People have money and people are making offers, so it’s just a matter of putting the deals together.”
Who are these remarkably rich buyers with deep pockets?
“A lot of local people,” Ms. Wilson says. “They can’t be foreign buyers, so they are expats and they’ve got their PRs [permanent resident status]. There is Hong Kong money here for sure – expats with PRs – or Canadian citizens trying to flow some of their money back here, there’s that demographic.
“Vancouver and the Lower Mainland is a wealthy, wealthy area, as far as a fair amount of people with high net worth. So they are looking.”
The home that caught everybody’s attention a few weeks ago was the sale of a waterfront Daniel Evan White designed home at 3439 Point Grey Rd. Mr. White was a residential architect who had worked with Arthur Erickson. He died in 2012, and in 2014 the Museum of Vancouver honoured his work in an exhibit called Play House.
The asking price for the home was $24,988,000, and it sold for $24-million after 32 days on the market. A title search shows the registered owners are “Jacob Austin, Canadian Senator” and “Natalie Veiner Freeman, housewife.”
The record of ownership for the 5,475-square-foot home with 66-foot wide waterfront frontage goes back to 1988, and the house was built in 1979. Taxes for 2022 were $121,560, a hefty price tag for living on what is essentially a gated community in Kitsilano, down the road from Lululemon founder Chip Wilson’s $74-million house.
The seller did well considering that the home is assessed at $20.82-million, and a report generated by Landcor Data Corp.
puts the value at $17.32-million.
But they say that a property is worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it.
“Not much comes up on the north side of Point Grey Road,” agent Bryan Yan explains. “These guys [that buy] are centi-millionaires or plus. They aren’t normal millionaires. If you look at his property tax – doctors don’t make that kind of money.”
Ms. Wilson has a listing in Shaughnessy at 1318 Minto Cres., for $24.8-million, a roughly 27,000-sq.-ft. lot with a 10,000sq.-ft. home.
“I can say that we’ve had a few offers. We’re just waiting to find that right fit. But there is more than one person walking around with $20-million-plus in their pocket,” she says. “Everybody is looking to carve out their best deal. That’s what it comes down to.”
They are negotiating because there are “deals,” of sorts, particularly in the high-end condo market, although that could change this spring. But last year, condos priced higher than $4-million saw an average sold price shrinkage of 23 per cent, according to the Engel & Volkers 2022 year-end luxury real estate market report.
Downtown, at the Fairmont Pacific Rim, penthouse No. 2 at 1011 Cordova St. sold for $19.3-million after more than 100 days on the market. The asking price was $24.88-million, and it had been relisted several times. The owner on title of that property is a numbered company.
Realtor Salina Kai, who represented the seller, said the unique customized unit wasn’t suited to a family because it’s a two-level, 6,500-sq.-ft. space. Most of the buyers looking were middle-aged professionals.
Ms. Kai says high-net-worth individuals are looking to negotiate, and they are more confident since the Bank of Canada suggested they may not increase the interest rate again this year.
“If it’s something that they desire and want, I think they can overcome that,” she said of the higher rate. “I think when the market seems down, they would be the people who go after things.
It’s not regular wealthy people; it’s the ultra, ultra wealthy that does this. I feel like this is when they make their move. … That’s why we are seeing a few more of these sales. And they are negotiating, right.
“It’s not across the board, but I think it’s good timing because the sellers might have opportunities with cash that they can also use and make more money on. It creates this perfect storm amongst this high-net-worth wealth, where if they have opportunities maybe they’ll let go of some of their prized assets to do so.”
She represented the buyer on a more modest purchase at 1495 Bramwell Rd. in West Vancouver, a 7,978-sq.-ft. home listed at $8.89-million that sold on Feb. 28 for $7.8-million, which was a considerable price drop.
“They definitely want to make sure to take into account the market, and buffer themselves a little too for whatever reason, if the market does dip a bit more. But we are seeing signs that it’s not going to.”
Ms. Wilson has another listing at 6848 Hudson St. for $11.6-million, a completely updated 1990s Shaughnessy house has eight bedrooms. She’s received a few offers on that one too, listed less than two months ago, but so far a deal hasn’t been made.
Foreign buyers can still find their way into the market, with limitations, Ms. Wilson says. She has foreign clients who are considering purchasing outside of Vancouver, in communities where it’s allowed. Foreign buyers can get started in a secondary market until the ban expires, then switch over, she says.
“They go, ‘maybe we will buy here, and invest money here in the meantime and when the ban lets up, maybe we will transfer the money over, or keep it as an investment and buy something else.’ ”We’re resilient. So you figure out how you can make it work for you,” Ms. Wilson says.
The centi-millionaires are an especially discreet group. It’s not uncommon for realtors involved in the transaction to have to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), even though they’re already bound by confidentiality rules.
Ms. Kai said that even inquiring about a property can require the signing of an NDA, such as the house on Point Grey Road.
“When we wanted information on that house, we had to sign an NDA as well,” she says.
She also had to sign an NDA to ensure she didn’t discuss the details of the purchaser of the Fairmont Pacific Rim penthouse. (As of April 1, real estate professionals in Ontario will be restricted from using NDAs when settling a dispute with a client.)
Ms. Wilson said it’s a matter of not wanting sensationalism around the sale, and also security concerns. Most ultra-wealthy sellers don’t list on the Multiple Listings Service for those reasons.
And even then, it’s not always easy to keep the listing under wraps. She was the listing agent in the sale of a property in 2021 that published reports said was owned by actress Michelle Pfeiffer and television writer and producer David E. Kelley, located in a remote part of the B.C. coast. Ms. Wilson has never commented on the sale, which had an asking price of $28-million.
“Some of the people I’ve dealt with, they are famous, high profile people. They don’t want that sensationalism around the sale: ‘Oh so and so sold their house.’ Or there may be security issues. If you are a high-net-worth individual, with family in, say the Lower Mainland for example, you may want an NDA. You don’t want people to know where you live.”
The pressure for discretion can be intense. One agent involved in one of the most expensive listings last year was too afraid to even comment for this story.
“The big family money people, they guard their privacy incredibly tight. And if you talk about them, you will never work with anyone like that again,” realtor Ian Watt explains. “And they are vicious to the point where you feel threatened. And fair enough – they trust you, so you should keep your mouth shut. They don’t want anyone knowing their financial situations, ever. So all their finances, everything is so private.”

Full text: When Kelly Laing spots an interesting real estate listing in Rothesay, N.B., a coveted suburb of Saint John, she texts her friends in the area: Is anyone else going to bid on that home?
“We found that when a good family home would come up there’d be, like, 10 people who put in offers,” said the 31-yearold marketing manager. “And then, after the offer is accepted, you find out eight of them are your friends.”
Competition is heating up across the country, in cities such as Chilliwack, B.C., and London, Ont., and in major urban centres such as Calgary and Toronto, as Canada’s housing market comes back to life with the approach of spring.
Prospective home buyers held their breath in anticipation through the second half of last year – and largely halted their searches – as residential real estate prices declined across the country following rapid interest rate increases by the Bank of Canada.
Some of them hoped the central bank’s quest to stomp inflation would send national home prices plunging, making it easier, especially for first-time buyers, to enter the real estate market.
But the housing crash didn’t happen.
A year after the rate-hike cycle began, housing affordability remains near record lows, with costlier mortgages largely erasing the effect of lower home values. Federal lending rules are amplifying the impact of higher mortgage rates, further hobbling borrowers.
At the same time, many homeowners are loath to sell after the recent price declines, meaning real estate listings are scarce. The result is buyers scrambling to snap up something they can afford in their chosen market.
To be sure, this spring won’t mark a return to the feverish bidding of the COVID-19-era housing boom.
In many markets, demand from real estate investors and wealthy out-of-towners from big cities has waned.
Buyers are far more cautious about making offers above the asking price, purchasing properties sight unseen and waiving home inspections.
Yet multiple offers on a home are back, real estate agents across the country report. If you want to buy one, you must still act fast.
After eight interest rate increases, the Bank of Canada signalled at the start of 2023 it would hold off on further hikes as it waits for the impact of higher borrowing costs to work its way through the economy. That pause, along with data showing home prices are stabilizing and the arrival of warmer weather, is luring buyers back into the market.
Growing concern about the stability of certain corners of the financial sector could also add momentum to the housing market. The recent demise of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in the United States, which was linked to the impact of soaring interest rates, has spooked investors. For mortgage borrowers, it means less likelihood of further increases in fixed and variable mortgage rates.
Yet, in a stark departure from the pandemic, it is mostly local buyers who are venturing back into the market so far this year. In 2021 and early 2022, moneyed buyers from expensive cities such as Toronto and Vancouver flocked to suburbs and smaller towns looking for bigger homes and lower prices, ramping up competition in markets such as Chilliwack, London and Halifax. But now that home prices have plunged by between 10 per cent and close to 30 per cent in most of those areas, locals believe it’s their chance to get into the market.
In Chilliwack, where the price of a typical home dropped from a peak of $907,600 down to $677,600 in January, realtor Jason Sandhu said about 70 per cent of his buyers are now from the region. By contrast, in the first few years of the pandemic, 70 per cent of his clients were investors from Vancouver, Surrey and Langley, all more expensive areas.
The stream of buyers from out of town has also thinned out in London and Halifax, according to real estate agents there.
Now, local buyers who sat out the real estate craze of 2021 and 2022 are coming back – with larger down payments to make up for higher prices and mortgage rates.
In Halifax, would-be buyers are seeking help from their families for home purchases, said Clinton Wilkins, who has worked as a mortgage broker in the region for 17 years. That phenomenon has been common in Ontario and British Columbia for years.
Buyers are adapting to the higher mortgage rates in Vancouver and Toronto as well, the two priciest real estate markets in the country. People are now looking for smaller properties or in less desirable neighbourhoods, said Faith Wilson, a realtor with Christie’s International Real Estate in the Vancouver region.
It helps that the interest rate increases did not translate into widespread job losses, said Debbie Penzo, a realtor in Toronto.
With fears of a recession fading away, she said, people are eager to buy once again, she said.
Home prices, though, remain far higher than they were before the pandemic, even in the cities that saw steep declines last year.
In London, for example, residential real estate prices in January were down 27 per cent compared to their pandemic peak of February, 2022. Yet a typical home still costs 60 per cent more than it did in January, 2019.
In Halifax, where home prices started the year 10 per cent below their previous peak, the benchmark home price remains 70 per cent higher than it was four years ago.
And for buyers who need a mortgage, higher borrowing costs have largely erased the effect of price declines. In Vancouver, Calgary and Toronto, for example, buyers with a competitive five-year fixed mortgage rate, a 20-per-cent down payment and 25-year amortization would have seen their mortgage payment shrink by around $50 a month or less if they’d bought in January compared to the market peak, based on local benchmark home prices.
Complicating the math further for buyers is the federal mortgage stress test, which mandates that lenders test borrowers’ finances to ensure they’d be able to afford interest rate increases.
“Home prices have not come down enough to make up for the stress test,” said James Laird, co-chief executive officer of financial product comparisons site Ratehub.ca, and president of mortgage lender CanWise.
When it comes to qualifying for a mortgage, higher interest rates have, in effect, reduced the amount home buyers can borrow from federally regulated lenders based on a given household income.
Current rules require lenders to ensure that mortgage applicants would be able to keep making payments based on the higher of a minimum qualifying mortgage rate of 5.25 per cent, or their contract rate plus two percentage points.
At the start of 2022, mortgage rates were low enough that most well-qualified borrowers were being tested against the 5.25per-cent stress test benchmark, according to data from Ratehub.ca. But with mortgage rates now hovering around 5 per cent, borrowers must pass the test based on a qualifying rate of around 7 per cent. This means they can borrow significantly less.
In the Saint John area, home prices have come down by about 10 per cent since last June. But Ms. Laing is still struggling to find a home for between $500,000 and $800,000 that fits her and her partner’s needs.
“You’d think out here that would go a long way and it really doesn’t,” she said. At least not for a four-bedroom home – the couple is planning to have children – in a kid-friendly neighbourhood close to stores and schools.
A home that would have been “just right” for them recently sold for over $900,000, far above the couple’s financial comfort zone. Fixer-uppers are going for well below that, but generally require such extensive work that Ms. Laing reckons the cost of renovations would send the couple over budget anyway.
In rural areas, it’s still possible to buy a large detached house on an acre of land for around $200,000, she said. But every time the couple checked out properties further afield, two questions kept nagging at them: Who would the kids play with? And how easily could the couple recoup their money if they had to sell the home to chase job opportunities elsewhere?
Ms. Laing and her fiancé both have fully remote jobs, but they want the flexibility to be able to move to pursue professional opportunities, she said.
So far, the home search has been far from what Ms. Laing expected after the couple moved to Rothesay, which is her fiancé’s hometown, from Toronto in the spring of 2020. They’ve been living at his parents’ home since then and looking for their own place to buy for the past couple of years.
But even after higher mortgage rates brought an end to the real estate euphoria of 2021 and early 2022, finding the right home at an affordable price remains a challenge, she said.
And so, nearly three years after moving east, Ms. Laing and her fiancé are still searching.
The challenge is that, for now at least, homeowners aren’t rushing to put up for sale signs.
Some homeowners accustomed to the record price increases of the past two years are reluctant to list following price declines. Some who would otherwise move to bigger properties aren’t putting their current homes up for sale because they can’t qualify for the mortgage they’d need to upsize. In Calgary, for example, last month marked the lowest volume of new listings for February in 17 years.
The dearth of housing inventory is stok-
ing competition among prospective buyers, although the current market remains a far cry from the pandemic housing frenzy.
In Saint John, Lesley Oland, the real estate agent who’s helping Ms. Laing and her partner with their search, would often see 25 to 30 offers on a property in 2021 and the first half of 2022, with bids as high as $50,000 over asking. Now, she said, multiple bids for a home priced at market value generally involve two to 10 buyers, with offers going $5,000 to $10,000 over asking.
“And if a seller overprices, then he’s not gonna get any,” she said. “Now, people will wait.”
Buyers are also placing a variety of conditions on their offers.
In Oshawa, Ont., real estate agents Tania and Brandon Sheridan recommend that all prospective buyers make their offers conditional not just on their ability to secure financing but, if applicable, on their lender conducting an appraisal within that financing condition period, which is usually from three to seven days.
After a seller accepts an offer, the buyer’s lender will often order an appraisal to assess the value of the property. The amount the institution will lend depends on that assessment.
If the appraised value is below the agreed purchase price, the lender will offer a smaller mortgage, leaving the buyer in a bind. If they can’t cover the shortfall between the mortgage and that price, the deal doesn’t close. The buyer may lose their deposit and face additional penalties.
Making an offer that includes a clause about the appraisal, however, would allow the buyer to walk away during the conditional period.
That became an issue for some buyers last year, as the housing market was cooling off. A buyer and a seller would agree on a price and a period of a few weeks or months to close the deal. In the meantime, though, similar properties in the neighbourhood could sell at lower prices.
If the bank ordered the appraisal just before the closing date, lower-priced comparable sales could drag down the appraised value of the property, leaving the buyer in the lurch.
While the home prices declines have now stopped, Ms. Sheridan argues the appraisal clause remains an important additional safeguard for buyers and sellers.
“Right now, if you’re going into a bidding war and you’re overpaying for a property, then your appraisal matters, because if it’s lower, you have to come up with that buffer,” she said.
The ability to demand conditions without fear of losing out to other bids is a marked improvement so far this year compared to the past two years for buyers such as Ms. Laing, who knows all too well about the importance of a home inspection.
In September, 2022, she and her fiancé thought their search was over. After looking for a year-and-a-half, they’d found a newly built townhouse in the mid$600,000s that seemed just perfect.
But the couple eventually pulled their offer after a home inspection revealed severe issues with the property.
“That made us realize that some builders were taking advantage of the COVID market,” Ms. Laing said. “They were throwing up these homes, building them for cheap [and] marketing them to people coming in from Ontario who didn’t bother getting an inspection.”
Having to withdraw the offer when she thought they’d finally found their dream home was a low in what had been a months-long emotional roller coaster, she said.
“There were tears shed.”
Buyers in today’s market may be wary of making rash decisions and paying too much but, like Ms. Laing, they’re motivated. That means when a good home is put up for sale, someone will snap it up quickly.
At the height of the market, said Ms. Oland, the Saint John real estate agent, you had to check out a property and put in an offer the day it was listed. Now, she said, you have “a couple of days” to put in an offer on coveted homes that are priced right.
In some areas, a supply of newly built homes is providing some limited relief to otherwise inventory-starved markets. In Toronto, for example, a record total of nearly 32,000 new condo units is expected to hit the market this year, according to data from condo research firm Urbanation Inc.
In Calgary, Nishant Kalia, 31, and Tanushree Holker, 30, said they’re seeing a good number of listings coming up in the real estate segment they’re targeting: newly built townhouses priced at less than $500,000.
Mr. Kalia, who works in recruiting, and Ms. Holker, an investment representative at a big bank, moved to Toronto from New Delhi in 2019, but decided to relocate to Calgary after falling in love with the city – and its more affordable home prices.
But there, too, competition from buyers is fierce. Unlike markets like Chilliwack, London and Halifax, where demand now largely comes from locals, Calgary is now a prime destination for out-of-province buyers. With benchmark home prices hovering just above $500,000 – compared to more than $1-million In Toronto and Vancouver – the city is becoming a prime destination for buyers moving away from Ontario and B.C., and for real estate investors looking for a cheaper price point.
Ann-Marie Lurie, chief economist with the Calgary Real Estate Board, predicts the city’s home prices will soon be marching up if this trend continues.
Concern about a bounceback of demand and prices in the spring is why some buyers rushed to purchase in the dead of winter.
One of them was Ms. Laing’s 29-year-old sister, Krista Laing, who bought a condo in Oshawa in February.
“Let’s just do the opposite kind of what everyone’s expecting and, and maybe we’ll find a good deal that we won’t have to overbid or we won’t have to put multiple bids on,” said Krista, a municipal worker, describing the reasoning motivating buyers like her.
Those instincts proved to be correct.
Just after she sealed the deal on the condo – a 900-square-foot, three-bedroom, twobathroom apartment she bought for $475,000 – the market turned, according to Ms. Sheridan, the Oshawa real estate agent, who, along with her husband Brandon, assisted Krista in the purchase.
“The market switched, and it switched fast,” Ms. Sheridan said, recalling multiple offers becoming more and more common as February turned into March.
But while Krista dodged the competition by buying before spring, she still had to adjust her expectations to find something that would fit her budget.
“I kept hearing everything was down, I was hoping this was my time to get into a small detached home,” she said. But even after double-digit price declines, all such listings were going for $650,000 at least, which was far beyond her spending ceiling.
Even after settling for a property priced well below $500,000, Krista is working two side gigs – one doing snow removal in the winter and the other picking up extra shifts in a nearby municipality on top of her 40-hours-a-week government job in Oshawa – to be able to comfortably afford her mortgage.
Making ends meet with just her main job would be “extremely tight,” she said.
In Whistler, B.C., Jasmine Lorimer, a 34year-old social media marketing entrepreneur, poured all of her savings into a $805,000, 396-square-foot condo in December. It took about $200,000 to cover a 20-per-cent down payment and transaction costs for a property that is roughly the size of a two-car garage. But Ms. Lorimer sees the condo as her way into a housing market that had previously been utterly out of reach despite her solid income and six-figure savings.
“Once I found a place, I was pretty impulsive about it and just went for it,” she said.
For buyers who are still looking, the outlook is uncertain. Douglas Porter, chief economist with Bank of Montreal, warned until recently about the potential for the Bank of Canada to resume interest rate increases, should economic data – among them a resilient housing market – suggest that inflationary pressures haven’t sufficiently subsided.
But the recent collapse of SVB and Signature Bank has the potential to be a game changer for central banks, including the Bank of Canada. Now worries about the health of the banking sector could override higher inflation.
“It now seems unlikely that the Bank of Canada will be hiking further,” Mr. Porter said.
That’s good news for borrowers with variable mortgage rates, which are linked to the central bank’s trendsetting rate. At the same time, the crisis has rattled bond markets, pushing down bond yields, which affect fixed mortgage rates. The implication for borrowers who prefer to lock in mortgage rates is similar: Less upward pressure on rates.
Lower fixed mortgage rates could give buyers more confidence to borrow, once again lighting a fire under the housing market. And while more demand and rising prices could draw more homeowners back to the market to sell, the housing inventory is bound to remain tight.
Canada is on track to admit 1.45-million new permanent residents over the next three years, equivalent of 3.8 per cent of the country’s population. However, the pace of home building has slowed as developers pull back amid higher borrowing costs.
In Rothesay, Kelly Laing is still holding out hope this will be the year when she and her partner can buy a home, strike out on their own again and begin the next chapter of their lives together.
“I just have a really, really good feeling about it,” she said. But, after witnessing the excesses of the pandemic housing boom, she knows better than to let that feeling drive her decision-making.
“I don’t think it’s wise to potentially just buy a home to have a home,” she said. “We don’t want to be house poor.”

Full text: It was hailed as a breakthrough – a private member’s bill that sought to amend Ontario’s Planning Act to allow a form of housing that would allow unrelated seniors to live together in a single home, each with separate units, but also sharing common elements, like a kitchen or a living room.
The legislation, introduced by former Durham Liberal MPP Lindsey Park, was named after the long-running sitcom. In pushing for the change, however, Ms. Park was trying to help four senior women who were living together in a house in Port Perry, Ont., and had been turned down for a building permit because the local bylaws didn’t permit that kind of occupancy.
As Husmates co-founder Lesli Gaynor explains, “The city wanted to have them register as a rooming house because they shared the kitchen and they said ‘We are not a rooming house.
We don’t want to be inspected.
We don’t want to have to pay the fees that go along with rooming houses.’ “Those policies were a holdover from a more puritanical era when unrelated adults living together were viewed with suspicion – unless they were boarders in a boarding house.
“Local municipalities should not deter seniors from choosing affordable housing options and should recognize that unrelated seniors living together can reap significant health, economic and social benefits,” the bill’s preamble read. “It is desirable to provide clarity to municipalities that the Planning Act should be interpreted in a way that encourages and permits home sharing by unrelated seniors as a housing solution.”
Co-housing has been growing in Canada, and especially British Columbia, for many years, but such projects tend to be larger and rely on a condo or strata ownership model. In the case of the four women in Port Perry, they were told they’d have to register their dwelling as a rooming house, pay fees to the municipality and submit to regular inspections.
While Ms. Park’s bill never made it past second reading, later amendments to the Planning Act now include a provision preventing municipalities from passing bylaws that distinguish between related and unrelated adults.

Full text: 1048 broadview Ave., No. 901, Toronto B R O A DV I E W N O RT H Asking price: $1,149,900 (December, 2022) Previous asking prices: $1,149,900 (October, 2022); $1,169,900 (September, 2022); $1,198,000 (August, 2022) Selling price: $1,120,000 (January, 2023) Previous selling price: $498,468 (March, 2010) Taxes: $4,177 (2022) Property days on market: 146 Listing agent: Christopher Bibby, Re/Max Hallmark Bibby Group Realty THE ACTION This one-bedroomplus-den suite is in a building just north of Playter Estates and the Danforth but somewhat off the beaten path. Hitting the market last summer, successive mortgage-rate hikes made the sale a challenge and the asking price was tweaked several times.
Finally, in mid-January, a bid came in at $1.12-million from local buyers.
“There was a verbal offer from someone expressing some interest, but we didn’t engage because my clients hadn’t purchased anything else and they didn’t need to sell,” agent Christopher Bibby said.
“We knew we’d have to be patient, and it would take someone very specific who appreciated the neighbourhood and the layout.”
WHAT THEY GOT In 2010, owners of this nearly 1,200-square-foot unit had the builder remove the original second bedroom to extend the entertaining area along the wraparound balcony, and convert the third bathroom into a laundry room with a basin and folding table.
The kitchen is fashionable and functional with an island and stainless-steel appliances.
Other assets include a storage locker and parking.
Monthly fees of $999 cover 24-hour concierge and recreational facilities.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s a LEED-certified building, so it was more ecofriendly,” Mr. Bibby said.
“The amenities were quite nice with a large podium-level outdoor patio and entertaining space, which had southwest views, which a lot of people were excited to see.”
This unit’s custom design also catered to downsizers. “By opening up that second bedroom, it brought in a lot of natural light, but it wouldn’t be difficult to enclose it again,” Mr. Bibby said.
“[The owners] also wanted a grander entertaining space because that southwest and west view over the Don Valley, [Evergreen] Brick Works and into the downtown core is pretty stunning.”

Vancouver college eyes Broadway site for student housing

Full text: One of the biggest projects proposed for Vancouver’s Broadway Plan – the city’s ambitious effort to add 50,000 new homes along the subway extension now under construction – is a 3,300-apartment development by Vancouver Community College, as it joins other B.C. colleges and technical institutions in a push to build housing.
VCC president Ajay Patel said the college wants to use its Broadway site, which consists of three large blocks at the eastern end of the subway extension, to create affordable housing options for its students and for the city, as well as to generate money for a new academic building.
“We feel this is the right thing. It lines up with our values in delivering relevant education,” he said, adding that it is also a proposal that would “serve our community.”
Mr. Patel is hoping the development will lead the way in a new approach to student housing, one that provides the kind of apartments suitable for its students, whose average age is 35 and more than a quarter of whom are Indigenous.
“We need to look at something different from a dormitory.”
It’s a development the city appears to be poised to welcome.
Vancouver senior planner Matt Shillito, who has been overseeing the Broadway Plan, said via e-mail that the VCC site is one of eight “large and unique sites” in the almost 500 blocks of the newly rezoned corridor that could help provide much needed new housing, public services and job space in the area.
“We’ve had some initial discussions with VCC about their aspirations to redevelop the campus to enhance their academic programs and introduce a broader mix of uses, including housing,” he said. “Once VCC are ready to start, the next step would be for us to seek council approval to begin a planning process to create a new policy statement and master plan for the site.”
The multiple new housing towers at VCC, if built, would dwarf the two towers and 524 apartments planned for the former Mountain Equipment Co-op site further west on Broadway, one of the other major proposals that has been pitched for the corridor.
The community-college proposal is meant to connect with the creative district being developed along Great Northern Way, where the Emily Carr University of Art and Design, the Centre for Digital Media and a number of new tech businesses are located.
VCC’s plan is also the largest housing development put forward by any of the other B.C. postsecondary institutions that have been acting on an NDP promise in 2018 of $450-million to create almost 5,000 new student beds around the province.
Universities – which are seen to have partially contributed to Canada’s housing crisis by bringing in thousands of high-feepaying, apartment-needing international students to help balance their budgets – have been working intensively across Canada to increase the amount of student housing.
But in B.C., no postsecondary institutions were allowed to take on debt to create housing until 2018. The University of British Columbia was the only one that added housing from 2006 to 2016 because it was able to leverage its endowment fund.
Colleges and technical institutions, and even other universities, didn’t have those kinds of resources.
The 2018 NDP housing initiative allowed all of them to take on that kind of debt, with approval and backing from the province.
Several other institutions have already built new projects or are in the process of doing so. Douglas College, for example, will build a 20-storey, 368-bed tower near the current New Westminster campus with $200-million in provincial money for the $292-million project, which will start construction this summer. It’s part of the work already started to add 2,000 beds in the Lower Mainland.
In Burnaby, at the British Columbia Institute of Technology, a 12-storey mass-timber building is under way that will have 470 beds, some of them reserved for students who come into the city for only a few weeks at a time to complete intensive tradestraining programs.
“It will start to relieve student pressure on local markets,” said Lisa Collins, vicepresident for students. And, she said, it will also provide a better environment than the scattered and not-always-pleasant basement suites students frequently find themselves in around the campus.
“We hear stories from students about their experiences in off-campus housing and we worry about the impact on student success.”
In Northern B.C., Coast Mountain College has already completed a new 104-bed student-housing building in Terrace, funded with $19-million of provincial money for the $20-million project. It was designed to make its Indigenous students, who come from remote villages and settlements throughout the north and account for more than a quarter of the student population, feel at home. In addition to communal kitchens, there is an apartment for visiting elders, and design elements throughout reflect Indigenous heritage in the region. Students pay $600 a month in rent.
“We all recognized that safe, affordable on-campus housing contributes to student success,” said college president Laurie Waye.
In Comox, North Island College is about to start on two buildings: one with 20 apartments for family housing and one that is more traditional, with 217 student beds.
Like both Vancouver Community College and Coast Mountain, the college is grappling with a student body that is markedly different from the 20-somethings who dominate university undergraduate programs.
“Our average student is 30. We’re not like a UBC or SFU, so the family housing was really important,” said Christiana Wiens, director of public affairs. “And we have students commuting from Port Alberni, Port Hardy, to classes and then driving back to their family. We’d heard it enough, we decided to do something about that.”
The new housing will provide some priority admission to Indigenous students from the 35 First Nations in the college’s territory.
Ms. Wiens said it has been a learning experience for the college to build housing, something it had never done before.
But, she said, “there was a lot of help and willingness from the province” and local residents raised no objections.
Back in Vancouver, Mr. Patel is hoping the same for Vancouver Community College’s ambitious plans.
He said, so far, the province and city have been extremely supportive. And he’s not expecting the kind of blowback that, for instance, has swirled around the massive housing development planned by a real estate investment trust for the Safeway site next to the Commercial Drive SkyTrain station.
He believes the college’s efforts to hang on to its land, rather than selling to a private developer, and to create a significant number of below-market apartments, will be welcomed by the community.

Can Freddie retire and still support his kids?: Almost 60, he’s amassed $3.8-million and wants to draw down his savings in the most tax-efficient way

Full text: FINANCIAL FACELIFT Freddie is at a turning point.
He’ll be 60 this year and he’s decided to leave his professional career – and $148,700 salary – to travel, teach part-time and do some volunteer work, including helping out with the local hockey club. He’ll get a year’s bonus.
It’ll be a big change, shifting from saving to spending. The numbers tell the story. Freddie has amassed $3.8-million of assets, yet he spends less than $30,000 a year – and that’s with joint custody of his two teenage children.
“I have been investing in dividend stocks for the past decade to collect the cash flow,” Freddie writes in an email. “Thank you John Heinzl.”
His main concern is how to draw down his savings in the most tax-efficient way. He plans to support his children through college and university and give them a gift when they graduate.
He doesn’t plan on that being his last contribution to their future. “Will I have enough to live to 93 and leave [an inheritance] to my children?” Freddie asks.
We asked Warren MacKenzie, a fee-only financial planner in Toronto, to look at Freddie’s situation. Mr. MacKenzie holds the chartered professional accountant (CPA) and certified financial planner (CFP) designations.
WHAT THE EXPERT SAYS With a $3.8-million net worth, Freddie is in the top two per cent of all Canadians, Mr. MacKenzie says. While Freddie has earned an above-average salary over the years, “the real key to his financial security is the fact that he saves a lot each month.”
Freddie’s questions are mostly related to maximizing investment efficiency and minimizing income tax, the planner says.
“This shows that, after years of saving and building wealth, it’s difficult for him to shift gears. He has to recognize that he is now at a time of his life when he can start to spend more.”
Freddie’s retirement spending goal of $80,000 per year after tax is more than twice what he is spending now. So even if he lives to age 100, he is likely to leave well over $1-million in dollars with the same purchasing power as today to each of his two children, Mr. MacKenzie says.
If it is important for him to minimize income tax and be certain about the amount he leaves his heirs, Freddie could also consider using a whole life insurance policy, where the death benefit grows tax-free and the amount is guaranteed.
For Freddie, it would make more sense to give his two children advances on their inheritance now while they are young and need the money to get started, Mr. MacKenzie says. “By giving them money in stages, Freddie will reduce his taxable income and be able to enjoy seeing how his gift helps his children.”
A gift of money may also give his children experience in investing.
If Freddie’s goal is to maximize the size of his estate, there are several steps he should consider, the planner says.
In the years before he collects Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security benefits, his only income will be the interest and dividends from his non-registered investments. He will be in a lower income tax bracket than after he begins collecting CPP, OAS and the required withdrawals from his registered accounts.
In those early years, he should fund all his living expenses with taxable withdrawals from his registered accounts, the planner says. By drawing down his registered accounts, the amount of tax he will eventually have to pay on the mandatory withdrawals (starting in the year he turns 72) will be lower because there will be less money in the accounts.
“If he delays withdrawing from his RRSP until he needs to turn it into a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) at age 71, the RRIF will be larger, and the larger payments will come into income at a time when he is also collecting CPP and OAS, the planner says. ”This will put him into a higher tax bracket and into the OAS clawback zone.”
Freddie has $660,000 in defined contribution pension plans ($600,000 from a previous employer and $60,000 with his current employer). These can be converted into a locked-in RRSP and then to a life income fund, or LIF, the planner says. He also has $833,000 in a personal RRSP.
“Because he wants to maximize flexibility and liquidity, Freddie should first convert his defined contribution pension plan to a LIF immediately upon retirement and withdraw the maximum amount allowable,” Mr. MacKenzie says. (A LIF has less flexibility than a RRIF because with a LIF there is both a minimum and maximum amount that can be withdrawn each year.)
Depending on the rate of return and the balance of the LIF at the end of 2023, it is projected that, in 2024, Freddie will be able to withdraw about $45,000 from it, the planner says. In addition he should convert his RRSP to a RRIF because he will need the additional money. He could withdraw about $30,000 a year from his RRIF. He will also take about $45,000 a year from his non-registered/cash account.
“Altogether this will be sufficient to cover his projected living expense of $80,000 a year, a taxfree savings account contribution of $6,500 and projected income tax of $33,000.” By the early conversion to a RRIF, at age 65 he’ll get the benefit of the federal pension deduction.
Given that Freddie has more than adequate liquid resources, and assuming that he expects to live until at least his mid 80s, he should delay CPP and OAS until age 70. By doing this, his CPP payments will be higher by 42 per cent and his OAS payments will be higher by 36 per cent.
With his investments, Freddie’s asset mix is 85 per cent in mostly individual Canadian stocks, 6 per cent in bonds and 9 per cent in cash. As such, Freddie is exposing his savings to more stock market risk than is necessary, the planner says. “One important decumulation strategy is to have an asset mix which will provide the required cash flow each year without having to sell equities when they have fallen in value,” Mr. MacKenzie says.
Freddie is considering giving each of his children a gift of $10,000 upon graduation. He could help them more financially, while also saving income tax, by arranging to give each child an advance inheritance of $250,000 toward the purchase of a first home, the planner says.
This could be done after they are employed and demonstrate they are financially responsible.
“By removing $500,000 from his non-registered account, he will reduce his taxable income by about $25,000, (assuming an average rate of return of 5 per cent),” the planner says, “and at his average marginal tax rate of 45 per cent, it would reduce his tax by more than $10,000 per year.” Want a free financial facelift?

Full text: Catherine Hernandez says she wrote her latest novel, The Story Of Us, as a way to give her readers something that felt like a “nice hug” during the pandemic.
She dug into the story, about a Filipino personal support worker’s bond with an elderly trans woman, in 2020, as the prolonged lockdown and uncertainty made so many people feel like our world was coming to an end. She had just published Crosshairs, a dystopian fiction set in the near future about the containment and oppression of marginalized communities that felt all too real.
Moving onto something new, she decided that, after serving up a prophetic doomsday scenario, she would hole up in the Scarborough, Ont., townhome she was renting, and pivot toward a narrative about human connection that is full of warmth and hope.
“I sat in my room, imagined myself to be like Lady Edith in Downton Abbey, stuck in my estate, writing my lovers,” a sprightly Hernandez says over the phone.
Her home, or at least hometown, plays a prominent role in the playwright and author’s literary debut – the award-winning Scarborough, which was about a community of people in difficult circumstances finding support at an underfunded drop-in centre.
That novel, which has since been turned into a feature film, is partly responsible for a local renaissance putting the long-misrepresented Toronto suburb on the pop-cultural map; others contributions include Carrianne Leung’s That Time I Loved You and David Chariandy’s Brother, the latter also recently been turned into a film. Beyond writers, Brother lead Lamar Johnson, recording artist the Weeknd and John Wick 4 actor Shamier Anderson fill out those who are repping the east end to the world.
The Story Of Us, which is largely set in a Rouge River bungalow close to where Hernandez wrote it, now joins the canon. Scarborough is never far from Hernandez’s heart, even though she’s currently living pretty far from it.
She is among the latest to exit the overpriced city, moving just more than a year ago with her spouse Nazbah Tom to Napanee, Ont. If you browse Hernandez’s Instagram posts, you’ll see she’s gone full farmhand, sporting overalls or coveralls, wielding chainsaws, hacksaws and even a bow and arrow that she fires into her own straw bales.
The couple’s decision to leave Scarborough began with the 2019 flooding of the Rouge River, which resulted in park benches along the marsh engulfed under water. Hernandez saw that as a sign the environmental collapse would be hitting close to home sooner than later.
She and Tom began developing a green thumb as a way to become self-sufficient should basic supply structures collapse. “I was like, ‘Oh, I think we’d better get ready for some harder times to come,’ ” she says, acknowledging that she was leaning into her inner doomsayer. ”Do I want to get ready now and look completely silly to everyone around me? Or do I not care about what people think, be prepared now and be pleasantly surprised if things turn around?
And then the pandemic happened.”
What began with growing onions, leeks and bok choy in pots near their window grew into urban farming on their veranda and then a search for more space to expand their farming, which Scarborough could not accommodate. That’s how they ended up in Napanee, a rural community where a QTBIPOC couple like Hernandez and Tom stand out.
Despite that, Hernandez says the neighbours have been great, sharing their experience with the land and often lending a helping hand.
“Obviously they have to educate themselves about what it’s like to be around people who are like us,” says Hernandez. But she adds that the learning goes both ways when the cultural divide is so wide. “We also have some privilege. We’re coming from the city.
We work from home. We have an income. We’re not relying on the land at this point. So we really do have to meet in the middle.”
Building connections and growing community is Hernandez’s whole vibe. Wherever she goes, she’s always that glowing and inviting presence, finding common ground where people least expect it. That’s also a common thread in her published work, including The Story Of Us.
The new novel, which in an amusing gambit is narrated by a newborn, follows Mary Grace Conception, or MG as she’s referred to by others. MG, a woman in her 30s, leaves behind her husband in the Philippines to work as a nanny in Hong Kong before immigrating to Canada through our Live-in Caregiver Program. She longs for home while looking after other people’s children and waits patiently to have her own.
Hernandez is returning to familiar territory. Once a child-care provider herself, she also worked with the Sulong Theatre Collective alongside Karen Ancheta, Romeo Candido and Aura Carcueva on the 2010 play Future Folk, which was based on interviews with Filipino caregivers. That material helps fill out MG’s story as she moves from employer to employer. The narrative paints in vivid and striking detail a childcare provider’s daily grind, and the oppressiveness of being forced to sleep in the same home as an exploitative employer.
The bulk of the new novel is set at a neglected bungalow in Rouge River, where MG cares for Liz, the elderly trans woman whose memories of a storied past are slowly slipping away owing to dementia.
Hernandez describes recent interviews she conducted with personal support workers, which deepened her understanding when it came to the responsibility of caring for trans elders. “They are the protector of that identity,” says Hernandez. “You have a person who might not be able to advocate for themselves. It demands a beautiful level of care.”
For MG, Hernandez takes her time in letting the character develop that protector identity. MG comes from a conservative religious upbringing after all. There’s caution and even some hostility in the dynamic between MG and Liz before a tender bond is formed. In their relationship, Hernandez forges common ground between the immigrant and queer experience. Both, for Hernandez, are made beautiful by the effort and love put in to finding chosen families.
“The reality of a diaspora is that you have to reconfigure what family and love means,” she says, describing those immigrants separated from their biological families but building new ones to enjoy weekend barbecues with.
“And so, too, do queer folks who are orphaned or disconnected from our families. We’ve had to reconfigure who are our siblings, who are our parents and who are the elders in our lives.”
“It’s been such a joy in my life to do that,” she adds. “It’s such an empowering thing to say, ‘I can still be loved. I can still be cared for.’ ”

Full text: 130 Glenforest Rd., Toronto LAWRENCE PARK NORTH Asking price: $2,198,000 (December, 2022) Selling price: $2.1-million (December, 2022) Previous selling price: $376,000 (November, 1992) Taxes: $7,444 (2022) Days on the market: Five Listing agent: Belinda Lelli, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
Buyer’s agents: Suzanne Stephens and Belinda Lelli, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
THE ACTION More than 150 people came through the doors in private and public tours of this updated, four-bedroom house over the second week of December.
“We were priced high when people were selling detached homes at $1.7-million and $1.8million,” agent Belinda Lelli said.
“There was one priced like ours, but it had been sitting on the market for over 60 days and there were no professional photos.” Ms. Lelli was confident buyers would pay a premium for this attractive space. In the end, there were two offers, somewhat under the asking price, with the winning bid coming from a couple who were already local renters.
“My stager and her crew made it nice, light and inviting,” Ms. Lelli said. “That’s what everybody wants.
“The buyers who were victorious did not see the need to keep paying high rent when they had determined they indeed love the neighbourhood and all of its offerings.”
WHAT THEY GOT This roughly 90year-old house has had numerous updates, from a new driveway and roofing to a pair of family room additions with exits to a deck and flagstone patio.
The eat-in kitchen was recently remodeled and the basement lowered to create an 81/2-foot ceiling.
The living room has the original wood-burning fireplace, stained glass windows and pocket doors to the dining room.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s a very quiet street and kids can play outside for hours because you’re not getting that thoroughfare [traffic] you get on a lot of other streets,” Ms. Lelli said.
“Lawrence Park speaks for itself in terms of value proposition: top schools, proximity to transit/TTC, parks, and great community spirit and multiculturalism.”
The 25- by 125-foot lot was also about 20-feet deeper than most, allowing for a larger house. “Normally when you have a main floor family room, it’s usually in a newer build and the price point really escalates,” Ms. Lelli said.

A very rare house by John C. Parkin hits the market: Architect, who is considered one of Canada’s most successful modernist builders, designed very few private residences

Full text: TORONTO While I’m unaware of any such poll, gut instinct tells me that a random sampling of Americans asked to name significant U.S. Modernist architects would produce names such as Richard Neutra, Philip Johnson, I.M. Pei, or Eero Saarinen. And a similar poll in Canada would be a less successful, tooth pulling exercise that might, perhaps, come up with Moshe Safdie or Raymond Moriyama, if any at all.
“I think that’s right,” agrees 84-year-old architect Frederick Valentine from his home in Calgary. “And of course the architects themselves [in the U.S.] are more savvy about public relations.”
Mr. Valentine’s boss/mentor from 1966 to 1978, for example, John Cresswell Parkin (1922–1988), was arguably the most successful modernist this country has ever produced, yet his name does not fall easily from the lips of the average Canadian.
However, those of us who study the period from 1945 to, perhaps, 1980, know that John B. Parkin Associates (his partner, John Burnett Parkin, ironically, was not related) was the largest office of its kind, with an output of modernist buildings nothing short of staggering. We also know that John C. was lucky enough to receive his Master’s degree at Harvard under legendary Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius.
Oh, and one other thing: we know that the Parkin office produced very few private houses. One for himself at 75 The Bridle Path (demolished), one for his friend J.
Douglas Crashley (when he was a bachelor) on Old George Place, one for the son of Canadian Tire co-founder A. J. Billes, and a few others. So, when the Alfred W. Billes house in Toronto’s tony Bridle Path neighbourhood came up for sale a few months ago, I decided to e-mail the listing agent, Jane Zhang at Sotheby’s, to have a look at the 26,000square-foot mansion for myself.
The first thing that struck me? What the well heeled wanted in 1975, when this house was completed, and what they want today, are very different. Had it not been bare-treed February, the house would have been invisible due to the raised mounds of earth and the small forest in front; today, most owners want to broadcast at least some of their bling to impress passersby.
Walk up the impressive stair and rather than being confronted by a baronial front door, 30 High Point Rd. sports a simple (albeit beautiful) wooden door surrounded by three panes of glass. And before I clunkclunked the big knocker, I stop to admire the bush hammered concrete walls – a technique used by stone masons to give rough texture and visual interest – and its exposed pink and white quartz aggregate.
And, in a classic Modernist move, these walls slip past the glass to blur the distinction between indoors and out.
“Material use was entirely John C.,” says Mr. Valentine, who served as project head and even enjoyed a few toots on the water on the Billes’s family yacht. “He was a devotee of I.M. Pei; he was fascinated by the modern use of concrete, and the treatment of concrete as a finish material.” Mr. Valentine adds that this was around the same time the office was working on the competition entry for the National Gallery in Ottawa and he’d been sent to both I.M. Pei’s Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, N.Y.
(1968) and his East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington (construction began in 1971) to do research.
And while Parkin’s National Gallery was not built (despite winning) the Billes’s residence takes cues from that project, plus the I.M. Pei buildings Mr. Valentine toured: the projecting and receding concrete façade; the wide, angled piers (better seen in construction photographs); and the interior’s wide, sundrenched, three-storey atrium – try selling that much unusable space to a wealthy client today – which collects natural light from a quartet of copper clad skylights.
Toronto’s futuristic City Hall, which the Parkin office worked on, can be seen in the ceilings (while penned by Finland’s Viljo Revell, his office had to partner with a local firm). Parkin, at every opportunity, created low, sheltering ceilings that, like at City Hall, suddenly zoom upwards, thereby creating a sense of wonder. This sense of undulation, of ‘travel’ from place to place, creates a building that despite boasting eight bedrooms and twelve bathrooms never feels unmanageable, cavernous, or ostentatious as I walk through it. It’s a testament to the design that, in the quarter century that’s passed since the Billes family sold it, it hasn’t changed much save for the bathrooms (I spotted some groovy original tile in the men’s and women’s change rooms beside the indoor pool) and some portions of flooring.
“There’s been really no major intervention, from what I could see,” Mr. Valentine says during our Zoom call, “which would be typical for most houses in that price range.” (For the record, 30 High Point Rd. is listed at $28-million.) He’s right: A less enlightened owner might have filled in the atrium, drywalled over the rough concrete, or replaced the Zen garden with a basketball court. Maybe, just maybe, the building has embodied some of the optimism architects possessed in the mid-century period.
“There was a real sense [of] history being made,” Mr. Valentine says. “I was pretty young, but it seemed very romantic and very exciting. You know, lots of people would say, ‘Oh, jeez, I don’t want to work in an environment like that, you’re just one of 60 [employees] in rows, everybody with a white shirt and tie,’ but I didn’t see it like that for some reason – I was enthralled by the whole business.”
Hopefully, a very well-to-do architecture buff will become enthralled by the former Billes residence. Too many John C. Parkin designs have met the wrecker’s ball.
Intrigued by John C. Parkin’s work but unwilling to rent the Ferrari needed to show up for a tour of 30 High Point Rd.? In an upcoming column I’ll feature John C.
buildings that are accessible to the public. I’ll even throw in a few by his closest rival, Peter Dickinson.

Owners rediscover the appeal of rental, short and long term: Higher interest rates have pushed some owners to look for more income

Full text: VANCOUVER As homeowners and investors struggle to cover increased mortgage payments and other debts, there’s been a noticeable spike in the number of short-term rentals.
The increase in short-term rentals is revealed in data provided by Inside Airbnb, an American based non-profit that gathers data on Airbnb listings and is starting to do a deeper dive on Canadian cities. And those who work in real estate are also taking notice, including Joy Chao, co-owner of JHA interior design, a company that deals in major renovations and new builds, mostly in Vancouver and Richmond, B.C.
“We have seen more and more clients asking … either to have a laneway house put in or a legal basement suite put in for both long term and short term rental,” Ms. Chao says. “Some of them can get financially quite a bit more for short term rental.”
Ms. Chao said the increased interest rate is a major incentive for switching to short-term rental listings, which can command rents that are significantly higher than long-term rents. One west side client who owns a property with a basement suite and a laneway house rented both out for short-term rental and collected between $8,000 to $9,000 a month last summer, she says.
“It was designed in such a way that no matter how you slice it, it’s going to be a high end rental, with nice appliances, in-suite laundry for both the laneway and the basement suite, and so between the two areas he realized a significant financial gain for sure,” Ms. Chao said.
Vacation rental operator Deana Steele has heard from more than 40 investors since the start of the year who want to rent out vacation rental units. Kelowna, B.C., is a growing condo market for investors, with 52.4 per cent of condos investor-owned, according to the Canadian Housing Statistics Program. There are several condo towers zoned to include vacation rental, such as the new Aqua, a waterfront tower complex.
Her Keys to Kelowna Properties firm brings short-term rentals online, and she focuses on the high-end market. Right now she’s seeing a glut of all kinds of investors trying to cover their costs by turning to vacation rentals.
There’s a reason. An ultra-luxury home worth more than $3million can bring in $100,000 to $120,000 a month in rental income in the high season, based on nightly bookings, according to Ms. Steele. Newer family homes priced at $1-million to $2-million can bring in $40,000 a month in the high season. A luxury condo can bring in around $15,000 to $20,000 a month and a standard condo around $7,000 to $12,000 per month, although that category really varies, she says. In the low season, the revenues are substantially lower, around $10,000 a month for the $3-million homes, $7,000 a month for the newer family homes and $5,000 a month for the luxury condos.
While the luxury market for short-term rental is thriving, average investors are having a tougher time, she says. Even though short-term rentals can command rents that are up to four times that of long-term rentals, that’s not always enough to cover their new financing. A lot of them are dealing with construction delays that have them completing at a higher rate, says Ms. Steele.
“All these enquiries are coming in, and I can’t save them, the market is so saturated,” she says.
“The delay in closing for the new construction was really damaging to their projections. The only way to make up for those numbers is short-term rentals. It’s a huge loss to go long term [rental],” she says. “At the moment, most people I speak with don’t want to sell, because they do see there will be some long-term gains but they realize there will be some short-term subsidies from their income to cover these properties, so it’s a little stressful.”
Short-term rental is defined as less than 30-day stays, which in many municipalities requires a business licence. It also requires payment of the province’s speculation and vacancy tax. To avoid the tax, hosts must rent the units for a minimum of one-month increments for at least six months, according to the Ministry of Finance. The province also requires all short-term operators to collect PST at 8 per cent and municipal and regional district tax at 3 per cent.
Ms. Steele has a client with a two-bedroom townhouse whose investor owner is looking at $5,500 in carrying costs, including the speculation and vacancy tax he will be required to pay on his vacation rental. There are other taxes, financing costs and utility bills. The start-up cost of furnishing and stocking the unit is around $52,000, she says.
In response to the new supply of short-term rental units, a lot of new operators are coming into the market, she says.
“I think we are going to see another surge of listings come on as one last kick at the can for these investors, to make it work.”
Murray Cox is founder of Inside Airbnb, a short-term rental analysis site that is mostly selffunded and does data analysis for academics, governments and community groups. Airbnb is the biggest platform, but there are others, including VRBO and HomeAway.
Mr. Cox, who is based in New York and has a tech background, has started collecting data on Canada as a whole.
In Vancouver, short-term rental is only allowed if the owner lives within the residence, and is not allowed for a separate suite or laneway house. However, 82.6 per cent of Airbnb listings are currently posted as entire homes or apartments. More than 50 per cent of short-term rentals advertise entire homes, according to Inside Airbnb.
Short-term hosts can have multiple units using one licence number within their principal residence, but are only allowed to accept one booking at a time, according to the City. There are hosts with multiple listings, according to Inside Airbnb, appearing to operate like businesses, both short term and longer term rentals.
Whether they are paying the speculation and vacancy tax is not known. B.C.’s Ministry of Finance said legislation is under way to offer better tools for local government to regulate the system.
Rentals of more than 30 days are allowed to advertise on vacation platforms, and they require licences for each address. About 28 per cent of the listings in Vancouver are unlicensed, according to Inside Airbnb. Mr. Cox noticed Vancouver’s longer-term rentals doubled once regulations were brought in.
The problem with the 30-day minimum rentals allowed on these types of platforms is that they evade tenant protection laws, says Mr. Cox.
He said it also appears a lot of Vancouver hosts are reusing license numbers for different addresses. As an example, he found 16 different Airbnb listings that are using the same licence number.
“The Canadian systems have some decent laws on the books, for example, Toronto. But there is still abuse of those laws that is taking place.”
The City of Vancouver said it’s issued 2,597 short-term rental business licences so far this year and their data shows 3,524 active short-term listings.
Chief licence inspector Sarah Hicks said in an e-mail that investigations are ongoing and they’ve issued more than 1,890 tickets to illegal operators and more than 200 cases have been referred to prosecution.
Ms. Steele sympathizes with both sides of the debate, those who need to make extra money to cover growing costs, and those who are seeking affordable housing.
She’s focusing on the luxury market because so many mansions sit empty “90 per cent of the year.”
“All of them are for personal use … they are sitting vacant. We can bring people in, stimulate the economy, and drive some interest to Kelowna. That’s my goal.”

Full text: Home in building west of downtown Toronto features a unique terrace in a condo complex with plenty of amenities CAROLYN IRELAND TORONTO 2285 Lakeshore Blvd. W., No. 1908 TORONTO Asking Price: $1,899,000 Taxes: $4,404.57 (2022) Monthly Maintenance Fees: $1,521.74 Agents: Mara Bossio, Royal LePage Terrequity Realty THE BACKSTORY In 2001, real estate agent Mara Bossio led a technology guru from Texas on a tour of Torontoarea condo units.
On the list was a two-bedroom unit in the Grand Harbour complex on Etobicoke’s waterfront.
The 1,600-square-foot unit had wraparound windows overlooking the yacht clubs below, a balcony and a large terrace.
The next morning Ms. Bossio called her client.
“You have to pursue this offer because there’s someone else who wants to buy it,” Ms. Bossio recalls telling him. “That someone else was me.”
When the tech executive demurred, Ms. Bossio purchased the unit.
At the time, Ms. Bossio lived next door, in a unit which provided no outdoor space.
“A girl can’t live like that,” she says.
The two complexes, built in the 1990s, were among the first to spring up along the lakeshore west of Toronto’s downtown.
The large Palace Pier and Palace Place stood to the east. In between was a strip of motels that had developed seedy reputations since their heyday in the 1950s.
“People couldn’t sell those motels for very good money.
They were not zoned for residential,” Ms. Bossio says.
Local and provincial governments expropriated the land along the shoreline and created a plan to build a community with condo towers replacing the motels.
Development was slow but new projects were under construction in the 1990s.
“Then the market fell out,” Ms. Bossio says.
The builders couldn’t sell their luxury penthouses and townhouses.
“I rolled in, and I called the builder and said, ‘I can see you’re going to have trouble,’ ” she says.
“He couldn’t get rid of the product.”
Ms. Bossio, who had studied fashion and design, advised the developers to revamp some of the units – including making structural changes – in order to make them more appealing to buyers.
“No developer accepts this easily,” she says, “however they allowed me the room to launch successful sales programs in record time.”
UNIT 1908 Ms. Bossio took possession of her new Grand Harbour condo and hired a crew to make changes immediately. With her background, she could see past the stippled ceiling, wall-to-wall broadloom, closed kitchen and colour palette.
“It was painted mustard yellow,” she recalls. “It was awful.”
During a six-week renovation, Ms. Bossio had walls removed to make the kitchen more open to the living and dining areas.
The carpeting was torn out and 3/4-inch hardwood floors were installed.
Today the unit has an island for casual dining next to the kitchen.
“It’s a free-flowing, really great space in which to entertain,” says Ms. Bossio, who brings in a chef to cook for her and her guests on special occasions.
There are two bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms and a powder room.
The complex has plenty of amenities, including an indoor salt water pool, squash and basketball courts and a car wash.
THE BEST FEATURE The unit sits at the top of the archway connecting two of the buildings at Grand Harbour. The 500-square-foot terrace sits in the arch, sheltered by the wall of the next building.
Ms. Bossio says the position of the terrace – high above the yacht clubs below – provides complete privacy.
“My unit is the only unit in the building that has this terrace.”

Full text: VANCOUVER As homeowners and investors struggle to cover increased mortgage payments and other debts, there’s been a noticeable spike in the number of short-term rentals.
The increase in short-term rentals is revealed in data provided by Inside Airbnb, an American based non-profit that gathers data on Airbnb listings and is starting to do a deeper dive on Canadian cities. And those who work in real estate are also taking notice, including Joy Chao, co-owner of JHA interior design, a company that deals in major renovations and new builds, mostly in Vancouver and Richmond, B.C.
“We have seen more and more clients asking … either to have a laneway house put in or a legal basement suite put in for both long term and short term rental,” Ms. Chao says. “Some of them can get financially quite a bit more for short term rental.”
Ms. Chao said the increased interest rate is a major incentive for switching to short-term rental listings, which can command rents that are significantly higher than long-term rents. One west side client who owns a property with a basement suite and a laneway house rented both out for short-term rental and collected between $8,000 to $9,000 a month last summer, she says.
“It was designed in such a way that no matter how you slice it, it’s going to be a high end rental, with nice appliances, in-suite laundry for both the laneway and the basement suite, and so between the two areas he realized a significant financial gain for sure,” Ms. Chao said.
Vacation rental operator Deana Steele has heard from more than 40 investors since the start of the year who want to rent out vacation rental units. Kelowna, B.C., is a growing condo market for investors, with 52.4 per cent of condos investor-owned, according to the Canadian Housing Statistics Program. There are several condo towers zoned to include vacation rental, such as the new Aqua, a waterfront tower complex.
Her Keys to Kelowna Properties firm brings short-term rentals online, and she focuses on the high-end market. Right now she’s seeing a glut of all kinds of investors trying to cover their costs by turning to vacation rentals.
There’s a reason. An ultra-luxury home worth more than $3million can bring in $100,000 to $120,000 a month in rental income in the high season, based on nightly bookings, according to Ms. Steele. Newer family homes priced at $1-million to $2-million can bring in $40,000 a month in the high season. A luxury condo can bring in around $15,000 to $20,000 a month and a standard condo around $7,000 to $12,000 per month, although that category really varies, she says. In the low season, the revenues are substantially lower, around $10,000 a month for the $3-million homes, $7,000 a month for the newer family homes and $5,000 a month for the luxury condos.
While the luxury market for short-term rental is thriving, average investors are having a tougher time, she says. Even though short-term rentals can command rents that are up to four times that of long-term rentals, that’s not always enough to cover their new financing. A lot of them are dealing with construction delays that have them completing at a higher rate, says Ms. Steele.
“All these enquiries are coming in, and I can’t save them, the market is so saturated,” she says.
“The delay in closing for the new construction was really damaging to their projections. The only way to make up for those numbers is short-term rentals. It’s a huge loss to go long term [rental],” she says. “At the moment, most people I speak with don’t want to sell, because they do see there will be some long-term gains but they realize there will be some short-term subsidies from their income to cover these properties, so it’s a little stressful.”
Short-term rental is defined as less than 30-day stays, which in many municipalities requires a business licence. It also requires payment of the province’s speculation and vacancy tax. To avoid the tax, hosts must rent the units for a minimum of one-month increments for at least six months, according to the Ministry of Finance. The province also requires all short-term operators to collect PST at 8 per cent and municipal and regional district tax at 3 per cent.
Ms. Steele has a client with a two-bedroom townhouse whose investor owner is looking at $5,500 in carrying costs, including the speculation and vacancy tax he will be required to pay on his vacation rental. There are other taxes, financing costs and utility bills. The start-up cost of furnishing and stocking the unit is around $52,000, she says.
In response to the new supply of short-term rental units, a lot of new operators are coming into the market, she says.
“I think we are going to see another surge of listings come on as one last kick at the can for these investors, to make it work.”
Murray Cox is founder of Inside Airbnb, a short-term rental analysis site that is mostly selffunded and does data analysis for academics, governments and community groups. Airbnb is the biggest platform, but there are others, including VRBO and HomeAway.
Mr. Cox, who is based in New York and has a tech background, has started collecting data on Canada as a whole.
In Vancouver, short-term rental is only allowed if the owner lives within the residence, and is not allowed for a separate suite or laneway house. However, 82.6 per cent of Airbnb listings are currently posted as entire homes or apartments. More than 50 per cent of short-term rentals advertise entire homes, according to Inside Airbnb.
Short-term hosts can have multiple units using one licence number within their principal residence, but are only allowed to accept one booking at a time, according to the City. There are hosts with multiple listings, according to Inside Airbnb, appearing to operate like businesses, both short term and longer term rentals.
Whether they are paying the speculation and vacancy tax is not known. B.C.’s Ministry of Finance said legislation is under way to offer better tools for local government to regulate the system.
Rentals of more than 30 days are allowed to advertise on vacation platforms, and they require licences for each address. About 28 per cent of the listings in Vancouver are unlicensed, according to Inside Airbnb. Mr. Cox noticed Vancouver’s longer-term rentals doubled once regulations were brought in.
The problem with the 30-day minimum rentals allowed on these types of platforms is that they evade tenant protection laws, says Mr. Cox.
He said it also appears a lot of Vancouver hosts are reusing license numbers for different addresses. As an example, he found 16 different Airbnb listings that are using the same licence number.

The City of Vancouver said it’s issued 2,597 short-term rental business licences so far this year and their data shows 3,524 active short-term listings.
Chief licence inspector Sarah Hicks said in an e-mail that investigations are ongoing and they’ve issued more than 1,890 tickets to illegal operators and more than 200 cases have been referred to prosecution.

Full text: If the goal is excitement (and it should be), the just-completed NHL trade deadline was an alltimer. Instead of the usual shrill hype, we got actual follow through. Congratulations to everyone in the league and welcome to the 21st century.
But if the goal is measurable ROI, someone messed up big time. Several executives have made decisions in the past two weeks that will cost their team for four or five years. A couple are going to lose their jobs on the back of this. If those men are remembered, it will be as a sort of local talk-radio curse.
These are the executives who should be praised most highly.
They aren’t just trying, which is new in the NHL context. They’re overtrying. That’s how you create content.
Managing a hockey team isn’t like working for The Co-Operators. The goal isn’t modest, reliable returns. The objective should be victory or death.
On that note, the sworn miserabalists who support the Toronto Maple Leafs are currently enjoying a break in the clouds. The NHL’s favourite peek-a-boo team – ‘Here I am! Now I’m gone!’ – isn’t doing anything special on the ice. But there are signs of life off it.
In their current incarnation, the Leafs have been regular deadline tinkerers. Swap in a veteran for a pick. Take on someone else’s garbage contract in return for a depth defenceman.
Every year, the Leafs show up at training camp full of the conviction that this is the right mix.
“Everything they’re doing now is about winning,” general manager Kyle Dubas said of his team six months ago.
Apparently, whatever they’ve been doing about winning since (commuting to win? grocery shopping to win?) isn’t winning enough. The Leafs decided they needed some more people who do everything about winning, mostly guys who play on losers.
In the end, seven bodies in, including Ryan O’Reilly, and seven bodies out, largely prospects.
The headline is “All in.”
FROM B15 People keep saying that like it gives you a one-goal advantage before every playoff game.
A better headline would be “Almost Last Chance.”
You are watching a team coming to grips with the big idea that most of its other big ideas weren’t great.
The Leafs M.O. in the Brendan Shanahan era is moderation.
Having drawn a couple of winning numbers in the draft, the idea was to let the team coalesce at its own pace. The choice of GM – a numbers-based technocrat – suggested an organizational emphasis on prudence and incremental change.
That didn’t work.
Moderation isn’t the worst philosophy for a sports franchise, but it’s low reward. If it works, great.
You were bad, drafted and got good. Hurray for you.
If it doesn’t work, you become boring. Moderation is a Tuesday night in January.
No one talks about the Tuesday night that changed their life.
Nobody ever says, ‘You know, let’s meet up on a Tuesday.’ If you’re not going to win, you must at least give people the weekend.
Moderation got the Leafs into the jam they’re in now – a team that looks like it should win, but can’t. What are you going to do with a team like that, in a town like this? Nothing. You can’t do anything with these guys. They’re too good to be useless, and too useless to be good.
They’re just over there sucking up a bunch of money and talking, talking, talking about how it’ll be different this time. When it isn’t different, they apologize and say it’ll be different next time. The Leafs are the world’s worst and hardest-to-leave boyfriend. Not a bad guy, but no follow through.
Never does what he says he’ll do.
Doesn’t show up when it matters (in April).
Say this much for the Edmonton Oilers – another obsessedover, perpetually wrong-footed franchise that should be great but isn’t.
When the Oilers fail, they do it with panache. They don’t just collapse. They collapse with style.
The Leafs just sort of deflate.
Like a soufflé that can’t play defence.
Are the Leafs good now that they’ve got Luke Schenn back? I have no idea and neither do you.
You thought the Leafs were good last year, and the year before that, and you were wrong. Why do you trust yourself all of a sudden? If you think the Leafs are good, I’d call that fairly scientific evidence they are not.
All we can say for sure at this moment is that these Leafs have finally become immoderate. Seven years after drafting Auston Matthews, they’ve lost their ‘Everything’s going to turn out in the end’ smirk. Hence their manic need to acquire a million defencemen.
They used to talk about this team as an intergenerational juggernaut, moving seamlessly from a winning older group to a winning younger one and so on.
That’s out the window now. The Leafs will take one win, any way they can get it. The future can find its own ride home.
It’s desperate, and I like it.
Anyone from Toronto is easier to like with a whiff of desolation on them. What’d self-actualization ever get this city? A real-estate crisis. Who knew that if you kept telling people how you great you are, they’d start believing you? Like all iconic franchises, the Leafs are a portrait of the city they play in.
The Leafs still have a few advantages – a bar so low you couldn’t slip a beer coaster under it; a core that can’t be moved; a fan base that’ll buy anything as long as you don’t yell at or talk down to them; an ownership group that shows up at board meetings like a cartoon cat with dollar signs bulging from their eye sockets. The mulligans for this executive remain unlimited.
But eventually even the most under-control, trust-the-process types start to lose the plot. The Leafs just got there.
It probably won’t work because nothing’s worked before. This way, at least there’s some excitement before the disappointment.

Full text: Montreal artist Karen Tam has mounted an exhibition at the McCord Stewart Museum entitled Swallowing Mountains.
Drawing on the McCord’s archives as well as donations from the community, it features photographs and documents from the city’s historic Chinatown as well as Tam’s own creations inspired by traditional Chinese art forms such as shadow puppets and western Chinoiserie. The Globe and Mail spoke with Tam about the exhibit.
Tell me how your family came to Canada.
The first person to come was my greatgrandfather on my dad’s side in 1907. He came to find work: You could make more money in two months in Canada than you would in two to three years in China. He went back twice to China, first to get married, the second time for my grandfather’s birth, but after my grandfather was born, he never went back. He was based in Montreal and separated from the family from 1923 until my grandparents and my dad and his siblings came in 1967. The family was reunited then.
So, your great-grandmother, his wife, always remained in China. You describe the Chinese immigrant community in Montreal as a bachelor society. Why?
Because of the disproportionate number of men in the first waves of Chinese immigration; migrants came to work for the gold rush and then for the construction of the railway.
Once the railway was completed in 1885, the government imposed a head tax.
It went up to $500 by the early 1900s. It was exorbitant, only the wealthy could afford to bring their wives or their children.
And those are your great-grandfather’s real head tax documents in the show?
I believe it was a replacement for the original that he lost. But yes, he had paid the head tax.
How did you find it?
When I was in high school, it was a history class assignment to find something related to Canadian history. I just started asking my family and asking my grandfather. He produced it and eventually he let me have the document because I was the only grandchild who was interested in these things.
Where did you find the other people’s documents?
The other ones were lent to me. The other gentleman is the father-in-law of a friend of my mom. And the third certificate I find absolutely fascinating: It’s very rare because it’s a head tax for a woman. She came in August, 1923. So, the Chinese Exclusion Act that banned virtually all forms of Chinese immigration was passed July 1, 1923. She was probably one of the last Chinese immigrants that were allowed into the country.
It’s actually the certificate of the grandmother of a museum member who read about my project and got in touch.
And the portraits, those are your greatgrandparents? That’s the man who came to Canada?
Yes. They are ancestral portraits that were hung in the family home in China, in a village now on the outskirts of the city of Taishan.
It hung there until 2004 when my dad finally sold the restaurant and had his first vacation. (It was called Restaurant aux septs bonheurs, it was a typical chop suey kind of restaurant in the east end just behind the botanical gardens. He ran it from 1976 to 2004.) So, we went back to China with my mom to the village and we saw it and we thought we should bring this back home.
First there was this head tax and then a period of complete exclusion that coincided with the revolution in China. The later documents you found are the citizenship papers for the generation in the 1960s. Did it isolate the community in Montreal, the lack of new members?
Well, it’s definitely small, but I think that the community here was very much in contact with Chinatown communities across the country and in the States too.
When I talked to some of the lenders of the photographs and other materials, they all knew each other, they all grew up together.
Was it different from the Chinatown in Toronto or Vancouver?
There are very similar experiences, but the Chinatowns in Vancouver and Victoria are much older and more established. Everything that we’re experiencing now in Montreal, such as gentrification and real estate development, it’s a little behind what Toronto or Vancouver have experienced.
Another thing that’s unique is that it’s a minority within a minority, factoring in the French language.
In the photos that I borrowed, you’ll see the Saint-Jean-Baptiste celebrations in Chinatown. It’s one example of a kind of hybridization.
You straddle curation and making your own art. How did that come about?
It comes out of my own installation practice. The first exhibition I did, With wings like clouds hung from the sky, in 2017 at the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, I didn’t really see as curating. I looked at the Chinese immigrant artist named Lee Nam who worked in the 1930s in Victoria’s Chinatown. We only know about him through the journals of Emily Carr.
I wanted to talk about what is Canadian art history and Chinese art history and who gets to be included. There are ink-brush art communities that are really vibrant, but they have their own networks different from the contemporary western-based art ecosystem. I wanted to parallel some of the experiences of those ink brush painters now with Lee Nam. I started inviting local community artists to show their works next to Emily Carr paintings and Chinese masters. Kind of putting everyone on this equal standing. That’s where the curatorial aspects started creeping in.
At the McCord, you’ve placed some of your own work in alcoves around the gallery, as though they were mini storefronts. Tell me about the installation.
I love playing with architectural features of a given space; that gallery space has these four alcoves or niches. I was thinking about Chinese diaspora spaces, and thinking about how in the ‘70s and ‘80s the government expropriated acres of land from Chinatown to build the Montreal Convention Centre and the Complexe Guy-Favreau.
This is something that occurred in other Chinatowns too: The first Chinatown in Toronto was razed to construct Nathan Phillips Square. In Vancouver, parts of Chinatown were torn down for the Georgia Viaduct.
So, I was thinking that this exhibition, even though it’s temporary, could be one way of reclaiming that diaspora space.
Swallowing Mountains continues at the McCord-Stewart Museum in Montreal until Aug. 13.

As listings sag, Calgary house hunters struggle to find an elusive home: A lack of inventory means a sellers’ market could persist for the rest of the year

Full text: As house prices continue to drop across the country, Calgary remains an outlier.
In February, RBC characterized the Prairie city as “the tightest market in Western Canada.”
Driven by record population growth in Alberta, the number of listings in Calgary’s resale inventory has been falling for almost a year, RBC estimates.
Last month, the Calgary Real Estate Board recorded 1,852 new listings, the lowest level of new listings in that month since the late nineties, a trend that has been particularly strong in the detached segment.
“We’re seeing some of the inventory decline because people aren’t listing,” says Ann-Marie Lurie, chief economist at CREB, pointing at the significant supply discrepancies between both ends of the market.
“While we’re having growth in the upper end, it’s not enough to offset the pullbacks that are happening at the lower end of the market.”
In January, the median listed price for detached homes in Calgary reached $599,000, but finding a unit below this price-point is a growing challenge.
Since September, Agnieska and Maciej Gorczyca have been actively looking to buy their first home in Calgary.
With a budget of $500,000, the Gorczycas were nudged by the potential sale of the two-bedroom condo they’ve rented since 2020 in Mahogany, a suburban neighbourhood in the city’s southeast, and the newcomer couple embarked on what would become a Sisyphean quest.
“Our main struggle would be bidding wars on the houses,” Mr. Gorczyca says, noting that the past two houses they had wanted to bid on sold for $50,000 over the listed price.
“We ended up not putting in the offers because of the amount of people viewing the houses, plus our realtor told us how many offers they already had,” Ms. Gorczyca says.
“What we’ve learned so far is, if there’s many people [bidding], we know that we’re not going to get it.”
According to CREB data, in January roughly one in three active listings in the detached segment were priced between $400,000 and $599,000, yet more than 44 per cent of sales were concentrated in this price range.
As a result, eight out of 10 units listed in January sold – a rate roughly two times higher than prior to the pandemic.
One of the causes of this, Ms. Lurie explains, is that “the higher interest rate environment has pushed people towards more affordable product. So we’re seeing a shift towards more apartment style product, more row product, more semis and anything that’s more affordable than detached.”
But for the Gorczycas, a family of four, options are limited.
“We’re looking for something just over 1,000 square feet,” Mr. Gorczyca says, emphasizing the importance of having a yard for their two small children, three and four years old.
“We’re pretty outdoorsy, so we would love to be near the Fish Creek area or the Bow River.”
Realistic about what their budget can buy, the Gorczycas have focused their search on older builds located in Shawnessy, Woodbine and Queensland, neighbourhoods in Calgary’s south, where the benchmark price is $506,900, below the city’s median.
But competition is fierce for the small number of listings that suit both their needs and budget.
“We’ve missed out on two houses we couldn’t even view because they were just half a day on the market,” Mr. Gorczyca says.
“You pretty much have to be available every single day to be able to view a house, and you have to make a decision on the spot.”
By the second week of February, the number of active listings in the detached segment was roughly 1 per cent higher than a year prior, but the number of new listings shrank by half.
For this downward trend to shift, Ms. Lurie says, “demand has to pull back enough that inventory can rise.”
Calgary’s limited resale inventory not only affects first-time buyers like the Gorczycas, but also move-up buyers, who might withhold from listing their property until they find a suitable unit to purchase.
“While new home starts have improved, especially on the detached side, they’re not coming at that lower price point,” Ms. Lurie says, impacting the capacity of move-up buyers to list their properties.
According to Jared Chamberlain, a Calgary realtor and broker, buyers in the current market should be “prepared to fight,” as local residents compete against more affluent buyers from outside Alberta.
“We have two different types of buyers in Calgary right now,” Mr. Chamberlain says. “The people not from here have a lot more cash than people who are from here … because they’re able to pull out half a million dollars from their place out there.”
Moreover, out-of-province buyers are also more likely to put in unconditional offers, Mr. Chamberlain says.
However, this possibility is untenable for many first time buyers in Calgary who, like the Gorczycas, can’t bear the risk of forgoing pre-purchase inspections.
Although Calgary’s market is expected to shift toward balanced conditions in 2023, sales are likely to remain high, and a seller’s market could persist in some segments.
“What I’m seeing happen, is that conditions are still really tight for all the affordable product,” Ms. Lurie says. “You’re in a strong seller’s market for homes that are priced under $500,000.”
If these conditions persist, the Gorczycas are likely to find themselves in a conundrum.
“We don’t want to get caught into that whirlpool, that we have to buy now because rents are going up,” Ms. Gorczyca says. “But if we don’t buy now, it might even get worse, [costs] will keep going up and up for both house prices and rent.”

Full text: We spoke on Christmas Day and as always, Umberto was pleased to hear my voice. His last words were a promise they would be waiting for my return: “Silvana, noi siamo qua, ti aspettiamo.”
His use of the first-person plural, “we,” referred to him and his buddy Virio. Actually, Virio was my buddy, too. In fact, they both took me under their wings in Montepulciano, Italy, shortly after I arrived alone there a few years back. I was eager, no desperate, to become part of the ancient Etruscan community where we had bought a pied-a-terre.
Umberto, who was 77, and 80-year-old Virio, were the perfect age for me, a middle-aged North American woman arriving alone on the scene.
That’s because my husband, Graham, was on the other side of the Atlantic working to pay off our little real estate adventure. Finding myself on my own, I could hear the village rumour mill churning that a Signora d’una certa età had come looking to enjoy the juices of the local forbidden fruit. And while that was not true, the cold hard fact was that I was lonely and scared that I might fail Graham by not being able to create la dolce vita for us in this hilltop town nestled between the Val di Chiana and Val d’Orcia.
Virio was our neighbour living right below us and it’s through him that I met Umberto. Even though Umberto lived on the same street, it wasn’t until I started going to Virio’s shoe-repair shop that I actually got to know him. Virio was the town’s cobbler. His dimly lit shop along the main street was an important location. But you won’t find it on the tour guide or map because it’s not a visitor attraction. Rather, it’s a “mantuary” for the town’s retired gentlemen whose impatient wives have shooed them outdoors, with the instructions not to set foot back home until the church bell strikes noon, and guai, or look out, if they forget to pick up a loaf of pane for lunch.
Umberto wasn’t married. Never was. Virio was a bachelor, too. Even though I was the odd “man” out I started to take my seat on one of the faded, ripped-up leather chairs inside the shop. Neither had the heart to say they weren’t looking for testosterone-deprived members. But they sensed my need for companionship and guidance.
Umberto had been an accountant in Siena and took early retirement. In Montepulciano, he became the keeper of the keys to the ornately decorated church in Via di Voltaia. His routine was to unlock the wooden, 100-pound doors to the 17thcentury Chiesa del Gesù at the crack of dawn; then close them at sunset after the 6 p.m. daily mass. It was at that mass that our friendship really took seed. I recognized him from Virio’s shop and started to sit next to him in his regular pew. After mass, I helped him snuff out the candles and turn off the lights before making our way home. Walking slowly as the Tuscan sun was setting, I peppered him with questions about the town and why its people were called Poliziani. Why is there a black market in Italy? Why is the Italian government constantly in upheaval? In turn, he answered each one with patience and wit.
From him, I learned the history of the streets of Montepulciano. That, for example, Via della Stamperia got its name because that’s where the local news printing shop was located years ago. Often during those walks, I would yawn. In the good teacher’s eyes that yawn turned into an opportunity to introduce me to a new word, the Italian equivalent: sbadiglio. And because he cared so much, he then would have me conjugate the present indicative of this tongue-twister of a verb: sbadigliare.
Along the way, we met other Poliziani, and being seen with him, a man whom the town respected and admired for his humility, gave me credibility.
At my doorstep before bidding each other buona notte, we were already making plans for the next day: whether to go to the weekly Thursday market together; meet at Virio’s shop; or drive to Chianciano for un gelato: pistachio for me, and the classic stracciatella, ice cream with chocolate chunks for him.
Our relationship was quite simple: He asked nothing, he gave everything.
That’s why the news of his death hit me so hard. It came to us in Canada, in an e-mail.
The subject line actually read: Gianni da Montepulciano. I immediately recognized the name of our neighbour and jumped to the conclusion that it was Gianni’s aunt who had died. She had had dementia for several years and was slowly declining. Then I opened the e-mail. Then I read the bad news.
Graham and I arrived back in Montepulciano that year nearly a month after Umberto had died.
Our street was simply not the same. It would never be the same. The local Poliziani that I met either in church or on the street would stop me and offer condolences, saying, “siamo rimasti scioccati; siamo rimasti male.” It appears they, too, were as shocked and feeling as badly as me.
Then they offered me their condolences. Why?
Because they understand that it was thanks to Umberto that this Signora d’una certa età and her husband are now able to enjoy la dolce vita here in this Tuscan hilltop town.
Caro Umberto. Thank you for the words and verbs. Not surprisingly, it wasn’t much later that his friend Virio passed away, too, from a broken heart.

Province didn’t need to touch Greenbelt to meet housing goals, report says: Enough land already existed to hit goal of 1.5 million homes outside of protected areas

Full text: Ontario already had enough land designated to build two million new homes – more than its overall goal of 1.5 million over the next decade – before it decided to release parts of the protected Greenbelt and force municipalities to earmark even more farmland for housing, according to new research.
The numbers, based on public figures from local governments, are contained in a report by former Waterloo director of community planning Kevin Eby that was commissioned by a group of housing and environmental advocacy organizations, including Environmental Defence. The results echo previous conclusions from other experts, including those of the government’s own industry-led housing task force, which said the province did not face a shortage of land for new housing.
The report, released Monday, adds to the controversy around Premier Doug Ford’s decision to break previous promises and allow development in parts of the Greenbelt, the protected countryside that encircles the Greater Toronto Area, in the name of solving the housing crisis.
Most recently, the Opposition NDP has focused on allegations that real-estate developers or lobbyists may have attended a fundraiser held in advance of the wedding of Mr. Ford’s daughter and the fact that prominent building-industry figures, described by the Premier as personal friends, attended the wedding itself.
Allegations that some developers – and donors to Mr. Ford’s Progressive Conservative Party – knew in advance of the Greenbelt decision have prompted investigations by Ontario’s Auditor-General and its Integrity Commissioner. The Premier and his Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Steve Clark, have denied tipping off developers.
Mr. Eby’s report says that before the government’s recent policy changes, there was enough “designated greenfield area,” or farmland already planned for development across the Greater Golden Horseshoe region, to build 700,000 units.
And that number even assumes the government’s other changes to allow more sprawl-like lowdensity development. Most of the units are already in various stages of the approval process.
Plus, the report says, there is enough land earmarked for more than 1.3 million new units in existing “built-up areas” inside municipalities in the GGH, which arcs around Toronto from Niagara to Peterborough.
Mr. Eby and several other members of the government’s Greenbelt advisory council resigned in 2020 to protest the province’s changes to the powers of local conservation authorities.
The report was commissioned by a coalition calling itself the Alliance for a Liveable Ontario.
The report’s numbers raise questions about the government’s stated rationale for its decision to open up 3,000 hectares of the 800,000-hectare Greenbelt area, while adding back 3,800 hectares of land elsewhere. The government has said the move would lead to the creation of up to 50,000 new homes. It has also previously forced municipalities to designate more farmland on their outskirts for housing.
Chris Poulos, a spokesperson for Mr. Clark, dismissed Monday’s report as “not based on facts but rather a particular antihousing and anti-growth ideology.” He said the Greenbelt land that was opened up is in prime locations for housing.
NDP Leader Marit Stiles said the report shows the government did not need to open the Greenbelt to solve the housing crisis.
Her questions in the Legislature on Monday about the Greenbelt prompted a fiery response from PC Government House Leader Paul Calandra, who falsely accused the NDP of sending a photographer to the wedding of the Premier’s daughter to take a picture of the seating chart.
The photo in question, obtained by multiple media outlets and submitted by the NDP to the Integrity Commissioner, was on posted online by the couple’s own wedding photographer. Mr. Calandra also accused the NDP Leader of implying that ItalianCanadian developers are unable to build homes “ethically.”
“We are raising these issues because Ontarians are deeply concerned,” Ms. Stiles said. “And I think the government showed yet again how desperate they are to avoid those questions.”
Also on Monday, the NDP released an affidavit from Ms. Stiles, filed with the Integrity Commissioner, as part of a complaint calling on him to investigate the Premier’s actions at the pre-wedding and wedding events.
The document focuses on the handful of developers whose presence at the wedding has already been reported, such as Mario Cortellucci, a long-time Progressive Conservative backer whose companies have received special fast-track orders from the government, and Shakir Rehmatullah, president of Flato Developments, who benefited from a Greenbelt carveout.
But Ms. Stiles also alleges the land chosen for removal from the Greenbelt did not meet the government’s own stated conditions that the properties must be “on or near readily serviceable land” – meaning land that is close to existing sewer and water pipes and roads. The affidavit cites letters to the province from York Region’s chief planner and Durham Region’s chief administrative officer who said the Greenbelt lands opened up in their jurisdictions were not in the two regions’ servicing infrastructure plans.

Full text: A new incubator program aims to make the real estate development industry more reflective of the city’s diversity. Led by consulting firm Monumental and the University of Toronto Infrastructure Institute, the FutureBUILDS BIPOC Real Estate Development Incubator invites midcareer entrepreneurs for a fivemonth course that will provide training, connections and on-site learning.
“Real estate development has been an insider’s game,” says Zahra Ebrahim, a principal at Monumental. “Your network is what allows you to thrive in the industry. This program will provide participants with mentors and connections to the professionals they need to get a project built.”
The program builds on a report by Monumental for the think tank Future Skills Centre. It found that “representation of racialized folks in Canadian real estate development ... is low overall, especially in leadership.” BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and people of colour) real estate professionals “described the prevalent culture in the industry as a ‘white boys club.’ ” The five-month program, which is free, runs May to September; enrolment is open now.
The program will assist participants in planning their first project, which will likely be a building with two to four apartments, with a goal of starting construction within three years.
The intended scale is modest.
“We’d be surprised if someone wants to build a 40-storey tower,” says Kofi Hope, the other principal of Monumental.
“We expect that people may have a single-family home that they want to convert into three units.”
However, he adds: “That’s where a lot of established development families started out: doing things on the small scale and then working their way up.”
The program was inspired by research by Monumental into the careers of BIPOC people in the local real estate industry. Ms. Ebrahim explains that many of them had the necessary expertise to become developers and builders but lacked a social network and the access to banks and other lenders.
Several such professionals will speak at a public roundtable March 6 at Innis College at the University of Toronto.
The program has support from several financial institutions including Bank of Montreal and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.
One secondary goal, Mr. Hope says, is to address the housing crisis by “adding new developers, bringing new creativity and energy.”
Having more small-scale players, he argues, is a critical ingredient in creating more of the small-scale apartments that planners call “missing middle.”
(The City of Toronto has signalled that it will begin making it easier to get such projects approved and built.)
That would mean that the financial returns from development would flow to a wider group of people.
Earlier generations of real estate developers in the Toronto region – including many European immigrants – “got a chance to build generational wealth, not just for their families but for their whole communities,” Ms. Ebrahim says.
The program aspires to bring that same opportunity to BIPOC people, she adds, and to bring their resources to address the larger issue. “We do need new ideas. This is appropriate to the moment we’re in as a city,” she adds.
“Because we’re in a crisis. It can only help to have more people in the ring trying to wrestle this to the ground.”

A modern treehouse in Quebec’s wilderness: Architect Paul Kariouk created a cabin for weekend escapes that respects nature

Full text: ‘Magical,” that’s how architect and homeowner Paul Kariouk, describes his secluded treetop escape in the Quebec wilderness.
Mr. Kariouk’s home, which he has dubbed the “M.O.R.E cabin”, is cantilevered off a steep cliffside, 60 feet above the ground.
Designed as a weekend escape, the cabin is an hour outside of Ottawa in the rural municipality of La Pêche, Que.
Mr. Kariouk said when he went looking for the right spot to build his getaway home, he wanted a piece of land that would give him and his husband the quiet they crave after a busy work week in the city.
“I grew up in New York but my family spent a lot of time in the northeast [of Canada] in the Laurentian Mountains as a kid and so this kind of landscape is in my blood,” Mr. Kariouk said.
“I wanted to find a piece of land that really had character and then to do something that would preserve that or celebrate it.”
The cabin’s acronym, M.O.R.E, pays tribute to Mr. Kariouk and his partner’s four grandmothers: Marie-Rose, Olga, Rosemary and Elizabeth. All European immigrants, the four women were instrumental in creating a safe, loving home for their families where more was always done with less.
“When our grandparents arrived in the new world [Canada and the U.S.] they had nothing, they really had to start from scratch,” Mr. Kariouk says. “Despite the fact there were real economic difficulties, it didn’t ever register as a fundamental hardship.”
The narrow structure sits eye level with the treetops of the surrounding landscape. The innovative build allowed for minimal disturbance to the site by reducing the foundation size with a single concrete footing and the use of a steel mast to support the overhanging structure from the ground.
“I like living in an apartment so being above the ground for me is normal,” Mr. Kariouk says.
“I spend my life designing houses for clients that are on the ground, but I personally would never live on the ground.”
Mr. Kariouk first purchased the land in 2007 but was at a standstill for years to get the cabin’s structure approved by the local municipality. Only in the past few years was he able to start construction. He says in that time the initial design has evolved and changed dramatically.
The unique position of being both the principal architect and homeowner enabled Mr. Kariouk to take his time – and take risks.
Mr. Kariouk jokes the project was like a big 15-year-long experiment. “I was completely dedicated to using this project as a laboratory, as a learning curve,” he says. “The money I’ve put into this cabin, it’s like an investment in my education; it enables me to bring something more to the next projects.”
With an architecture firm deeply rooted in sustainability, each project Mr. Kariouk and his team take on strives to reduce the consumption of natural resources and preserve the environment. With this commitment to sustainable design in mind, the cabin was built primarily with three-ply cross-laminated timber panels, one of the most environmentally friendly building materials on the market.
The long, skinny build and 12foot high ceilings create an abundance of airflow that naturally cools the structure during hot summer months. The south-facing wall of windows maximizes both heat and natural light, while solar panels harness and conserve energy for the cabin.
Mr. Kariouk says he doesn’t think it would have been possible to have had a smaller environmental impact.
“For every component [of the planning] there was an opportunity to think how can I do this differently that will have less of an impact on the environment.”
When Mr. Kariouk – a lifelong fan of bats – learned the brown bat population in the area had dropped by 90 per cent, he commissioned a bat expert to help him create safe houses for the endangered species in the structure’s steel mast. The houses hold up to 300 bats – a testament to his commitment of preserving the fauna and flora of the surrounding landscape.
Mr. Kariouk says one of the most special parts about his woodland escape is being able to observe the abundance of nature around him.
“There’s a way you experience the organic world in a way which is just so unexpected. If we were down on the ground, sure it would be wonderful, but it wouldn’t be this kind of magic.
And that caught me by surprise.”

Full text: A crop of potential candidates to replace Toronto’s mayor are already assembling campaign teams and trying out messages to attract voters, as John Tory officially left his post at City Hall after admitting he had an affair with a subordinate.
In his final public act as mayor, Mr. Tory made a short statement to the media late Friday afternoon alongside Deputy Mayor Jennifer McKelvie, who will stand in as city leader until a by-election can be held.
Mr. Tory said he hoped he would be remembered for more than the circumstances of his departure, listed some of his accomplishments and left the podium without answering questions.
Less than 20 minutes later, his term as mayor officially ended.
The departure sets the stage for a new months-long political drama in advance of a voting day expected between mid-June and mid-July. Several familiar faces from the city council chamber are already mobilizing for potential bids.
Among them are: former deputy mayor Ana Bailao, who did not run for her seat on council last year; Beaches-East York Councillor Brad Bradford, a key ally of the departing mayor; and Josh Matlow, a midtown councillor and outspoken critic of Mr. Tory.
Progressive Conservative sources say former Toronto Police chief Mark Saunders, who unsuccessfully sought a provincial seat last year under Premier Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservative banner, is speaking to potential supporters as he considers a run.
The Globe and Mail is not naming the sources because they were not authorized to speak about the potential campaign. Mr. Saunders could not be reached for comment.
Ms. Bailao, a Liberal who was Mr. Tory’s point-person on affordable housing, said in a text message on Friday she was “seriously, seriously considering” a run for mayor.
However, she is already assembling her team. Her campaign includes Liberal strategist Tom Allison, once a senior aide to former premier Kathleen Wynne, as campaign manager, and Conservative strategist Nick Kouvalis, a pollster and political adviser to Mr. Ford who was the maverick architect of his brother Rob Ford’s mayoral victory in 2010. Both have also served Mr. Tory in the past.
“Tom and I worked together very closely to have John Tory elected in the first campaign, 2014, against a tough competition – Doug Ford on one side and Olivia Chow on the other side,” Mr. Kouvalis told The Globe. “So we’re working together again.”
A councillor for the central Toronto’s Davenport area, she worked closely with Mr. Tory, an ex-PC leader, but was also respected by council’s NDP wing. During her tenure, she championed the building of more affordable housing and the city’s move to allow laneway housing.
Her website lauds her as a “City Builder, Housing Leader and Social Innovator.” Just last month, she announced she had taken a job with real estate giant Dream Unlimited as its head of affordable housing and public affairs.
Mr. Bradford, a former city planner who won his council seat in 2018 over a higher-profile NDP rival with the help of Mr. Tory’s endorsement, told The Globe he had not yet made up his mind whether to run for mayor. However, prominent strategists are also already lining up behind his potential bid.
Ford campaign boss Kory Teneycke and communications and advertising executive Dennis Matthews say they are among those backing Mr. Bradford.
A source close to Mr. Bradford said a group of supporters looking to advise him includes Jeff Ballingall, the founder of conservative social media network Canada Proud and president of digital strategy firm Mobilize Media Group. The Globe is not identifying the source because they were not authorized to speak for the candidate.
Mr. Bradford said he has spoken with Mr. Ballingall but is also talking to a wide range of people, including many Liberals, about his potential bid.
“It’s a big group of people.
There’s neighbourhood people, business leaders,” he said.
Liberal strategist Brian Teefy confirmed he would be helping Mr. Bradford, as he has in past campaigns. (Mr. Bradford’s mother is Valerie Bradford, the Liberal MP for Kitchener South-Hespeler in Ontario.) Mr. Matlow said he was discussing the idea of a mayoral run with his family and that he had made “no final decision.” The long-time councillor in the city’s affluent midtown area, who is a Liberal, said it was dismaying that two of his potential rivals, Ms. Bailao and Mr. Bradford, had signed up with political advisers so strongly linked to Mr. Ford.
“We can’t allow for political opportunists who are going to be backed by special interests and Ford government operatives to take over City Hall,” he said in an interview on Friday.
Ivana Yelich, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ford, said the Premier will not be taking sides in the election.
However, Mr. Ford warned reporters this week that he believed a “lefty” in the mayor’s office would be a “disaster.”
While municipal politics in Ontario is officially non-partisan, in Toronto, it often breaks down roughly along traditional party lines. It remained unclear who could carry an unofficial New Democrat banner in the race.
Some in the NDP have been urging former councillor Mike Layton, son of the late NDP leader and city councillor Jack Layton, to run.
Reached on Friday, Mr. Layton was non-committal. Asked if he was considering a bid, he replied that it was “probably a little too early to say.”
Gil Penalosa, who placed a distant second behind Mr. Tory in last fall’s election, is running again, while Liberal MPP Mitzie Hunter, a former education minister, said in a statement she was “seriously considering” a run.

Full text: DONE DEAL 349 Lady Macdonald Cres., Canmore, Alta.
CANMORE Asking price: $1,290,870 (November, 2022) Selling price: $1.2-million (January, 2023) Taxes: $5,141 (2022) Days on the market: 50 Listing and buyer’s agents: Brad Hawker and Drew Betts, Royal LePage Solutions THE ACTION This three-bedroom house was customized around the natural slope of a 41- by 115foot lot, so it has a multilevel layout with four staircases inside.
That setup was a deal-breaker for some buyers, but acceptable for others. A returning expat, bowled over by the home’s wood and stone aesthetic and the proximity to Banff National Park made a $1.2-million offer the first week of January.
“It’s a striking home in the neighbourhood on a corner lot with great views, so a lot of people wanted to see it,” said agent Brad Hawker.
“There were other listings, but not with the same alpine appeal.”
WHAT THEY GOT This 28-year-old house incorporates a built-in garage and nearly 2,700 square feet of living space across five floors, including recreation areas on two separate lower levels.
The front door opens into a living room with a wood-burning fireplace and double-height ceilings. A short flight of stairs leads up to a dining room and casual entertaining space. In between them is a kitchen with an island, granite countertops and sliding doors to a deck and a yard.
The top level accommodates two bedrooms and a primary suite with a walk-in closet and largest of four bathrooms.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It has a couple great outdoor living areas with a fenced backyard and a big deck, big enough for a large dining area for eight to 10 people,” Mr. Hawker said. “At the front, there are two separate outdoor spaces that have sun throughout the day and amazing sunsets.” Local outdoor attractions are also within easy reach. “It’s very close to hiking and biking trails, as well as a hockey rink,” Mr. Hawker said.

Developer’s insolvency raises questions about health of Vancouver housing market: Coromandel Properties seeks protection from creditors to which it owes more than $700-million

Full text: THE LISTING The financial difficulties of a Vancouver real estate development company sitting on close to a billion dollars in property has raised questions about the health of the housing market in Canada’s third-largest city.
On Feb. 6, Coromandel Properties filed court papers seeking temporary protection from its creditors, to which it owes more than $700-million. Such filings often lead to the appointment of a receiver for the insolvent company whose assets may be restructured or sold off to satisfy its debts. Two principals associated with the company signed off on most of the debts – Zheng Yu Zhong and Junchao Mo – but the company’s profile was also raised through its employment of fiveterm Vancouver city councillor and former mayoral candidate Raymond Louie as an executive.
The company’s application is replete with examples of the company paying top dollar for sites between 2016 and 2022, borrowing millions to hold on to them, and being unable to redevelop them into more profitable uses.
The insolvency made local headlines but, at least inside the real estate development world, it did not come as a shock.
“The market has rumours, we were aware of concerns for a while that had been expressed by not us but other lenders. … It’s a pretty small community,” said John Nicola, CEO of Nicola Wealth, which bought Coromandel out of a joint venture on a Vancouver apartment site earlier this year. Mr. Nicola said Coromandel approached the Nicola Wealth Real Estate arm of the company seeking a “liquidity event” less than a year after the two companies partnered to build two towers of 22 and 14 storeys with 441 market rental apartments and 100 affordable housing units.
In its petition, Coromandel said municipal delays in approving new housing were to blame for its inability to get its projects off the ground. It’s a hot-button issue. The 2022 recent municipal election that turfed out several incumbents including the mayor was largely seen as a referendum kick-starting housing construction. That said, Vancouver is middle of the pack among large cities according to a recent study from the Canadian Home Builders’ Association, which found it had an average 15-month approval timeline.
Those in the industry say everything from labour and construction material shortages to changes in market demand likely also played a role. Coromandel also pointed to the other big shift in the market: interest rates.
“Due to the rise of interest rates since 2022, the petitioners have had difficulty servicing the secured debt on the projects,” the application said.
Coromandel appears to have borrowed more than $700-million to fund its plans for 16 projects in various states of progress.
Several lenders have already filed motions demanding repayment of funds, accounting for more than $218-million.
In one example, Coromandel says it purchased a site called Southview Garden in 2017 for $72million, and there are three loans registered on that property that total more than $80.5-million.
The land is a little under three hectares with 140 townhouses and apartments on it that earn about $224,000 in rent monthly.
This does not appear to be enough to satisfy the debt payments on loans, as three parties are named seeking repayment: Cenyard Pacific Development Inc.
is seeking $21.4-million, WB Partners Canada is seeking $8.2-million and Peakhill Capital Ltd. is seeking repayment of $50.8-million.
According to Harley Gold, managing director of Peakhill, it’s not actually their loan: “Peakhill Capital is neither a lender nor a creditor on the Southview Gardens building. We have been retained as a loan servicer, and in our capacity as a fiduciary are taking all steps necessary to insure that our mortgagee client is repaid,” he said in a statement, referring The Globe to loan originators Lanyard Capital and Desjardins.
Lanyard Capital is also seeking the return of another $16-million it loaned Coromandel for a site called Alberta 40, which was a land assembly of six properties purchased for $35-million in 2017.
The properties generate $15,377 a month in rent, but the interest on Lanyard’s loan is costing Coromandel $4,796 a day, which equates to about 10 times more in costs than the site earns. There’s at least one more Lanyard loan, on a project called AC Nanaimo, which was purchased in 2021 for $29.6million, with $18.8-million in mortgages, of which Lanyard accounts for $12.76-million it is demanding repayment on.
“Given this matter is before the courts, we have no comment at this time,” Brian Chelin, principal and director of Lanyard Capital, said in response to Globe inquiries.
Another challenge may have been the locations of Coromandel’s sites: “They seemed to have a strategy for land opportunities in Vancouver property; especially the West Side, which is perceived as a prestigious location,” said Jon Bennest, vice-president of product development at real estate analysts Zonda Urban.
Even so, Coromandel’s petition describes one of its most advanced projects – Kingsway Frame – which is in East Vancouver, and yet it was unable to sell enough preconstruction condominium units to secure construction financing. Finding the right price for this market is proving challenging: “The top end of the market is not performing as well as the middle or upper middle,” Mr. Bennest said.
Mr. Bennest and Mr. Nicola agree that one thing players in Vancouver’s development market need is deep pockets of patient capital.
“If you’re on a development treadmill and running 85 per cent loan to value, you need virtually nothing in terms of something that would go wrong to completely turn that apple cart over and basically you’re buried,” said Mr. Nicola, who described highly leveraged investing as no different than stock frenzies such as GameStop or pouring cash into crypto assets trying to make a market.
“It’s not a gamble worth taking, not for us anyway,” he said.
And despite Coromandel’s financial troubles, Mr. Nicola says the combination of demographic growth and the city’s long-term housing shortage still makes Vancouver an attractive place to invest hundreds of millions to build new multifamily housing (Nicola Wealth currently has about 1,500 apartments under way in four locations in Vancouver and Victoria).
“It’s a low-risk form of longterm real estate investing, along with industrial it’s much lower volatility than say office or retail,” Mr. Nicola said.

The buyers were temporarily out of town, but made a $3.55-million offer based on the property’s online tour and advice from their local agent and family.
“It’s a special building in a really coveted location, so there’s often a waiting list of people who are looking to get into that building,” said agent Christina Pinelli.
“Between last year and 2021, there were only three units sold in the building.”
WHAT THEY GOT In one of two ninestorey buildings constructed in the 1990s, this 3,010-square-foot unit has many extravagant details, such as direct elevator access, herringbone hardwood flooring and bow windows.
A dining room lies between the eat-in kitchen and living room. An adjacent family room has a gas fireplace and double doors to an octagonal terrace facing southwest.
The primary bedroom contains two walk-in closets and two ensuite bathrooms.
The unit includes a locker room and two parking spaces.
Water and heating costs are included in the monthly fees of $3,476.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “This would be considered a larger unit at about 3,000 square feet,” Ms. Pinelli said.
“This unit in particular has a beautiful west-facing view over Lawrence Park, and it’s the first time a unit with this view on a higher level has come on the market since 2006.”
On-site services and amenities, such as the pool, are also topnotch. “This building offers a level of luxury and comfort in the Bridle Path that is very appealing, with 24-hour concierge and really fantastic valet parking,” Ms. Pinelli said.

Full text: The John Tory drama is an opportunity wrapped in a tragedy.
The tragedy is obvious. Mr. Tory summoned reporters on Friday night to say he was resigning after having an affair with a former staffer, “a serious error in judgment on my part.” His career in politics is over, his sterling reputation stained. It’s difficult even to imagine what those close to him must be going through: his wife, his children, his grandchildren.
His fall came from a perch he had worked all his life to reach.
The scion of a prominent Canadian family, he got the politics bug early. After stints as a political staffer, election campaign organizer, business executive and admired community leader, he ran for mayor a first time in 2003, but lost to David Miller, then stumbled badly in a foray into provincial politics.
The Rob Ford scandal gave him a last shot. Running against Rob and then, when an ailing Rob stepped aside, Doug Ford, Mr. Tory finally prevailed, becoming Toronto’s 65th mayor in 2014. He seemed just what the doctor ordered. Smart, earnest, moderate and fanatically hardworking, he promised to return sanity to the city after the tumult of the Ford years.
Voters rewarded him with a second term and then, last fall, a third. Had he completed his fouryear mandate, he would have become the city’s longest-serving mayor, best remembered for steering it through the pandemic with a steady hand. Now it has all come crashing down.
The end came not because he stole from the public purse or failed to do his job but because he had an extramarital relationship with someone who had worked for him, a lapse that he will have all his days to rue. Once the affair was exposed, he announced right away that he would step down, said he was deeply sorry, asked the city integrity commissioner to review the matter, and admitted he had acted “in a way that did not meet the standards to which I hold myself as mayor and as a family man.”
All weekend the city has been poring over the news, wondering what on Earth he was thinking, and combing the internet to see who that woman might be. Let’s hope all the gawking stops soon.
Mr. Tory has paid a heavy price already.
He and his family deserve the privacy he pleaded for in his resignation statement, which was as dignified as such a thing can be. This was a sad episode for everyone involved.
But the opportunity is obvious, too. Toronto badly needs a fresh start.
After years of bounding growth, the metropolis finds itself quite suddenly in a fragile, anxious state. The ever-rising real estate market that buoyed its animal spirits is in a bad slump.
The city’s finances are sagging from the burden of fighting COVID-19. Its thriving downtown has yet to rebound from the big pandemic exodus. A series of random attacks is making residents fret about their personal safety. The plight of the homeless is painfully visible all around.
Mr. Tory stayed too long in the mayor’s chair. By rights, he should have called it quits at the end of his second term, as he had said he would. Instead, he ran again in October.
It was a disappointing election. Though an energetic urbanist, Gil Penalosa, made a brave run at the mayor, the outcome was never in doubt. Mr. Tory’s dominance muffled opposing voices and discouraged other contenders. Toronto has a wealth of them, not just in local or provincial politics but in business, the arts and other fields. The special election that must be held soon should be a wide-open, freewheeling, all-comers contest.
Anyone could take it. Mr. Penalosa has already thrown his hat into the ring.
The issues are important and urgent.
How does Toronto house the unhoused and become a city where young people can afford a place to live again? How does it get spooked commuters back onto public transit, plagued recently by violent incidents? How does it even pay its bills, while keeping taxes within reason? Should it move to reject the strong-mayor system, just imposed by Queen’s Park and embraced by Mr. Tory?
If Toronto is to tackle all the problems in front of it, it badly needs new leadership, new energy, new ideas. It’s a shame it happened this way, but here is its chance.

Royale blush: To celebrate Valentine’s Day, and any special day, the Kir Royale is the toast of the town again thanks to streaming hit Emily in Paris

Full text: Another classic sparkling wine cocktail is back in the spotlight thanks to a celebrity endorsement. This time it’s the Kir Royale, which features prominently in the current season of Netflix’s escapist drama, Emily in Paris.
The pleasing to the eye, pleasing to the palate combination of crème de cassis liqueur and dry sparkling wine is enjoyed by the title character, Emily Cooper, at an outdoor café that overlooks the ferris wheel at the Place de la Concorde. She’s just been let go from her marketing job, but a sip of pink-hued Kir Royale from her flute helps lighten the mood. Her colleague explains, it’s the “perfect drink to sip and do nothing as the ferris wheel turns.”
Whether in form of the Aperol Spritz, the Negroni Sbagliato or the Kir Royale, sparkling wine cocktails are mainstream.
Unlike the Mimosa, which is cast solely as a slightly boozy brunch treat, these are flavourful and sophisticated drinks that can be enjoyed from brunch to happy hour. To my taste, they are ideal aperitifs.
The Italian-rooted recipes for the Aperol Spritz and Negroni Sbagliato call upon Prosecco to contribute the effervescent and brightness. In the show, Emily discovers a Kir Royale is made from Champagne and blackcurrant liqueur, but I’ve never believed well-made Champagne needs extra flavouring.
Kir Royale’s legacy is credited to Canon Félix Kir, a French Catholic priest and mayor of Dijon who died in April, 1968.
His home in Burgundy leads me to believe he would have mixed his crème de cassis with a locally produced sparkling wine, crémant de Bourgogne, which is made in the same method as Champagne from chardonnay, pinot noir and other regionally grown grapes. The drink’s sibling, Kir, mixes blackcurrant liqueur with an inexpensive white wine made from Burgundy’s aligoté grape. Perhaps it’s the lack of the effervescence, but Kir’s still cocktail doesn’t enjoy the same name recognition in France. In my travels, I’ve discovered it’s easier to request a vin blanc cassis or blanc-cassis at a bistro than risk raised eyebrows by ordering a Kir. (A lesserknown riff, the Cardinal adds blackcurrant liqueur to a dry red wine. I’m in no rush to taste this.)
My introduction to the Kir Royale came at the Niagara winery I worked as a summer student in the late 1980s. Hillebrand Estates produced ready to drink versions of Kir Royale and Kir, the sparkling version was featured as part of the tasting for every tour group that visited during the summer of 1988. These were sweeter in nature than what most bartenders would mix, but that’s another charm of this easy-to-produce cocktail. You can finetune the drink’s sweetness.
The suggested mix ratio for the Kir Royale or Kir is 1/2 ounce of liqueur to 2.5 oz of wine, sparkling or still. Embracing a laissez-faire attitude, I serve my Kir Royale in a white wine glass, adding a small measure of liqueur – in the absence of crème de cassis, you could use raspberry or pomegranate liqueurs; local wineries often promote using icewine for a Canadian take on Kir Royale – that’s topped with sparkling wine usually inexpensive crémant or Cava. The bubbles mix the liqueur into the wine so. The wider bowl of the white wine glass makes it easier to appreciate the cocktail’s aroma and flavour, but you can follow Emily’s lead and sip from a flute while you picture yourself sitting near the Champs-Élysées taking in the sights while the ferris wheel revolves gracefully.

Full text: The latest episode of Run the Burbs – the family sitcom co-created by Kim’s Convenience alum Andrew Phung – paid tribute to actor, CBC host and comedian Candy Palmater, who died in December, 2021. She had a supporting role in the first season, playing a neighbour named Candy living in the suburban nook in a fictional town called Rockridge, occupied by young diverse families and a few encroaching gentrifiers.
In the commemorative episode that aired last Wednesday, called Phestival of Life, the Rockridge residents, led by Phung’s preening stay-at-home dad Andrew, negotiate how to best remember Candy (several characters share first names with the actors playing them). Their exchanges are alternately mournful, comic and joyous, which just happen to be sentiments that hang over Run the Burbs as a whole.
The sitcom, which premiered in January, 2022, to fill in CBC’s post-Schitt’s Creek and Kim’s comedy lineup alongside Son of a Critch and Sort Of, is all family high jinks with local flavours, riffing on the chaos of registering children in summer camp, the frustrations of navigating municipal red tape and the dynamics of getting along with your neighbours in a multicultural ‘hood.
But it’s also about 1980s kids celebrating and desperately clinging to their communities – which are either slipping away or changing at an accelerating rate – and the memories those places foster. Is it coincidence that Phestival of Life opens with the intrusion of a predatory real estate agent (Ann Pornel), who sees Candy’s death as an opportunity to bank on an out-of-control housing market?
Run the Burbs was shot during a pandemic in which urban dwellers made an exodus from the cities and suburban home prices jumped upward of 40 per cent. The show feels alert to the big and small changes wrought by migrational shifts and gentrification in general, and an anxiety about how the current real estate market is exacerbating those.
You see it in how the characters handle a change in the neighbourhood’s makeup. You see it in the way a central Bubble Tea shop (the equivalent to Friends’ Central Perk) adds café crème to their menu, or when Rakhee Morzaria’s character, Camille, has to temper her Indian catering business for white tastes. You see it when a show about minorities is broadcast on the CBC.
As Camille, Morzaria (who also writes on the series) is a hilarious force of nature. The character’s mixed Vietnamese-Indian family, including two precocious children and a husband played by Andrew Pham, live in a postwar bungalow in a community that screams Scarborough or Mississauga for anyone (like me) raised in the Greater Toronto Area. But it could just as easily be the Calgary suburbs, where star Phung grew up, if it weren’t for a few very choice details. Kardinal Offishall cameo, anyone?
The Northern Touch rapper from Scarborough turned Def Jam A&R appears in the series pilot as a Rockridge resident. Andrew coerces Kardi into performing at a neighbourhood block party, which the Pham fam affectionately calls the “blockbuster.”
I’m guessing that the moniker is a reference to the video chain only because the whole episode (and the series, really) is loaded with nods to late-nineties/earlyaughts cultural signifiers – the stuff regularly consumed by minority millennials and Gen-Xers who are now taking root in suburban bungalows with their young children.
In the pilot, Camille pays homage to Vin Diesel in a not-sofast-and-furious subplot involving Tim Hortons parking-lot types, and Kardinal closes things out with a performance of his 2001 Toronto anthem Bakardi Slang.
A lot of the conversation around Run the Burbs has been about its representation. If the show looks like a Toronto suburb, it’s because white people are the minority and the few who navigate this terrain are mostly hip to the culture. In the Season 2 premiere, when a white man makes a racist comment toward Camille, it feels like he strayed over from another show.
Phung and Season 2 showrunner Anthony Q. Farrell have discussed in interviews that they weren’t going to get hung up on making a diverse show that deals with racism but are instead keen to dig into the more intimate cultural details and anxieties that modern families deal with. The second episode in the new season is all about Camille’s regret over growing up disconnected from her Indian culture.
Our generation knows this anxiety too well. We grew up with a sense of self-hate, feeling pressed to bury our heritage to fit in. Now we’re enviously witnessing the culture embrace diversity with such shows as Netflix’s Never Have I Ever, along with the GTA narratives that Drake, The Weeknd, Domee Shi and Simu Liu are catapulting into the world.
Run the Burbs responds by retroactively taking pride and celebrating – to the tune of Bakardi Slang – the culture in the neighbourhoods we grew up in. The show is taking advantage of this new-found progress by hanging onto those vibes from our past.
Here is where its joyousness tends to feel mournful, though.
Just when we get a series celebrating the diverse ethnic makeup of suburbs like Scarborough – places that hardly ever got the spotlight in Canadian television before – those places are shifting to serve café crème and glutenfree Indian food.
That’s why the show feels like it could just as easily be called Protect the Burbs.
Run the Burbs airs on CBC Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m. ET.

Full text: TORONTO There are plenty of occupations that stretch back hundreds – if not thousands – of years, from tailors and farmers to butchers and architects, but only a few seem to latch onto historic locations to ply one’s trade.
Architects often gravitate to old brick piles with tons of character, but even more so are the craft brewers. To be a brewer, I think, requires a big helping of chutzpah, but softened by the addition of rose-coloured glasses … even metaphorical ones.
“If you go back 110 years ago, every small town and city had their own little brewery,” says brewer Jack Doak of Old Flame Brewing. “So for me the nostalgia of the brewing industry, the coupling [of] it with heritage buildings … I wanted to find unique locations or unique buildings to help tell the story.”
And it’s quite the story. One that starts about a decade ago in Port Perry, Ont., is peppered with a dislike for suburban industrial plazas as potential brewing sites, and ends, currently, in Toronto. Mr. Doak, a salt-and-pepper haired, almost-60-yearold with an intense gaze, is sitting at a high table at his new location in the Distillery District – so new a Google search fails to locate it at 43 Tankhouse Lane – with a glass of Helles lager at his elbow, so full of stories that he almost vibrates.
But, after a rundown of how food service will be handled in the 4,200-square-foot space via pop-ups with existing Distillery restaurants – “We don’t build kitchens; we’re not restaurants; we’re not bars; we’re breweries: beer is the star” – he begins, thankfully, at the beginning.
Born in Newmarket, Ont., Mr. Doak spent 35 years in the fitness industry, owning and operating clubs, and consulting on, and branding them, for others. Also a hockey player who once played at the NCAA (college) level, it was with his hockey buddies decades later that the sudsy light bulb switched on during postgame wings and beers at the local chain restaurant “down the road” from the rink.
“I would whine and complain that the beers weren’t very good,” he remembers.
“I’m not a big drinker, I can’t drink spirits [and] red wine gives me a headache. Being in school in upstate New York and Michigan, I got introduced to craft beer fairly early. So, as a whimsical thing, my buddy said, ‘if you don’t like the beers here, stop whining. Go make your own.’ ” By 2012, he’d written a business plan. After meeting with beer educator Roger Mittag, it was decided he’d brew traditional German-style lagers, which are more time consuming, rather than ales, since the market was already flooded (pardon the pun) with those. The pair came up with a blonde (Helles), a red (Vienna), a brunette (Munich Dunkel) and a raven (a black lager). And then, through Niagara College’s brewmaster program, Mr. Doak found Scott Pautler to perfect the recipes.
Of course, the really important puzzle piece was real estate. Which, he says, had to be downtown since “the whole charm of a craft brewery is foot traffic; we want to go where the dance is already happening.” After a failed attempt at leasing a 1950s fire hall in Newmarket, his wife suggested Port Perry, a charming Victorian town they’d often stop in on the way to the family cottage. And there, he happened upon an old LCBO (Liquor Control Board of Ontario) building that did not look heritage, but was strategically situated at the corner of Perry and Mary streets.
When he began peeling back the layers of 1970s stucco and drywall, the 1884 carriage factory building revealed itself: old red brick; curved lintels; quoins; and big openings for carriage doors. There had even been two fires during its history, which dovetailed nicely with the Old Flame moniker.
A six-pack of years later, the Newmarket fire hall hit the market again, so Mr. Doak jumped at the chance.
And even though the brewery was winning awards left and right, he knew he had to have a presence in the T-Dot. After visiting and enjoying the Distillery District’s famous winter market for more than a decade, the choice of location was obvious.
“The Distillery became a little bit of a muse for me,” he recalls. “I said to my wife, ‘Oh, wouldn’t it be cool, one day, [if] I could actually put an Old Flame here?’ By having a presence in Toronto, it just elevates our brand.”
But despite spreading over five hectares and including more than 40 heritage buildings, space is at a premium at the Distillery, and a brewery needs quite a bit. While he toured a few potential spaces, he admits he “lost momentum” because of other commitments. When he finally refocused, he was able to secure the old GW General antique store, which, ironically, isn’t in a heritage building but, rather, occupies the glassedin space between two heritage buildings, with a concrete ceiling that supports the new condominium tower over top. Which means, thankfully, that pockmarked brick walls, the district’s ubiquitous green-shuttered windows, and original signs that read things like “STOCK TANK NO. 36 4250 IMP.
GALS. 1,178,414 CU. INS.” fill the walls.
And Mr. Doak, a self-confessed antique “picker,” has filled the remainder with curios of his own, such as barber chairs, an old school gymnasium scoreboard, milk jugs, old bicycles, and vintage sofas. It’s a cozy space, and one he hopes Torontonians will warm to enough that they might even put down their cellphones while imbibing.
“In fact, my staff are trained that if they saw you and I sitting here having a beer but we’re both on our phones, they would come over and encourage us to chat,” he finishes with a laugh.
A chat that would surely include heritage architecture and how well it pairs with an aged lager.

Full text: The swing in the national housing market has been nothing short of spectacular, says economist Robert Hogue, but sales appear to be gradually stabilizing.
Recall the frenzy gripping Toronto and Vancouver real estate at this time last year.
In the opening months of 2022, exceptionally low interest rates, changing housing needs and elevated investor involvement supercharged demand, points out Mr. Hogue, assistant chief economist for Royal Bank of Canada.
Then came the Bank of Canada’s aggressive campaign to tame inflation with higher interest rates, which in turn triggered a massive correction, Mr. Hogue says.
The swing is bringing about some grisly comparisons: The Toronto Regional Real Estate Board reports that sales in the Greater Toronto Area tumbled 44.6 per cent in January compared with the same month last year.
The average price stood at $1,038,668 in the GTA in January, which marks a 16.4-per-cent decrease from $1,242,793 in January, 2022.
In late 2021 and early 2022, runaway prices were rising at more than 7 per cent per month, which pushed the average price in the GTA to a milestone $1,334,544 in February of last year.
New listings last month slipped 3.7 per cent from January of last year while active listings surged 124.6 per cent in the same period.
Looking at the numbers on a month-over-month basis, transactions are levelling off in the majority of local markets, Mr. Hogue notes.
Prices have been under intense downward pressure across Canada, and he expects they will depreciate further in the near term. Higher interest rates and stretched affordability will continue to be huge issues for buyers throughout 2023 – and possibly beyond, he cautions.
As for the recovery, it will be muted at first, Mr. Hogue predicts, but strong population growth will eventually heat things up.
Jimmy Molloy, real estate agent with Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd., recalls a pervasive “fear of missing out” during the pandemic run-up.
“At this time last year, all everyone talked about was, ‘I’ll never get in.’ ” Mr. Molloy says the high-octane run-up that started in 2020 was partly fuelled by the demand for home offices and increased outdoor space while people were staying home.
“There was such a COVID premium added to the market that wasn’t sustainable. You knew there would be some giving back,” Mr. Molloy says.
The recent monthly statistics are keeping many homeowners in place, he adds.
“I think a lot of sellers are thinking this is not the time to sell.”
Some are planning to list in the coming weeks but he does not see a great deal of inventory in the pipeline.
“The interesting thing is that no one is bailing,” Mr. Molloy says.
“There is no flood of people saying ‘I don’t want to own a house any more – interest rates are making it prohibitive.’ ” In many cases, the perennial problem in the Toronto market persists: People don’t want to sell the home they have because they don’t know where they will move to next.
Still, some deals are coming together quietly, says Mr. Molloy, who sold one property above the $10-million mark just before Christmas without listing it on the public realtor.ca site.
“It was all done by phone calls,” he says.
Munira Ravji, real estate agent with Royal LePage Signature Realty, says many of the potential sellers she is coming across at the moment are downsizers who have a sentimental attachment to their long-time home.
Unless they’ve bought their next property, they don’t feel any urgency, she adds.
“They’re really holding fast to their price,” she says. “There’s no desperation on their side.”
She met with the owners of one semi-detached house in the Trinity-Bellwoods neighbourhood in April and estimated that the house would sell for about $1.7million, based on recent sales of comparable homes.
But by the time the homeowners were ready to list in November, she recommended an asking price of $1.5-million based on the softness in the market.
“Showings were few and far between,” she says.
The house eventually had two buyers competing and still sold far below asking at $1.364-million.
She advised the seller, “if you wait another month, you might not even get this price,” she recalls.
Some homeowners have negotiated with buyers until the two sides have almost clinched a deal, only to have the seller back away, Ms. Ravji says.
Owners might be swayed if they see an uptick in showings, for example, and refuse to sign a deal at the 11th hour because they hope another buyer will step up, she says.
Just as sellers are often stubborn, many buyers too are refusing to budge, she says. Others are backing out of deals in the final stage of negotiations.
Some are submitting offers conditional on inspection, then using the results of the inspection to ask for an abatement in the price.
“They feel like they have the upper hand,” Ms. Ravji says.

Companies rethinking their real estate portfolios: Hybrid work trend at offices influencing structural changes and investments: insider

Full text: The great experiment in balancing working from home and returning to the office is still on the drawing board, according to new research about commercial property in Canada.
After nearly three years since the first lockdown, more offices are turning to a hybrid work model, with employees dividing their workweek between home and the office, according to a new report from Colliers Canada called The New Age of Hybrid Work.
But the research shows that building owners and operators, employers and office workers alike are still struggling with this idea, says the report, released in late January.
“It is clear we are in the age of hybrid work, yet companies continue to experiment, and their space needs continue to evolve,” it says.
“There’s no question that there are structural changes going on in the relationship between the amount of time people work at home compared with the office,” says John Duda, president of Canadian real estate management services at Colliers.
“There are basic issues that have still not been addressed.
They come down to two things – productivity and culture,” he says.
“More than half of the companies we surveyed said, ‘I don’t know what to do’ about whether we can let our people keep working at home. If a company is finding it difficult to compete, they’re going to look at pulling their workers back into the office,” he says.
Mr. Duda says there is conflicting research on whether workers are more productive at the office or their dining rooms.
For example, IBM sold off office property in 2009 because so many of its employees in 173 countries were working remotely. Then in 2017, it called back thousands into offices, only to send them back home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
By 2021, IBM chief executive Arvind Krishna told Yahoo Finance that he expected up to 80 per cent of the company’s employees to choose a hybrid schedule of two or three office days a week, with up to 20 per cent working from outside the building full time.
“Every business is different; there are metrics you can use as a discussion point, but they don’t tell the whole story,” Mr. Duda says.
Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey reported in April, 2021, that 90 per cent of workers said they get as much done working from home as they do in an office. Nearly one in 10 workers had a hybrid work arrangement, the agency said in its December, 2022, report, up six percentage points compared with the previous January.
In October, a survey by Montreal-based financial tech company Hardbacon found that 80 per cent of people who shifted to remote work during the past few years would rather quit than come to an office full time.
To entice people back to offices, many companies are offering gourmet food and coffee and games such as air hockey on site.
But it usually takes more, says Ted Mildon, senior director of office leasing for Oxford Properties Group in Vancouver.
“One way to encourage people to come in is to improve the amenities for the entire building, not just one company,” Mr. Mildon says. For example, in January, Oxford’s 35-storey MNP Tower in Vancouver held an evening exhibition called 100 Amigos with works by local artists.
It drew a packed crowd, Mr. Mildon says. Another of Oxford’s buildings in Vancouver is opening a 5,000-square-foot gym to cater to about 3,000 office workers.
“People who have been working out on machines in their basements for three years will like coming to a state-of-the-art facility,” he says.
Despite such enticements, the new Colliers survey says national office vacancies will continue to rise from the current rate of about 14 per cent until the end of 2024, when they will reach 15 per cent before starting to level off.
The rise is not all because of hybrid work – changes in the economy and new buildings opening that were planned years ago have an effect, too. But “if we isolate hybrid work to determine its impact on vacancy, we estimate that [vacancies] will increase a further 4.5 per cent by 2025,” the report states.
Many workers who do go back to offices, whether full-time or a few days a week, will find that their space has shrunk.
“The average square feet of space per employee has declined 10 per cent since the onset of the pandemic,” from 280 square feet to 250, the Colliers survey shows.
Nearly half (44 per cent) of companies will not be providing a dedicated workspace to all employees.
Flexible office space, which can be adjusted quickly for size and use, will make up 8 per cent of Canada’s total office market, Colliers reports.
This affects not only the way offices are configured but how companies acquire and maintain office space, says Wayne Berger, CEO, the Americas, at IWG, a global leader in flexible office real estate that offers a sustainable turnkey model to enable investors, landlords, entrepreneurs and brokers to capitalize on the continuing workplace transformation.
The uncertainty about how much hybrid work will dominate the white-collar future is leading many companies to unload their office portfolios and move to managed partnership agreements for as-needed flexible workspace with companies like IWG (which operates under brand names such as Regus in Canada), Mr. Berger says.
“Companies are rationalizing their corporate real estate portfolios, finding that the capital they have tied up owning buildings and leasing can be put to use in other areas, such as improving technology,” Mr. Berger says.
Another offshoot of the tentative move away from central offices is a rise in demand for flexible workspace in secondary and tertiary markets, he adds.
IWG is seeing greater demand for space on Vancouver Island, the Okanagan Valley, southwestern Ontario and the East Coast, he says.
While many workers say they prefer working at home, Mr. Duda says he expects many companies will insist on some office time. But it won’t happen by turning it into party time or by simply ordering people to show up, he says.
“The pitch to come to the office has to be evidence-based, not: ‘I just want you in here,’ ” he says. ”You have to explain the effect on the company if people don’t come in, and let workers make a choice.”

Russia planning offensive to mark anniversary of war, Kyiv warns: Ukraine’s Defence Minister says number of Russian troops amassing along border and in occupied territories is reaching 500,000 – far more than Moscow claims, Eric Reguly reports

Full text: Russia is mobilizing a huge contingent of troops and is planning an offensive to coincide with the first anniversary of the war on Feb.
24, Ukraine’s Defence Minister has warned, while a city in the country’s east has come under attack for the second day in a row.
Speaking Wednesday evening on the French news channel BFM TV during a visit to Paris, Oleksii Reznikov said the Ukrainian military believes the number of Russian troops amassing along the border and in occupied territories is approaching 500,000 – far more than the general mobilization of 300,000 that Russia revealed in September.
“We do not underestimate our enemy,” Mr. Reznikov said. “Officially, they announced 300,000, but we see the troops at the borders. According to our assessments, it is much more.”
He said the Russian offensive probably would come from Ukraine’s east, the scene of intensive fighting in recent weeks, and the south. “We think that, given that [Russia] lives in symbolism, they will try something around Feb.
24,” he said, adding, “we keep telling our partners that we have to be ready for this as quickly as possible, and that’s why we need weapons.”
On Wednesday, a Russian missile destroyed an apartment building in the city of Kramatorsk, in the northern region of Donetsk, killing three residents and injuring 20, local police said. The number of dead and wounded is expected to rise as rescuers sift through the rubble. On Thursday, Kramatorsk was hit again by missiles, damaging more than a dozen residential buildings and injuring at least five people.
Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, citing the Russian surge in the east, said the Russian offensive may have already begun. “I think that Russia really wants some kind of big revanche. I think it has started it,” he told the media after meeting with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.
His warning came as Russian President Vladimir Putin attended commemoration ceremonies for the Soviet victory over German forces at Stalingrad (now Volgograd) 80 years ago. It was one of the longest and most savage battles of the Second World War, and many historians consider it a turning point of the war in Europe, decisively contributing to the Allied victory over Germany.
Mr. Putin said Russia will be victorious in Ukraine, just as it was in Stalingrad. “Unfortunately we see that the ideology of Nazism in its modern form and manifestation again directly threatens the security of our country,” he said in a speech in Volgograd. “Again and again we have to repel the aggression of the collective West. It’s incredible but it’s a fact: We are again being threatened with German Leopard tanks with crosses on them.”
Mr. Reznikov was in France to secure the purchase of French airdefence radar systems and to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron, part of Ukraine’s campaign to acquire the most le-
thal NATO-standard weapons as the war grinds on. Mr. Macron has not ruled out sending Frenchbuilt fighter jets to Ukraine, nor has Poland, whose Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, told German newspaper Bild on Thursday that he is open to the idea of sending some of his country’s American-built F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine.
So far, the United States, Germany and Britain have ruled out sending fighter aircraft of their own.
But several NATO countries, including Germany, the U.S., the U.K., Poland and Canada have agreed to equip Ukraine with dozens of their most advanced main battle tanks, including Leopard 2s, a process that could take several months or longer, raising fears in Ukraine that they will arrive too late to stall the expected Russian offensive.
Mr. Zelensky used a Wednesday evening video address to say that the war in the eastern province of Donetsk was becoming bloodier by the day. “A definite increase has been noted in the offensive operations of the occupiers on the front in the east of our country,” he said. “The situation is becoming tougher.”
“The only way to stop Russian terrorism is to defeat it,” Mr. Zelensky said in a tweet after the attack on Kramatorsk. “By tanks.
Fighter jets. Long-range missiles.”
In January, at least 44 people died when a Russian missile hit an apartment building in the city of Dnipro, in central Ukraine.
NATO has not released a new estimate of the Russian troop buildup, but the military alliance’s Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, said this week in South Korea that Mr. Putin retains his “maximalist goals” in Ukraine.
“And most of all, we have seen no sign that President Putin has changed his overall goal of this invasion, that is to control a neighbour, to control Ukraine,” he said.
“So as long as this is the case, we need to be prepared for the long haul.”
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank in Washington, recently said Russia is getting ready for an “imminent offensive,” citing the information it gathered from Western, Ukrainian and Russian sources.
Mr. Zelensky is expected to make a plea for more Western weapons, including longer-range missiles capable of hitting deep inside Russian-occupied territory, such as Crimea, and tougher sanctions against Russia at the European Union-Ukraine summit in Kyiv on Friday. More than a dozen top EU officials, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat, began to arrive in the Ukrainian capital Thursday.
The summit is designed to show the EU’s solidarity with Ukraine but is not expected to make a breakthrough in fast-tracking Ukraine’s EU membership. The EU representatives will probably urge Kyiv to make the reforms required to allow it to qualify for membership at some point.
The EU’s energy support for Ukraine is expected to be on the agenda, as well as continued financial support. The bloc has agreed to provide 18-billion (about $26.1-billion) in support in 2023. Ukraine’s Finance Minister, Sergii Marchenko, has said his country has been running a US$5billion budget deficit since last March.
There may also be discussions on the Black Sea Grain Initiative, the shipping corridor that was approved earlier this year by the UN, Turkey, Ukraine and Russia. In recent weeks, the flow of grain-laden ships from Ukrainian ports has fallen to two or three a day – a four-month low – reducing exports to poor countries desperate for food supplies. Ukraine blames the intentionally slow work by Russian ship inspection teams for the severe delays.

Full text: DONE DEAL 7790 264 St., Langley, B.C.
LANGLEY Asking price: $5-million (Dec. 9, 2022) Previous asking price: $6.2 million (March 2, 2022) Selling price: $5-million (Jan. 6, 2023) Days on market: 282 Taxes: $13,563.52 (2022) Listing agents: Paul Hague, Christa Elizabeth Frosch, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada THE ACTION The estate, named Silver Ridge, had been operated as a successful movie set and shortterm rental, particularly for equestrians. The seller also lived in the house.
The property went on the market on March 2, 2022 at $6.2-million and although the seller received offers, they were too low.
The seller pulled it off the market and continued to receive inquiries, so it was relisted Dec. 9 at a firm $5-million. It quickly received three offers. The buyer is a young local family that fell in love with the house and its privacy, listing agent Paul Hague says.
“All sellers were challenged with releasing their properties because they still thought they were in a sellers’ market,” he says.
But the superhot pandemic market had changed by end of March last year, and prices continued to fall.
WHAT THEY GOT This 12-acre rural estate includes an 8,500-squarefoot house with a 1,500-squarefoot garage and extensive landscaping.
Designed by architect Tomizo Yamamoto for a sole occupant and his caregiver in 1993, the 26room home has only had one other owner prior to the recent sale.
There are seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms, nine fireplaces, wood features and stained-glass windows throughout the four levels.
Although it’s in pristine condition, it’s still stuck in the nineties and in need of a makeover, which the new owners plan to do, Mr. Hague said.
THE AGENT’S TAKE Mr. Hague says the market for high-priced homes is stronger than the remainder of the market. There is a shortage of decent estates to suit demand, and buyers in the niche market do not generally rely on mortgages.
“At that price point, they are pretty close to paying cash,” he says. “Nobody wants to play with these mortgage rates.”
The sale completes on Feb. 4.

Full text: Hazel McCallion was fond of telling people that she built her city’s core out of a hayfield.
The well-worn line summed up the two things most people knew about Mississauga’s long-time leader: that she had ruled the suburban metropolis for nearly all its history and that she was a masterful communicator with a natural gift for punchy sound-bites.
But behind that larger-thanlife persona, Ms. McCallion was at heart a pragmatic political tactician. She changed direction in major policy areas – particularly on suburban sprawl, the predominant preoccupation of her mayoralty – and had an uncanny knack for sensing which way the winds of popular opinion were blowing.
She spent most of her decadeslong rule allowing Mississauga to develop as a sea of low-density tract housing and massive arterial roads, before reversing course during her last two terms and promoting pedestrian-friendly development and improved public transit.
As Tom Urbaniak, author of a biography on Ms. McCallion, once told The Globe and Mail: “She knows how to get out in front of a parade before it’s even formed up.”
That prowess, combined with a favourable fiscal environment, allowed her to rule Mississauga for 36 years, often with little more than token opposition.
To city staff, she was “Madam Mayor,” a leader who seemed to fully embody the office she held.
To her supporters, she was “Hurricane Hazel,” a nod to her strength of personality and political invincibility. To critics, a more common epithet was “Queen of Sprawl,” the dominant characteristic of the city she led.
Her final years in office, meanwhile, were overshadowed by a failed land deal that stood to make her oldest son a millionaire.
A judicial inquiry admonished her for using her public office to push the private project, which put her in a conflict of interest.
Ms. McCallion died peacefully in her sleep at her home in Mississauga early Sunday morning.
She leaves her children, Peter, Paul and Linda, and granddaughter Erika. She was predeceased by her husband, Sam.
Born Hazel Mary Muriel Journeaux on Feb. 14, 1921, in Port-Daniel, a village on the south coast of Quebec’s Gaspé Peninsula, she was the youngest in an anglophone farm family of three girls and two boys. Her parents were Herbert Journeaux, the grandson of a Huguenot immigrant from Jersey, and Amanda Maud Journeaux (née Travers), of Scottish descent.
Ms. McCallion would later muse that her healthy, hardworking childhood might explain her longevity. It certainly taught her frugality, as she helped handle the farm’s expenses and balance the family’s books.
She left in her teens to attend high school in Quebec City and, later, secretarial college in Montreal. During the Second World War, she worked as office manager at engineering firm Canadian Kellogg in Toronto. At the same time, she joined the Anglican Young Peoples’ Association and rapidly rose through the ranks to become national president. As Mr. Urbaniak wrote in his book, she was an efficient organizer, running the association like a business and hectoring subordinates who did not meet her expectations.
It was through this organization that she met Sam McCallion.
The couple married in September, 1951. Later that year, they decamped midtown Toronto for Streetsville, a small town surrounded by farmland west of the city. There, they set up small businesses – a drycleaner and a printing company – and had three children. Ms. McCallion became active in local politics when she was appointed to a seat on the planning commission.
Elected deputy reeve in 1967, she became mayor of Streetsville two years later. When the town was amalgamated into Mississauga, she was elected to its first council.
At the time, the urban reform movement was in full swing in southern Ontario, demanding pedestrian-friendly planning and the preservation of historic streetscapes. Ms. McCallion identified with these sentiments and joined the reform wing of Mississauga’s council, which butted heads with politicians who took a more laissez-faire attitude toward developers.
After two terms, she ran successfully for mayor in 1978, knocking off incumbent Ron Searle.
When she ascended to power, however, Ms. McCallion jettisoned reformist politics and opened up vast tracts of land to be covered with subdivisions. Her reasons were manifold, but Mr. Urbaniak suggests that she realized two things: first, that battling developers was politically dangerous and second, that Mississauga residents were inherently opposed to the sort of dense, infill developments in established neighbourhoods that would have been necessary to build New Urbanist communities.
Luckily for Ms. McCallion, the city had masses of empty land to satisfy developers’ thirst to build subdivisions, while keeping growth out of already built areas.
It also produced an ideal fiscal situation: levies on developers filled municipal coffers, allowing the city to quickly pay down its debt and, eventually, institute a property tax freeze.
Mississauga took shape under Ms. McCallion as a city of suburban tract housing, slab high-rise apartment buildings and strip plazas, criss-crossed by expressways. Attempts to build a city centre, in that oft-referenced hayfield around the Square One shopping centre, followed a plan that could have been pulled from Le Corbusier, with wide arterial roads girdling institutional buildings and high-rise towers surrounded by parks.
But Ms. McCallion’s popularity only grew. In part, acquiescence toward developers ensured local politics would be a sleepy affair; in part, the city’s fiscal situation kept residents pleased. Her dominating personality helped, too.
At no time was this more evident than when, on Nov. 10, 1979, a Canadian Pacific freight train, pulling cars of chlorine and various flammable substances, derailed near Mavis Road and exploded. Ms. McCallion helped ensure evacuation centres were opened and took the lead role in briefing reporters on the situation, alternately praising first responders for their work and hectoring other levels of government for not enforcing tougher transportation safety standards.
This persona would become her trademark at public appearances, whether dealing with city councillors, journalists or members of the public: those who deferred to her would be lauded; detractors would be dismissed as illinformed or incompetent, often with the use of clever one-liners.
Over time, she also ensured that as much power as possible was consolidated in her hands, abolishing various public boards and refusing to allow individual city councillors to take on specific areas of influence – such as the budget – as they did in other cities.
The result was a dearth of opposition for most of her rule.
In 1982, she was convicted of breaking the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act for backing the release of land that she owned for development. Nonetheless, she defeated a comeback attempt by Ron Searle with 71 per cent of the vote. In 1988, Ms. McCallion helped push Larry Taylor, the only councillor who had openly opposed her attempts to speed up development, off council by sending a letter to his constituents days before the election accusing him of lying.
Ms. McCallion’s dominance would not be challenged until 2006. That year, outspoken former Liberal MP Carolyn Parrish was elected to council and set about taking the mayor to task.
Other councillors, previously reluctant to criticize the long-time leader, seemed to find their voices as well.
The most contentious issue was the land deal. Peter McCallion and his company, World Class Developments, wanted to build a convention centre and luxury hotel near city hall. Ms. McCallion was involved, pressuring the owners of the land to sell to her son’s company, witnessing important legal documents and intervening to sort out a dispute between his shareholders. When the deal fell through, the mayor tasked a close friend to negotiate a $4-million payout to WCD.
Ms. McCallion didn’t deny her involvement: she said she was merely helping to advance a project that would benefit the city.
Opposition councillors didn’t see it that way. Neither did a judicial inquiry that probed the matter and demanded an overhaul of ethics guidelines to ensure no politician would do the same.
Nonetheless, voters returned her for a 12th and final term in 2010, in the midst of the inquiry.
Aside from the scandal, Ms. McCallion’s final years in office were dominated by another about-face in policy. The mayor reverted to the reformism she had espoused early in her career, championing public transit, new bicycle lanes and denser development. The change was no doubt motivated in part by the desire for better planning that swept North America in the early 2000s. But it was also a response to Mississauga’s new reality: after decades of sprawling, the city had exhausted all its empty land and had to look inward to accommodate new growth.
The modernist towers-in-parks plan for the city centre was thrown out, replaced by an urbanist blueprint envisioning more street-front retail, walkable streets and the replacement of parking lots with offices and condominiums. The site of the former Lakeview Generating Station, along the city’s waterfront, is subject to a similarly urbanist redevelopment plan.
Ms. McCallion also secured provincial funding for a bus rapid transit line along Highway 403.
The first phase opened in 2014, the year she left office.
She spent much of her final two terms pushing forward a plan to build a north-south LRT across her city along Hurontario Street, connecting Port Credit to Square One to the adjoining city of Brampton in the north. In contrast to neighbouring Toronto, where city council’s dithering on transit – mayors and councillors repeatedly changed their minds on various projects – led to lengthy delays getting anything built, Ms. McCallion successfully maintained political consensus around the Hurtontario LRT. Under her, city council never wavered, and she persistently pushed Queen’s Park to pay for the project.
Even as the clock ticked down on her final term, Ms. McCallion threw her political weight around to get the LRT. She made a point of courting Premier Kathleen Wynne, sitting in her box at the 2013 Liberal leadership convention. She gave her political backing to provincial transit agency Metrolinx, and would frequently tell reporters how badly the province needed more transit. When then Progressive Conservative leader Tim Hudak pitched a plan to cancel all LRTs and put the money into expanding Toronto’s subway, Ms. McCallion wasted no time slamming him as “very confused,” and said he had failed to do his “homework” before crafting his transit plan.
This work paid off: in 2015, just a few months after Ms. McCallion left office, Ms. Wynne’s government announced it would build the Hurontario LRT and pay the full cost.
Ms. McCallion also played an active role in setting up her succession, encouraging Bonnie Crombie – a former federal Liberal MP with whom she was close – to run for an open city council seat in 2011. In the 2014 mayoral race, when the polls showed Ms. Crombie tied with former federal cabinet minister Steve Mahoney, Ms. McCallion publicly endorsed Ms. Crombie. Ms. Crombie won with 64 per cent of the vote.
After leaving office, Ms. McCallion did not slow down.
In early 2015, she became a special adviser to the principal of the University of Toronto Mississauga, tasked with helping develop a new master’s program in urban innovation and development, and to create a course on how to be a politician. Ms. McCallion also took a seat on the board of real estate developer Kaneff. In 2022, she received a three-year extension to her term on the board that oversees Pearson International Airport.
As chair of the Greenbelt Council, she backed Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s decision to open up formerly-protected land to new suburban development – a move that will allow for even more sprawl on the edges of the Greater Toronto Area, rather than compelling denser, more urbanist neighbourhoods. Ms. McCallion’s support, in early 2023, was both an about-face for the council, which had previously tried to safeguard the Greenbelt from development, and for Ms. McCallion personally, who had previously seemed to be moving away from her long-time support of lowdensity development.
Monarch-like and tough-asnails, Madam Mayor would always be seen by her supporters as a principled leader with a firm backbone, the incarnation of a city with few landmarks. But the truth was much more complicated: Far from developing Mississauga with an overriding vision, Ms. McCallion’s talent was for sensing the direction of shifting political winds and responding accordingly. From crusading reformist to fiscal hawk to urbanist, her mayoralty and Mississauga’s development changed significantly over time.
Her legacy is less that of a New Urbanist, but rather that of a masterful practitioner of a different doctrine made famous in the 1970s: realpolitik.

Full text: The Premier Hockey Federation brought its all-star event to Toronto for the first time this weekend, showcasing a women’s professional league that’s expanding its profile, its player pool and its salary cap.
Held at Mattamy Athletic Centre, Sunday’s event featured the top players selected from the seven teams in North America’s lone female pro hockey league – where some of its women are finally reaching the long-awaited goal of making their sole living on the ice.
They skated out in flashy new uniforms, competing in a new allstar format. It featured 45 all-stars split into three squads. A team of Canadian women wore fuchsia head to toe, the Americans sported blue, and a world team wore white – for an evening of quick four-on-four round-robin contests, followed by a championship match. The 2,600-seat arena appeared about half full.
The PHF all-stars maximized their exposure, immersing in Toronto’s hockey scene throughout the weekend. The women took in a Toronto Maple Leafs game from a suite and the NHL team recognized them on the video board.
They enjoyed an impromptu tour of the NHL’s situation room, a reception at the Hockey Hall of Fame. They held clinics with local girls’ hockey teams, and signed autographs at Mattamy, the former Maple Leaf Gardens, now home to Toronto Metropolitan University’s hockey teams.
While the PHF is the only women’s pro hockey league operating on this continent, it isn’t the only group of pro female hockey players trying to build something. The Professional Women’s Hockey Players’ Association – which includes current stars from the Canadian and U.S.
national teams – plays showcase events in its Secret Dream Gap Tour, which the players have done every year since the Canadian Women’s Hockey League collapsed in 2019, while working to build their own league. Details of the PWHPA’s vision and timeline for that league remain mostly under wraps.
The PHF has upped the ante in its quest to be the women’s pro hockey league of record in North America, aiming to attract the best players by recently announcing it will double the salary cap for a second straight year, now US$750,000 to US$1.5-million per team for the 2023-24 season. Like every time the PHF plays, Toronto was an opportunity to display its growth, and the financial commitment of its team ownership groups.
“I think it’s a very impatient group. So that serves us,” said PHF commissioner Reagan Carey, who was previously USA Hockey’s director of women’s hockey and general manager of the national team. Carey also worked for the NHL’s Atlanta Thrashers before they moved to Winnipeg to become the Jets.
In addition to the historical salary cap for women’s hockey, Carey says the PHF’s two-year partnership with ESPN, medical resources and benefits for players. She points to the women now working together organizationally for the PHF who used to be with rival U.S. and Canadian national teams – like former Team Canada coaches Melody Davidson and Lisa Haley, and retired American Olympians Kacey Bellamy and Brianna Decker. Carey says the PHF’s door remains open for the PWHPA to talk about working together.
“We have a total interest in making this as unified and supportive as we can,” Carey said.
“And right now the best way for us to do that is to continue building the best league.”
Last week in Montreal, the media asked NHL commissioner Gary Bettman about women’s hockey. He reiterated that NHL involvement in a women’s pro league won’t happen if the PHF and PWHPA are working in different directions. Bettman said he has “tried on more than one occasion” to bring the two together.
“We continue to have concerns,” Bettman said. “The two organizations competing as opposed to coming together is not ideal. And if it ever gets figured out, we’ll be more than supportive.”
This season, the minimum PHF salary on the 22-player rosters was US$13,500.
It’s up to players to disclose their salaries publicly if they choose, but most don’t. They range all the way up to the reported US$80,000 contract paid to Buffalo Beauts forward Mikyla Grant-Mentis, of Brampton, Ont.
More huge news came last week. Daryl Watts, an NCAA standout at the University of Wisconsin who had briefly retired from hockey, has at 23 years old put a potential career in commercial real estate on hold to sign a two-year deal with the Toronto Six that will pay her a PHF-record US$150,000 next season.
Sunday’s PHF’s all-star event featured 24 newcomers to the league.
Loren Gabel, of Kitchener, Ont., had the scoring touch for the Canadian PHF all-stars on Sunday, as the current league leader in points with nine goals and 10 assists in 11 games for the Boston Pride this year. The 25-year-old forward has international experience with Canada, including the world championship in 2019 and a recent Canada-USA rivalry series.
She is playing in her first PHF season after departing the PWHPA. Gabel said she’d been missing the daily team environment since she graduated from Clarkson University in 2019.
“We have ice every day, I go to the gym, and I just get to play hockey and not have to worry about anything else. I am 100 per cent able to be a hockey player, and it’s great,” Gabel said.
“Structure was the big thing. I was only on the ice twice a week in the PW. And then we didn’t play every weekend, we didn’t have a lot of games. I think in my three years playing there, I played about 14 games. I’m almost at that right now for this season. I needed the change.”
Sydney Brodt, a 24-year-old American all-star, plays for her home-state team, the Minnesota Whitecaps. She is also formerly of the PWHPA and is debuting as a rookie in the PHF.
She has U.S. national team experience.
“Even a couple years ago, I didn’t think I’d be able to make a living, in my time, playing women’s hockey. It’s a day and night change. I’m playing hockey full-time this year, and I will be in next year too hopefully,” Brodt said. “In the past, it really hasn’t been the reality like people are working full-time to make a living and wishing that they could be spending that time on hockey. And I think this year that’s starting to change, and I think next year it’ll be even more so.”
There were 25 all-stars who have senior national team experience, including all 15 on the World squad. The new allstar format stemmed from the PHF having more international players than ever this year – 20 who hail from outside of North America. The World team included players who have competed for Austria, Czechia, Finland, China, Hungary, and Sweden. Many were meeting each other for the first time this weekend.
Minttu Tuominen has been part of the Finnish women’s national team since 2008 and has three Olympic bronze medals to her name. This is her first season in the PHF, and she said she joined the Metropolitan Riveters because she got a call from their head coach Venla Hovi, a retired Finnish hockey star who also earned three Olympic medals. The Riveters have six players from outside North America this season.
“I didn’t want to take like a random chance, but knowing Venla from national-team experience [and] playing with her, knowing how she wants to develop people,” Tuominen said.
“I immediately kind of felt like this would be a great fit and it is.”

Harold Ballard doc pulls back curtain on a raw, uncomfortable reality

Full text: T here’s a clever scene early on in OffSide: The Harold Ballard Story, a new TV documentary about the notorious former owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs, which serves as a winking reminder to viewers that history is sometimes little more than third-hand stories of long-ago events recalled imperfectly through a haze of nostalgia and resentment.
Director Jason Priestley intercuts interviews with former general manager Gord Stellick and Leafs legend Rick Vaive, as they offer wildly differing accounts of a famous Beatles concert held at Maple Leaf Gardens in August, 1965. Legend has it that hundreds of fans fainted at the show because Ballard was such a canny businessman he’d intentionally made the place insufferably hot in order to sell more soft drinks.
“Folklore goes that Ballard turned off the air-conditioning – which didn’t exist,” Stellick begins, with a wry smile.
Vaive weighs in: “He delayed the concert by an hour and a half, turned the heat on in the building, and turned the water off.” Stellick: “Where’s there a water fountain in Maple Leaf Gardens? … I wouldn’t even know where one was!”
Vaive: “People had to go to the concessions to get something to drink, and it was probably 110-degrees [F] in the building.”
So, what was the truth? Well, a review of the concert published the following day in The Globe and Mail did note the show started 15 (not 90) minutes after its scheduled time, but there is no mention of issues with the temperature – or, even, of mass faintings. Nor, in the days that followed, were there any local press accounts of such troubles, though every other element of the concert and its aftermath were breathlessly chronicled.
And yet the story took hold over the years (including, alas, in the pages of this newspaper), feeding Ballard’s legend. “He loved that,” Stellick says. “That was his reputation, that he was such a promoter that he did all these things … his business-savviness.”
In truth, though, Ballard’s greatest achievement may have been promoting himself. Certainly, he ruined most other things he touched. His Leafs were laughable (if you were a fan you had to laugh or you’d cry); in the decade that he owned the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, attendance dropped 42 per cent, losses hit an estimated $20-million, and he wound up selling the club for $1; he fought with his three children, sometimes in court, and died in April, 1990, estranged from them.
Which is to say, he was a reality star in a prereality TV era.
The doc, which premiered on CBC-TV Sunday night (and is streaming on CBC Gem), comes at a time when we’ve never had more access to content that purports to pull back the curtain and show the reality of the sports industry, from pro teams’ upbeat dispatches filed by “reporters” on their payrolls, to the explosion of docuseries pumped out by streaming services (Drive to Survive, All or Nothing, Break Point, The Test, etc.), to athletes’ Instagram feeds oversharing the highs and the heartbreak of their daily lives: an all-you-can eat buffet of empty calories.
Offside is a reminder of what reality often actually looks like – raw, ribald, uncomfortable, unvarnished – when there are no teams of image consultants ensuring someone doesn’t stray offbrand.
To be sure, Ballard was an extreme and ugly example, operating in a far different time. He was intemperate, racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, paranoid and utterly lacking selfawareness.
Or, as Adrienne Clarkson says at the top of a 1980 profile by the CBC’s The Fifth Estate, “he’s been called a pirate, a bully, an oaf, a vulgar male chauvinist pig.” Later, she refers to Ballard’s “image of a money-grubbing hustler.”
During an interview in his office, she tells him he’s “a con artist.”
He replies with a smile: “That’s what they call me!”
The new doc borrows liberally from that profile (which is available on the CBC’s YouTube channel) but though Priestley outlines Ballard’s racism and sexism (and quotes Sportsnet reporter Donnovan Bennett saying: “If Harold Ballard existed in 2022, he would have been cancelled – like, very quickly”), even he seems wary of wading too deeply into the muck.
The Fifth Estate’s microphones picked up Ballard using the Nword, and there’s an extended back-and-forth with Clarkson in which Ballard defends himself using all manner of racial epithets, saying that “everybody does it.” Besides, he says, “You want to get offended at that? It’s stupid!”
Why would Ballard have sat for the interview with Clarkson – even going so far as to open up a senior executive meeting to CBC’s cameras? When I called Clarkson a few days ago to ask, she didn’t recall the specifics – to be fair, it was 43 years ago, and, as she points out, she’s done thousands of such interviews – but she did say this: “The Fifth Estate was a big deal, and if people were publicityprone – as Harold Ballard certainly was – I don’t think he would have cared whether you put his picture on the back of a garbage truck, he’d still want to talk.”
As it happens, The Fifth Estate did another sports-oriented story a couple of weeks ago, about the noisy arrival of sports gambling in Canada, and the access to key figures couldn’t have been more different.
After failing to get a response from the Toronto Maple Leafs’ Auston Matthews about his decision to become a brand ambassador for Bet99, the program tracked him down at a Leafs practice. Walking into the dressing room, Matthews glances behind him, sports reporter Bob McKeown and appears to scurry away.
Later, in a press scrum with other reporters, McKeown asks about the deal, and Matthews replies: “I appreciate the question, but after all that I don’t think I’m going to get into it much, honestly. So – you guys got any more hockey-related questions?” It’s an awkward moment. He looks uncomfortable, and who could blame him? Like most athletes and the corporations that employ them and the media outlets that depend on them, Matthews is used to offering performative transparency, playing his part in a simulacrum of reality.
Real reality breaks through so rarely nowadays, it’s a wonder we recognize it at all.

Full text: After leaving his home on the Kitigan Zibi reserve in Quebec, 17-year old Gino Odjick found it tough to comply with the dress code of his new team, the Junior A Hawkesbury Hawks, just across the border in Ontario. A local men’s clothing store provided the youth with a nice sweater and a spiffy pair of corduroy pants. Everything was fine until just before his fourth game with the club, when he rushed into coach Bob Hartley’s office, pants ripped, sweater torn, hands covered in blood, but with a big smile on his face.
Out in the parking lot, Mr. Hartley found Mr. Odjick’s father, Joe, waiting in the car, also with a huge grin. There, in the trunk, was a dead deer, spied alongside the road and shot by the elder Mr. Odjick on the way to the rink. His son had gone into the woods to lug the bloodied animal back to the car, encountering a barbed-wire fence along the way.
“I will never forget those two smiles, for a job well done,” Mr. Hartley recalled years later. “To kill a deer and try to win a hockey game on the same day. Not many people can say they did that.”
The tale stands as a vivid illustration of the twin tracks that carried Mr. Odjick on his improbable journey from a self-styled “kid from the rez” to the National Hockey League. Best known as a bruising hockey enforcer, who became one of the most adored players in the history of the Vancouver Canucks, Mr. Odjick was also a full-blooded Algonquin, deeply committed to Canada’s First Nations. In many ways, despite his years in the NHL, including one memorable trip to the Stanley Cup final, Mr. Odjick never left the reserve. It’s where he grew up, and Vancouver’s Musqueam Reserve is where he often stayed during his time in the NHL, when his salary could have commanded a pick of downtown penthouses.
For Mr. Odjick, who died Jan. 15 of a heart attack, his roots were fundamental. One of only a handful of Indigenous players in the league when he joined the Canucks in 1990, he insisted on wearing No. 29, the number his father was given when forced into a faraway residential school as a boy. At the start of a hockey season, the player would often smudge his uniform and equipment with wafts of sweetgrass smoke. When he decided to quit drinking to better serve as an example to Indigenous youth, he prepared for abstinence with a sweat lodge ceremony and long talks with a medicine man.
For many years, Mr. Ojdick was also a keen observer and participant in Indigenous politics, a regular at meetings of the Assembly of First Nations and other gatherings. In 1997, while still with the Canucks, he campaigned for Musqueam’s Wendy Grant-John in her bid for leadership of the AFN.
When the ground-breaking (albeit later cancelled) Kelowna Accord between Indigenous leaders, Ottawa and the provinces was signed in 2005, Mr. Odjick was there, too. During and after his hockey career, he visited reserves across the country, dedicating himself to eradicating poverty and inspiring Indigenous youth.
“Gino took his fame and used it for the benefit of his people. He said: ‘This is who I am, and I want you to understand there is more to us than stereotypes,’ ” Ms. Grant-John said.
Of course, Mr. Odjick was best known to the public for his years in the National Hockey League.
Not much was ordinary about his rambunctious career. During his dozen years in the NHL, he reached double digits in goals only once, but he dropped the gloves more than 150 times, often in riproaring brawls, in the days when most NHL teams employed socalled enforcers to protect their top goal scorers. He remains far and away the Canucks’ leader in penalty minutes, sitting in the sin bin for close to 35 hours during his eight years with the team.
At the same time, Mr. Odjick worked tirelessly to improve his hockey skills, was an occasional member of the team’s power play, and formed an unlikely, tight friendship with Russian Hall of Fame superstar Pavel Bure, whom he safeguarded on the ice while both were with Vancouver. They bonded as outsiders, with Mr. Bure’s initially halting English and Mr. Odjick’s Indigenous status, becoming known as “the Odd Couple.” Mr. Odjick named one of his sons after the Russian Rocket.
He evoked rare emotion from normally gruff coaches, who fell hard for his hockey heart, work ethic and dedication to the team.
“He’s one of those players – I could easily say that I came to love him, you know,” said Pat Quinn, head coach for most of Mr. Odjick’s years with the Canucks, in an interview several months before Mr. Quinn died.
“Gino was my first pro,” remembered Bob Hartley, who was still working full-time at a factory when he began coaching in Hawkesbury. “We had a special bond right from the start. He was kind of like my son,” said Mr. Hartley, an NHL coach for 14 years.
Nor was there anything quite like the adulation showered on Mr. Odjick by the fans in Vancouver. Different from the huge cheers that greeted goals by Mr. Bure or saves by goaltender Kirk McLean, fans would salute the hard-nosed forward with chants of “Gino! Gino! Gino!” whenever Mr. Odjick was in a fight or made a notable play. They were always loudest in the seats high up in the arena, a tribute to his grinding effort and selfless play.
In 2014, when Mr. Odjick was diagnosed with a rare heart condition and given no more than a month or two to live, hundreds of fans gathered outside the hospital chanting his name. An experimental treatment subsequently provided another eight years of life, but his heart never fully recovered.
Though renowned for his fighting ability, Mr. Odjick was also a good skater with a hard shot, able to hold down a spot on his team’s third or fourth line. The year he spent time on the Canucks’ power play, he scored a career-high 16 goals. And there may never have been a louder roar at a hockey game than the night Mr. Odjick scored on a penalty shot against all-star goalie Mike Vernon. “I looked right, shot left,” he shrugged afterwards. Pat Quinn delayed sending out a new line so the raucous celebration could continue. “The roof just about came off the place,” Mr. Quinn said, likening the eruption to that greeting a Stanley Cup overtime goal.
Mr. Odjick ended his career in 2002 with the Montreal Canadiens, after receiving one bang on the head too many during a preseason workout. The ensuing concussion presaged a number of troubles that befell Mr. Odjick after he hung up his skates. As with many enforcers, the constant pounding in bare-knuckled fights exacted a price. He suffered from serious migraines, depression and other issues that landed him in hospital several times.
At a symposium on concussions in early 2014, Mr. Odjick talked candidly about the damage done. Toward the end of his playing years, he sometimes had trouble finding the rink. He became addicted to being hit, he confessed. “It made me feel alive, that I was involved, sticking up for my teammates.”
Wayne Gino Odjick was born Sept. 7, 1970, in the town of Maniwaki, close to his reserve, 135 kilometres north of Ottawa. He was the only son, amid five daughters, of Giselle and Joe Odjick, a highrise welder and labourer with a passion for hockey. The elder Mr. Odjick, scarred by his years in a distant residential school, couldn’t bear to see another lonely Indigenous youngster, so their house was always full of kids from other reserves attending school in Maniwaki. Bunk beds were everywhere, with girls upstairs and boys downstairs.
When young Gino wanted to play hockey, his father thought he was such a poor skater that he put him in figure skating for a year.
As a teenager, Gino rarely gave the NHL a thought, content to play for his reserve team on the local outdoor rink. When the Hawkesbury Hawks, impressed by his toughness during a town tournament, came calling, Mr. Odjick was out moose hunting. At one point during his rocky first season, he learned he was in danger of being cut. Mr. Odjick showed up at the rink the next day at 7 a.m. for extra practice.
Meanwhile, he was taking a welding course in Ottawa, often hitchhiking 100 kilometres to and from Hawkesbury in below-zero weather for practices. “If that’s not commitment, I don’t know what is,” said Mr. Hartley, who saw something in the raw, determined youth that could be honed and developed. He persuaded the Laval Titans of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League to give him a tryout. The next year, Mr. Odjick was playing for Laval in the Memorial Cup.
Less than a year after that, he completed his remarkable run by suiting up for his first NHL game with the Canucks at the age of 20.
Early on, he decked Chicago Blackhawks tough guy Stu (the Grim Reaper) Grimson. Then he fought the rugged Dave Manson.
His place on the team was secure.
Yet, Mr. Odjick sometimes had a hard go of it. For the first year or two, he experienced racial taunts, some from his own teammates, initially slow to accept him into their ranks. But he persevered, eventually becoming as beloved by his teammates as by the fans.
Away from the rink, Mr. Odjick demonstrated business acumen by purchasing the Musqueam Golf Course and helping Canucks owner and megadeveloper Francesco Aquilini broker real estate deals with local Indigenous groups. Mr. Odjick, who never married, fathered eight children with five women.
In an open letter to fans during his health crisis in 2014, Mr. Odjick mentioned his fervent hope that his career had helped open doors for other Indigenous kids. “I was just a little old Indian boy from the rez. If I could do it, so could they.”
Current Canucks defenceman Ethan Bear, a Cree from Saskatchewan, is one of those inspired by Mr. Odjick and other Indigenous players. Not long after Mr. Odjick’s death, Mr. Bear scored a goal against the Carolina Hurricanes.
“I scored right after he passed,” an emotional Mr. Bear said after the game. “I think that’s pretty powerful. It was meant to be. Maybe he was there for me on that shot.”
Mr. Odjick leaves his sisters, Judy, Shelly, Debbie, Janique and Dina; and children, Ashley, Patrick, Russell, Joey, Bure, China, Toby and Rose.

Full text: Smaller communities have taken bigger housing market hits from rising interest rates than bigger cities, but have still had greater increases overall in property values since the start of the pandemic when compared to Toronto and Vancouver.
The most desirable small communities, such as those within a couple hours of Toronto, uniformly saw skyrocketing prices over the pandemic as people left big cities for remote work. But similar to how those markets had larger value increases during the pandemic, they’re also seeing larger decreases as the Bank of Canada increases interest rates.
The recent drops have been significant in Ontario municipalities such as St. Catharines and London, where the average selling price in December, 2022, was down between 14 and 15 per cent from 12 months prior, according to data provided by real estate marketplace Zolo Realty. The drop was even more steep in Belleville, which was down 25 per cent in December.
Those numbers are large when compared to a year-over-year drop of just 9 per cent in Toronto.
However, Kevin Ali, vice-president of operations with Zolo Realty in Toronto, said average selling prices are still up between 30 and 40 per cent in many small communities today when compared to December, 2019, before the pandemic. That’s compared to a 25-per-cent increase in Toronto from December, 2019, to December, 2022.
The situation was similar in British Columbia, where regions such as the Okanagan and Kootenay had price drops of roughly 17 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively, from their January, 2022, peak to their current level in December, 2022. The Metro Vancouver area only dropped 11 per cent during the same time.
However, the overall increase in pricing remained higher in smaller B.C. communities when compared to Vancouver.
Realtors in these smaller communities say lower inventory numbers, a sense of confidence over the long-term viability of their markets and a lack of urgency to sell because of more affordable mortgage payments are creating an environment in which sellers are unwilling to budge much from their listing prices.
Jeff Nelles, broker and manager of Royal LePage ProAlliance Realty in Belleville, Ont., said people in his community may not be as financially pressed by high interest rates because anyone who bought in the early stages of the pandemic or earlier didn’t likely stretch themselves to own a home as much as someone in Toronto did.
“People are able to hang on and pull through it,” said Mr. Nelles, adding that even though there is worry of a recession, mass layoffs haven’t materialized and so homeowners aren’t heavily under pressure.
“We’re not seeing a ton who are going to get underwater in this, especially anyone who bought prior to 2020.”
Revelstoke, B.C., a small ski community in the province’s Interior, is one place that had explosive growth in the past three years. BC Assessments, a Crown corporation, put the average value of a Revelstoke home at $801,000 in June, 2022, a 57-per-cent increase from $509,000 in June, 2019.
Despite recent softening in the market, Century 21 Executives realtor John Sparrow said some properties will stay on the market for more than 100 days before eventually selling for close to their listing price.
“People say they have the utmost confidence in Revelstoke that, even if it’s fallen off the high point, it’s going to come back, so let’s hang on to it,” said Mr. Sparrow, who noted the lack of supply in town is a large factor.
Sellers not budging on their pricing may put buyers in a tricky situation as they deal with high prices and high interest rates at the same time, but Mr. Sparrow said buyers are in a better situation than two years ago because there is at least time to negotiate and make conditional offers. He added there sometimes are deals to be found from motivated sellers.
It’s a far cry from the frenzy in Revelstoke during the height of the pandemic, where properties were sometimes being snapped up sight-unseen and prices rose dramatically.
Other desirable markets such as Penticton in the Okanagan region of B.C. have also faced little downward pressure on prices. Realtor Shannon Simpson said overall they have only seen a 2-per-cent decrease year-over-year in December, a tiny drop when compared with Metro Vancouver, where prices fell from their January, 2022, peak by 11 per cent by December, 2022.
Local realtors painted an optimistic picture for 2023 in their small communities, with Mr. Nelles in Belleville saying there is pent-up demand as people have waited on the sidelines to see what will happen next with interest rates.
At the first sign of decreasing rates, he expects buyers to pile back in to try and take advantage of any lingering low prices. Sellers are still receiving multiple offers when a house hits the market at a particularly competitive list price since inventory is so low and incoming people from Toronto have so much buying power.
“There’s a lot of people sitting on the sidelines and pentup demand is going to be there,” Mr. Nelles said.

Thinking of buying undeveloped land? Take these precautions first

Full text: There’s a scene that plays out all too often at Gerald Christie’s regional district office: Someone will walk in with high hopes to build their dream home on an undeveloped piece of property they just bought, only to find out the massive financial hurdles they didn’t realize they’ll face.
Mr. Christie, manager of development services for the Columbia Shuswap Regional District (CSRD) in Salmon Arm, B.C., said those owners could have saved themselves a lot of grief if they’d done their due diligence. Interest in undeveloped land and the money spent building homes have skyrocketed in that part of the province’s Interior. The CSRD issued 1,187 building and planning permits between 2016 and 2019. That number nearly doubled to 2,177 permits for the period from January, 2020, to November, 2022.
In larger regions such as the Greater Toronto Area, undeveloped land remains a fascination for people looking to build the home of their dreams, while others look to demolish downtown homes in order to build a more modern residence. But Mr. Christie says that kind of build can bring either great joy or great pain, and the difference lies in how prepared you are. There are so many factors to consider: Is the soil stable? Will it be possible to set up services such as electricity? Do your dreams clash with the reality of local bylaws?
The Globe and Mail spoke with real estate and development experts to compile a list of considerations before taking the plunge and buying land that could one day support your own home.
TALK TO YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ABOUT YOUR PLANS Before you think about financing, contractors or countertops, Mr. Christie says it’s imperative to make contact with your local government to better understand what you can and cannot do with the land you’re thinking to purchase.
Some of the vital information they’ll provide is how much of your land you’re actually allowed to build on and limitations to what your structure can look like – how close to the water’s edge you can build, if there’s water connected to your property, for example.
Moreover, Mr. Christie said local governments will be able to give you preliminary information about whether the land you’re buying might require expensive work to stabilize it. He says many people from large cities buy plots in his region sight unseen because they think they’re getting a great deal, but then realize it’ll cost tens of thousands of dollars to clear away unstable topsoil that can’t be built upon.
“They think it’s so cheap, but then they get there and realize that all the money you saved will be eaten up by engineering costs,” he said.
“We deal with a lot of folks that don’t go into these kind of situations with their eyes wide open.”
BUDGET FOR A HEALTHY OVERRUN IN COSTS AND TIME Tim Syrianos, owner of Re/Max Ultimate Realty in Toronto, says you should add at least 15 per cent to 20 per cent to your budget to account for cost overruns in the process of building a home.
Typically, there’ll also be a 15-percent to 20-per-cent overrun in the amount of time it takes to build a home.
Building a home is a complicated process with lots of moving parts. Any unforeseen challenges such as delays in lining up contractors, rising costs of materials and issues with the land itself can quickly add up.
One way Mr. Syrianos says people can mitigate cost overruns related to materials is to purchase as many items ahead of time as possible, such as drywall. Not only does that protect you from rising prices in the future, but it also prevents delays while waiting for goods to ship in.
Mr. Christie said he’s seen people wait more than six months just to have a garage door arrive.
Supply chain issues notably remain pervasive and can create an expensive logjam in the building of your home.
PREPARE FOR A LENGTHY MORTGAGE PROCESS The financing process for a home-building project can make a basic home purchase seem like child’s play. Mr. Syrianos says the first hurdle is that appraisers are usually much more conservative when evaluating land compared with a home. That means you’ll likely be required to have more cash to put toward the property to make up for any discrepancy.
Wayne Germaine, owner of Valhalla Path Realty in Nelson, B.C., said brokers may also look more closely at your financial standing because of the risk involved in a home-building project. He added that you’ll need to get a firm quote on costs and a detailed plan from a qualified builder. The bank will study them before approving you for the value of both the land and projected building cost.
Even then, the money will not all be released at once. Mr. Germaine says portions of the money are released as your house progresses through stages of its build. Some of the major stages include when the foundation is laid and when the framing is completed. Banks will generally require an appraiser to confirm each of these stages, which Mr. Germaine said can cost roughly $800 a visit in his region.
Of course, if you have more cash in hand, you’ll have more options. A purchaser could buy the plot of land outright and may have more freedom when it comes to the process of building.
Cash is particularly valuable when building a home because construction loans can carry higher interest rates.
EXPECT COSTS RELATED TO LAND ENGINEERING, PERMITTING, SETTING UP HYDRO It’s likely you’ll be buying land that doesn’t already have services connected, especially in more rural areas. The cost of servicing your home should not be overlooked, and could be much more expensive in remote locations.
For example, some properties in Mr. Germaine’s B.C. region can’t be connected to a sewer system, so owners will have to budget anywhere from $20,000 to $85,000 to have a septic tank installed. He said a rough estimate for setting up most services such as electricity and gas for a singlefamily home would cost around $40,000. There could be engineering expenses such as bulldozing loose topsoil to get to more stable ground, or diverting groundwater – which will also extend into the five-figures.
Then there are the permits. Regional governments such as the CSRD in B.C. often charge less for them: Marty Herbert, team leader for building and bylaw services, said a single-family home with a construction value of $400,000 could expect to pay roughly $2,400 in permits, although that number would likely be much higher in municipalities.
There are more regulations in municipalities, and everything from moving a pile of dirt to chopping down trees could require permits, depending on your local government.
BE AWARE OF THE LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES In the Toronto area, Mr. Syrianos says the average person building their own home is definitely not a first-time buyer. They’re generally in their 40s or 50s, and have stable finances that allow them to deal with the uncertainty that comes with such an involved project.
Building a dream home is not for the faint of heart, especially in today’s market where the supply chain has made materials difficult to access and the flow of people into more rural areas has created a shortage of contractors.
“Gone are the days where you call up a contractor and they’re on site in six weeks,” Mr. Herbert said, adding that many contractors are telling him they’re already booked up for all of 2023.
It used to be possible for a project to be completed in one building season, he says. These days he’ll see some projects go for two years, so it’s imperative that you can financially sustain that long of a project.
The payoff, however, can be glorious. With proper planning, Mr. Syrianos says you can attain a dream home in a dream location.

Full text: DONE DEAL 889 Pacific St., No. 3801, Vancouver DOWN TOWN Asking price: $8,888,900 (May 1, 2022) Selling price: $8,888,900 (Aug. 22, 2022) Days on market: 113 Taxes: $34,169 (2022) Listing agents: Amy Chan & Tracie McTavish, Rennie & Associates Realty Buyer’s agent: Phil Chang, Rennie & Associates Realty THE ACTION The Pacific tower received its occupancy permit in July, 2021, and 25 groups toured the new unit. A local buyer made the purchase, which completed in October.
“The offers coming in today are vastly different from the swift market that we saw even as recently as a few months ago, with buyers offering quick closes, subject free and top dollar,” says listing agent Amy Chan.
“Although this particular listing is considered a niche market based on the price and size of the condo, this is a testament that there are active buyers looking.”
WHAT THEY GOT This sub-penthouse on the 38th floor is at the newly built 39-storey Pacific by Grosvenor. It has 2,791 square feet of living space, with four bedrooms and three bathrooms, a powder room, laundry and family room.
The 405-square-foot balcony spans the width of the unit, with unobstructed city and ocean views. The bedrooms are big enough for a king-size bed and the floors are heated.
The kitchen is outfitted with a SubZero fridge, a wine fridge and has Italian millwork. Integrated home technology includes black-out blinds.
There is only one other neighbour on the floor, and a total of 224 units in the LEED certified tower. Located at Pacific and Hornby streets, the unit is in the heart of downtown.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “Buyers are actively looking despite the fear of interest-rate increases,” Ms. Chan said. “The sentiment from buyers is that the market has dropped much more than the data shows, showing a lack of confidence in the market. I have heard numbers upward of 25 per cent [drop], but in reality, for the Vancouver region, price declines show 5 per cent compared to the previous month of August and 3 per cent comparative to the same time last year.”

Full text: 712 Rossland Rd., No. 315, Whitby, Ont.
WHIT BY Asking price: $599,900 (September, 2022) Previous asking prices: $679,000 (June, 2022) Selling price: $590,000 (September, 2022) Previous selling prices: $209,000 (May, 2008); $111,983 (May, 1993) Taxes: $2,948 (2022) Property days on the market: 75 Listing agents: Malcolm Macaulay and Erin Way, Coldwell Banker R.M.R. Real Estate THE ACTION When this one-bedroom-plus-den suite in Whitby, about 60 kilometres from downtown Toronto, came on the market this summer listed at $679,000, it got the attention of local buyers downsizing from freehold houses. Though there were competing condos for sale in the 12-storey building, this one received three offers, but none were acceptable to the seller. The unit was relisted and priced at $599,900 in September. After two weeks, one offer came in at $590,000, which was accepted.
“There were two other units available in the building when we were listed,” said agent Erin Way.
“It was right at the start of the market shift, so once we relisted, interest really took off and we got a good offer almost right out the gate.”
WHAT THEY GOT This 961-square-foot unit is in a roughly 30-year-old building near the Regional Municipality of Durham headquarters, toward the north end of Whitby.
It has a traditional kitchen and an open principal room flanked by the bedroom and enclosed den.
There are two full bathrooms and a laundry room, in addition to a storage locker and one parking spot. Monthly fees are $589 and cover utilities and the use of a gym and pool.
The property closed on Nov. 29.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “Whitby only has a handful of apartments,” Ms. Way said.
“The amenities are really good, and it’s one of few condos now where everything is included in the maintenance fees.”
This unit is also well positioned, facing east towards tree-lined streets and a park. “Although there’s no balcony, the whole back end of the condo is just windows, so there’s lots of natural light,” Ms. Way said.

Loopholes aplenty in housing policies: Anti-flipping tax and foreign buyers’ ban are destined to fail, experts say

Full text: VANCOUVER New federal housing policies are being met with significant skepticism as to whether they will curb speculation and increase affordability.
The new federal anti-flipping tax and the two-year ban on foreign home purchases both came into effect this month. Neither move is expected to significantly impact the housing market in a way that would lead to a reduction in property prices, or curb the treatment of housing as a commodity. A report released by the Parliamentary Budget Office in September showed the house price affordability gap widened last year. The report said the average house prices in Vancouver, Victoria, Toronto, Hamilton, Ottawa, Halifax and Montreal “were more than 50-per-cent higher than their respective affordable prices in August.”
The idea of the ban is to protect the supply of housing for Canadians, which, in major markets, has de-coupled from local incomes.
However, the foreign buyers’ ban is really just a fine, argues Toronto-based Ron Butler, owner of a large mortgage brokerage and outspoken critic of issues such as tax evasion. The maximum penalty for violating the ban is $10,000, which he calls a pittance in high-priced Vancouver and Toronto. And the numerous exemptions make it even weaker.
Non-resident buyers already make up a tiny share of the market. And those who are exempt include long-term international students and people with temporary work permits, non-Canadians married to a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, those with temporary resident status, diplomats, refugee claimants and some international organizations.
Buildings with more than three units are still open to foreign investment, as are properties in less populated areas, as well as recreational properties.
Government can force the sale of a property, to be sold at the price it was purchased. And those who helped facilitate the purchase can also be fined.
Mr. Butler sees the unlikely scenario as achieving little.
“So they catch you after [the sale] closes,” Mr. Butler says.
“We’re not sure how they will monitor it, but let’s assume they catch you. You’re forced to sell the house. It would appear to be a court-ordered transaction, some kind of court order, which would probably take a couple of years before it reached a point of seriousness and a forced sale.
“So you could go ahead and buy the place, you wait 18 months and they’ve chased you, and then you sell it, and you pay the $10,000 fine. That’s kind of the perfect money laundering timing scenario.”
Mr. Butler has been criticizing the ban on social media. His other complaint is that the ban doesn’t address the foreign wealth that flows into the market by way of international students and others who live in Canada but are funded by a family member who earns their income outside the country. Satellite families typically declare little income tax in Canada. In Vancouver, the result has been multimillion-dollar properties owned by proxy owners, students and homemakers.
“The reality is that 95 per cent of the money that flows into Canada comes here from people who are already permanent residents,” he says. “They are the siblings, the spouses, the offspring of the foreign agents, and they’ve come here through standard immigration protocols.”
The new anti-flipping tax measure is aimed at purchasers of properties who flip them in under a year. If the house is sold less than a year after purchase, the entire net profit is taxed as business income. The owner no longer stands the possibility of benefitting from the 50-per-cent capital gains inclusion rate, or the principal residence exemption.
The 50-per-cent inclusion rate is the allowable taxable capital gain, generally lower than business income tax. However, there are several exemptions for incurring that new tax as well, including divorce, death, moving far away for a job and other situations that require a person to sell.
“Just as we found out with the foreign buyer’s ban, the new [anti-flipping] tax could have many holes as a pair of fishnet stockings,” Mr. Butler says.
“I’m a critic of the loopholes.
Here’s what will happen since there’s an exemption for marriage breakdown. Every house flipper that wants to sell before the end of the one full year, they will announce they’re filing for divorce and magically reconcile once the sale is through.”
Exemptions aside, not many people who flip homes do so in less than a year, says Prof. Rhys Kesselman, professor emeritus at Simon Fraser University’s School of Public Policy.
“I would have gone to two years or three years, frankly, if I were writing that legislation and thinking of the policy goal,” Prof.
Kesselman says.
“There’s one other interesting twist on the flipping tax,” he says.
“If you lose money – which could happen now with the market being soft and maybe going down – the loss cannot be claimed as a business loss. That’s very interesting. They just wanted to, I imagine, say, ‘This is a no-go area.
Don’t do it. If you happen to lose money you’re out of luck.’” But he’s also doubtful that the new measures will do much to improve affordability.
“Looking back, I don’t think anything that B.C. has done, or now the federal government is doing, has had a big impact,” Prof. Kesselman says.
“Maybe an indefinite foreign ban on purchasing would have more of an impact, not just two years, and not with all these exclusions.”
The federal government estimates tax revenues of $64-million over five years will be generated by the anti-flipping tax measure, according to Budget 2022, tabled in April. The government’s concern was that people flipping homes were “improperly reporting their profits” as either capital gains or claiming the principal residence exemption, according to the new rule. It includes rental properties that are flipped.
The anti-flipping tax does not yet apply to assignment sales, however. That piece has yet to be legislated, according to a Ministry of Finance official who spoke about the new tax on background only.
Once it applies to assignment sales, government estimates another $5-million in tax revenues over five years. The proposal to extend the anti-flipping tax to assignment sales was announced in the federal government’s fall economic statement. Profits from the assignment sale would be fully taxable as business income if owned for less than 12 months.
The ministry official said that enforcement is up to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), and people must report the sale of their principal residences on their tax returns, as a way to monitor property sales.
Vancouver real estate lawyer Ron Usher, who participated in the Cullen Commission on money laundering, said that without proper follow-up and enforcement, policies are often meaningless. As well, the added complexity of so many new rules creates industry confusion and adds to the cost.
Prior to the sudden implementation of the foreign buyer ban, for example, foreign buyers were wondering if their not-yetcompleted purchase would suddenly be banned.
“I think it’s pretty clear that those are valid sales,” Mr. Usher says.
“As long as you had a contractual right to buy, that’s a purchase that will not be undermined even though the transaction is not completed. If you live in Shanghai and it completes in April, you can still buy the property, according to the [rules].”
Mr. Butler has a non-resident client who will live in Canada for five years for work, where she will pay taxes and contribute to the economy. She had wanted to purchase a home in order to stay in the real estate market, but she’s now banned from such a purchase. There will be those people affected by the ban, says Mr. Usher. But many countries restrict foreign property purchases, and policies are imperfect.
“In my view it’s a good thing if we can get to more specificity on these various rules so we are not up to the whim and mood of [a Canada Revenue Agency] inspector. I don’t want to slam them, but it shouldn’t be subjective. It shouldn’t make a difference what federal court judge you find yourself in front of.
“But the bad news is, it’s really hard to write laws that deal with all the circumstances. So inevitably there will be people who we would all agree did get caught in some unfair way.”

Urban renewal: Canadian cities see immigration-driven surge in population after pandemic lull

Full text: Canada’s urban areas recently experienced their strongest population growth in at least two decades, after a weak expansion during the early stages of the pandemic.
Over the year ending July 1, 2022, the country’s census metropolitan areas (CMAs) grew 2.1 per cent – about 574,000 people – according to Statistics Canada estimates published Wednesday. That was the strongest pace of annual growth since the agency began publishing such figures in 2001.
It was a comeback of sorts for urban regions, which had grown just 0.5 per cent the previous year, lagging the growth in rural areas. The pandemic and its accompanying border restrictions led to a dramatic decline in immigration to Canada, while many urban residents decamped to smaller communities.
But as restrictions eased, immigration surged to record levels, helping drive most of the population increases in urban areas.
Sixteen CMAs notched their strongest annual growth on record.
At the same time, some major cities are still seeing plenty of residents leave. The Toronto region, for one, is losing significantly more people to other parts of Canada than it is bringing in. Over the past year, its population growth was entirely driven by international migration, which includes permanent residents and foreign students.
Several economists tie the exodus to worsening home affordability, along with the rise of remote work. And as homes have gotten pricier in suburbs and exurbs, buyers are looking even further afield.
“This is not like 50 years ago, when people were leaving downtown Toronto and moving to Etobicoke,” said Mike Moffatt, the founding director of the PLACE Centre think tank, referring to the former suburb that is now part of the city of Toronto. “This is people moving to London or Moncton or basically outside of the economic region.
So there is a fundamental difference.”
Indeed, Atlantic Canada is experiencing a boom. Moncton’s population rose 5.4 per cent over the year ending July 1, 2022, the most of any CMA. Halifax was the next highest, at 4.5 per cent. Charlottetown grew 4.2 per cent.
There was breadth to the expansion, too.
The Calgary area grew 3.2 per cent, or roughly 50,000 people, its strongest pace since the mid-2000s. The Vancouver area added 2.8 per cent to its population. The populations of Barrie and London, Ont., rose 3.2 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively.
The Toronto region did grow – by 2.1 per cent, or more than 138,000 people. However, it saw a net intraprovincial loss of roughly 78,000 – which means that many more people left for other parts of Ontario than moved in. It was the most on record, and the outflow has accelerated in recent years, alongside rising home prices and rents. There has been a spike in the number of children leaving the city, suggesting that young families are getting priced out of the housing market and are looking elsewhere for properties.
The Montreal and Vancouver areas also saw net intraprovincial losses of about 29,500 and 14,300 people, respectively, over the past year. Over all, Montreal’s population grew just 0.9 per cent, outpacing only Thunder Bay (0.2 per cent) among CMAs.
Toronto is also losing people to other provinces. The region saw a net interprovincial outflow of roughly 21,400 residents, more than double the previous record for departures.
Mr. Moffatt said the concern is that cities such as Toronto will suffer a “hollowing out” of their middle classes, who can no longer afford to live there. This has implications for the labour market, he said, as many crucial workers – such as teachers and nurses – are forced to relocate.
“You basically have two extremes, where fairly wealthy and older households can make it work, then you have young students and people starting their careers who are sharing apartments,” he said.
On the flip side, the Calgary area swung to a net interprovincial gain of residents in what amounted to the largest inflow of people since the oil price collapse of 2014 to 2016.
Similarly, Halifax is drawing large numbers of people from outside Nova Scotia. The CMA notched a net interprovincial inflow of more than 8,000 people, a figure that has been rising steadily for years.
Brigitte Teleu, a local real estate agent, said upward of 30 per cent of her clients recently have been out-of-province buyers. Like much of the Maritimes, Halifax saw home prices surge during the boom period of 2020 and 2021.
“Our prices are still relatively low, even now, compared to the rest of Canada,” she said. “A lot of people are selling their homes in Toronto, and they have all the money to spare and they just buy a house upfront in cash.”
Canada is struggling to build enough homes for its rapidly growing population, especially with higher interest rates, which make construction costlier and qualifying for a mortgage even more difficult. The federal government, meanwhile, is pursuing record levels of immigration in the coming years, adding more demand for homes in short supply.
“I think we’re going to have an escalation of the current trends, where our cities are growing but at the same time we are losing a lot of young professionals to Alberta and Atlantic Canada” from Ontario, Mr. Moffatt said.

Full text: After three years of COVID-19-fuelled turmoil and uncertainty, Canada’s economy is at an inflection point. With interest rates at their highest level in 15 years as the Bank of Canada fights inflation rates not seen since the 1980s, Canadians are trying to make sense of what lies ahead: Does Canada face a recession? How sharp will the slowdown be? Will inflation cool or remain stubbornly high?
To help make sense of the year ahead, The Globe and Mail asked dozens of experts – including economists, investors, academics and business leaders – to each select a chart that reflects an issue they think will be critical to watch in 2023 and explain its importance.
The charts they selected reflect a broad range of metrics that cover everything from housing and interest rates and inflation to job markets, Canada’s energy transition, immigration and Indigenous reconciliation.
DIVERGENT DEBT Beata Caranci, chief economist, TD Bank Group One word describes this graph: striking. The painful U.S. deleveraging cycle after the 2008-09 global financial crisis now pays dividends, and it could be a factor that creates American consumer resilience relative to the size of interest-rate changes.
Canadians are unlikely to say the same. The differences in household debt-service ratios between the two countries reflect differences in the amount of leverage and the structure of mortgage debt. American mortgage holders are skewed to a 30-year fixed rate that helps insulate them from renewal risks, while Canadians usually renew at fiveyear intervals or less.
This risk is amplified by the popularity of variable-rate mortgages here during the pandemic. These terms climbed to 34 per cent of the overall stock of Canadian mortgage credit, compared with a previous peak of 25 per cent in 2018.
The Canadian debt-service ratio rises in this graph solely because of interest-rate increases, and despite our assumptions that loan growth stalls and households extend their mortgage amortization to minimize the increase in monthly payments.
STAY ON TARGET Cynthia Leach, assistant chief economist, RBC Canada is not investing enough in deploying the technologies needed to reach 2030 climate targets. Will the federal government’s recent introduction of a broad clean technology investment tax credit be enough to change the trajectory?
Federal incentives, corporate climate commitments and the push for energy security should see climate investment outperform through the next cycle. But like broader business investment, the capital-intensive sector has to contend with higher interest rates and high uncertainty. So deployment of green so11 lutions will likely vary by technology. More commercially-ready clean technologies with lower risks and better returns should see greater investment, while those with higher risks might see further relative underinvestment. Even then, it may not be enough to keep investment on target.
CANADA THE LAGGARD Jim Balsillie, co-founder of the Council of Canadian Innovators, co-founder and former co-CEO of BlackBerry Four decades ago, the traditional production-based economy began transitioning to a knowledgebased economy and, more recently, to a data-driven economy.
This shift foundationally reshaped the international competitive landscape, and changed the structure and behavioural characteristics of companies, which became capital-equipment-light and worker-lean, yet operating at global scale and pulling in massive profits by aggressively generating intellectual property and data assets.
Canadian policy makers missed this shift and, as a result, our country started a steady decline in prosperity that continues today. Since 1976, Canada’s productivity performance has been the worst of all advanced economies, resulting in real wages remaining essentially stagnant since then.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development recently projected that Canada’s economy will be “the worstperforming advanced economy over 2020 to 2030 and the three decades after.” And the really bad news? There’s nothing in the current federal budget or associated economic development strategies designed to reverse this trend.
Unless we build the expertise inside our policy community to deal with the structural economic issues surfaced by the rise of the intangible economy, middle-class Canadians will continue to experience a financial squeeze, and our public infrastructure will continue its own path of erosion.
GHOST-TOWN REBOUND Stephen Tapp, chief economist, Canadian Chamber of Commerce As Canada’s work force continues to adjust to a new equilibrium of hybrid and remote work, it’s proving to be the biggest labour-market adjustment of our lifetimes.
The Canadian Chamber of Commerce Business Data Lab recently released a report and interactive dashboard that shows workplace mobility has taken a significant hit in the downtowns of the largest cities, including Ottawa-Gatineau, Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver.
As maps in the report show, there’s evidence of a doughnut effect, in which traffic to the downtown cores of Canada’s biggest cities hollowed out, while action shifted to outlying, mid-sized commuter cities (such as Barrie, Brampton and Brantford in Ontario, Chilliwack, B.C., and Trois-Rivières) as knowledge workers embraced remote work and cheaper housing.
Thankfully, we saw progress in 2022, with downtown ghost towns slowly coming back to life with increasing vibrancy. How much more recovery will we see in 2023, and what will be the implications for local economies and businesses across Canada? METRICS OF RECONCILIATION Tabatha Bull, CEO, Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business There remains a significant gulf between the wealth, income, well-being and prosperity of Indigenous people and other Canadians. This chart, taken from a report produced by the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business, shows that the unemployment rate for Indigenous people is twice that of other Canadians, a gap that seems systemic.
Last year marked a change in economic reconciliation with the release of the National Indigenous Economy Strategy (NIES). Indigenous-led and driven, this strategy guides governments, industry and institutions in their reconciliation work and collaboration in rebuilding Indigenous economies. The NIES presents four strategic pathways, covering Indigenous people, lands, infrastructure and finance, supported by 107 calls to economic prosperity.
The aim is to assert Indigenous empowerment through sovereignty, economic frameworks, capacity and institutions. Progress is necessary to close gaps in opportunities Indigenous people face, and the calls to actions under the NIES are the places to focus to see meaningful outcomes.
TECH LONG AND PROSPER Lisa Melchior, founder and managing partner, Vertu Capital With technology playing a central role in the way we live, work and play today, it’s no surprise the tech sector is the fastest-growing segment of the economy and a major contributor to Canada’s prosperity. Despite news of layoffs and swings in stock-market performance, the underlying fundamentals of the tech sector continue to be very strong.
Over the past five years, technology’s contribution to Canada’s GDP has materially outperformed all other industries, including into 2022. Indexed from Q4 2016, the tech sector has delivered almost four times more GDP growth than all other sectors of the economy. Looking ahead, tech will continue to drive Canadian growth and productivity, which is why it’s critical we continue to invest in this strategic sector.
BEWARE THE WAGE RAGE Armine Yalnizyan, economist, Atkinson Fellow on The Future of Workers Inflation hit levels not seen in four decades last year, erasing purchasing power. We’re told that if workers try to recoup lost ground, they could trigger a wage-price spiral, baking in never-ending waves of wages trying to catch up with prices, which in turn rise because of higher costs. Nobody wants entrenched inflation. But is it happening?
I recently learned that wage growth is in the eye of the beholder – and data adjuster. Talking with another economist about inflation, I was told claims of wage growth falling behind inflation are “factually false.” Not only has wage growth kept up with inflation; it has been “explosive” since last year. The supporting evidence indexed changes to April, 2022, using three-month moving averages and in-house seasonally adjusted data (normally accompanied by the Statistics Canada caution, “Don’t try this at home, kids”).
Inflation is usually measured monthly as a year-over-year change.
So is wage growth. Both are not typically seasonally adjusted. Do you see evidence that Canadian workers are keeping up with inflation in this graph? Keep your eyes out for wage growth and wage rage analysis in 2023.
NET-ZERO NEEDS Mark Carney, chair and head of transition investing, Brookfield Asset Management The ratio of clean-energy to fossil-fuel investment over the next decade is probably the most critical indicator of whether the world can meet its net-zero objective. Today that ratio sits around 1-to-1. By 2030 it must rise to between 4-to-1 and 5-to-1. That means a rapid acceleration in clean-energy investment, a process that has already begun.
Importantly, a smooth energy transition will also require some limited and targeted investment in fossil fuels, to maintain the stability of our energy systems and our economies. But the ratio of cleanenergy investment to fossil-fuel investment rises from 1-to-1 to at least 4-to-1, not 4-to-0.
AMPLIFIED PAIN David Doyle, head of economics, Macquarie Group A year ago, markets were discounting 125 to 150 basis points in interest rate increases in 2022 by the Bank of Canada. The bank has more than delivered this, raising rates by 400 basis points in 2022, or four percentage points, the sharpest year of increases on record.
All rate hikes, however, are not created equal. Given rising leverage in the private sector, rate increases in 2022 should have more impact than in the past. Accounting for this puts the 2022 rate cycle in its proper perspective. On this debt-adjusted basis, the rate hikes were more than twice as severe as the next most dramatic year of rate hikes (1980).
Significant economic consequences are already flowing from this. The unemployment rate bottomed in the summer and has begun to move upward. In the third quarter, final domestic demand contracted, dragged down by residential investment and consumer spending. These developments foreshadow a recession ahead.
Our forecast for Canada in 2023 remains the same as it has since April, 2022. We expect a severe recession, with real GDP contracting by 3 per cent, double the decline we anticipate in the United States.
LAYOFFS IN LIMBO Brendon Bernard, senior economist, Indeed.com Some economic indicators have softened of late, but the Canadian unemployment rate remains near its multidecade low.
One reason for the labour market’s resilience is that layoffs have been low.
Over the past three months, through to November, 2022, an average of 0.52 per cent of Canadian workers per month were newly jobless owing to layoff or discharge, according to Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey. The lowest the rate reached in recent years over the same intervals was 0.6 per cent in 2018. Layoff rates were either at or below their 20172019 averages across most industries, including construction and retail trade, despite some signs of slowdowns in these sectors.
As the economy remains in limbo heading into 2023, tracking layoffs will help distinguish the signal from the noise in the headline Labour Force Survey data. Through to November, there are few signs, either in layoffs or employer postings on the job website Indeed, that the Canadian job market has hit a major turning point. This is good news for job seekers today, but it’s less clear if it will last.
TAKING STOCK OF RECESSIONS Alexander MacDonald, portfolio manager, GlobeInvest Capital Management If you were able to predict now, with 100-per-cent certainty, that a Canadian recession was coming in 2023, how would that affect your investment decisions? It would likely be tempting to sell everything and wait until the economy is on stable footing again before buying back in. But if history is any guide, the worst of the recession-driven market performance may already be behind us.
Markets are forward-looking, constantly trying to anticipate events that are often years in the future. How they attempt to anticipate recessions is no different. This chart shows how equity markets have both anticipated and responded to Canadian recessions over the past 40 years.
Since 1982, annual Canadian GDP has decreased year-over-year four times: in 1982, 1991, 2009 and 2020. In three of those four instances, the S&P/TSX Composite Total Return Index fell in the preceding year. The one exception is 2020 – it seems equity markets are poor at predicting global pandemics.
Furthermore, the index increased during every one of those four years of negative GDP growth. At the time of writing, the index is down 3.3 per cent so far in 2022. We’re about to find out whether 2023 will bring Canada’s fifth straight recession rally.
CLOSING TIME Stephen Poloz, special adviser, Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP; former Bank of Canada governor My favourite chart this year is the same as last year: active businesses in Canada, which number more than 900,000. After losing many companies during the pandemic, we have gradually rebuilt, and by late 2021 the number of companies had exceeded prepandemic levels. During the summer of 2022, the rate of company closings began to move above the rate of company creations, causing the population to roll over, and symptomatic of tighter financial conditions and a slowing economy.
Watch for more net company closings as higher interest rates work their way through the system – and if those companies have been looking for workers, we’ll see job vacancies decline at the same time.
WATCH THAT CURVE Sal Guatieri, senior economist, BMO Financial Group Canadian real GDP growth averaged 3 per cent annualized in the first three quarters of 2022, with little sign of slowing despite fierce monetary tightening. But as the full weight of tighter policy bears down on activity, tougher times lie ahead. To wit, the recent minus-154-basis-point spread between yields on Canada 10-year and one-year securities is the most deeply negative spread since the early-1990s recession.
The yield curve is not a perfect guide to downturns, but it is one of the most reliable. Ignore it at your peril.
ROBOTS 1, LABOUR 0 Vass Bednar, executive director at McMaster University’s Master of Public Policy Program I think it’s worth watching the movement on total compensation per hour worked, deflated by the GDP deflator, a measure of inflation in domestically produced goods and services. This metric has grown at a slower rate than labour productivity during the pandemic (from the first quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2022).
Analysis from Statistics Canada suggests that “the increase in automation caused by labour shortages and the need to work in a socially distanced work environment could continue to decrease labour’s share of the GDP and prevent real wages from returning to their historical position.”
As corporations continue to resist wage increases, we need to be real – and stay real – about the relationship between productivity growth and the real total compensation that people are taking home.
LET’S GET REAL Carolyn Wilkins, senior research scholar, Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies at Princeton University; former senior deputy governor, Bank of Canada Real gross domestic product per capita seems like an unfashionable indicator, especially if you’re of my son’s vintage. I can see why. There are more immediate and important concerns: the cost of living, pressures on health care, and how we’ll deal with an aging population and achieve climate objectives while generating shared prosperity. Add geopolitical and social risks to the list.
Unfashionable or not, GDP per capita is a key performance indicator, since it drives the kind of investments businesses and governments can afford to set up Canadian families and their communities for success. We’ve only just climbed out of the massive hole created during the pandemic, and there’s room to improve if our neighbour is any gauge. U.S.
GDP per capita, adjusted for inflation, grew around twice as fast over the past decade as it did in Canada.
When measuring success, however, we mustn’t stop there. I’ll be watching for an update to the Coalition for a Better Future’s scorecard, through a research partnership with the University of Ottawa’s Telfer School of Management, due out in March. It’ll track performance along several fronts: living better, growing sustainably and winning globally.
HELP REALLY, REALLY WANTED Katherine Judge, senior economist, CIBC Capital Markets There’s been a lot of emphasis on getting to a higher unemployment rate to help cool wage inflation, but limiting wage growth can also be achieved by having fewer job vacancies.
The tightness in Canada’s labour market is highlighted by the difference in demand for workers relative to supply, shown in the chart. Record levels of job openings and a low unemployment rate are resulting in wage inflation that exceeds the Bank of Canada’s 2-per-cent inflation target, and the bank has increased interest rates aggressively, which should help add slack to the labour market.
Monetary policy makers will be looking for both an easing in job vacancies and a rise in unemployment next year to restore balance in the labour market and return inflation closer to target, adding to supply chain improvements. It takes several quarters for interest rate hikes to work their way through the economy, so the effects of this year’s hikes will become more apparent in 2023, and we don’t see the overnight rate heading any higher from here.
LOONS, HAWKS AND DOVES George Pearkes, macro strategist, Bespoke Investment Group While the Bank of Canada finished 2022 moving from ultrahawkish to a more measured tone, the U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of England and European Central Bank have all continued to talk tough. Foreign-exchange markets are all about relative relationships, so for the Canadian dollar, the relatively less aggressive Bank of Canada means lower rates compared with major peers. With less compelling returns on Canadian dollars, the loonie has sunk and is likely to continue to suffer from a central bank that feels it needs to start easing off the brakes.
ATLANTIC CANADA’S CATCH-22 e Frances Woolley, professor of economics, Carleton University Newfoundland and Labrador has the oldest population of any province in Canada. Almost a quarter of its residents are 65 or older. The rest of Atlantic Canada is not far behind. To counter these demographic trends, every Atlantic province has a nominee program approved by Ottawa for immigrants. In addition, there is a federal Atlantic immigration program.
But this chart, which takes immigrant tax filers who arrived in Canada in 2010 and reveals how many remained in their original destination province a decade later, shows that many immigrants who come to Atlantic Canada don’t stay. Some leave Canada altogether; most move to larger and more prosperous provinces.
Atlantic Canada could find itself in a Catch-22: unable to attract immigrants without a strong economy and unable to build a strong economy without immigration.
Yet immigrant retention is about more than economics. All Canadians, immigrant and non-immigrant alike, want to be part of a community. Quebec, for example, retains 94 per cent of its French-speaking immigrants, but only 71 per cent of those who arrive speaking only English. Immigrants who land in Halifax speaking neither English nor French usually end up leaving; those who land in Toronto or Vancouver generally remain there.
People want to live where they feel like they belong. The crucial policy question is: What can be done to make immigrants to the Atlantic provinces feel part of a community and want to stay? AS ALBERTA GOES, SO GOES THE FEDERATION Trevor Tombe, professor of economics, University of Calgary From a deficit of nearly $17-billion two years ago to a projected surplus of well over $12-billion this year, the reversal of Alberta’s fiscal fortunes – owing largely to high oil prices – is astounding. It is, without exaggeration, the most dramatic improvement for a provincial government in all of Canadian history.
But the coming year is highly uncertain. Depending on world oil prices, Alberta’s budget could barely balance in 2023 (with prices for benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude at US$70 a barrel) or post a $20-billion surplus (at US$100 a barrel). This oil royalty roller coaster matters for all of Canada.
Alberta’s new government under Premier Danielle Smith is looking for a fight with the federation. And several of her signature initiatives, such as separating from the Canada Pension Plan, and setting up a provincial tax-collection agency and provincial police force, will not come cheap.
A province flush with cash is a province with room to manoeuvre.
Higher incomes also (naturally) increase federal revenue raised from Alberta taxpayers, especially oil and gas companies enjoying record profits. This may bring the federal-provincial fiscal imbalance to new highs and embolden many Albertans to complain of unfair treatment by Ottawa. Regional political tensions are already high, and further increases are unwelcome.
A coming spring election in Alberta makes these risks even greater.
For these and other reasons, the province’s fiscal position in 2023 will be an important chart to watch.
IT’S A GLOBAL THING Siddhartha Bhattacharya, economist, ATB Financial Right when recovery from the pandemic appeared on the horizon, things went into a tailspin with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As a result, prices for commodities such as crops, chemicals and natural gas soared to levels not seen in decades.
Global output, which the International Monetary Fund initially expected to increase by 3.8 per cent in 2023, underwent several downward revisions and is now pegged to grow by less than 3 per cent.
While several factors can be cited for this, elevated inflation across most G7 nations and the measures adopted to combat it pose the biggest threat to economic health going into 2023. Looking ahead, it is crucial to see how effectively and quickly last year’s interest rate increases pull inflation toward a more normal range.
THE LONG AND SHORT OF INFLATION Pierre Cléroux, chief economist, Business Development Bank of Canada Inflation soared to multidecade highs in 2022, forcing the Bank of Canada to tighten monetary policy rapidly and aggressively.
The central bank is closely watching inflation to better determine its next move, and so should we.
Headline inflation in Canada peaked at 8.1 per cent in June, 2022, and has declined to 6.8 per cent in November. While the recent number is well above the bank’s 2per-cent target, the shorter-term trend demonstrated by the three-month annualized change had been encouraging before an upswing in the fall.
Therefore, it is important to watch inflation to get an indication on the direction of interest rates.
THE WAGE SCAPEGOAT Jim Stanford, economist and director, Centre for Future Work In recent months, the Bank of Canada has focused on the labour market as the main culprit behind higher inflation: The unemployment rate is too low, wages are rising too fast and this so-called “overheating” is driving up prices. This echoes conventional fears of a wage-price spiral like the one in the 1970s. But empirical evidence suggests wages have lagged inflation – not caused it – by an average of 2.5 percentage points per year since early 2021. However, another component of production costs – profits – has grown much faster and further, and hence is more culpable in explaining the inflation surge. Corporate profits have swelled dramatically during the pandemic, to the highest share of GDP in history. And those profits are concentrated in the same industries that lead inflation: petroleum, real estate, building materials, car dealers and, yes, supermarkets.
Let’s define unit profit cost as the amount of corporate profit built into each dollar of real output produced in the economy. Unit profit cost has soared almost 50 per cent since 2019. Unit labour costs grew one-third as fast. So instead of targeting workers with anti-inflation medicine, we might consider why profits have grown so substantially – and find ways to short-circuit the profit-price spiral fuelling current inflation.
DECODING, B8
RENT LAMENT Matt Lundy, economics reporter, The Globe and Mail In every major city, rents are surging. The national average rent for units listed on Rentals.ca was slightly more than $2,000 in November, an increase of 12.4 per cent, year over year. In several cities – including Halifax, Toronto and Vancouver – rents jumped by more than 20 per cent in that span. Of course, many tenants are covered by legislation that limits annual increases. Movers, on the other hand, were exposed to brutal conditions. The rental crisis is decades in the making. Canada isn’t building enough homes (including apartments) for a rapidly growing population, and now with rising interest rates, hopeful buyers are stuck on the sidelines, keeping people in rentals longer. Expect more housing stress in 2023.
TECH’S 20-YEAR FAILURE Viet Vu, manager of economic research, Brookfield Institute for Innovation + Entrepreneurship In 2001, one in five tech workers were women. Two decades later, in 2021, that number has not changed, demonstrating the immense structural challenges women still face in the technology sector in Canada. Each woman we drive away from tech is a loss to the Canadian economy we cannot afford, as digitization continues to accelerate as the pandemic eases.
LEADING DOWN David Rosenberg, founder and president, Rosenberg Research & Associates Inc.
Who needs an economist when we have the U.S. Conference Board’s leading economic indicator? The data go back to 1959 and never fail to signal the storm clouds (or sunshine) at turning points in the cycle. This forward-looking index has now declined for eight consecutive months. At no time in the past have we seen a string of weakness like this, with an annualized contraction of 5.6 per cent over such a time frame, that failed to presage a recession within a quarter or two. Call it nine for nine back to 1959. The U.S. recession is staring us in the face.
What the Federal Reserve is focusing on is the index of coincident economic indicators, but that only tells you where we are today. And the index of lagging indicators tells you where we were yesterday. The leading indicator is chock full of leading factors such as capital-goods orders, building permits, the workweek and consumer buying plans. The coincident index has non-farm payrolls, and the lagging index consists of the unemployment rate and wage costs.
The Fed is driving the bus all right, but it is not looking through the front window. Which means what? It means we are going to crash land the economy into a recession in the year ahead. This is the theme for 2023 and it is typical for the year that follows the Fed tightening cycle – think 1982, think 1990, think 2001 and think 2007.
The most powerful determinant of the Canadian economy is not monetary policy, fiscal policy or the exchange rate. It is the push and pull from U.S. domestic demand. When the United States catches a cold, as the leading indicator strongly suggests, Canada ends up with the flu.
FALLOUT AT THE CHECKOUT Mikal Skuterud, professor of economics, University of Waterloo Roughly 600,000 Canadians are employed as cashiers, service station attendants and store-shelf stockers, a number that has changed little since 2017. The fortunes of these workers in the years before the pandemic reflected those of low-wage workers across the country, as generous increases in provincial minimum wages and labour-productivity gains produced substantial real wage gains. Inflation as the pandemic has eased, combined with sluggish nominal wage increases, are eroding those gains.
The average real wage rate of Canadian cashiers in October, 2022, was lower than it was in October, 2018. As inflationary pressures persist and employers increasingly look to temporary foreign workers to fill low-wage job vacancies, thereby relieving pressures on employers to improve wages and labour productivity, there is reason to worry that the economic fortunes of Canada’s lowestwage workers will deteriorate further in 2023.
SPEND, SPEND, SPEND Alexandre Laurin and William Robson, director of research and CEO, respectively, C.D. Howe Institute Successive fall fiscal statements from Canada’s finance ministers show federal spending accelerating, even after COVID-related measures drop out of the projections. The government’s last pre-COVID projections in the fall of 2019 showed spending of $421-billion in the 2024-25 fiscal year (the final year in the projections).
Ottawa produced no budget in 2020, but that year’s fall statement showed spending of $429-billion in 2024-25 – a marginal increase. The 2021 fall statement showed spending at $465-billion in 2024-25 – 11-percent higher than in 2019. The 2022 fall statement showed spending at $505-billion in 2024-25 – up 20 per cent since the 2019 projection. Not because of COVID.
Everything else – transfers, costs of federal employees, interest payments on debt – is up.
About one-third of the higher amount now projected for 2024-25 reflects higher prices, but the government’s relentless spending is a key driver of inflation.
The talk of restraint around the 2022 statement was just talk. Before long, Ottawa will need to act.
A COAL GOAL REACHED Andrew Leach, professor of economics, University of Alberta When Alberta pledged in 2015 to phase out coal-fired power, with a target of 2030, few thought it was possible. No one thought it was possible by 2023. But that’s just what we’re on track to see here on the Prairies: a complete phase-out of coal-fired electricity generation in Alberta by late 2023 or early 2024. So, without a doubt, this chart is the one I’ll be watching the most in the year to come, as we wait for our first coal-free hour of electricity generation and, eventually, for the last coal-generated megawatt-hour in the province.
A DISTRESSING TREND Rob Gillezeau, assistant professor of economic analysis and policy, University of Toronto Over the past two decades, there has been a dramatic increase in Indigenous incarceration, with the number of Indigenous admissions doubling while non-Indigenous admissions have declined. This has occurred over a period of substantial reductions in crime severity nationally.
With the recent resurgence of law and order policy agendas in many Canadian cities, there is substantial risk that the already distressing trend of Indigenous overrepresentation in correctional facilities could worsen without appropriate policy interventions. The costs of this overrepresentation are large, with dramatic effects on earning, health and outcomes across generations, resulting in greater inequality.
MOMENTARY POLICY Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics, Scotiabank As Canadians grapple with the soaring cost of living and higher borrowing costs, one question looms prominently over the outlook: When will relief arrive? Markets are pricing in significant interest rate cuts starting in late 2023, and rate cuts of almost two percentage points by the end of 2024.
Scotiabank Economics forecasts a cumulative 1.25 percentage points of Bank of Canada rate cuts by the end of 2024.
History may be at least somewhat on our side.
Since the central bank adopted its current approach to setting rates in 1996, it has taken an average of about 14 months to begin cutting after the policy rate peaks. If you exclude the unique circumstances after the global financial crisis, that average period drops to just over half a year before cuts set in.
Today’s circumstances are unique – when and by how much rate relief may begin to arrive will be informed by uncertain developments – but bond markets are already beginning to price in this coming relief.
MORTGAGE BORROWERS IN A FIX Royce Mendes, managing director and head of macro strategy, capital markets at Desjardins Securities Most Canadians know our economy is very sensitive to changes in interest rates. As evidence, the household debt-to-disposable-income ratio is often cited alongside the share of the economy devoted to housing. But the structure of the Canadian mortgage market deserves more attention, since it means the effects of higher interest rates are being felt sooner in Canada than in other jurisdictions.
While our neighbours to the south rely on 15-year and 30-year mortgages, most households here have historically opted for five-year fixed-rate products. So, in any given year, all else equal, there’s a greater share of Canadians renewing their mortgages than in the United States. Recently, there have also been even more households choosing variable-rate mortgages, in which the amount of interest owed adjusts as the Bank of Canada raises rates.
With central bankers hiking rates very aggressively, our simulations show that just about all of the variable-rate mortgages originated over the past two years now owe more interest than a buyer’s fixed regular payment covers. This is a situation that hasn’t been faced before. So, while monetary-policy makers continue to forecast a soft landing, it remains to be seen whether their models are adequately capturing all of the effects on the Canadian economy.
TROUBLE BUILDING Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist, Capital Economics How the economy fares next year will depend crucially on how the construction sector responds to higher interest rates. Developments so far have been encouraging, with housing starts still running above the levels seen immediately before the pandemic.
But as this chart shows for Toronto, housing starts tend to follow new home sales – which are mainly preconstruction sales – by around 12 months, and new home sales have fallen off a cliff after the Bank of Canada’s aggressive rate increases. While the surge in immigration should offer some support to construction, particularly for purpose-built rental projects, the weakness of preconstruction sales raises the risk that construction will fall sharply next year, which would lead to a deeper recession than most people expect.
A GAME OF RISK Kurt Reiman, senior strategist for North America, BlackRock (@KurtReiman) The BlackRock Geopolitical Risk Indicator tracks the relative frequency of brokerage reports (via Refinitiv) and financial news stories (Dow Jones News) associated with specific geopolitical risks. We adjust for whether the sentiment in the text of articles is positive or negative, and then assign a score that reflects the level of market attention to each risk.
We have seen a surge in market interest in geopolitical risk in recent months, highlighting how fraught the current environment is. Among the risks gaining attention: a global technology decoupling between the United States and China that has significantly accelerated in scale and scope with U.S. export controls; the likelihood of cyberattacks increasing as the Russia-Ukraine conflict persists; and the ever-present risk of intentional or accidental military conflict between NATO and Russia.
NOT-SO-GREAT EXPECTATIONS Brett House is a professor of professional practice in economics at Columbia Business School and a Fellow with the Public Policy Forum Businesses and consumers surveyed by the Bank of Canada in the third quarter of 2022 expected the cost of living over the next two years to keep rising by 5.2 per cent and 4.3 per cent year-over-year, respectively. Inflation expectations matter because they drive wage and price contracts that will remain in effect long after supply chain bottlenecks and warrelated commodity-market disruptions have receded.
Although headline inflation readings have come down from their peak last June, average annual wage growth in November was running at 5.6 per cent. That’s fast enough to sustain inflation because those pay gains were much quicker than Canada’s productivity growth rate. The central bank’s governing council signalled at its Dec. 7 meeting that it was nearing the end of its interest rate hiking cycle, but it won’t be finished raising rates until what it called “elevated” inflation expectations are nearer to the bank’s 2-per-cent objective.
Bond markets are anticipating that the bank will do whatever is necessary to get inflation back to its target range of 1 per cent to 3 per cent over several years. Unless inflation expectations have come down substantially, that’ll mean another rate increase in 2023.
WHAT SKYROCKETS UP … Farah Omran, economist, Scotiabank Canada’s housing market has been undergoing a correction since the Bank of Canada started hiking rates to fight soaring inflation. Some normalization of housing-market activity was expected from the elevated levels seen in 2021 – a year that was the weakest in Canada’s modern history in terms of population growth, but one that broke historical records in terms of home sales activity.
As such, home prices have been declining, clawing back some of the unsustainable gains of 2021 and early 2022. However, despite widely cited declines, the national MLS Home Price Index, which abstracts for sales composition effects, is only 11.5 per cent below the February, 2022, peak and remains 35 per cent above prepandemic levels.
Prices are therefore expected to continue to decline in 2023, but by how much and for how long varies significantly across cities. So far, we have seen bigger price adjustments down from peaks in cities where prices climbed more during the pandemic.
Population dynamics are likely to continue playing an important role, as we are currently experiencing the most rapid pace of population growth in 50 years.
HISTORIC RED FLAG David Wolf, portfolio manager, Fidelity Investments Canada After interest rates go up, the economy tends to fall down. This chart shows the rate of change in real mortgage interest costs compared with the performance of the economy over the subsequent year. (The axis on the chart for interest costs is inverted in order to show how reliably rising interest rates precede economic slowdowns.)
The historically sharp increase in interest rates through 2022 points to a historically deep recession in 2023. There are reasons to believe that it won’t be quite that bad. But the degree to which this leading relationship holds between rates and growth will tell the story of the Canadian economy in the coming year.
VOLATILITY CONTINUING John Ruffolo, founder and managing partner, Maverix Private Equity Layoffs, interest rate increases, online retail misses, the FTX fiasco and other bad economic news will continue to cast a chill in the technology capital markets. Coupled with continuing supply chain and logistics issues, protectionism and global conflict, the technology industry faces a lot of uncertainty in the near term. As a result, the technology capital markets will remain volatile for quite some time.
The valuations of private technology companies will be brought back down to Earth from their dizzying heights of 2019 to 2021, and will revert to the long-term mean. Investors will be rebalancing their mix of expectations between growth and profitability, in which the “growth at all costs” mantra will be replaced by “growth with profitability.” Expectations that companies can burn cash forever will disappear in 2023 as there will be more focus on cost reduction and strengthening balance sheets.
The Canadian initial public offering window will be closed for at least the next 12 to 24 months, except for companies viewed as ready and high-quality. Small-cap technology companies will continue to struggle.
Acquisitions by foreign-based purchasers or buyout private-equity funds will rise again as lower valuations and currency arbitrage will cause many companies to look “cheap” to potential acquirers.
Despite the uncertainty and the pullback of cross-over investors, particularly for later-stage financings, deal activity will be strong owing to the record amounts of dry powder sitting on the sidelines.

ABBOTS FORD, B.C .
Asking Price: $9,950,000 Taxes: $5,992 (2022) Lot Size: 9 acres Agents: Paul Hague and Christa Elizabeth Frosch, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada THE BACKSTORY Sometimes in some places the universe seems to conspire to make it so that things just work out.
Though it didn’t feel like that 10 years ago when Allison and David Zimmerman got their first annual tax bill for their Mount Lehman home: they were almost knocked flat.
“We had just settled in, and we were like, ‘Oh no, we gotta move back to our old house,’ ” Mr. Zimmerman said. ”Here the taxes are land and improvements on the land, so it was about $14,000 annually,” Mrs. Zimmerman said.
Ironically, they had wanted to buy the acreage for lifestyle and practical reasons: there was a horse barn on site and they were hoping to save on boarding fees for their 12-year-old daughter’s increasing needs as she pursued equestrian sports and acquired new mounts.
Mount Lehman is just north of Abbotsford at the southwest edge of the Fraser Valley – one of Canada’s most fertile farming spots – and they knew taxes on agricultural land could be a little more reasonable. At the time one neighbour had a vineyard and the Zimmermans were avid Okanagan wine tourists themselves, so they reached out to a wine business contact to see what their options might be.
“We started off with two acres, and planted the front field … originally the property had a lot of trees, and then in a big wind storm they all blew over, so we planted the side field,” Mr. Zimmerman said. “One year we had a big freeze over, and huge cherry and plum trees on a big piece of land, they just all broke and split open fell over and a whole piece of land was left.”
It takes time for grapevines to mature, but when they reached about four years old the vineyard contact who had pledged to buy their grapes had dropped out of the deal. “We have all these grapes, what do we do with them? One of our friends introduced us to a wine consultant who said ‘Why don’t you get a winery?’ ” Mr. Zimmerman said.
“We kind of thought about it, and I think we both said yes at the same time,” Mrs. Zimmerman said.
Their Seaside Pearl Farmgate Winery now produces about 2,000 cases a year, has won some competitions for Pacific-Northwest wines and they play host to visitors all year round at the chapel-style tasting room they built, as well as a larger recently added barrel room tasting facility (with furnishings and decorative embellishments made from oldgrowth lumber salvaged from a 100-year-old Fraser Valley barn teardown). Mr. Zimmerman’s working background is in mining and Mrs. Zimmerman’s was in retail and real estate but now both of them spend about 90 per cent of their efforts hosting tastings and running the winery.
And yes, their annual tax bill now a third of what it was before they went down this road.
“Anything perceived as a road block ended up being a good thing,” said Mr. Zimmerman. “I’d get frustrated, but it all worked out the way it was supposed to.”
THE HOUSE TODAY The Zimmerman’s say the builder of their home was a local property developer who built it for himself and a large family in 1992.
The five-bedroom nearly 6,000square foot ranch-style home was certainly built big, but it was also built to last with some commercial-grade building techniques.
There are two driveways: one that goes straight back to the barn, equestrian and winery facilities at the rear of the lot, and one that winds through the vineyard to the main house. A large ovalshaped paved courtyard in front of the three-car garage offers lots of visitor parking.
The double front doors are framed by gables and a rounded portico transitions into the house to the vaulted foyer ceiling with an angelic fresco which was painted by a local artist.
Mrs. Zimmerman calls the interior style “Tuscan” with its rich oranges, arches, trayed ceilings and pillars.
To the left of the front foyer is a step-down living room and library, to the right is a long formal dining room with a vaulted ceiling.
Off the dining room is a but-
ler’s pantry and stairway leading upstairs, past which is a kitchen filled with custom millwork cabinets in aqua/teal shades. Even with the triangular central island and high-end appliances it’s very much a farm kitchen with windows all across the back wall.
The second floor has a large loft-style family space dominated by a pool table off of which the bedrooms branch out. The primary bedroom features a fireplace and a large ensuite bathroom.
The basement level is rarely used by the family, the house is on terraced land so the bottom floor walks out and is set up as a separate apartment at the moment.
The commercial operation out back is not your typical barn. The main building is more like a hanger with about 14,000 square feet of internal space. There’s an ice surface – about a quarter the size of a hockey rink and unused by the Zimmermans – so the building is well insulated. The Zimmermans upgraded the stables and converted one half of the space into their wine operation.
There’s also a full apartment on the back of the building available for rent.
About a third of the back lot is occupied by the arena, pens and school enclosures for training with horses. There’s another field of grapes back behind the barn as well.
Even if you’re not dedicated to the equestrian competition enough that you need a half-dozen horses or more, the house is just down the street from Douglas Taylor Park, off which you can ride a leg of the Trans Canada Trail.
BEST FEATURE The winery comes with the property. Sometimes in vineyard sales the wine equipment isn’t part of the deal, but in this case anyone who wants to take over the Seaside operation is welcome to it.
Mr. and Mrs. Zimmerman are planning to retire to Mexico, and other than hanging on to the existing stock of wine the rest is up for grabs.
The tasting cottage is also a charming structure: Separated from the main house by one of the vine fields it has a large outdoor patio (barrel tables, of course) and really looks like a chapel complete with steeple and bell tower.
The interior is the same Tuscan/Canadiana style of the main house, but with more heavy ironwork, treated concrete floor and rich leather furnishings. Whether you keep the wine business it’s a heck of a coachhouse/guesthouse.
In addition to Seaside’s cabernet sauvignon’s, pinot gris, petite milo and syrah wines (they even sell a canned sparkling wine made with their grapes) the site is picturesque enough to have served as the set for more than one Hallmark movie.
One any interested buyer should check out is Christmas on the Vine, which shot some scenes on the Zimmerman property. Not only is the romantic lead (Jon Cor) Canadian, but the IMDB description for the 2020 movie is pure Hallmark: “A young marketing executive is assigned to help a struggling family-owned winery in a town that has lost its Christmas spirit due to a large wine conglomerate.”

Slower price growth seen in assessments: Assessor cautions values reported by Crown corporation reflect a snapshot from July and market momentum has shifted since then

Full text: The assessed value of homes rose in almost every community in British Columbia last year, but new official estimates show much smaller increases across B.C. than 2021’s massive spikes because rising interest rates had already begun cooling many of these real estate markets.
BC Assessment, a provincial Crown corporation, released five new reports on Tuesday showing trends in scores of communities across the five different regions of the province, with most owners of single-family homes and condos located in and around Vancouver seeing a 9-per-cent lift in their assessed values. In Vancouver, for example, the agency said a typical detached house is now assessed at $2,125,000 compared with $1,994,000 the summer before.
Further east in the Fraser Valley, where housing prices exploded in the earlier parts of the pandemic, houses saw their assessed values rise roughly 10 per cent and attached units – condos and townhomes – rose 15 per cent compared with the previous year.
On Vancouver Island, homeowners saw their properties rise in assessed value anywhere from 10 per cent to 20 per cent, the agency stated, with detached houses in the Okanagan region rising up to 15 per cent in value.
But, assessor Bryan Murao said these assessments are a snapshot of the local markets on July 1, 2022, when prices had already begun falling in many places after peaking before the Bank of Canada started raising interest rates.
The market momentum is now quite a bit different from last summer, Mr. Murao said, with an unpredictable stalemate developing in many markets between buyers wanting better deals and sellers stubbornly refusing to drop prices.
“If anything is surprising, it’s perhaps that it’s not deep into a buyer’s market,” said Mr. Murao, who has worked at the agency for more than 15 years.
Jesse Kleine, a realtor in Vancouver and its eastern suburbs, said these latest assessments will further confuse some sellers as to the true value of their homes.
For example, Mr. Kleine said, a three-bedroom rancher he was showing this week in Langley was first listed last July for $1.14-million. The owners have since dropped the price three times and are now asking $998,888. But, he said, their new assessment just pegged the value at $1.25-million.
In a normal market, an assessment might be off by up to $100,000 owing to not taking into account a house’s location on a busy street or the state of its interior, said Mr. Kleine, who has been selling real estate for six years.
But, now with the downturn taking shape in Metro Vancouver, he said these assessments “can easily be off by a quarter million.”
That is leading to some difficult conversations when an agent meets with a seller to discuss what price to list their unit at, said Mr. Kleine, who said he just sold a house in Abbotsford for $899,000 that was assessed for $1.05-million.
This widening gap between assessed values and what buyers are willing to pay for a home has largely hit the suburbs to the south and east of Vancouver, he said, but it could soon spread to Vancouver proper if interest rates remain high throughout this year.
Andy Yan, adjunct professor and director of Simon Fraser University’s City program, was struck by the largest assessment increases on the South Coast occurring in communities such as Pemberton, north of Whistler, and Sechelt on the Sunshine Coast. This, he said, still reflects the pandemic trend of white-collar workers moving further from city centres to work from homes with more space.
Penny Gurstein, director of the University of British Columbia’s Housing Research Collaborative, which studies ways to improve the affordability of real estate, said these assessments have not been a real indicator of a home’s market value in volatile Metro Vancouver “for a long long time.”
Instead, she said, these evaluations are mostly of use to municipal governments.
BC Assessment estimates values on behalf of B.C. municipalities, which use the data to determine how much homeowners will pay in property taxes. The agency could not provide the total value of real estate across the province, but last year these assessments totalled $2.44-trillion, an increase of nearly 22 per cent from the year prior.

Full text: PAYCHEQUE PROJECT Name, age: Nitya, 21 Annual income: $36,000 Debt: $0 Savings: $60,000 in savings account; $3,000 in TFSA What he does: student; intern at software firm Where he lives: Brampton, Ont.
Top financial concern: “I’d like to support my parents – they have 20 years to retirement.”
Most people don’t have $60,000 in their bank account after a four-year undergraduate program. But that’s exactly the situation Nitya, a software company intern and soon-to-be graduate in business administration, finds himself in.
“I wanted to be financially independent and I did not rely on my parents to fund my tuition,” says Nitya, who’s on track to graduate from a Toronto-area business school with a BBA in the spring.
He also relied on numerous scholarships and had paid internships at companies while he studied. During a bank internship this past summer, he worked 10to 12-hour days, earning a lot of overtime.
By not accruing student debt, Nitya, who lives at home rent-free, allowed his parents to buy a detached four-bedroom home – a major upgrade from their previous house. “We used to live in a semi-detached townhouse. We bought a detached house in a nicer community with a big backyard,” says Nitya. “My parents bought it because my education expenses were so low.”
When he graduates, he will join an investment firm as an analyst with a starting salary of $80,000. With that consistent, higher paycheque, he plans to dramatically increase the amount he is funnelling into his tax-free savings account. Right now, he’s investing $1,000 every six months.
While his TFSA funds are currently invested in dividend-paying stocks and exchange-traded funds, he would like to be more aggressive should equity prices fall further. He will also weigh joining his future employer’s group registered retirement savings plan.
In the meantime, Nitya hopes to buy a small car to help his younger sister get around. And he’d like to take his family on a trip to Europe before he starts his fulltime role next year.
He’s saving by cutting back on meals on campus, playing badminton at his local community centre and going on excursions near home.
In five or six years he’d like to buy real estate with friends. “I’d like to get an investment property in London or Cobourg,” he says. He’d also like to help his parents when they retire. “I’d like to support my parents – they have 20 years to retirement.”
This holiday season, Nitya planned to celebrate modestly. “I’m having a small Christmas with friends,” he says. “I’m cooking rather than going out.” Some details may be changed to protect the privacy of the person profiled. We want to thank him for sharing his story. Are you a millennial or Gen Z who would like to participate in a Paycheque Project? Send us an e-mail.

Full text: When real estate sales shifted online during the pandemic, Toronto-based agent Cailey Heaps and her team at Heaps Estrin found they were missing the face-to-face aspect of their very social jobs.
“Real estate has always been a business about people more than anything,” Heaps says. To help bring that personal element back, Heaps opened the Lobby, a concept shop dedicated to fostering community while connecting consumers with local design-based businesses. Built like a concierge service, the Lobby gives a brick-and-mortar presence to a selection of small Toronto businesses including TLine, Luxton and Mary Radcliffe Studio, with more joining in the coming months.
“We wanted to create a space for designers to showcase their work who don’t otherwise have that opportunity,” Heaps says.

Mini outdoor pantries offer more than food: For those struggling to afford basics, access to free essentials can help dispel shame around food insecurity

Full text: They perch on people’s front lawns, outside libraries, in parks and by duck ponds.
They’re colourful, crafted like tiny homes on stilts, or retrofitted from discarded newspaper boxes or kitchen cabinets.
Miniature pantries stocked with free food and essential toiletries dot neighbourhoods across the country, thanks to good Samaritans who build, maintain and replenish these boxes for the benefit of those struggling to afford the basics.
The mini pantry movement gained speed throughout the pandemic, when opportunities to volunteer grew slimmer during lockdowns. Now, as Canadians face record-high food inflation, neighbourhood pantries – and their philosophy of “take what you need, give what you can” – feel even more relevant.
Some 5.8 million Canadians – or 15.9 per cent of the country – worried about running out of food, bought fewer groceries or missed meals last year, according to Statistics Canada. Food-bank visits were up 35 per cent this past March from prepandemic levels, according to a Food Banks Canada report. Food costs are set to rise by another 5 per cent to 7 per cent in 2023, according to Canada’s Food Price Report.
While little pantries aren’t meant to solve the root causes of hunger – inadequate wages and a lack of affordable housing among them – they aim to dispel shame around poverty and build trust in communities. Operating independently of one another, pantry stewards keep their boxes stocked with the help of neighbours, passersby and local business owners, who contribute goods, too. Speaking with The Globe and Mail, pantry keepers across Canada shared what they’ve learned about their neighbourhoods through this type of giving.
The robin’s egg blue “pantry of hope” sits in a park in Nobleford, a town of just over 1,400 in Alberta. It was dreamt up by kids 11 to 13 years old this past spring as they grew worried about hunger in their community.
“When it was first built, they would come to programming and be like, ‘We built that!’ or, ‘That’s our pantry!’ They’re really invested in the project,” said Kaitlynn Weaver, outreach services supervisor at Family & Community Support Services, which runs a youth program where the children hatched their idea.
In June, they ran a food drive for their pantry, going door to door dropping off empty bags to be filled with goods. What they collected is now stored at a local community centre; the kids ferry supplies to their little blue box in a wagon.
The pantry’s central location is key. The nearest food bank is 25 minutes away in the rural community, the distance proving a challenge for some struggling with gas prices and those without a car, Ms. Weaver said.
Townspeople were aghast when the pantry fell victim to vandalism during its first days in the park. Someone had torn the door off, taken out a donated tube of toothpaste and smeared the box with minty goo.
“The entire town was up in arms over it,” said Joseph Hutter, Nobleford’s chief administrative officer, who helped get the project into the park. “It was like someone got personally attacked.”
Locals quickly repaired the pantry, which has remained intact since. “It’s part of the community now,” Mr. Hutter said. “It reminds people to be more compassionate and neighbourly.”
As lockdowns brought life to a standstill in Winnipeg in the winter of 2020, Marlies Roziere noticed the way a tiny free library outside her neighbour’s house became a “community booster.”
Feeling motivated, the retired elementary schoolteacher organized two free food pantries in the fall of 2021. Friends built the boxes for her and placed them outside a couple of local churches in areas of need, and close to bus routes.
One pantry sits outside Winnipeg’s Big Red Church, where Ms. Roziere is a community member.
Church staff take a moment during Sunday services to gently remind parishioners to donate goods. With grocery prices still painfully high, the pantry is emptied quickly. “There is nothing that doesn’t move,” said Ms. Roziere, who helps refill this particular box every week or two.
She thinks the pantry movement offers dignity. “It doesn’t instill shame. You can just walk by there and grab something. You can even go at night.” She added: “I like this grassroots thing. I’m not a big huge organizer.”
On summer nights, she might leave bananas. For winter’s frigid blast, she puts out coffee, tea, macaroni and hot dogs: “They can take the freezing.” At Christmas, she likes setting out cake and biscuit mixes, including eggs and oil, measured out for specific recipes.
She watched one day as a woman placed something bulky into the pantry and walked away.
“I looked in the box and she had put a loaf of freshly baked bread in there. Maybe she didn’t have tons herself but she could make a loaf of bread.”
For her little pantry, Alana Tollenaar repurposed an abandoned box originally intended for real estate magazines. Shaped like a bright yellow house, it sits outside her bird feeding store in Spruce Grove, Alta.
Ms. Tollenaar spends between $200 and $300 a month to stock her pantry, nearly double what it cost before inflation set in. She offers customers store discounts in exchange for helping load up the pantry, which gets emptied nightly.
Ramen noodles, crackers and snack kits go fastest, as do soap and shampoo. Once a week, a neighbour brings leftover bread and buns from a bakery. Another neighbour practising her knitting skills donates all her hats and mittens.
Ms. Tollenaar studied food insecurity at the University of Alberta. She learned some Canadians without fixed addresses are denied access to food banks.
That’s when little free pantries came up as a small-scale way to help. “You don’t have to fill out any application to access them.
They’re available freely, all the time,” she said.
An elderly woman without a home stops by her pantry often.
“She doesn’t have any teeth so it’s hard for her to eat any kind of hard food. I put in pudding and apple sauce for her. The other one she loves is apple pie filling.”
Recently, a man came by to collect food for five people camping out nearby.
“People ask us all the time, ‘Well, what if someone comes and cleans out the whole pantry?’ ” Ms. Tollenaar said. ”My philosophy is, if someone needs all the stuff I put out, I’m glad it was there for them.”
Last summer, Rachel Buxton and her five-year-old son, Sullivan, dug an old kitchen cabinet out of someone’s trash, giving it a second life as a mini pantry in their Ottawa neighbourhood, which straddles wealth and poverty.
“With the pandemic, things really took a nosedive. People were really desperate in their need,” said Ms. Buxton, a professor in environmental sciences at Carleton University.
A community liaison made a list of items not readily found at local food banks. Ms. Buxton printed out the list on the pantry door to help guide would-be donors. It includes toiletries but also “fun things like cookies,” Ms. Buxton said. During a recent grocery run, Sullivan picked Oreos for the box.
Sitting out in the elements, the kitchen cabinet slowly rotted and caved in on itself. It’s now been replaced by a small garden shed, with more room for warm winter clothing donated by neighbours.
“We’re expanding,” Ms. Buxton said.
The family’s living-room window looks out onto the pantry.
People visit at night, their belongings carried in shopping carts.
“The people taking are very much in need,” Ms. Buxton said.
“What I’m hoping is that it makes people feel welcome, that they’re our neighbours and that we want to share what we have.”
Alexis Rudderham and her friends have persuaded legions of neighbours, grocers, farmers and restaurateurs in Sydney, N.S., to help keep one popular pantry full.
A café donated macaroni pot pies one week, lobster mac-andcheese pot pies another. This winter, local businesses will give $200 a week for one month, with seniors at local Rotary Clubs dispatched to grocery stores to stock the pantry with the funds.
The pantry in question appeared in town mere days into the pandemic, attached to a large, old maple tree near a community organization. Nobody knew who put it there; eventually it was revealed to be a quiet local contractor. A Facebook group sprung up to co-ordinate grocery errands, cleanups and fixes. The pantry has since been moved off the tree and refurbished with a fridge and red roof.
It needs constant maintenance, with critters, open and expired food, and frost-cracked bags of lentils to contend with – pulses go slowly. Salt, pepper, sugar and peanut butter go faster, as do toiletries and garbage bags.
One day, a member of the group found someone had “butchered open a can of soup,” eating it cold on the sidewalk. So they started stocking more readyto-eat foods. After Ms. Rudderham saw a child check the box after school, she started leaving mandarin oranges and granola bars.
“There’s never enough food,” Ms. Rudderham said, adding the need has risen sharply in recent months.
Throughout the effort, she has witnessed desperation up close.
Some people have taken items from the pantry and tried to return them to grocery stores for cash. The group contemplated locking up the box at night or asking people to register. But it felt antithetical to the little free pantry philosophy of anonymity, dignity and trust.
“You don’t have to disclose who you are, or your need. You don’t have to disclose anything,” Ms. Rudderham said. “You just walk up and open the door.”

Full text: Deepali Verma is nearing the end of her studies at Cape Breton University. She has taken just one class on campus.
Instead of going to lecture halls, she and hundreds of her peers in the university’s post-baccalaureate diploma programs have attended classes at a Cineplex movie theatre, before nightly showings of Top Gun: Maverick and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.
The university has increased its intake of foreign students – so much, and so quickly, that it has run out of space on campus. During the recent fall semester, 90 courses in the post-baccalaureate programs were held at Cineplex, compared with 56 on campus and 20 online. About 2,680 students were enrolled in those programs.
All but two were international students, and the vast majority – 86 per cent – came from India.
Ms. Verma, who is from New Delhi, is paying more than $27,000 in tuition and fees for her two-year education in business analytics. She isn’t pleased with the Cineplex arrangement. “I would say it’s disgusting,” she said.
That’s not the extent of students’ frustrations. Every day on social media, there are desperate pleas for housing in Sydney, N.S., a sleepy town of 31,000 that is trying to absorb a spike of newcomers caused by the university’s increased admissions. Quite often, incoming students days away from arriving in Canada still don’t know where they’ll live. Others complain about a public transit system that is buckling under rapid growth in ridership.
And these troubles are not unique to this corner of the Maritimes. Across the country, postsecondary schools have dramatically ramped up their admissions of foreign students, creating knock-on effects for their communities.
This has led to accusations that colleges and universities are gorging on international student fees while turning a blind eye to local challenges. Some critics are saying schools need to be reined in.
“You’re getting a lot of localized stresses that come from the fact that institutions don’t seem to care where their students live,” said Alex Usher, president of Higher Education Strategy Associates, a consulting firm.
“They don’t care about the housing problems faced by the local community. They’re acting like bad neighbours.”
Colleges and universities control a major chunk of population growth. At the end of 2021, there were more than 620,000 study permit holders in Canada from abroad. Before the pandemic, which led to temporary border restrictions, their ranks jumped by 434,000 people over the course of a decade. That’s about the population of Halifax.
There is a simple explanation for the explosion: money.
Government funding of postsecondary schools has not increased in inflation-adjusted terms in nearly 15 years, while domestic enrolments have peaked, according to a recent report from Higher Education Strategy Associates. That has turned international students into a crucial, and expanding, source of revenue.
The average undergraduate tuition for international students at Canadian universities has nearly doubled over the past 15 years, after adjustments for inflation. Foreign students now pay five times more than their domestic peers; it used to be three times more.
“There is no sign yet that Canadian institutions are pricing themselves out of the market,” the report says.
It helps that colleges and universities are an integral part of the immigration pipeline. After graduation, foreign students can get multiyear work permits, which help them acquire Canadian job experience that is valuable in Canada’s points-based system for economic immigrants.
The eventual goal, for many students, is to gain permanent residency. And the federal government wants a lot more immigrants. Its goal is to admit 500,000 permanent residents annually by 2025. The country brought in slightly more than 400,000 last year. Around 150,000 of them had started their journeys in Canada as international students.
However, unlike the permanent residency program, there are no targets for study permit holders. Postsecondary schools can admit as many foreign students as they wish. Ontario colleges are notable for jacking up admissions numbers, Mr. Usher said.
“Can this be done better? Yes,” he said. “But it means actually not letting every institution decide for itself, whenever it wants to increase these numbers. It’s untenable.”
Around 21,000 beds will be added to student residences in the 24 largest domestic markets by 2025, according to a report from real estate consultants Cushman & Wakefield, published earlier this year. At recent rates of admissions growth, that would cover just a portion of the incoming wave of students.
This pushes more students into the private rental market, where they compete with other residents for a limited number of housing units in supply-starved cities.
“It’s not just international students having trouble finding housing. That has an effect on the local market,” Mr. Usher said.
“And it’s a tax that institutions are placing specifically on lowincome families in those communities.”
Ms. Verma moved from Sydney to Halifax in the fall semester, as part of a required co-op term. Now she can’t find a room back in Sydney. She may commute – a one-way drive of five hours or so – to her final two classes.
“There is literally no space out there. I can’t even express how we are feeling. It’s really terrible,” she said.
Gurwinder Singh, who has also taken the bulk of his recent classes at Cineplex, likens the situation to paying for an iPhone but getting a knock-off. “It just felt like discrimination against the international students,” he said.
Mr. Singh will be making the same journey as Ms. Verma for his final class. He is moving to Halifax with his wife, who can’t find a job in Sydney. He also hopes to find a job in Halifax, and wants to limit his time away.
“I’m not going to lose extra dollars” by staying overnight near the university, he said.
Sara Asalya, founder of the Newcomer Students’ Association, said “the burden of high tuition fees” is the number-one concern she hears about from international students. They often work multiple jobs to make ends meet.
The federal government is making it easier for them to work. This fall, it temporarily removed a limit on their job hours.
Now international students enrolled in full-time studies can work more than 20 hours a week off campus. The government has said the change will help employers, who have complained about a lack of workers.
“These government decisions are really coming at a time when the government is pressured to look at the labour shortage, more than looking at the actual experience of these students,” Ms. Asalya said.
“I don’t think we can continue to increase the intake, and lift the limit of hours, without building a proper infrastructure to support these students.”
Gordon MacInnis, Cape Breton University’s vice-president of finance and operations, said the school is dealing with a sudden rush of students, because many had to postpone their studies owing to pandemic-related border restrictions. The university had nearly 4,000 international students in the fall semester, an increase of roughly 1,600 (or 68 per cent) from the previous year, according to preliminary survey data from the Association of Atlantic Universities. Foreign students accounted for 72 per cent of CBU’s full-time enrolments, and their ranks have grown by more than 3,000 (or 343 per cent) in five years.
Even so, the fall spike caught the university off guard. “They all showed up more than we were anticipating,” Mr. MacInnis said. “This bubble will be with us for about two years,” he added, because foreign students are mostly enrolled in two-year programs.
Mr. MacInnis said CBU is not the first university to rent out movie theatres for lectures. It has spent money to retrofit those spaces for classes, he noted, and a shuttle bus will run between Cineplex and campus, starting in January.
Still, these are “stopgap measures,” he said. The goal is to invest in school infrastructure and eventually “repatriate” its staff and students to the main campus.
Starting in May, CBU will be limiting its intake of students in the post-baccalaureate programs to ease some of the pressures caused by the recent uptick in enrolments.
Nova Scotia recently announced it is investing $5-million in a CBU project to build hundreds of housing units in Sydney, although the development is years away from completion. In the interim, many students are feeling conflicted about their choice of university.
Ms. Verma was initially smitten with the school and Sydney, which was so peaceful compared to her native New Delhi.
But her recent struggles – in particular, with finding a home – have left a bitter taste.
“I won’t recommend anybody to come to CBU right now, because I don’t want people to suffer or go through the same things that we are going through,” she said. “It’s really hard here.”

Vancouver’s real estate outlook not so sunny for sellers: Inflation and interest rate hikes to put a chill on house and condo prices for 2023: experts

Full text: A year ago, the outlook for sellers of residential real estate in the Vancouver area was optimistic, with industry experts foreseeing a continued upward trajectory of home prices after a year of near recordsetting sales. The forecast for 2023 is not so cheerful.
Vancouver realtor Bryan Yan, who specializes in high-end properties, had predicted last year that prices for detached homes in 2022 would increase by 15 per cent and 10 per cent for condos. But there was a caveat. Those increases were dependent on the Bank of Canada holding interest rates in check, a move that would throw cold water on the market. He says his prediction held true until the spring, but then inflation and the bank’s big move on interest rates changed everything.
In March, the rate increases began with a 0.25-per-cent rise, and then the hikes came swift and strong – in total, seven overnight rate hikes. On Dec. 7, the bank raised its benchmark rate to 4.25 per cent, the highest level since early 2008. There remains a lot of uncertainty about whether there will be another rise in the new year.
The timing of the increases coincided with drops in MLS sales. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver cited a salesto-active-listings ratio in January, 2022, of 40.3 per cent. By October, the ratio had fallen to 19.3 per cent. Prices don’t really start to drop until the sales-to-active-listings ratio goes below 12 per cent, but experts say prices have already moderated slightly, depending on the area.
The B.C. Real Estate Association (BCREA) released statistics in mid-December that show a 50.8-per-cent drop in sales from November, 2021, province-wide. That drop is especially sharp because of the super-hot market a year ago. BCREA noted a 3.3-per-cent average price drop for Greater Vancouver, and a large 17-per-cent drop for the Fraser Valley. Chilliwack had the biggest drop at 18.6 per cent and Victoria prices fell 7.7 per cent. The average Multiple Listing Service price in B.C. had dropped 8.6 per cent compared with November, 2021.
BCREA chief economist Brendon Ogmundson noted the drastic change from this time last year, with mortgage rates that have more than doubled affecting sales.
Mr. Yan now predicts a 10-per-cent to 15-per-cent dip for overall home prices in the Lower Mainland in the year ahead.
He forecasts a condo price drop of 15 per cent to 20 per cent, and presales about the same. He attributes that partly owing to the federal government’s upcoming ban on non-Canadian real estate purchases, beginning in January. The prohibition prohibits foreign buying for two years.
“If you think about a ban on foreign buyers, prices will come down like crazy.”
Luxury real estate agent Faith Wilson said she’s heard people predict that prices will fall by as much as 25 per cent, but she thinks overall it will be far closer to 10 per cent.
“It’s going to be interesting,” she says.
“It feels like you are in a new world, and you are waiting for new data on how the market will play out. We had that interest rate hike and we may not get one in February, but that being said, it’s tougher for people to get mortgages. Prices will moderate down a bit.
“The thing I do know is we never know until we are in the market, and what other stresses there will be. COVID proved that.”
But these adjustments will only matter to those who want to sell, she adds.
“The ones that bought in the last couple of years aren’t caring too much. Once you are in the market, you don’t want to move.”
Marketer Bob Rennie’s team released a report in November that says a stagnant fall has set the region up for a slowdown not seen in a decade.
“We feel certain that our current market dynamics will prevail into early 2023, at the very least,” said the report, prepared by economist Ryan Berlin and analyst Ryan Wyse.
Based on MLS information, sales fell 36 per cent below the 10-year October average and 48 per cent below October, 2021.
Usually, the period between September and October sees an increase in sales, the report said.
Mr. Rennie cites a need for more housing that is in the mid-range, priced at under $1.5-million. If that still sounds unaffordable, he cautions that there is an intergenerational transfer of wealth that plays an increasing role in the market. He found that homeowners over age 55 own more than $300-billion of clear-title housing in the region. Sixteen years ago, they owned $66-billion. Their millennial and Gen X children will inherit that purchasing power, which will put pressure on the lower end of the market.
“Nobody pays attention to the fact that 80 per cent of sales are under $1.5-million on the MLS. That’s where everybody is buying. We talk about how we’re the most expensive market and everything, but only 10 per cent of sales are over $2-million.
We have to create supply where the heavy demand is.”
He predicts that properties under $1.5million will only come down in price about 5 per cent, and high-end properties over $5-million about 10 per cent.
“The high end of the market isn’t threatened; anything over $5-million. And who gives a poop. It has nothing to do with local incomes.
“For 20 years we have tried to point out that we shouldn’t be talking about Ferraris when we are talking about Buicks.”
Another 2022 trend was the intense increase in rents, particularly for newer units.
Last year in the West End of Vancouver, Great West Life Realty Advisors ended up renting units in their new Chronicle rental building on Robson Street for much higher than the $4.95 a square foot they’d predicted. Mr. Rennie marketed the high-end apartment building and spoke at its launch party a year ago. At the party, he predicted rents could go to $6 a foot, and he was correct.
“GWL ended up achieving $5.72 per foot, so that was a financial home run,” Mr. Rennie says. “But now everybody building new supply, given interest rates and construction costs, has to achieve $5.50-plus per square foot. And at $6 in the upper half of the building, that is $3,000 a month for a 500-square-foot apartment. None of this is commensurate with local incomes.
“The problem is, we have never married jobs to housing. That’s single-handedly why head offices don’t move here, because of the cost and proximity of housing that matches incomes.”
Instead, local income earners will increasingly look to the region rather than the city, he said.

Full text: RESTAURANT BRANDS DOLLARAMA CAMPBELL SOUP LITHIUM PET VALU HOLDINGS INTERNATIONAL QSR - TSX DOL - TSX CPB - NYSE PET - TSX STAR It’s a perfect morning.
You’ve got your box of Timbiebs and your French Vanilla Biebs Brew. You’re rocking your official Tims Run windbreaker with an insulated pocket for your Tims breakfast sandwich, made with a freshly cracked Canadian egg. And you’ve already preordered lunch and dinner on the Tims mobile app: a Tims Loaded Wrap, followed by a Tims Loaded Bowl. But something isn’t right.
You’re spending all of your disposable income at Tim Hortons, but you’re getting nothing in return, except for a few lousy Tims Rewards points.
There’s only one solution: You need to invest in Restaurant Brands International. After trading sideways for the past couple of years, shares of the parent of Tim Hortons, Burger King and Popeyes finally served up some tasty returns as pandemic restrictions eased and customers returned to their daily routines. In the third quarter, Restaurant Brands’ global same-store sales jumped 9.1 per cent across the company’s three major chains, driven by higher customer traffic, price increases and double-digit growth in digital orders. This calls for a Candy Cane Iced Capp. JOHN HEINZL STAR When was the last time you ordered a tube of toothpaste online? What about AA batteries, deodorant or lightbulbs? Exactly, never. Which explains why, even as other bricks-and-mortar retailers are cowering in the face of Amazon.com, Dollarama is making bank. Folks who shop at Dollarama only care about two things: They want stuff cheap, and they want it now. Frequently, they emerge from the store with things they didn’t even know they needed: flameless LED candles; scented gel pens; artificial snow spray that creates that authentic wintry look you can only get from a can. All of these small items add up to some big sales. In its latest quarter ended Oct. 30, Dollarama’s sales leaped 14.9 per cent to $1.29-billion, driven by double-digit growth in same-store sales and the net addition of more than 60 stores in the past year. The retailer also hiked its fiscal 2023 samestore sales forecast to a range of 9.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent.
This Christmas, you can tell Dollarama investors by the snowy dollar signs in their windows. JH STAR On a cold winter day, nothing warms your soul like a hot bowl of soup. Feeling sick?
Open a can of soup. Lost your job? Soup. Mortgage in default?
More soup. Turns out soup is also a great antidote to market volatility. In a year that saw interest rates and inflation spike and tech stocks, real estate and crypto tumble, many consumer staples companies bucked the trend as shoppers continued filling their carts with basics such as breakfast cereals, prepared foods – and soup. Lots and lots of soup. In its latest quarter, Campbell Soup reported that sales and earnings both grew 15 per cent, helped by inflation-driven price increases, productivity improvements and new products. The company also increased its full-year 2023 sales and earnings guidance, citing strong demand and improved supply chains, all of which generated some delicious, soothing gains for investors. That’s what Campbell’s Soup is, mm mm … money. JH STAR One day, fossil fuels will be history and everything will be electric. We’ll all be zipping around in electric vehicles, flying in electric airplanes and watching electric cars race around the track. Not only will this make it easier to converse at NASCAR events, but it might just save the planet from burning and/or drowning everything in sight. But first, we need more lithium. Like, way more lithium. On average, the lithium-ion batteries found in EVs contain about 10 kilograms of the metal – thousands of times more lithium than in the battery of your smartphone.
By 2035, demand for lithium is expected to soar about sevenfold. Problem is, lithium isn’t cheap or easy to obtain. First, you have to conduct geological studies. Then you have to obtain mining permits and raise capital. Then you have to pull the stuff out of the ground and process it. All of this takes years, which explains why, as demand for electric vehicles surged, the price of lithium carbonate soared to a record high in November, having more than doubled during the year.
The future isn’t plastics, Ben.
It’s lithium. JH STAR When the pandemic started, dog breeders and animal shelters noticed a trend: People were adopting more puppies.
Now that those pandemic pooches have grown into mature dogs with adult appetites, pet stores are noticing another trend: Sales of dog food are up.
Could there possibly be a connection here? Yes, there could, which is why savvy investors have been gobbling up shares of Pet Valu like a hungry Rottweiler inhales Alpo. In the third quarter, Pet Valu’s revenue rocketed 21.9 per cent – exceeding 20 per cent for the third consecutive quarter – thanks to strong same-store sales growth, new store openings and acquisitions. The pet food and supplies retailer also hiked its full-year guidance for the third time this year. Putting a bow on the year, the stock was added to the S&P/TSX Composite Index in December.
In addition to the tailwind from the puppy boom, Pet Valu benefited from strong merchandising, attractive store presentation and a location strategy that stresses neighbourhood convenience. No wonder sales are going through the woof. JH ENERGY SECTOR XEG-TSX STAR As publicly traded entities, Canada’s big oil producers were obliged to report to their shareholders that they made obscene amounts of money this year. But for the love of God, please don’t tell anyone else about it. After spending years upsetting people by putting up very little in the way of profits, the oil patch is now upsetting people by doing the exact opposite. With billions in excess cash driven by a run in energy prices, and no mandate to spend that money on drilling and exploration, the oil patch quietly siphoned most of it back to shareholders. Meanwhile, the gap between fossil fuel’s critics and its supporters widened to canyonesque proportions. Last month, U.S. President Joe Biden said the industry was raking in “war profits” and proposed a windfall tax. That idea has been floated in Canada as well, which Alberta’s former energy minister Sonya Savage said would be considered an “extreme act of aggression.” Our only hope is for nuclear fusion to save us from this hopelessly divided debate by providing a limitless source of emission-free energy. We’re told commercialization is at least a decade away. C’mon science, let’s see a bit of hustle. Put the power of the sun and the stars in our homes ASAP. TIM SHUFELT HERSHEY HSY-NYSE STAR Here’s an idea for a Hershey marketing campaign: The shot opens on a family sitting in a bunker, safe for now from whatever carnage and pestilence have engulfed the world just above them. After a tough day of scavenging, they divide a single chocolate bar between them, each savouring a moment of quiet, simple indulgence. “There for you until the end,” the voiceover says, “which may not be far off.” Too dark? Much like chocolate itself, when it comes to chocolate sales, the darker the better. The pandemic touched off a boom in snack-food sales, with chocolate in particular seeing explosive demand in direct proportion to the health crisis.
In 2021, Hershey reported that chocolate sales were 40 per cent to 50 per cent higher in areas of the U.S. with the highest rates of COVID-19 infections. Then along came the biggest wave of inflation in half a century, and that seemed to work in Hershey’s favour, as well. “It is an affordable indulgence when consumers can’t afford a lot of other things,” CEO Michele Buck said in an earnings call last month. At this point it might be tempting for the company’s shareholders to dream of a world in which perennial hyperinflation, war and disease have people living on nothing but Hershey’s kisses and peanut butter cups. TS U.S. DOLLAR USD/CAD STAR The lost souls of the currency wars of yore must have been rolling in their graves. In their day, war was waged by competitive devaluation – that is, intentionally lowering the value of one’s currency so as to make your own goods cheaper on the global market. This year saw the opposite kind of campaign – countries around the world scrambled to keep pace with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate-hiking campaign.
They wanted to strengthen their currencies so as not to effectively import inflation, since commodities tend to be priced in soaring U.S. dollars. This dynamic was dubbed the “reverse currency war.” Then things reversed again, as central banks started to ease off monetary tightening over fear of crushing their economies, effectively letting their currencies weaken. It was enough to make you wonder whether the libertarians were right – perhaps we should cast the central bankers into the sea and return to the gold standard, where your exchange rate is fixed, and your money supply depends on how much of an arbitrary metal is dug out of the ground. TS LOBLAW L-TSX STAR When you need to consider a payment plan to buy a few heads of romaine lettuce, it’s natural to wonder if perhaps you’re being taken advantage of.
Millions of Canadians’ jaws dropped this year as they encountered a triple-digit bill at the checkout for a couple of bags of groceries. Critics of the grocery chains questioned whether they were using the inflationary backdrop to pad their profits. To which the companies essentially replied, “Nope,” and left it at that. The profiteering claims stem from the fact that Loblaw’s gross margins increased in each of the past six quarters, and are now sitting at record highs.
That’s a definitive sign that companywide prices have outpaced costs, and it’s one reason the stock was in the top 20 per cent of TSX performers this year.
Loblaw says that its margin gains have come from the beauty aisles rather than the produce section. Unfortunately, this is impossible to verify, as pharmacy and food profits are not split out in the company’s financial statements. Owning Loblaw shares this year would have gone a long way to easing grocery sticker shock, with the added option to plow dividend payments right into the household food budget.
Bam, you’ve got yourself a stock that pays lettuce dividends. TS LOCKHEED MARTIN LMT-NYSE STAR After Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, fund managers were faced with the question as to whether defence stocks deserve a place in the realm of sustainable investing.
Never mind that tanks and fighter jets tend to have a rather large carbon footprint, or that many defence companies will happily arm both sides of a conflict.
Might weapons that help preserve self-determination and national security, especially of an underdog in an unprovoked attack, be considered virtuous?
Talk about an all-time great corporate image makeover! These are proving to be boom times for the likes of Lockheed, the world’s largest defence company. The rekindling of old tensions in Europe has many countries revisiting their military budgets. The U.S. and its European allies, as well as Canada, are already spending billions to send weapons to Ukraine, like Lockheed’s Javelin anti-tank missiles.
NATO countries are dedicating new resources to protecting their borders. And the renewed nuclear threat emanating from Russia has helped propel defence stocks skyward, not unlike Lockheed’s Trident II D5 long-range submarine-launched nuclear missile system. So naturally, the company’s stock landed in some funds with terms like “ESG” and “social equity” in their names. Big Tobacco and for-profit prisons should be so lucky. TS
ALLIED PROPERTIES REIT AP.UN - TSX DOG Remember when offices shut down at the start of the pandemic, and people thought they’d be working from home for a month or two? And then a few months turned into a few years? Well, lots of folks still haven’t returned to the office full time, because – let’s be honest – working from home is the only way to grab a decent nap after watching the World Cup. The downside of the WFH trend is that it’s casting a chill over office owners such as Allied Properties Real Estate Investment Trust. Units of the REIT, which specializes in lowrise, urban office space for tech and creative businesses, have been trading at a discount of more than 40 per cent to Allied’s most recent net asset value estimate. This not only signals investors’ skepticism about the portfolio’s true value but also reflects the impact of higher interest rates. Allied, for its part, doesn’t seem too concerned. The REIT recently hiked its distribution, and it could raise buckets of cash by selling its data-centre properties in Toronto, which it recently put on the block. But for investors worried that working from home is here to stay, the REIT remains a show-me story. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going back to bed. JH WALT DISNEY DIS - NYSE DOG To outsiders, Walt Disney seems like a joyful place, with its theme parks, iconic cartoon characters and movies about princesses and superheroes. But for Disney employees and investors, the mood has been a lot more Grumpy than Happy.
Much of the ire was directed at Bob Chapek, who took over as chief executive from Bob Iger in February, 2020, just as the pandemic was bearing down on North America. Mr. Chapek’s tough management style and relentless focus on cost-cutting did not win him many friends inside the organization, and his decision to hike prices at Disney theme parks angered customers. Mr. Chapek also sparked a backlash from LGBTQ supporters inside and outside the company by initially failing to denounce legislation in Florida that prohibits teaching of gender identity and sexual orientation in early grades. The final straw was Disney’s dismal earnings report in November, which revealed that its streaming operations, including Disney+, lost nearly US$1.5-billion in its latest quarter – more than double the loss of a year earlier. Less than two weeks later, the board ousted Mr. Chapek and brought back none other than Mr. Iger. When it comes to Disney CEOs, it does seem to be a small world after all. JH BITCOIN DOG What if I told you there was an “investment” that is ridiculously volatile, produces no income and is largely unregulated? And what if this highly unstable investment, which was invented by a person, or persons, whose identity remains a mystery, played a central role in multiple frauds, financial collapses, ransomware attacks and other criminal activities?
Would you be interested? Well, for years plenty of folks – from small-time punters to major financial institutions – couldn’t cram enough bitcoin, ethereum and other make-believe money into their digital wallets. But the crypto crash of 2022 revealed – surprise! – that it had all been a giant speculative bubble. From the collapse of “stablecoin” terraUSD to the implosion of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital to the bankruptcy of crypto lender Celsius and Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire, cryptocurrencies and their blockchain cousins – NFTs – faced a colossal reckoning that wiped out an estimated US$2-trillion of wealth. With bitcoin plunging about 75 per cent from its November, 2021, record high of about US$69,000, even Canada’s most famous bitcoin booster, Pierre Poilievre, suddenly stopped his crypto cheerleading routine.
That shawarma he bought with bitcoin last March must have left a really bad aftertaste. JH SHOPIFY SHOP - TSX DOG Isn’t technology wonderful? It puts vast stores of information at our fingertips, allows us to meet virtually with people halfway around the world and prevents us from looking like fools when we try to parallel park. But for all the good technology does, it also has a nasty habit of burning a hole in investors’ wallets. In a year that saw tech stocks get crushed as interest rates and inflation both surged, few companies shredded more shareholder wealth than Shopify. It was, in some ways, an accident waiting to happen: After a massive run-up in its stock price, the e-commerce software darling entered 2022 with a price-to-earnings multiple of about 280, reflecting a delusional optimism normally seen only in Toronto Maple Leafs fans. But as pandemic restrictions eased and consumers returned to in-person shopping, Shopify’s revenue growth slowed. Year-over-year growth fell to 22 per cent by the third quarter of 2022, down from 46 per cent a year earlier and 96 per cent in the third quarter of 2020. For Shopify’s stock, the slowdown triggered a severe case of what analysts call “multiple compression,” and what investors refer to as “losing their shirts.” That’s okay. They can always order a new one online – Shopify could use the business. JH CANADA GOOSE HOLDINGS GOOS - TSX DOG If a goose flaps its wings in China, does it affect the weather in Canada? Maybe. But when people stop buying Canada Goose jackets in China, it definitely affects investors in North America. With China shutting malls and imposing lockdowns and travel restrictions under its recent zeroCOVID policy, Canada Goose’s pricey parkas weren’t exactly flying off the shelves this year.
Having already cut its fiscal 2022 revenue and earnings guidance in February, the company in November chopped its fiscal 2023 outlook, citing disruptions in China and global economic and political uncertainty. Predictably, Canada Goose’s stock came in for a hard landing. As the year drew to a close, the shares were down about 75 per cent from their 2018 high. “We remain confident in our brand strength and see a long runway ahead to drive profitable growth,” said Dani Reiss, Canada Goose’s chairman and CEO. But this wounded goose will have to start flapping its wings soon if it wants to get off the ground.
JH TESLA TSLA-NASDAQ DOG You know what Ford CEO Jim Farley did not do this year?
He did not personally buy an unrelated media company for US$44-billion, only to immediately gut the staff, float the possibility of bankruptcy, fire the board of directors, botch a subscription rollout that brought on a wave of accounts impersonating big brands, remove safeguards against misinformation and hate speech, suspend legitimate journalists and reinstate banned accounts, pick fights with advertisers, urge people to vote Republican, call for the prosecution of U.S. government medical adviser Anthony Fauci – before badly losing a poll on whether he should step down.
The fact that Tesla CEO Elon Musk, on the other hand, managed to pack all that into the past two months has left Tesla shareholders wondering who exactly is running that particular company. Last week, Ross Gerber, a long-time investor of Tesla tweeted: “There is nothing wrong at Tesla at all. Other than the CEO working at another company.” Ouch. Tesla’s stock is having its worst year on record, its share price down by 40 per cent just since the Twitter takeover closed in late October. For the record, over that time, Mr. Farley has stayed in his lane, tweeting pictures of classic cars and links to pickup-truck reviews. TS BAUSCH HEALTH BHC-TSE DOG It’s time we get to the bottom of the fabled curse of the Canadian stock market.
About once a decade, some rising star ascends to the very top of the TSX, having supplanted Royal Bank of Canada as the country’s largest publicly traded company. This reign is inevitably fleeting, as some sort of calamity soon befalls the new champion. The latest casualty is Shopify Inc., which has seen roughly $200-billion of its market value vanish in a little over a year. The hex started with Nortel Networks Corp., which accounted for more than one-third of the total value of the TSX in 2000 but was delisted and sold for parts before the end of the decade. Then there’s Bausch, which dominated the market under its previous incarnation as Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. before it too flamed out. Seven years later, the company’s reckoning is still happening. It was the single worst performer in the S&P/ TSX Composite Index this year, in large part because it lost a patent ruling over one of its key drugs. What’s happening to all these companies? The obvious explanation is that they were felled by some mixture of wanton growth, questionable acquisitions, and valuations in great excess to earnings power.
But is it not more likely that RBC is a malevolent puppet master orchestrating the demise of all who dare to challenge it? It’s at least a question for the bank’s next earnings call. TS BONDS DOG Since time immemorial, people have looked to bonds to be the silver lining in times of disquietude. Collapsing economy? At least your bond investments should hold up.
World seems to be falling apart? Comfort yourself in the bond market’s hearty embrace.
Nothing to eat for dinner? Let the steady returns of your bond portfolio nourish you. Then came 2022, which ushered in a trouncing of financial markets that came out of nowhere.
Who could have imagined that the stock market wouldn’t gain 30 per cent every year? Or that a non-fungible token of a bored ape might not be worth millions? Very well. Do your thing, bonds. But alas, here was the moment when the ancient compact between humanity and fixed income fell apart. As central bankers realized that inflation was not so much transitory as it was rampaging out of control, they applied a campaign of rate hikes that, up until this year, would have qualified as maniacal. This crushed bond prices on a scale that may have no precedent.
The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index was down as much as 16 per cent in October. In data going back a century, the next worst showing was an 8-per-cent decline in 1969, according to Vanguard Group data. So I hope you’re happy, 2022. You broke the bond market. TS LUMBER DOG You know you’ve officially arrived as an asset when they’re making memes about you. Last year, the lumber market went haywire, as explosive demand converged with supply constraints, and prices quadrupled to a record high.
The internet masses, already intoxicated by the success of questionable companies with poor prospects, a.k.a. meme stocks, took notice. “I saw a billionaire today,” read one lumber meme with a photo of a truck laden with two-byfours. Another had an image of a tiny plastic bag filled with sawdust, advertising grams of freshly shaved pine for $10. You get the idea. But lumber mania was short-lived. The sharp rise in interest rates this year has put the squeeze on the housing market, raising the cost of mortgages and cutting into demand for new homes. U.S.
home-builder sentiment, which drives the bulk of demand for lumber in North America, has declined for 12 consecutive months. Lumber has the dubious distinction of being the year’s worst-performing commodity. It’s not worthless, but it’s certainly no longer memeworthy. TS MOEX RUSSIA INDEX DOG Back in March, a Russian equities analyst appeared on local Moscow television and gave a toast to the stock market on the occasion of its apparent death. “Dear stock market, you were close to us, you were interesting, rest in peace dear comrade,” he said. This was clearly the influence of the Russia-haters in Western media.
The fine journalists at Russian state television tell the real story. In the early days of the very correct and well-balanced Russian military operation to liberate the people of Ukraine, the stock market was shut down for a well-needed rest.
After regaining its strength, the Moscow Exchange was triumphantly reopened by Vladimir Putin himself, who spent the morning ringing the opening bell with judo strikes. As Russian missiles were being welcomed by cheering masses across Ukraine, Russia’s stock market cleverly declined by 44 per cent, fooling the world into thinking it is weak. CNN will tell you this is a result of sanctions crippling our economy, of the collapse of the ruble, of local investors losing confidence, of financial isolation, of revelations of war crimes, of an unpopular military conscription, or of a fierce Ukrainian resistance. But do not listen to them. They are cannibals. Or maybe Nazis. TS

Full text: ARTS REPORTER BRAD WHEELER THE BUY: A vintage guitar that took more than 30 years to find, again In the early 1990s, I felt ready to buy a real electric guitar. (Not that I knew an EmMaj9 chord from an electrical cord.) Stepping into Toronto’s Ring Music, this thirtysomething kid met his candy shop.
What caught my eye most was a streaky-greenish hollow-body model that looked more like an art project than a musical instrument. It was Fender Coronado Wildwood from the late 1960s. The wood, I was told, came from trees injected with dye years before they were harvested. The uniqueness was appealing: I could barely play, but nobody else would have a guitar like mine. The $1,200 price was outside my budget, though. More than that, I felt I wasn’t ready for that level of guitar – it was above my station. I settled for another guitar and have regretted not buying that Coronado Wildwood ever since. Occasionally I’d scour the internet looking for one, but it’s a rare animal. Three years ago, when former Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour sold his at auction for US$100,000, I gave up the hunt.
An e-mail from a friend popped into my inbox not long ago. He had spotted a 1967 Wildwood for sale for $5,000 on the website of Folkway Music, in Waterloo, Ont. I called the store immediately and bought the guitar – an impulse purchase three decades in the making. It plays like a dream and looks as fantastic as I remembered.
Though it’s a luxury as far as toys go, it’s a real bargain when it comes to wiping out regret.
P.S. The guitar is currently in the shop for a minor repair. The luthier said it would take a couple of weeks. I can wait.
EDITOR DOMINI CLARK THE BUY: A point-and-shoot Nikon Coolpix P1000 that shoots the stars For most of my travels, my iPhone 14 does an incredible job capturing memories. But for two types of my favourite photography – wildlife and night sky – I need more oomph. I’ve found it in the Coolpix P1000, Nikon’s supertelephoto digital camera. The zoom is a whopping 3,000 mm. What does that mean in practice? On a recent trip to Antarctica, I captured beads of water on a penguin’s individual feathers from several metres away.
Surprisingly, it’s not a DLSR, but just a point-and-shoot, so there’s no changing lenses, which for me is one of the best parts. And while you can tinker with settings, you can also simply leave it in auto – or use one of the preset scene modes – and still produce stunning images. (It also records 4K video and time lapses in five different speeds.) A tripod is recommended for astrophotography, but the camera’s two-way stabilization system (vertical and horizontal) meant I was fine without one even when shooting swooping albatross from a moving ship. Finally, there’s no need to visit far-flung places to make the most of the P1000: I expect birders would delight in this no matter where they live.
Ditto for backyard astronomers.
EXECUTIVE EDITOR ANGELA PACIENZA THE BUY: A no-stress wardrobe makeover from stylist Charly Goss As summer turned to fall I realized the skinny jeans in my closet weren’t going to cut it as I headed back to the office. When the pandemic began, I wholeheartedly traded my work dresses for joggers. But after two years of leisure wear, I was ready to dress up again. Yet I felt lost as I attempted to rejoin the world of fashion. A trip to the mall only made me feel even more out of touch and, frankly, old.
How wide are the pants supposed to be? How short? Tuck or untuck the shirt? Instead of feeling chic, the new baggy styles only made me feel like Munsch’s Paper Bag Princess. I felt like a frump.
Enter Charly Goss. Her highly instructive Instagram account and style guides got me back on track. Goss has a snarky, tell-it-like-it-is, no apologies tone to her advice. “Don’t hate me because skinny jeans are out” is the vibe. She aims to help. And that she does! In addition to her Instagram, she sells fashion guides via her website, charlygoss.com, to lead us lost souls on how to dress for every occasion and season: “Autumn capsule” and “Cool mom” and “Fall work guide” to name a few.
The guides ($68 each or $78/ month for all the guides) come as downloadable PDFs, which directly link to (Canadian!) retailers. It was the perfect map to get me back on track. Armed with my personal stylist, I felt more comfortable and confident in my choices. So when Goss came out with holiday gift guides, I jumped. For $38 I had dozens of (again, Canadian) gift ideas for every type of person, from the cyclist and movie buff to teen boy and hockey mom.
ART DIRECTOR MING WONG THE BUY: Trek FX 1, the perfect entry-level ride to savour life’s every moment The pandemic turned me into a cyclist, and this was the year I upgraded from relying on bike shares to buying my own two-wheeler. I wanted something that could do it all – commutes to the office, longer weekend rides out of the city – without spending thousands. After testing out a few at local shops and comparing specs online, I landed on Trek’s FX 1, the entrylevel model from their hybrid line. It’s nothing elite – it has a basic range of gears and comes in a modest silver colour, but if you’re like me and have only ridden on those clunky bikes shares, having something lightweight that you never have to return to a dock is a gamechanger.
Having moved back home to Vancouver after living and picking up my biking habit in Toronto, my new bike has given me new life in my old city.
My phone is full of dreamy sunset pics from rides on the False Creek Seawall and the Stanley Park loop, both firsts for me despite growing up here. Maybe it’s endorphins, maybe it’s nostalgia for summer – but scrolling through those photos reminds me how freeing it is to get out of my apartment (and my head) and just ride.
REAL ESTATE REPORTER CAROLYN IRELAND THE BUY: A smart and camera-friendly travel backpack that’s high on function Adventurous photographers need a way to smoothly transport gear so they can focus on capturing images.
Peak Design founder Peter Dering discovered that tenet when he lugged a nice camera on a trip around the world. On his return, he launched a Kickstarter campaign, which led to some incredibly well thought out solutions for carrying cameras, video equipment and drones. After researching bags for an Arctic expedition, I went with a black Peak Design Travel Backpack in the 30L size for $299.95. The medium camera cube insert for $89.95 comes with innovative origami-style dividers for seemingly endless permutations.
The beauty is in the versatility: Remove the camera cube and the ultralight bag is a squishable, expandable backpack for travel or everyday use.
The creatives who designed the bag added a padded compartment for a laptop or tablet, and access to essentials like sunglasses, passport and water bottle. There are also thoughtful details such as magnetic closures, theft-deterrent pulls and clips that hold the cube snugly in place. The backpack straps slide away to create a sleek package. The build quality is excellent, with burly zippers and a weather-resistant shell. Plus, the bag is fair trade certified, carbon neutral and guaranteed for life.
FEATURE WRITER IAN BROWN THE BUY: A KitchenAid stand mixer that has made sweet pavlova and memories One of the best presents I ever received was a KitchenAid stand mixer from, surprisingly, my mother-in-law.
I count the Christmas Joanne gave it to us, decades ago now, as the date of the first thawing of our mother-inlaw/son-in-law ice jam, the point at which she began to believe I wasn’t intending to break her daughter’s heart. You don’t give someone a 22pound, 325-watt, $245 (back then) stand mixer unless you figure they’ll stick around.
It’s a beautiful object. It always looks at home, no matter what style of kitchen we have had: antique (or at least kind of art deco) in a modern kitchen and sleekly contemporary in a countrified one. Its stout thickness declares its multifunctional competence: After I started using the KitchenAid I was never again daunted by a complicated procedure. I knew the mixer would a) make the recipe easier and b) make it take less time – impatience being the scourge of good cooking in particular and humanity in general. By now, after all these years, it is not so much a mixer as a kind of inanimate coach, urging me to try all the things I might have been afraid of.
The mixers come in a soothing range of colours (ours is all-purpose white); it’s quiet and easy to clean.
Best of all, it is utterly reliable, and always, always, always works. There are no odd-shaped batteries to dislodge and find and replace, no LED lights to mislead you: The mixer is either on or off. There is no in-between with this baby (though it does come with a balloon whisk, a paddle and a dough hook. I added a meat-grinding attachment, which I recently used to make meatballs). Our mixer has only five speeds. Five, it turns out, is all you need: The frightening blender-level “liquefy” is not an option. The first time I ever used it, I made meringue, which became a pavlova with lemon curd and raspberries and mint, which in turn became my daughter’s favourite dessert. It remains so to this day.
What better gift could you ask for?
EDITOR ADRIAN LEE THE BUY: EQ3 Marcel Lift bed, a milestone purchase made for adult-ing For nearly 15 years, across multiple homes, I slept on the same plywood
bed frame from IKEA – not out of any real devotion, I told myself, but because I didn’t want to have to spend money upgrading it. These beds are probably not meant to last that long, though, and about six years ago, the slats supporting the mattress started shifting off the frame, so that when I rolled to my left (and sometimes just randomly), the bed would become a sinkhole in the middle of the night. Still, I insisted all through my 20s and into my early 30s that it remained serviceable enough.
To my great shame, I kept insisting this even after my now-fiancée moved in, and she made an enormous ask of me: Please can we get a not-broken bed? But it was only collapsing on my side, I said, and I had a technique for contorting myself into bed just-so to avoid slat-slipping – so we’re good, right?
But I’m getting married next year; it is time to put away one’s childish things. So this summer, we bought the EQ3 Marcel Lift bed, which has serious storage underneath (crucial in our tiny condo), includes a solid-feeling lift-up mechanism, and is made of sturdier composite wood – and of course, I sprung for the deluxe reinforced slats. What a luxury, it turns out, to sleep on a bed that won’t sink in the night – and now, I can cling to this one past its expiry date, too! EDITOR CAORA McKENNA THE BUY: A Tiger non-stick rice cooker because rice deserves to be more than meh In my house growing up, rice was made in the microwave. It was mediocre. In adulthood, mediocrity followed me until recently. My miracle of a rice cooker came into my life when I was struggling to make healthy meals. It makes light, fluffy, perfectly crispy-on-the-bottom rice every time. I eyeball the water to rice ratio, get distracted and leave it for hours – the rice is still perfect. Plus, there’s a tray for steaming. I’ve steamed everything: sweet potatoes, carrots, kale, even pot stickers. With some butter and soy sauce, my healthy one-pot dinner is ready in less than 30 minutes.
REPORTER CARRIE TAIT THE BUY: A Dyson hairdryer, and the price is worth it when your hair stresses you out Five hundred dollars is a stupid amount of money for a hair dryer.
Who – WHO?! – would spend five hundred freaking dollars on a hair dryer?
I have long, thick hair – a burden, I swear. It takes forever to dry. Then I bought the Dyson Supersonic hair dryer. It ninja chopped my drying time, makes my hair all shiny and soft, and the styling lasts for days.
Touch it – touch my hair. See how soft and smooth it is? That’s the Dyson hair dryer. Want salon blowouts at home? Get the Dyson hair dryer. Flyaways? Dyson has an attachment for that. Curly hair? YouTube tells me the Dyson diffuser is amazing. And the thing is so lightweight and its matte finish feels like a mix of velvet and silk. Here, hold it. See? Amazing, isn’t it! It remains stupid expensive. I’m a bit embarrassed to admit my hair dryer costs about as much as a set of winter tires. But I’m a Dyson evangelical now. If you can afford it, buy it. It will change your life.
REPORTER PATRICK WHITE THE BUY: A bass guitar that added a heartbeat to dark days During the darkness of another COVID winter, a neighbourhood friend told me he was in a dad-band that needed a bassist. “I play bass,” I lied. I hadn’t touched a bass since the late 20th-century, when I’d botched The Lion Sleeps Tonight while accompanying our high-school choir, my first and last performance. I withheld that information. The pandemic made me sad, and regular dad-band jams in an unheated garage seemed like a possible antidote. But it raised a problem: I didn’t own a bass.
I hurried to the nearest guitar shop, Lil’ Demon, and bought the Model-T of bass guitars, a basic, allblack $225 Squier P-Bass. More than anything else I’ve blown money on this year, it has slain the gloom of modern times. Despite -20 C temperatures and my janky technique, that simple Squier stayed in tune as we jammed, laughed and shivered in that little garage, becoming tighter as a band and closer as friends. By fall we were playing laneway parties and even curriculum night at our kids’ school. When my clanky quarternotes are barely keeping up with the beat, my worries disappear. I could upgrade the Squier, but why mess with such good medicine?
COLUMNIST MARSHA LEDERMAN THE BUY: AirPods because it’s never too late to finally understand what all the fuss is about For years, I resisted. Why drop oodles of cash on AirPods when my (several pairs of) wired earbuds work perfectly well?
They will change your life, a friend advised, as I texted her from the electronics store, with a gift card burning a hole in my pocket.
I am a sucker for a life-changer.
The slow cooker, the air fryer – these are going to change our lives, I declare, justifying the purchase as I slap down my debit card. While each has been helpful, none can really claim that life-altering descriptor.
But those AirPods? Life-changing.
Actually.
These wireless wonders make listening far less cumbersome and ultimately more enjoyable. So I’m not just listening more, I’m doing more: walking, cleaning, organizing, gardening. When I’m tuned into something like the podcast SmartLess or Matthew Perry’s Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing audiobook, the time I spend tackling chores goes by quickly, and I have incentive to keep going. So more laundry gets folded, more dishes washed, more steps logged onto my Fitbit.
Sure I could listen at home on a speaker, but there’s something about the headphone experience that makes the content more powerful. I like having Jason Bateman crack jokes directly into my ear.
The AirPods are more motivation than anything else I’ve tried when it comes to housework or getting my steps in. Something to consider as we head into the New Year’s resolution zone.
EDITOR SARAH EFRON THE BUY: A stand-alone hammock that just needs a breeze and your free time After years of hammock envy, I finally found a solution. My small city backyard doesn’t have the ample space – or the sturdy trees – required for a traditional hammock setup.
Vivere, a Guelph, Ont.-based company, sells hammocks with compact stands that are simple and quick to set up – no tools or trees required.
The stand can be easily taken down if you need space for other activities and in the winter, you can store the parts in its carrying case. The result: backyard bliss. I now have a special spot to read and snooze and soak up the sun’s rays – it’s like being on vacation at home.(P.S. You can also shop for them at rona.ca and lowes.ca).
COLUMNIST CATHAL KELLY THE BUY: A dough scraper. For $10 or less, you’ll feel smarter in the kitchen You know that thing in cooking shows where the chef turns the edge of a blade and scoops a diced onion neatly into a pan? Yeah, you can’t do that. Diana Henry can. But not you.
What you do is drop a thousand onion bits onto the floor. You’ll be reunited with them years from now when you get around to cleaning under the oven.
What you need is a dough scraper.
Plastic miracles that allow you to move ingredients around a kitchen without crop-dusting the linoleum.
Three for 10 bucks, and a boon for the averagely hand-eye co-ordinated.
REPORTER DAVE McGINN THE BUY: LuggageHero, an app that lets you lighten your load while you’re on the road If you’ve ever been stuck dragging your luggage around – perhaps you’ve landed at your destination but can’t check in to your Airbnb for a few hours – know that there’s a way to unburden yourself. LuggageHero is an app that connects travelers to certified locations – shops, hotels etc. – where they can store their bags from an hour up to several days, with prices ranging from US$0.95 an hour to US$6.05 a day.
The service offers more than 800 storage locations in 125 cities around the world, so chances are you can find someplace to put your suitcase away safely and start enjoying your trip sans baggage.
EDITOR RAJESHNI NAIDU-GHELANI THE BUY: A Tesla. For this working mom of three, it’s made pick-ups, drop-offs and everything in between easier I can’t say I’ve ever really been into cars.
That changed this year. We bought a Telsa Model Y. Now I can’t imagine wanting to buy a fuel-driven car again. It wasn’t an obvious choice because of the upfront cost. And, one triggered by a series of events including having a third child and needing a car backseat big enough to hold a car seat, booster and comfortably fit the oldest child.
We also drive a lot.
The biggest benefit, of course, is the money we’ve saved on gas. I’ve started driving downtown twice a week to work and it’s a one-hour commute during rush hour. It costs me just more than $100 a month to charge my car at home, the same amount I spent filling premium gas in my SUV per week before inflation spiked.
Other perks: As an electric-vehicle driver, I’m allowed to drive alone in the carpool lane. That’s cut down how long I spend on the road and the time it takes to pick up three kids from two schools after work. Safety features and alerts like self-driving are invaluable for a tired mom of a toddler, who refuses to sleep through the night. Before self-driving, I used to have to leave the kids in the house alone while I moved the car out of the garage, because it’s parked against a wall and doesn’t allow me to buckle the youngest into his car seat. Thanks to the Tesla, I can back the car out onto the driveway from my phone while waiting with my kids on the porch and then buckle them in.
Needless to say, I talk about my car all the time now.

Full text: Shortly after Jordan Bitove and Paul Rivett bought the Toronto Star two years ago, they moved into an office at the newspaper’s headquarters that provided a view of Lake Ontario below. It had once been occupied by John Honderich, the bow-tied former editor and publisher, who died this year at age 75.
The newsroom was deserted owing to the pandemic, but Mr. Bitove and Mr. Rivett shared the space and installed two standing desks. The act was symbolic, intentional or not. Here stood two captains of a storied newspaper, charting a new course, shoulder to shoulder. At a virtual town hall, the company’s then vice-chair, David Peterson, couldn’t help but remark on it. “There aren’t many people who could be in the same office for four months and not fight,” he said.
Earlier this year, Mr. Rivett moved out. He decamped to the newsroom, visible for all to see peering over his standing desk, but alone. In retrospect, it was a sign that something wasn’t right between him and Mr. Bitove.
Almost nobody knew how bad it was until Mr. Rivett went to court this past September seeking to wind up NordStar Capital, the private-equity firm he started with Mr. Bitove, saying the two of them could no longer work together. News of the court application sparked weeks of anxiety at the Toronto Star and Metroland Media Group, which publishes more than 70 community newspapers, as employees stewed over who would ultimately take charge.
That question is now settled: Mr. Bitove took full control of parent company Torstar Corp. last month after a handful of mediation and arbitration sessions, and Mr. Rivett walked away. The more pressing matter is how exactly Mr. Bitove will ensure a profitable future for the Toronto Star and Metroland with a business model that has been upended.
Mr. Bitove declined an interview on these questions and others, but he sent a lengthy statement through communications firm Navigator Ltd. “In the last two years we’ve seen growth in market share, and in subscription revenue. … We’ve also made tough but necessary business decisions, like selling underutilized real estate, without harming our newsroom,” he said. “As a result, the Toronto Star is once again approaching profitability – a target we have set for this year.”
Left unsaid is whether that progress is because of – or in spite of – his partnership with Mr. Rivett. He, too, declined an interview but told The Globe that, “Integrity, kindness, loyalty and honesty are values that are integral to me, and those who know me well know that these guide my relationships and the way I do business.”
The original promise of their union was to combine two different skill sets to create something powerful and lead the Toronto Star into a new era. Mr. Rivett once described it as a case of “two plus two equals five.” He comes from the school of value investing, the idea of buying into unloved companies with the certainty of seeing potential where no else can. Mr. Bitove, meanwhile, is an extroverted and wellconnected scion with a marketing background whose family is known for audacious projects.
The two of them were going to turn the paper around (“fix it,” they said) by attracting digital subscribers and building new revenue streams, even quixotic ones, like launching an online casino and sportsbook.
What’s surprising is how quickly it fell apart. In many ways, they were like infatuated lovers who rushed into marriage.
They’d never worked together before – let alone in the news business – but formed an equal partnership that apparently lacked a shotgun clause, a common mechanism in such arrangements. The provision allows one partner to buy out the other, or be bought out themselves, when the relationship breaks down. Their brief stint as joint newspaper barons was rocked by turmoil not only between each other, but with employees, too. (The Globe and Mail spoke to 18 current and former employees, and has granted confidentiality to sources to speak candidly and preserve professional relationships.) In the end, the duo clashed on the most crucial of issues: where to cut costs, where to spend money and who to hire. Perhaps the only thing they’re likely to agree on these days is that it would be better if they’d never met.
There was a time when they were just a couple of dads who knew each other through their sons’ hockey teams. (Mr. Rivett has three kids, while Mr. Bitove has four.) Trained as a lawyer, the 55-year-old Mr. Rivett came up through the trenches of Bay Street, aided by a keen financial mind. He lives with his wife, who works in the mental-health field, and keeps a honeybee colony on their property. You’d have a hard time finding a picture of him before he purchased Torstar; he prefers to stay out of the spotlight.
That’s where Mr. Bitove thrives. At his wedding reception, he slipped away from guests and reappeared in a white polyester suit, cape and wig to ham it up. He and his wife, a former model who runs a clothing boutique, purchased a US$10.8million mansion in Florida this year, with palm trees drooping over the backyard pool. The 58year-old is a consummate networker, with a burbling font of emotion. Often during company town halls, he’d get choked up talking about the newspaper, and Mr. Rivett would have to continue.
Still, there was one thing they had in common: for much of their careers, their names had mostly been associated with someone else. Mr. Rivett worked for 17 years at Fairfax Financial Holdings, most recently as president, with founder Prem Watsa, the famed value investor often likened to Warren Buffett. Mr. Bitove, meanwhile, is the youngest of five siblings in a celebrated (and occasionally maligned) business family. His older brother John brought the Toronto Raptors to the city in the 1990s; Jordan, meanwhile, founded an experiential marketing company that worked on Canada’s Walk of Fame and other events – not necessarily the kind of venture to make history. But buying the Toronto Star, which traces its roots to 1892 – that’s the kind of thing with Bitove written all over it.
Torstar, the parent company, had long been in financial decline, despite the quality of its journalism. Publicly traded shares peaked in 2004, only to crash 99 per cent by May, 2020.
Head count has shrunk at the Toronto Star, too, dropping from 610 unionized employees in 2009 to 178 as of September, 2022, according to Unifor. Part of the damage was self-inflicted, such as spending tens of millions on a failed tablet app. More fundamentally, though, the company couldn’t escape the forces dragging down many traditional news outlets. Torstar gave away its content as the internet took off, Google and Facebook swallowed up the online ad market and print revenue dwindled. By the time the company realized it had to win over digital subscribers, it was way behind.
At the time, the company was controlled by a voting trust consisting of representatives of five families, each with a connection to the Toronto Star’s history. By August, 2019, a year in which Torstar would lose $51.9-million and see revenue slide 12 per cent, the trust was ready to sell.
Mr. Bitove made an unsolicited bid in February, 2020, and met privately with Torstar chair John Honderich. He was bursting with infectious enthusiasm, Mr. Honderich wrote in a posthumous memoir published this year. Mr. Honderich gave him a copy of Humanity Above All, a history of the newspaper, and the next day, Mr. Bitove met with the seven members of the voting trust to make his pitch. He’d stayed up late reading the book, recited his favourite passages, and charmed them with an anecdote about delivering the Star as a kid. Repeatedly, he emphasized his commitment to the Atkinson Principles, a near-religious code guiding the progressive paper’s reporting.
“We thought he would be the person to take the Star forward and not implement the usual cutting to the bone that destroys a franchise,” said Campbell Harvey, a former trustee.
Mr. Rivett left Fairfax that same month but agreed to stay on as its point person on the Torstar sale. Fairfax, after all, was a large shareholder, with a roughly 40-per-cent stake in the company. By April, Mr. Rivett decided instead to partner with Mr. Bitove. Purchasing Torstar would be the completion of a deal neither he nor his old boss, Mr. Watsa, had been able to see through a few years earlier, when Fairfax attempted to buy Torstar. The two sides couldn’t agree on how much the company was worth, and talks stalled.
In August, Mr. Bitove and Mr. Rivett triumphed over a rival bid to close the deal, paying just $60-million. Torstar had nearly that much cash on its books and a large stake in VerticalScope Holdings Inc., a digital media company that operates web forums. (That stake would hit $180-million last year, when VerticalScope went public.)
As for Mr. Honderich, he felt he’d passed the newspaper into safe hands. “It was time for someone else to try,” he wrote.
Not everyone was as serene about the transfer of power, and the sale fuelled anxiety at the paper. Here was a Bay Street investor and a rich kid with no experience operating a news company, neither one known for their liberal leanings, who were borrowing tens of millions from Canso Investment Counsel, a major lender to National Post owner Postmedia Network Canada Corp., to complete the purchase.
Were they going to kill the Star’s progressive political bent? Fire everyone? Sell to Postmedia and then fire everyone?
The new owners tried to head off these concerns. “You can’t grow revenue on the back of cuts,” Mr. Rivett told the paper in an interview shortly after the deal was announced. They recruited David Peterson, the former Liberal Ontario premier (and long-time Bitove family friend) to serve as vice-chair and presented him as a bulwark against any right-wing pressure.
Internally, they built up goodwill. The Toronto Star’s internship program returned after it had been slashed to save money, and they hired reporters for the paper’s Ottawa bureau and longneglected business section.
Anyone who saw them witnessed a bromance in full bloom, two guys giddy at the prospect of an adventure. Neither proved to be a passive owner. Mr. Bitove took on the mantle of publisher with an almost theatrical approach. He proudly showed off a vintage Toronto Star sweater during a town hall and spoke of meeting with local leaders in communities where Metroland publishes, talking about how they’d impressed upon him the light journalism shines on issues such as the opioid crisis and homelessness.
In a documentary about the Star called Viral News, which was filmed before the split, Mr. Bitove comes off as a man who believes he’s found his purpose in life. His children never really understood what he did for work, he says in the film, but that changed when he brought them to the Toronto Star. “The pride that they took in me being the publisher was incredibly powerful,” he says.
Mr. Rivett, meanwhile, initially viewed the company as a “big fixer-upper” and took longer to appreciate what a newspaper could do. The moment came during the first year of the pandemic, as seniors died alone and neglected in long-term-care facilities. One Saturday morning, he wrote the first draft of a letter calling on elected officials to address the problem. The final version ran across the newspaper chain in January, 2021, signed by both owners. “This is when the light went on for me that this is more than just a turnaround,” he says in the documentary.
Off-camera, tensions were building. Wayne Parrish, Torstar’s senior-vice president of editorial, abruptly left the company in January, leaving employees to speculate about his departure.
Some of the details are contained in a $1.5-million lawsuit he filed against Torstar the following month. According to the statement of claim, Mr. Rivett allegedly dismissed him for cause but refused to tell him what exactly he’d done wrong. Mr. Parrish later received a letter from Torstar. “You have engaged in conduct and comment which has been disparaging of the leadership of the company,” it said, going on to accuse him of acting “in an insubordinate manner.”
Mr. Parrish, who declined to comment, claims he was let go as a cost-saving measure, and the allegation of cause was a pretext to avoid paying severance.
Torstar, in a statement of defence, alleged that he repeatedly mocked Mr. Rivett’s and Mr. Bitove’s leadership and journalistic knowledge to other employees, and “worked to establish himself as the ‘protector’ of journalistic integrity.” In a reply, Mr. Parrish said both owners interfered with the Toronto Star’s reporting to promote related businesses, according to a court filing. The allegations have not been tested in court.
Behind the mutual admiration the two owners projected, there was a more complex dynamic developing. In the beginning, Mr. Bitove tended to defer to his partner, perceiving him to be the more experienced operator. But
he started to assert himself, particularly as he believed Mr. Rivett made mistakes, according to two sources.
Torstar’s efforts to decide on a more powerful content management system (CMS), for example, were anything but straightforward. A CMS is the unglamorous but crucial software for writing, editing and publishing articles. Torstar considered Arc XP, owned by the Washington Post. Mr. Rivett, according to two people familiar with the discussions, balked at the cost and instead pursued a different solution in partnership with another company. His goal was to develop a platform that could be used by other publishers and develop a new revenue stream for Torstar. But after months of talks, it was clear the partner company couldn’t deliver.
More fundamental, however, were competing visions about where to invest and where to cut.
Some time after the sale, Torstar engaged in discussions with Postmedia about a potential combination with the company, according to two people familiar with the matter. A deal between the two newspaper publishers has long been rumoured in the industry, as it could potentially lead to significant cost savings.
But it’s also the kind of arrangement that fills some in the business with concern, particularly around how consolidation could affect resources and, ultimately, the quality of journalism.
The two sides, however, never came to an agreement. Mr. Rivett, concerned about Torstar’s cash holdings and burn rate, brought in a consultant early on who specialized in restructurings, insolvencies and troubled companies. The consultant’s role, according to four sources, was to find ways to cut costs, including in the Star’s newsroom.
At some point, proposals were made that would have resulted in a significant reduction in the newsroom headcount, according to two of the sources.
By the fall of 2021, Mr. Bitove was objecting to the consultant’s very presence and put a pause on his work, according to one source. He was also concerned about the costs associated with NordStar’s other ventures and refused to allow a tranche of funding to go ahead for the online casino division, which launched earlier this year. The divergence is apparent in the court application Mr. Rivett filed in September, where he notes that Mr. Bitove refused to carry out cost-cutting measures at the Toronto Star that had been agreed to, and changed his mind about funding NordStar’s earlystage ventures.
Hiring proved to be another major flashpoint between the two. Earlier this year, they set about filling the role of CEO and president of the Toronto Star. Mr. Rivett was enamoured of Marina Glogovac, a director on the VerticalScope board, where he is also chair. But Mr. Bitove was less impressed, according to three sources, and didn’t want to bring her in. Moreover, Mr. Rivett wanted her role to include editorial oversight, whereas Mr. Bitove did not. Ms. Glogovac had spent the past nine years as the head of CanadaHelps, a provider of fundraising technology to charities, and her last media job ended in 2004.
The company announced her appointment in April, 2022, citing her passion for journalism and technology background. But then the newsroom found her Twitter account.
Ms. Glogovac had written that she would never step foot in an establishment requiring vaccine passports (“Did the living in a communist country thing, thank you”) and later warned that the public health measure was part of a “psychological phenomenon that enabled all totalitarian regimes.” In another tweet from July, 2021, she suggested that Pfizer was influencing Ontario government policy. “We are witnessing a policy and government capture by a massive corrupt drone corporation,” she wrote.
“Dig deeper folks.” (Ms. Glogovac did not respond to requests to comment.)
This, to some, was heresy. A letter to management was hammered out and signed by around 80 employees. “The personal views expressed by Ms. Glogovac about vaccines and mandates directly oppose not only the stance this paper has publicly taken but also our science-based approach to covering the pandemic,” the letter read. “They are also bad for business, undermining the Star’s brand.”
The signatories weren’t satisfied that Ms. Glogovac had later said the tweets were “hasty and ill-considered,” and the letter asked for written assurance that her views would not affect editorial coverage. But even that might not be enough: “The idea that the CEO of a news organization … can be a purveyor of and believer in outright misinformation – and even conspiracy theories – is a dangerous one.”
Ms. Glogovac’s official start date was in June, and a virtual town hall was convened for the owners to address the controversy. Mr. Rivett acknowledged that some people were upset by the tweets but held firm on hiring her. Nobody had vetted her social media before she was appointed, an admission that irked some reporters who carefully monitor their own feeds. Mr. Bitove, meanwhile, looked upset.
Accounts differ slightly, but he delivered a meandering and bewildering soliloquy about the divisiveness of technology and social media, the negative effects on youth, and, eventually, shed tears. (Mr. Rivett offered a tepid backpat, one observer recalls.)
Anyone who witnessed the display could tell the two owners weren’t aligned. Mr. Bitove wanted to dismiss Ms. Glogovac before she joined, according to a person familiar with the matter, but a compromise of sorts was reached. She came aboard as planned, but only as president, not CEO, with no editorial component to her job. Mr. Bitove, though, did not allow her to move into the corner office occupied by Torstar’s former president and CEO.
When news broke in September that Mr. Rivett had filed a court application to dissolve NordStar and split its assets, employees at the Star were gobsmacked. Reporters, as is their instinct, got their hands on a copy of the application and pored over it to make sense of the surreal situation. The two men were “deadlocked,” they read, the relationship “irrevocably impaired.”
The feud was only briefly in the public eye. Both sides agreed to take it out of court and attempt private mediation to agree on who would get what. When that failed to produce an outcome, the dispute moved into arbitration. Broadly, the process was of the “cut and choose” variety, according to two people familiar with the discussions. Mr. Rivett divided NordStar’s assets into two groups and assigned each a value; Mr. Bitove then had to choose which bundle he wanted.
The two finally reached an agreement on Nov. 24. By then, the Toronto Star had moved from its headquarters of 51 years in a drab brown building at the foot of Yonge Street into a new, sleek space farther west. That day, Mr. Rivett was working in the newsroom at his standing desk when news broke that his former partner would take ownership of the Star and Metroland.
He later huddled in a glasswalled meeting room backed by two TV screens displaying large, roaring flames. Not long after, he left the building, and Mr. Bitove strolled in.
The deal was officially announced in a press release early that evening with a cordial tone masking the animosity between the two men. The change was effective immediately, and Mr. Bitove wasted no time: Neil Oliver, a long-time executive, was appointed CEO of Torstar. Ms. Glogovac, who some staff spoke highly of once she joined, was gone.
It’s not yet clear how all of NordStar’s assets have been divided, including the gaming operations and the company’s 37per-cent stake in VerticalScope.
(At its peak, Torstar’s holding was worth some $266-million, but has fallen to $40-million amid a rout for tech stocks.) Mr. Bitove has recently taken steps at Torstar that suggest he’s conserving cash to focus on the newspaper business. Torstar will be shutting down a subsidiary called Eyereturn Marketing by the end of January, and all 28 employees will be let go. (Spokesperson Bob Hepburn said the closure is due to “financial challenges” facing Eyereturn.)
Mr. Bitove has yet to detail publicly his plans for the Toronto Star and Metroland, but he gave some indication in November, during a panel discussion at the Isabel Bader Theatre in Toronto following the premiere of the Viral News documentary. He sat on one end of the stage, Mr. Rivett on the other, with three panelists between them. Boosting digital subscriptions was key, he said, noting the company had between 130,000 and 140,000 of them, up from nothing a few years ago. Building new audiences, even globally, was important, and he brought up the Star’s coverage of long-term-care facilities.
“Why shouldn’t that be something that, whether you’re in Stockholm or wherever, that you are embracing?” he said. He then took aim at Google and Facebook. “We’re battling the tech giants,” Mr. Bitove said. “We have to put some form of regulation on them, and we need to get our fair share of all the revenue that they take from us.” (Torstar has signed revenue agreements with Meta and Alphabet, as has The Globe.)
As he went on, it seemed like profit was almost secondary to him. Maintaining margins was “wonderful,” but he was eager to show he had higher goals in mind. “We have an obligation to protect the Atkinson Principles and to protect democracy,” Mr. Bitove said.
There has long been tension between those competing realities at the Toronto Star: profit versus principles. Mr. Honderich, a man whom Mr. Bitove admired, grappled with it, too. He at least had the good fortune to live through the glory years. Last month, Mr. Bitove turned up at the Toronto Reference Library for the launch of Mr. Honderich’s memoir. The night had an elegiac feel, not just because the man of the hour had passed away nine months earlier, but because on stage, a panel of current and former Star journalists spoke of an era of journalism that no longer exists, a time when budgets seemed endless.
The rueful air didn’t seem to bother Mr. Bitove. He stood at the back of the room, behind rows of onlookers, an inscrutable smile on his face. As the panel reminisced about past triumphs, he turned his back and drifted away to the reception area to mingle.

Full text: Corporate ownership of homes in Metro Vancouver increased by 14 per cent, according to new data provided by the Canadian Housing Statistics Program.
In 2018, corporations owned 36,475 residential properties in Metro Vancouver, and by 2020, they owned 41,400 homes in the region, according to Andy Yan, adjunct professor and director of Simon Fraser University’s city program. The data covers years 2018, 2019 and 2020, the first year of the pandemic.
Of those corporate owners, 83 per cent own only one or two properties, said Prof. Yan.
“Mom and pop owners have become Mom and Pop Inc.,” he said.
When a property is held as an asset owned by a company, there are tax benefits, which could explain the mom and pop corporate ownerships. However, other corporations own several hundred properties, including real estate investment trusts. The number of corporations that own more than 100 properties has increased 21 per cent over the three years.
The vast majority of properties corporately owned are condos.
But it appears corporations are now targeting condos in a lower price bracket. The average unit owned by a corporation in 2018 was valued at $706,000. In 2020, the average was $692,000.
“One has to wonder if corporate owners are now competing for a stock of housing that used to be a starter home for first-time homeowners,” Prof. Yan said.
Judging by the arrival of institutional investors to Metro Vancouver in recent years, the supply of rental housing is indeed a lucrative business. Large investors with deep pockets can afford to develop and hold large housing projects. While B.C. developers are highly skilled at delivering housing, there are critics who say they don’t have enough incentive to provide affordable housing, and that no amount of market-rate supply will bring down the price of housing without government intervention.
Ottawa housing consultant and adjunct professor Steve Pomeroy has made the case that Canadians have lost many affordable units of housing for every single new unit built or renovated.
Prof. Yan has made a similar argument, but he adds that some of those units have gone into shortterm rental. And BMO chief economist Douglas Porter penned a piece last spring called, “Could We PLEASE Stop With the Supply Myth?” He included a chart from the 2022 budget that showed Canada’s number of homes per 1,000 persons is keeping up to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development average in the U.S., Australia and the U.K.
And yet, few involved in policy decisions acknowledge the arguments, says professor Patrick Condon, the James Taylor Chair in landscape and liveable environments at the University of B.C.
Prof. Condon says housing supply has tripled in Vancouver since the 1960s, and yet it has become one of the most expensive cities in the world. He calls the market supply argument more ideological than fact-based.
“It defies logic to think that adding more supply is the solution to this problem. The solution as far as I can see must and can only be a large increase in the production of non-market housing.”
As for the increase in corporate ownership, he sees that as part of the inflow of global money, which helps drive the market.
“This corporate interest in our local real estate is just another version of what I call global capital flows, and sometimes that’s from our own Canadian citizens.
Sometimes it’s the grandmother from L.A. who puts money into one of these hedge funds that specializes in real estate. A lot of retirement money is wrapped up and sent to these hedge funds, where a substantial part, or the entire portfolio is in real estate, and the attraction of that to small investors is because they have successfully been able to guarantee returns of 10 per cent for quite a while now, and that’s the consequence of the increase in land values.”
Former planner and developer turned commentator, Arny Wise, recently wrote a post about the new premier’s housing supply act, which pushes development along by addressing “local barriers” to construction, such as zoning bylaws and approvals processes.
Mr. Eby’s plan is based on a theory that supply “magically” lowers housing prices, says Mr. Wise.
The focus, Mr. Wise argues, should be on the delivery of non-market housing and the limitation of big corporate money in residential real estate.
“If investors are a major portion of the demand, then the local residents are priced out of the market. And that’s what’s happening,” Mr. Wise says. “The issue is, what are the mechanisms from government to hold them to account?
“Because there is a large percentage of ownership by this investor class, they have no interest in moderating their profits or moderating their revenues, or their return on investment. So it is antithetical or the opposite to producing affordable housing.”
Businesses that seek to improve profit margins by raising rents are key stakeholders in the housing sector. According to the new federal housing advocate Marie-Josée Houle, REITs (real estate investment trusts) own about 30 per cent of purpose-built rentals in Canada.
So far, senior governments have focused largely on increasing supply in response to the housing crisis. Two reports released this year have given some initiatives created under the federal housing strategy a failing grade so far.
Last month, an auditor-general report revealed that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) hadn’t been keeping proper track of its targets for housing for low-income groups, in the five years since the national housing strategy had launched.
The Office of the Auditor-General found data were often incomplete or missing.
“They were only measuring output, like the number of units built – but not measuring outcomes, such as measuring whether the results led to specific vulnerable populations identified in the strategy,” said Sean MacLennan, performance audit director responsible for the audit.
He said it also wasn’t clear what agency was responsible for tracking the target to reduce homelessness by 50 per cent.
“During the course of our audit, CMHC took the position it was not directly accountable for the achievement of that target, and Infrastructure Canada was of the view that while they contributed to it, they were not solely responsible – which meant despite being a federally established target, there was minimal federal accountability for its achievement,” he said.
The majority of Canadians who are paying more than 30 per cent (defined as core housing need) are renters.
Another problem is the definition of affordability that is being used by the CMHC. While it’s the standard definition that housing should cost no more than 30 per cent of a household’s before-tax income, the CMHC is instead using the definition that affordable is 80 per cent of market rent for the surrounding area. They used the 80-per-cent definition for the co-investment fund, which is a program that provides capital to build new affordable housing. But by linking the definition to market rates, renters are at a disadvantage.
“What we found for the coinvestment fund … anything was considered affordable if it was less than 80 per cent of market rent.
And we found that for what was approved to date – units that had been constructed, or are under construction or agreements had been signed with builders or other levels of government – that on average, affordable units were coming out at about 63 per cent of market rent.
“And we found that even at 63 per cent of market rent that they were often unaffordable to lowincome households.
“By linking housing affordability to market rent [it means] that as market rents increase, if incomes don’t increase at the same pace, they become persistently more unaffordable over time.”
Mr. MacLennan said that they made it clear to the CMHC that using the 80-per-cent rule will “continue to produce housing that is unaffordable.”
The National Housing Council released a report in February that showed that new federally backed rental construction program was generating apartments whose median rents were far higher than existing rents. Only 3 per cent of the housing created was affordable to low income households, said the report.
Ann McAfee, a member of the National Housing Council, attributed the erosion of affordable stock to the federal government initiatives as well as the financial firms buying up existing apartment stock.
Private investors demolish and “up-price older rental stock,” said Prof. McAfee, former co-director of Vancouver’s planning department.

Let me ask you a question.
Why does Scrooge love Santa’s reindeer? Because every buck is dear to him. Groan. Okay, that’s a really bad dad joke, I know. This month, please don’t be like Scrooge. It’s time to be generous because the need is greater than ever.
According to The Giving Report 2022 – a survey published by CanadaHelps.org, the proportion of Canadians who have participated in giving to charity declined from 24.6 per cent in 2006 to 19 per cent in 2019 – even before the impact of the pandemic and the current economic uncertainty resulting from high inflation and increasing interest rates. Yet, charities fill an important need in our communities, with 22 per cent of Canadians expecting to rely on charities for basic necessities over the next six months, according to the survey.
So, here’s the challenge: If you have the means to give, please make it a priority this year. And if you’re one of the fortunate who have made a significant profit selling a major asset this year, like real estate or a business, for example, consider the difference you can make by committing to a larger gift than you might normally. Let me share an example of what this could look like.
THE STORY Warren (not his real name) sold a rental property this year. He purchased the property for $400,000 several years ago and sold it for $1-million, for a capital gain of $600,000. He’s expecting to pay taxes of $150,000 on his capital gain, assuming a marginal tax rate of 50 per cent and that one half of capital gains are taxable.
This will leave Warren with $850,000 ($1-million minus $150,000) after taxes. Given the large cash proceeds he received this year, Warren recognizes that he has an unusual opportunity to make a difference in his community while reducing his tax bill at the same time. So, he’s decided to make a donation to fully eliminate his taxes from the sale.
He’s going to do this by donating to a foundation that will, in turn, help various charities. If he donates $300,000 of the $1-million proceeds, he’ll be entitled to a donation tax credit worth about $150,000 which will eliminate all his taxes on the sale, so he’ll end up with $700,000 in his pocket after the donation.
As an aside, the exact tax savings from a donation will depend on your province of residence and income level, but Warren’s savings of 50 per cent are pretty typical for someone in the highest tax bracket anywhere in the country.
If we compare the no-donation and donation scenarios, he’ll have $150,000 ($850,000 minus $700,000) less in his pocket if he makes the donation, but he will also have added $300,000 to the foundation. Another way to think about it: The taxman is participating with Warren in the donation, covering half of the amount he chooses to donate. So, while the foundation ends up with $300,000, it costs Warren just $150,000.
Warren could simply donate his money directly to one or more registered charities this year. In his case, he hasn’t had a chance to think fully about which charities he wants to support. So, he has set up a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) at his local community foundation (you can use any public foundation that sets up DAFs; there’s still time to do this in 2022 if you act now).
A DAF looks and feels like his own private foundation in that he can donate before year-end, receive the donation receipt in 2022, then distribute funds from the DAF to specific charities soon – perhaps early in 2023 after he’s had the chance to think more about what causes are important to him, which charities help those causes, and how much each charity should receive.
THE ADD-ON Warren also decided to replace the capital that he’s giving to charity through a $300,000 life insurance policy that will eventually replenish the estate upon death. The insurance policy will be issued jointly on the lives of Warren and his wife (this is a cheaper way to buy insurance because the policy won’t pay out until both he and his wife have passed away).
Since the couple doesn’t want the cost of the insurance premiums to affect their cash flow, their insurance adviser has arranged for a bank to lend them the funds to cover the premiums each year.
When the second spouse dies the insurance will first pay off the loan at the bank, then $300,000 will be left over to replenish the estate. They’re also structuring this so that the interest costs and the net cost of pure insurance are deductible. While adding this insurance idea to the donation isn’t necessary, Warren sleeps better at night having done this. Speak to a tax pro and insurance adviser for more on this strategy.

At Canadian Apartment Properties Real Estate Investment Trust (CAPREIT), we are part of that solution. We provide rental homes for Canadians. However, we have a simple problem.
In the 2021 mandate letters, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked the ministers of housing and finance “to expand Canada’s housing supply” and “review and consider possible reforms to the tax treatment of REITs.”
These priorities are in conflict.
A REIT, like us, is essentially a form of mutual fund. Investors buy into REITs, and the resulting funds are used to build rental homes. Like shares in a publicly traded company, investors’ stakes in REITs earn dividends and go up and down with the market.
Despite representing just 3 per cent of the national rental housing market, REITs are important vehicles for efficiently allocating funds into housing development – building more homes.
By pursuing the review and possible tax reforms, the government is discouraging investment in REITS. That has unintentionally turned off the taps for REITs to build and expand housing supply, as the shadow of possible reforms has created market uncertainty. It’s exactly the opposite of what Canada needs right now.
And when that happens, our firms are also at risk of decapitalizing and becoming susceptible to potential takeovers by foreign and private equity players. Such privatization would mean losing a certain measure of public accountability. Private companies are not accountable to everyday shareholders, and their operational and financial details are not made public.
Such privatization would also mean another Canadian success story sold away.
REITs are no loophole. They were created in Canada in the 1990s to encourage investment in real estate by small retail investors. Many Canadians hold REIT units in their RRSPs. Unitholders in REITs receive distributions from the REIT and pay taxes on that income at their marginal tax rate, just like “mom and pop” landlords do. If they sell, they pay the applicable capital gains tax, just as if they owned a rental property outright.
According to a 2022 study by EY, the federal government receives approximately the same revenue from REIT owners as it would with a corporate model, and losing REITs might actually reduce government revenues.
And what about affordability for renters?
The majority of our apartments meet the CMHC’s definition of affordable, meaning rents are less than 30 per cent of local median renters’ household incomes. Pensions and private landlords, which dominate the market, have higher average rents than REITs. On average, privately owned condos rent for almost $1,000 more a month than purpose-built rental apartments.
And as speculative investments, these units are more likely to be sold and the tenants evicted.
Purpose-built rentals are more stable and affordable for tenants, and Canada needs to prioritize their construction. The best way to do so is through REITs.
To advance our goals, we formed an industry group this year, Canadian Rental Housing Providers for Affordable Housing.
This group comprises the five largest publicly traded residential REITs in Canada.
We also want to protect affordability – permanently – by selling affordable rentals to nonprofits, co-operatives and community land trusts. To do so, we’re proposing a national acquisition program to protect affordable homes at one-third to onehalf the price per unit of new construction. With just a billion dollars in upfront investment, the government could triple or quadruple its progress to date in securing permanently affordable homes. It’s a model with broad support across party lines.
We’re requesting the government expeditiously comfort the market by promising to not pursue a new tax treatment of REITs and by delaying no further its review of housing as an asset class.
We’re ready to work together, each doing our part, to meet the moment. We just need the government to make it clear that they want us here.

Full text: On the outskirts of the Nunavut hamlet of Arviat, past the polar bear alert signs and the packed-to-the-rafters schools and the community freezer full of caribou meat, lies a gravel pad on which an Inuit company is building something unprecedented.
The pad is the future site of a factory that will produce modular homes for a territory where the housing shortage is so acute that multigenerational families sometimes sleep in shifts on mattresses on the floor.
“We’re in dire need of housing,” said Joe Savikataaq Jr., the mayor of Arviat, a community of about 2,800 people on the western shore of Hudson Bay. “If housing could be solved, that would solve a lot of other issues – almost like a domino effect.”
Mr. Savikataaq Jr. is under no illusion that one factory can fix something as daunting as the housing crisis that underlies the poor mental and physical health of many Nunavummiut.
In his own community, the person at the top of the waiting list for a one-bedroom public-housing unit has been in the queue since 2007. Sixty per cent of Nunavut Inuit live in crowded housing.
But Arviat’s mayor and other supporters of the modular housing factory – which, when it opens, will be the only factory in Nunavut if you don’t count the fish and meat-processing plants – hope it will be a step toward building Arctic-worthy houses faster and perhaps cheaper than traditional methods.
They also see it as a training ground for Inuit tradespeople that could help Nunavut gradually reduce its reliance on construction workers who fly in from the south.
“As much as it’s bricks and mortar and it’s putting out a housing product,” David Kakuktinniq said of the factory, “it’s also building a work force.”
Mr. Kakuktinniq is the president and chief executive of Sakku Investments Corp., the for-profit arm of the Kivalliq Inuit Association, the landrights holder for Inuit in central Nunavut. Sakku is partnering with RG Solution, a Quebec modular housing maker, to build the $30-million, 42,000square-foot factory in Arviat.
Some 18,000 truckloads of gravel, hauled in from a nearby quarry, have already been laid on the marshy site, and a device called a thermosyphon has been installed to keep the ground frozen and stable all year round.
Construction of the factory is slated to start in the spring. If all goes as planned, the plant is expected to employ about 40 people – 15 of them Inuit apprentices in trades such as carpentry and plumbing – and produce 35 housing units a year when it opens in 2025. That may not sound like much in a territory where the government just announced a plan to build 3,000 new units by 2030, but it works out to about a third of the units that the Nunavut Housing Corporation (NHC) built across the territory in each of the past three years.
As a show of support for the project, Arviat’s municipal government bought two five-unit rowhouses, known in Nunavut as five-plexes, from RG Solution’s Quebec plant this year.
They’ll serve as living quarters for hamlet staff, freeing up public-housing units for others on the waiting list, according to Steve England, Arviat’s senior administrative officer.
The modules, complete with preinstalled interior doors and kitchen cupboards, were shipped to Arviat on a sealift in August. Wrapped in white plastic and pulled by tractor-trailers, they looked like “giant marshmallows” as they rolled through the community, Mr. England said.
The two-and three-bedroom units are expected to be move-in ready by December, with local assembly done by a work force that is 90 per cent Inuit.
That’s a sea change from minimum Inuit labour benchmarks in the range of 30 per cent for tenders issued by the Nunavut Housing Corporation, although the requirement varies depending on the nature of the project and where it’s being built.
“Contractors typically come in from the south, they set up here in the community and build. They do have some requirements on Inuit hiring content embedded in the contracts, but it’s nowhere near as high as we would like to see,” Mr. England said. “One of the reasons the hamlet mayor and council fell in love with the Sakku project is that it’s going to reverse that trend.”
Another reason is the prospect of a housing factory rising in a place where the need for housing couldn’t be plainer. Arviat has one of the highest birth rates in the country, and more than a third of the population is younger than 14.
The housing supply hasn’t begun to keep pace.
As of March, there were 289 individuals or families waiting for public housing in Arviat, according to NHC, second only to Iqaluit, the capital. By October, Arviat tenant relations officer Homer Obszarski counted 317 applicants on the list, excluding those looking to transfer to bigger units.
Tanya Sewoee, 40, is among those desperate to move.
She lives in a two-bedroom house with her husband, 10 of her children and two grandchildren.
Her oldest daughter, Pauline, 22, shares one room with 11-month-old Lisa, the baby Pauline adopted, in the customary Inuit way, from a younger sister.
Ms. Sewoee’s oldest son and three of his brothers share another room that is piled with mattresses
during the day. At night, they drag the extra mattresses into the living room, next to a couch with a missing cushion, for everyone else to sleep on.
“There’s 14 people living here. One emergency door,” Ms. Sewoee said as she sat at a table sewing a pair of mittens. Down the hall, a washing machine chugged away next to a mound of clothes taller than most of the children who darted in and out of the house.
“We need to have more rooms so we can live in peace.”
Pauline keeps baby Lisa in her arms because there’s nowhere safe to set her down at home. The young mother finds respite by taking part in an early years program run by Ilitaqsiniq, the Nunavut Literacy Society, which offers group gatherings and weekly home visits by other Inuit women who support young mothers and help them keep their babies healthy. Pauline prefers coming to Ilitaqsiniq’s bright and airy office for her weekly visits. “It’s nice and quiet here for my baby to calm down a bit and play with toys,” she said one day in October after taking part in a cooking class. Pauline and the other mothers left with a recipe and bag of ingredients for making shepherd’s pie.
Arviat’s overcrowded housing is a significant contributor to health and social struggles in the hamlet, including violence, addiction, suicide, respiratory illness and tuberculosis.
Arviat’s main family doctor, Carl Le Roux, said the housing crunch was one of the main reasons the hamlet suffered the first large outbreak of COVID-19 in the far north in November of 2020.
More than 300 people tested positive, two were admitted to hospital and one died. As the case count grew, outsiders accused Arviat residents of breaking the rules, said Mr. Savikataaq Jr., the mayor. But overcrowded housing made the rules impossible to follow.
“When you get someone with COVID, and they have to isolate in a two-bedroom with 17 people, how is that possible?” Arviat’s housing crisis is far from unique in Nunavut. There are just over 3,000 Nunavut individuals and families on the waiting list for public housing, according to NHC, and there is an overall shortage of about 4,000 units of all kinds across a territory that has just under 12,000 units now.
The reasons for the shortage are straightforward enough. The population is surging in a place where it’s difficult and expensive to build. Most construction materials must be shipped on annual sealifts to communities that aren’t connected to the outside world by roads. Construction seasons are short, with workers racing to close in buildings before the blizzards, -50 Celsius temperatures and near-perpetual darkness of winter set in. It usually takes 16 to 18 months, or two construction seasons, to complete a single-storey five-plex, the most common configuration for new social-housing units.
COVID-19 made everything worse. Construction ground to a halt during the worst of the pandemic, then supply chain disruptions, rising fuel prices and inflation prompted construction companies to submit eye-watering bids that forced NHC to postpone a slew of housing projects. Public procurement for the construction of a typical unit in a five-plex ballooned to an average of $923,447 in 2021-22 from $379,780 five years earlier.
“We just can’t afford to build at $1-million a unit,” said Eiryn Devereaux, the president and CEO of NHC. “We have to try to figure out ways to build more affordably.”
One way could be shipping prefabricated homes to Nunavut from elsewhere. But that idea is controversial. When, in 2019, the business arm of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association built a hotel in Iqaluit using block-style rooms imported from Shanghai, Lorne Kusugak, the territory’s then-minister of community and government services, warned there would be an “uproar” if the government bought modular homes from overseas.
“I assure you,” Mr. Kusugak told the legislative assembly at the time, “if this government built homes in China to bring to all the homeless people in Nunavut, everybody would be opposed because there are no Inuit building those houses.”
Mr. Kusugak is now Nunavut’s Minister of Finance and the minister in charge of NHC.
Given the political toxicity of importing buildings, Sakku isn’t the first to float building a modular home factory inside Nunavut. In a June, 2021, report on construction costs commissioned by NHC, the commercial real estate consultancy Colliers raised and then batted away the idea, declaring local prefabrication too complex and costly for a market as small (only about 40,000 people) and remote as Nunavut.
Guillaume Guida, the vice-president of Sakku, said his company and its Quebec partner have crunched the numbers and believe they can produce five-plexes for a price that is competitive with, or slightly cheaper, than the going rate for a unit in the north. That remains to be seen, said Mr. Devereaux of NHC, noting Sakku’s plans are preliminary, and construction of the factory has yet to begin.
In the end, the real advantage of a factory is likely to be that it puts a roof over the head of construction projects in the Arctic, eliminating weather delays and turning seasonal construction work into a year-round prospect in which multiyear apprenticeships for local Inuit make more sense.
“If we bring the factory to the north,” Mr. Guida said, “then we can do training in the proper environment, 12 months a year – a nine-to-five, standard job, where you don’t have to worry about temperature.”
Now seems as good a moment as any to try. Last month, Mr. Kusugak and Premier P.J. Akeeagok travelled to Rankin Inlet, a regional hub north of Arviat, to unveil Nunavut 3000, a plan to build 3,000 new housing units of different types by 2030.
The following week, Mr. Akeeagok and Aluki Kotierk, the president of Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the main Inuit organization for the territory, were in Ottawa pitching the plan to Prime Minster Justin Trudeau.
Back in Arviat, Mr. Savikataaq Jr. said he hopes the two modular five-plexes that the hamlet has already purchased will be a beacon for residents suffering in overcrowded homes. The factory plan, he said, should “give them hope that there’ll be more houses here that are locally built, that they could move into themselves and have a much better, healthier lifestyle.”

Complex apartment design aims to transform housing: Proposed building would have its structure made from engineered wood components that fit together like Lego

Full text: Right now, it’s a strip mall.
But the site at 1925 Victoria Park Ave. in suburban Toronto could soon give us a glimpse of the future of apartment living – and signal the start of a business that transforms the way housing is built.
These are the promises made by the architects PARTISANS about the development, which they are designing for a private real estate company. If it is realized, the 12-storey apartment building will have its structure made largely in a factory, from engineered wood components that fit together like high-tech Lego – and construction could begin as soon as next year.
“This is going to be the start of something big,” says Pooya Baktash, an architect and a partner at PARTISANS. Mr. Baktash and his colleagues are using the project to launch a new business called Serotiny. Working with the Austrian construction-tech startup CREE and a crowd of prominent local partners, they hope to develop a process to deliver many more buildings like this one.
Running north-south along Victoria Park, a major arterial road, the building would be structured in two linked pieces. The taller one will rise 12 storeys to the west; the shorter one, six storeys on the east side, bordering a neighbourhood of houses. The space in between will hold a sunlit courtyard on the second floor, with copses of trees standing atop a concrete base. The main floor will be for retail and a daycare.
From the second floor up, their design features the factory-built panels of engineered wood, which can be assembled quickly and precisely on the site. This approach dramatically reduces the emissions required for construction; wood is far less carbon-intensive than concrete. Through rigorous engineering, the developers and designers aim for the building to be extraordinarily well-insulated and energy-efficient. Their goal is to hit Tier 4 of Toronto’s Green Standard, making this the most energy-efficient multifamily building in the city. This is highly complex and very difficult.
But the clients are on board.
“The project is unusual,” admits Gabriel Diamond of Well Grounded Real Estate, the developers who are leading the project. “But this is a generational investment, one we’re very passionate about.”
Gabriel and his brother Jonathan are partners in the business, which was founded by their grandfather Harry Diamond in the 1950s.
Gathered in their office in midtown Toronto, the Diamonds are adamant that this building will be more than an interesting one-off.
Their investment thesis is that big apartments that provide a high quality of life will be desirable, especially to parents and kids, for many decades to come. “In Toronto, there’s a stigma around renting as a family,” Gabriel said.
“But there should be options. We believe that buildings like this, with larger units that allow for families, are very necessary.” Their architects are a young Toronto firm who don’t lack for ambition. But in this case, Mr. Baktash began with a nuts-and-bolts question. “I asked these guys, what’s your budget for this building for the next 30 years?” Mr. Baktash explains. “That’s becoming the norm in Europe: When you do a development, you do life-cycle costing. And that’s what we should do here.”
Real estate developers typically view construction and operating costs in isolation. The idea here is to see them holistically.
This leads to radically different design decisions. “In a condo, the developer wants to exit” – in other words, sell and walk away – “within five to seven years,” Mr. Baktash says. “The long term doesn’t matter to them.”
At 1925 Victoria Park, for instance, the building’s walls, windows and doors will be much better insulated than those in a typical condo. This costs more upfront, but pays off with lower bills in the long term. And it also reduces the carbon emissions of the building from operations well below those of a standard multifamily residential building, according to an analysis by consultants Focal Engineering.
The architects hope to demonstrate that such thinking is not only possible but profitable. On the latter point, they may have a challenge. The Diamond brothers admit that their business model is unusual. Building rental and using novel construction techniques reduces the financial return and increases the risk. But the Diamonds already own the land, and they are thinking long term. “We plan to be here for the next 50 to 100 years,” Gabriel said.
The building’s design makes other unusual choices. The apartments are organized along exterior corridors; you ascend in an elevator or staircase, then move along a covered outdoor passageway to an apartment’s front door.
Such “single-loaded” units have major advantages: The corridor space is less expensive to build, and it doesn’t need to be climatecontrolled, saving costs to the landlord. More importantly, it gives each apartment windows on two sides, providing natural light and cross-ventilation.
That idea is simple and logical – and already common in Europe.
But it’s very rare in North America and unfamiliar to most consumers here, which is why builders don’t generally do it. Jonathan says the family is ready to take that risk: After all, people who live in houses are used to putting their coats on in winter before going out the door. And, he explains, the covered corridors, draped with extensive plantings, add quality of life. “This design will provide a place where people will want to spend time.”
Here’s hoping. If completed, the building will be the most innovative the city has seen in a generation, combining novel construction techniques and thoughtful design into a building type – the apartment building – that will likely define Toronto’s future.

From streetcar garage to cultural hub: Planning begins to put transformation of old transit maintenance building in Toronto’s east end back on track

Full text: TORONTO Scale is a curious thing. When I lived in Scarborough’s Midland Park neighbourhood, a walk to Scarborough Town Centre – I think I did it twice in five years – felt fantastically far. Now, living on the Danforth, a walk to, say, the legendary Square Boy at Jones Avenue for souvlaki, or to Little India on Gerrard Street – both the same distance Scarborough Town Centre was from my house – presents itself as a pleasant opportunity to window shop and daydream.
Of course one need not be an urban scholar to understand why this is, but the psychology behind it can be applied to other things. For example, a building can be massive but, if it doesn’t present a friendly face to the street, pedestrians will ignore it.
Such is the case with the Toronto Transit Commission’s Danforth Carhouse and Garage (1915) at 1627/1675 Danforth Ave. Although the former streetcar maintenance complex is twice as large as the architecturally similar Wychwood Barns (1913) and situated on a major high street, passersby tune it out as they walk. It is fenced in, blank-faced and altogether architecturally estranged from the city. The Artscape Wychwood Barns, of course, despite hiding behind a long parkette fronting Christie Street, has been wildly successful since its 2008 transformation from TTC streetcar repair buildings into a cultural hub that contains artist’s live/work studios, gallery space, an event venue and a farmer’s market.
So, imagine my delight upon learning the City of Toronto has made it a priority to see something similar happen to the Danforth site.
It’s a long time coming, said former Toronto chief planner Paul Bedford. “Lots of ideas have been developed over the years from the community … the last 18 years … but nothing has happened to date.”
Mr. Bedford and a number of others, such as Mary Mowbray of Colliers International, Marcel Parsons of First Capital REIT, and urban planner Jonathan Tinney of SvN Architects and Planners, gathered virtually three weeks ago for a “Technical Assistance Panel” hosted by the Urban Land Institute. Really just a fancy name for brainstorming session, the panel was assembled in the spring at the request of the city’s real estate agency, CreateTO, with the goal of understanding what needs to take place in order to expedite the transformation of the 6,503-square-metre garage, which sits on more than two hectares of land.
The panel presented five action points. First, they felt the city should look at the immediate area – not just the subject site – as a “district” in order to “unlock potential funding sources.”
That could mean getting local businesses involved (there is a Shoppers Drug Mart across the street) or using nearby parkettes as umbilical sites. Hana Elmasry of arts organization Akin Collective suggested that organizations already in the area could benefit from the inclusion of rentable shared working or studio space and rentable rehearsal or performance space. “And we consider things like program rooms or even larger halls where we can [host] fairs for the businesses in that area, or markets from the 19 or 20 listed art organizations in the area,” she said.
Secondly, the city needs to allow increased density on the site; 750,000 square feet of market-rate housing, to be exact.
But, since the city has identified this as a “Housing Now” site – an initiative to build affordable housing on city-owned land – one-third of those units need to be priced or rented at much lower rates. If this creates a “funding gap,” says Mr. Tinney, then the development group needs to consider “what other opportunities are there within the city and other departments” or other levels of government that can plug the gap.
It will be a balancing act, since there is already a public library on site that needs to stay, and it’s possible a consolidated 54/55 Division police station will be located here as well. And the TTC still requires some administrative and storage space.
Third, the panel suggested the city “Just start!”: Get people to ‘notice’ the building by including it in Doors Open 2023, or take down the fence and have a farmer’s or arts market in the courtyard (a good portion of the building is set back from the Danforth). But will buying carrots make a difference? Yes, says Mr. Tinney: “Using it for some short-term uses now may allow for a community group to actually grow with the site … they come back after construction in the larger scale or the larger format. And so it’s starting to create a bit of an ecosystem.”
By doing this, the fourth point – testing circulation and ways into and out of the fortress-like buildings – will be achieved.
The fifth point might be the most obvious, but it’s also the most difficult: “Attract a creative, long-term developer and funding partner.” A developer that, I should add, has experience with mixed-use sites that include a great deal of creative retail, notfor-profits, and gathering spaces that won’t necessarily squeeze every dollar out of the site.
The thing is – and this is this idea of scale again – there is so much space available it should be a no-brainer. And I know, since CreateTO’s vice-president of development, Gabriella Sicheri, took me on a tour of the complex a few weeks ago. The 100-car surface parking lot is plenty big enough for new housing (including a high-rise facing onto Coxwell Avenue, and the repair barns are so very, very long (and post-free owing to their robust concrete frames) that almost anything can happen inside. Such as? Well how about: a circus school; glassblowing or sculpture school/workshops; paintball or escape room adventure; a vertical farm; an Indigenous longhouse for teaching; a U-fix-it auto repair school (the old trenches are still intact); roller derby; a roller rink; an indoor skateboard park; axe-throwing; and, of course, the more obvious uses such as artisanal retail and indie restaurants (and because floors are tough concrete, Ms. Sicheri envisions a brewpub with rows of gleaming kettles on display).
The other thing is, we’ve been down this road before. In 2019, an 83-page report by the design firm DTAH, ERA Architects and Stantec Consulting (and others) was released. It included feedback from all sorts of community groups, intense analysis and multiple options for development. And nothing happened.
So what makes this time different?
“We have a responsibility to deliver on it,” Ms. Sicheri said. “It is a Housing Now site, with a kind of accelerated time frame.
… I am very cognizant of the community wanting to see something even interim here.”

Full text: DONE DEAL 718A 3rd St., Canmore, Alta.
CANMORE Asking price: $925,000 (September, 2022) Selling price: $893,398 (October, 2022) Taxes: $3,354 (2022) Days on the market: 21 Listing agents: Christopher Vincent and Laura Wright, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada THE ACTION Near Canmore’s downtown core, this semi-detached house had eight on-site tours in addition to potential buyers taking online virtual tours over three weeks this fall. Near the end of October, a local resident made a low-ball bid. Subsequent negotiations raised the selling price to $893,398, a shave of $31,602 off the list price.
“We had one offer, but there were a couple buyers snooping around, looking for deals, so we did do some negotiating,” said agent Christopher Vincent.
“We just sold a tear down across the street for over $1.5-million, and we’re representing a builder on a new construction duplex across the street that we listed at $2.5-million per side. So this is on the more affordable side for that part of the community.”
WHAT THEY GOT This 43-year-old house offers 578 square feet of living space on one floor, plus another 502 square feet below, where three bedrooms are located.
New flooring was recently laid in most areas, like the living and dining rooms and updated finishes were installed in the kitchen and two bathrooms. There is an exit from the kitchen to a wide deck, yard, and garage on the 25by 130-foot lot.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s really rare to get something of that size of a house with a yard,” Mr. Vincent said.
“The big thing is also having a garage. People in Canmore don’t often park [cars] in their garages because it’s full of skis, bikes, and toys.”
The area is also packed with recreational outlets. “It’s in one of the most popular spots to be in town,” Mr. Vincent said.
“You’re walking distance to Main Street, where there are coffee shops, pubs and restaurants, but it still has a park-like feel in the community itself, and you’re two blocks to the river.”

Full text: REAL ESTATE REPORTER 4855 Chute Lake Rd.
KELOWN A , B.C .
Asking Price: $18.5-million Taxes: $15,348 (2022) Lot Size: 40 acres Agents: Richard Deacon with Engel & Volkers Okanagan THE BACKSTORY On the southern shore of Lake Okanagan is an unusual opportunity for a wellheeled oenophile: a 25-acre vineyard with space to expand.
It has been the home base for the Schlieth family since 1979, with two brothers – Ervin and Dan – sharing the land today. The family grows grapes for the valley’s famed Grey Monk Estate Winery and is literally next door to the Summerhill Estate (both award-winning vintners) but for wine-lover and listing agent Richard Deacon, the opportunity is to potentially start your own vintage.
“The zoning allows for somebody to put in a winery or ecotourism, so this is probably better suited to someone who’s going to build Kelowna’s next iconic winery,” Mr. Deacon said.
Over the years the family has added two family homes – as well as a farm worker living quarters and a log cabin – to the estate, and have switched uses for the land over time as well. The story the brothers tell starts with their parents and a dream.
“They came from a wine region in Germany, and it was their dream to own a vineyard,” said son Ervin Schlieth. His parents, Kurt and Verena, had grown up farming cattle in the Baden region in southern Germany close to the Swiss border. They emigrated to Canada in 1954 and his father worked in forestry and logging and in the early 1970s bought the Downie Street Sawmill in Revelstoke, B.C., which was sold in 1978. The couple were looking for a new venture when they drove past a vineyard in Kelowna. “There was a beautiful vineyard with a for sale sign. My mom was quite surprised, they didn’t realize this was a wine region,” Ervin said.
THE HOMES Ervin was 14 when his family moved to the vineyard with stunning views of Lake Okanagan. The land was planted with labrusca hybrids, typical of the period these hardy “fox grape” species were often made into table wines or fortified wines.
“It’s hard to describe, it was unbeatable … it was just paradise,” Ervin said. “There was an old farmhouse we lived in for a few years while my dad built his dream home: the Tudor-style house, with a traditional German interior [built in 1981].”
That house still stands today, remarkably intact. It’s a massive home, close to 7,000 square feet that marries traditional and 1980s contemporary finishes.
True to a forestry family, it’s filled with wood: the main floor central hall has a coffered ceiling and floating wood staircases that curve up to the second floor and down to the fully finished basement. The walls on this level are white stucco, the doors and trim all stained wood and brick accents are used in fireplaces and other structural elements, and the floors are either tile or hardwood.
Beams with decorative milling line the ceilings in the rooms off the central hall, and the kitchen has a carved wooden seating nook and built-in cabinets. There is a conventional oven and electric range, but also a wood-burning stove in the centre of the space for a homey cottage feel.
Off the kitchen is a dining room with corner windows offering the vista of the vineyard, the lake and the western shore beyond. Connected to the dining room is the main family room with wood-panelled ceiling, a huge fireplace and a walk-out to the wrap-around tiled patio that covers the back-half of the house. Back through the hallway is a main-floor bedroom with full six-piece bathroom next door.
The second floor is carpeted and has six bedrooms (and room for more). In the basement is a large tiled in-floor hot tub, with separate sauna room and shower adjacent, as well as a finished den and more storage space.
Mr. Deacon suggests it’s likely an operator might see value in converting this main house to an inn, or just removing it altogether to maximize the arable land.
The same goes for the second home on the site – a sprawling 4,000-square-foot ranch home – which was built in the late nineties for Ervin on the northern side of the property.
There is one other structure on the site worth considering: the barn was built in the 1920s and was apparently once used for drying tobacco and the loft area boasts an impressive amount of floor space with potential for weddings or other programming.
The vineyard is what sets the price point though, it’s worth far more than all the buildings on the land.
GRAPE EXPECTATIONS Initially the family had workers to manage the vineyard (the previous owner’s son stayed on to manage the operation for a number of years after the sale) and sold the grapes under contract to a local winery. Farming didn’t appeal much to the brothers then: Ervin became a pilot and eventually moved into the log cabin with his wife, and his brother, Dan, became a logger.
After 1988’s Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement was signed some of the trade protections for Canadian vineyards fell away and the family capitalized on a joint federal-provincial program offering up to $8,100 an acre to pull up “undesirable” local varieties in order to kickstart a switch to “vinifera” varieties used in fine wines.
But rather than diving back into wine, the family allowed the land to be leased to cattle farmers.
About 10 years passed before brother Dan, tired of the dangerous logging life, proposed restarting the vineyard with those high-end varieties.
“My brother planted five-acre blocks at a time,” said Ervin, initially planting pinot noir and gewurztraminer and later pinot gris; today there are 25 acres of vines on the 40-acre site. “My brother is a perfectionist: we’ll see a flag on the post, and he’ll say ‘That post is out of line by an inch’ … everything was done with such precision,” he said.
A few years into the process of renewing the vineyard one of their vine brokers mentioned a local wine legend just up the lake north of Kelowna was looking to buy.
“George Heiss from Grey Monk came out to the property, and he sat down and said ‘We’d like to buy your grapes and anything you grow on your land,’” Ervin said. They have remained an exclusive supplier ever since.
Both brothers have children, but in an echo of the past none of them appear to be interested in farming grapes. Three generations of Schlieths have lived here, so it’s bittersweet that it’s drawing to a close.
“[The children] are saddened by the fact we’re selling but we’re entering a new chapter of our lives here,” said Ervin. “We look forward to somebody carrying on the legacy. There’s no better location in the Okanagan.”

Developers turn to pop-ups to germinate street life: On Toronto’s Sheppard Avenue, a massive development is attempting to create a walking culture in a car-centric community

Full text: THE LISTING Filling in the retail spaces in the second largest masterplanned development in Toronto is a problem, or an opportunity, depending on how you look at it.
On a given day most people who come to the Concord Park Place real estate development in Toronto are there for some do-ityourself furniture or meatballs from the IKEA it shares space with.
Concord’s site is sandwiched between Highway 401, a six-lane stretch of Sheppard Avenue and tracts of single-family homes: it is the definition of a car-centric community.
This is true in spite of the nearby Bessarion subway station (long in the Hall of Shame as Toronto’s least-used subway stop) and despite the fact that Concord is going to add almost 5,000 apartments to the 45-acre site (formerly a Canadian Tire distribution centre) and pepper the landscape with as many as 20 towers by the time all is said and done. This level of density is practically unheard of in North York, and it presents an opportunity to create a walkable streetscape in a part of Toronto not known for having many. This is strip mall and Big Box retail country (as the nearby Canadian Tire and IKEA would attest).
That’s why Isaac Chan, vicepresident of sales and marketing at Concord Adex, an arm of the B.C.-based Concord Group, has spent much of 2022 experimenting to create a walkable high street by temporarily hosting a variety of retailers, cafés and community installations in a pop-up store location in one of its Park Place buildings across from recently finished Ethennonnhawahstihnen’ Park.
“We’ve had about eight in here,” said Mr. Chan, standing inside the most recent pop-up, a flower-shop/café called Olivia’s Garden. “Some of them said, ‘We just want to try for a weekend’ and then expanded to more weeks so that they can kind of feel out the community.”
Concord marketing specialist Tanya Kolacz found Olivia’s Garden on Instagram, and was drawn to the elegance of the offering: specialty pottery, minimalist design, coffees infused with edible flowers and unique floral arrangements while you wait.
The café opened during the pandemic in its sole location on Harbord Street in downtown Toronto, a tumultuous business environment that café manager Jason Korol says allowed the company to experiment with its unique caffeinated offerings.
“For example, we have a blue lavender drink and we grow the lavender [for the syrup],” he said, which is also harvested in spring, summer and fall to distill syrups from different stages of the plant’s life. “Depending on the season you come in it’s a slightly different flavour. So it’s the same song, but kind of like a different melody.”
One of the first pop-ups Concord hosted in July also married plants and coffee: connecting specialty roaster Terminal 3 (which plans to return to the popup soon) with plant retailer JOMO, which is an existing retail tenant in its City Place development. Over the summer and fall the pop-up site has hosted the Boxcar Social café, Courage Cookies, Hielito Bites (a purveyor of Mexican desserts) as well as art gallery installations and a physical pop-up of online function fashion retailer Stage 9 Secrets.
One thing many of these shops have in common is their permanent locations tend to be in walkable downtown neighbourhoods that grew up in a sometimes chaotic fashion over decades. A frequently referenced element of urbanist Jane Jacobs’s writing is the idea of the “sidewalk ballet” that makes up a lively streetscape: a mix of residents and visitors blending together throughout the day among a diversity of shops, services and eateries.
Transplanting the functional chaos of a mature streetscape to a new community remains an abiding challenge for planners.
In 2020, the City of Toronto released a 56-page document outlining all the elements of builtform it believed contributed to ground-level retail streetscapes.
Tellingly, many of the images it uses to illustrate good retail come from two-storey high streets such as Queen Street East and Greektown on the Danforth. The document offers advice on where to place signage and how to situate utilities and supporting columns for retail that sits at street level below a high-rise building, it does little to address the trickiest part of the equation: how to fill those spaces with retail that works.
As the city’s guidelines assert, build it right and, “the quality and diversity of retail tenants in the area will improve. Residents will have local and convenient access to goods, services and job opportunities. Lively active streetscapes will be created that invite people to gather in the public realm and make walking a more enjoyable experience.”
Toronto’s history of condo retail tends to be dominated either by risk-tolerant expansionist chains (everything from Shopper’s Drug Mart to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario), or services like dentistry and dry cleaning. Frankly, these kinds of retailers could be found in any place, but Mr. Chan is hoping to build a destination-worthy streetscape that is it’s own specific place.
As a society we’ve become used to the idea that on some big purchases you can try before you buy: we test drive cars, we have open houses, there’s even free samples at the supermarket. As Mr. Chan says, this is less common in the world of commercial leasing where a typical retailer might have to sign on for a five- or 10-year term. Pop-ups have become a way-station for retailers stuck between the decision to stick with what they have or to make a new a long-term commitment.
Concord’s pop-up destinations have also formed part of the tours and open houses for residential real estate brokers who are weighing dozens of preconstruction GTA condominium sites for clients, and sometimes themselves.
“One realtor was like, ‘Oh wow, there’s a new concept: I like that and I’m gonna talk to some of my clients,’ ” Mr. Chan said.
In the next few weeks Concord’s pop-up will be hosting a pet-friendly Santa Claus installation for condo dwellers looking for holiday pictures with the jolly fat man (the nearby mall Santas restrict pet pictures to an hour a day, apparently). It’s all part of the mix of turning a condo complex from a place to stay into a place to live.

Full text: From labour shortages to climate change, the commercial real estate industry continues to face key challenges as 2022 comes to a close. It’s never been more urgent to harness the power of the other half of the talent pool in traditionally male-dominated industries.
We spoke to three Canadian female powerhouses in commercial real estate about their successes, challenges and advice for the next generation of women.
MARION LARUE PRINCIPAL AND ARCHITECT, DIALOG Marion LaRue is an architect and principal at DIALOG’s Vancouver office. Her area of commercial real estate design expertise includes sports, recreation, public and institutional projects. Currently Ms. LaRue is working on student residences and dining commons for Simon Fraser University, the Vivo for Healthier Generations recreation centre in Calgary, a student housing facility for North Island College on Vancouver Island and an aquatics/ice arena addition in Edson, Alta. She is passionate about creating environments that inspire people to take ownership of their health and wellbeing.
What do you like about working in commercial real estate?
I get a great deal of gratification from the improvements the facilities make in people’s lives. I also find public-sector clients are fun to work with and they respect and value our expertise as designers. This field provides architects with a tremendous opportunity to be creative.
What are the biggest challenges and opportunities facing commercial real estate today?
Some of the most significant challenges include the exponentially rising cost of construction, lack of women in the work force, labour shortages impacting delivery schedules for both consultants and the construction trades, recession challenges exacerbated by interest rate hikes and increasing carbon emissions that continue to contribute to global warming.
To mitigate these challenges, we need to invest in new design and construction technologies. We need to invest in more affordable housing and daycare for families so more women continue to enter the labour force. We must also focus on repurposing existing infrastructure and limit new building wherever reasonably possible.
What opportunities and challenges do you see where you live?
Vancouver’s opportunities include harnessing the creativity of green building, research at local institutions such as UBC, and embracing vertical farming, given the tremendously high cost of land. Our challenges include growth limited by geography, rise in sea level and the ongoing tug of war to keep agricultural land supplying food to our communities.
Which projects are you most proud of?
My most career-defining project is the design and construction of the Richmond Olympic Oval for speedskating for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The facility is now the vibrant home of community recreation and sports in the City of Richmond, a successful example of a post-Olympics venue that is improving the health and well-being of all users; it was also one of the first projects to robustly engage the local First Nations in meaningfully contributing to its design.
What sacrifices have you had to make as a woman in a male-dominated industry?
I didn’t spend as much time with my children as I would have liked. At times I’ve had to manage my compensation expectations or even the expectations for the types of work. I’ve been careful with how I voice my opinion on some topics at times as it can be a judgmental industry. I’ve waited longer than some men for the same opportunities. Some of my male mentors have been incredibly supportive and provided me with opportunities along the way. But I didn’t have many female role models, which has driven me to focus on mentorship in my career.
What advice do you have for women who are pursuing a career in this industry? I would recommend that you ask for what you believe you are entitled to, with integrity. Take more risks earlier in your career and know the choices you make matter significantly down the road. Build relationships with as many men and women equally and be self-aware – it’s critically important.
PATRICIA PHILLIPS C EO O F P B A G R O U P O F CO M PA N I ES Patricia Phillips is the chief executive officer of the PBA Group of Companies, a fullspectrum real estate company based in Calgary, which owns and developed the city’s Dorian hotel. She has closed more than $1.5-billion in transactions in her role.
Before joining PBA Group, Ms. Phillips was the founder and CEO of three successful private oil and gas companies, served as an economist on trade policy development for the Tokyo Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Geneva, and worked on Wall Street as a financial analyst.
Why did you choose this line of work?
I’m immensely grateful to have had the privilege of growing up within a supportive family of business leaders. My father was a local real estate developer and his passion for creating community was extremely formative in my own development. The ability to collaborate and create opportunities speaks deeply to me; it was a natural progression into the hospitality industry, as it provides further opportunities to support the local economy while showcasing Calgary as a world leader in its own right.
What are the biggest challenges and opportunities facing commercial real estate today?
Moving into 2023, we realize supply chains will continue to be challenging; however, the PBA team and I are relying heavily on our local relationships to help cut down on wait times, while ensuring we support local vendors and suppliers whenever possible.
Which projects are you most proud of?
Our most recent development, The Dorian hotel, is the first to be built in Calgary’s downtown core in over a decade and the city’s only female-developed and owned hotel. Less than 2 per cent of hotels are owned and developed by women worldwide. It’s also the city’s only dual-brand lifestyle hotel, which allows us to target specific demand segments, and offer two unique price points with shared amenities.
What do you think needs to change to make the industry more accessible?
I strongly believe and advocate that our industry requires more diversity and inclusion. Unfortunately, for many years commercial real estate has been seen as a man’s world and a “boys’ club.” I’m hopeful this is currently changing. I’ll use PBA as a great example; we prominently feature females within our leadership team and board of directors.
What advice do you have for women pursuing a career in this industry?
Give yourself permission to follow your passions and trust your gut when you have a calling to do something interesting. We spend a lot of our youth living up to other people’s expectations, but in the end, we are the only ones who need to live with our choices. Never shy away from surrounding yourself with people smarter than yourself as this only improves your own skill set.
Being self-aware is key and finally, give back to your community any way you can.
DIANA HOANG M A N A G I N G D I R EC TO R / B R O K E R O F R ECOR D, O W N E R O F S P E A R R E A LT Y Diana Hoang is the founder and managing director of Spear Realty Inc., a commercial and industrial real estate brokerage based in Toronto. Ms. Hoang began her career in the industry in 2009 in a publicly traded company that allowed her to work with teams specializing in all facets of commercial real estate. Since starting her business in 2021, Ms. Hoang has led more than $500million in real estate transactions, including record-setting deals for leading landlord groups.
Why did you choose this line of work?
I’ve always had a passion for marketing and sales; I enjoy being practical, resolving issues and helping groups maximize their rate of return. About 13 years ago as I was raising my two young daughters, I found a position as an administrator with a large commercial real estate firm in Toronto.
Then I transitioned into a full-time nonlicensed assistant, got my licence and began as a fully licensed adviser in the industrial space.
What projects do you have on the go right now?
Expansion is top of mind to keep up with demand from existing and new clients who want that boutique level of client care and expertise. We’re looking at increasing our numbers of agents who specialize in various areas and asset classes. Within the span of one year, we grew to a team of 10 active associates and plan to expand further to 30 by 2023.
What kinds of sacrifices or concessions have you had to make as a woman in a maledominated industry?
The day does not stop at 5 p.m. I am still juggling schoolwork and family, managing kids’ extracurricular activities, sacrificing both my personal time and the time needed for career advancement, and working and taking conference calls even when on vacation with the family.
How are you doing business differently these days?
We’re proud to have an equal number of active female commercial agents at our office and plan to keep focusing on hiring, training and retaining more. Our mandate is to move towards 100-per-cent digital and paperless operations.
What advice do you have for women pursuing a career in this industry?
Be flexible, tolerant, always search for alternate solutions, and be creative to achieve your end goal. Perseverance will win the day – you should never take no for an answer.

Full text: Holiday shopping season has started and with ecommerce rates at record highs, companies are needing more places to store their goods.
Except there’s one problem: There’s no more space, so experts say it’s time to get creative with government land.
According to CBRE’s 2022 Canada Real Estate Market Outlook, “new construction will likely become the key avenue for occupiers looking for space,” and that’s happening with total industrial space under construction in Canada sitting at a record high of 36.2 million square feet at the end of 2021.
But in some key cities, there is no land left to build, so we need to rethink land usage, explains Chris MacCauley, executive vice-president of CBRE in Vancouver.
“[In Vancouver], nothing has improved for people who have been looking for warehouse space over the past three, four, five years,” Mr. MacCauley says. “We can’t change the geographical restraints that Vancouver has, but we’ve got regulatory restraints around land use – that we can change.”
To add to the pain, Canadian cities might start to lose out on jobs and economic growth, as companies – from startups to multinational corporations – skip over the cities that can’t accommodate their fulfilment needs.
But while there have been many sounding the alarm, experts say that few solutions will be found until local governments amend their industrial land regulations.
For years, Mr. MacCauley has been a significant voice in the call for more industrial space and the freeing up of farmland to fill this need – in particular, the Agricultural Land Reserve, which is 4.6 million hectares of land controlled by B.C.’s Agricultural Land Commission since the 1970s and kept for agricultural purposes. For him, this system is outdated and hurting many sectors, including agriculture, which he says also needs warehouse space for the production and processing of goods.
“A lot of our land is controlled by the provincial government,” he explains, “and it was [established] almost 50 years ago with no real science behind it. … That needs to be reviewed so that we can look at benefiting agricultural land as well as ways to expand existing industrial parks.”
However, he doesn’t see this happening until the area starts to experience “real economic pain” as a result of companies choosing places such as Alberta to set up their multinationals because of B.C.’s warehouse scarcity.
Michel Pilon, president and chief executive officer of Ottawaarea development company Avenue 31, agrees that using up government-regulated land is the way to solve Canada’s warehouse issues. In fact, his company is building the city’s latest industrial park, National Capital Business Park, on federal land.
“It’s National Capital Commission Land, so it’s federal land that we’ve leased on a long-term basis.
Now the project is well under way,” Mr. Pilon says, adding that the demand is already there from future tenants of the 1.3-millionsquare-foot industrial park who need the space. “The types of tenants that are coming to us [are] three-quarters nationals or multinationals, 25 per cent local or regional.”
Indeed, according to CBRE, new supply jumped to 9.1 million square feet of space in the third quarter of 2022, but provided little relief as almost 90 per cent of the new builds were delivered preleased.
“We’re getting phone calls daily,” Mr. Pilon adds.
It’s not just multinationals that will have to ignore areas that don’t have warehouse space. It is also needed by smaller businesses and without that option, some Canadian cities may see their entrepreneurial sector suffer.
“Everybody’s looking right now,” says Jordan Armstrong, senior vice-president at Paradigm Group Commercial Real Estate Services in Vancouver, which just completed a deal for a 38,000-foot warehouse space in the city’s Railtown neighbourhood for an international furniture manufacturer.
“But the people that are winning [bids] tend to be mid and large top companies.”
Because the current tight market conditions have managed to drive warehouse rents in Canada to a new record high of $12.89 per square foot, a 29.4-per-cent yearover-year increase, according to the CBRE, it’s getting even tougher for businesses of any size to afford them.
In places such as Vancouver, which has prided itself on entrepreneurial startups, this might just bring that idealism to its knees, Mr. Armstrong says, because landlords are going to go for the safe bet.
He adds that the situation is made tougher for these smaller companies because the city is currently experiencing a 25-per-cent year-over-year increase in rent for these warehouse spaces and it’s hurting startups.
“In Vancouver, we want this hub for startups and see a lot of industrial demand for the green economy businesses,” Mr. Armstrong says. “But when that type of tenant goes up against a tenant like Amazon or a large multinational, landlords are obviously going to err on the side of a larger corporation [rather than] on a startup, no matter what that startup’s financial situation looks like.”
While one common solution might be to “build up,” as many cities have done to ease residential housing pressure, it’s a lot more complicated in the industrial warehouse space.
But Mr. MacCauley reiterates that the need for more land is still at the centre of this issue and says that while building up to accommodate the growing need is possible, there are still many logistical issues to work out before this can be considered a widespread option.
Right now, Amazon has several multilevel warehouses in Canada and the U.S., but they are the only occupant of these spaces, Mr. MacCauley explains.
“I want to see a multilevel industrial [space] that’s worked in [other places in] North America that has multiple tenants and how they interact, operating on different floors,” he says. “That hasn’t been proven yet and that’s something that we need to see.”

How proptech tools are reshaping commercial real estate

Full text: Proptech, short for property technology, is already a growing force in commercial real estate, and now a Toronto tech firm is making it easier for developers to determine where to locate their projects even before they assemble the land.
“Our company is like Google Maps, only it’s for commercial developers. We use technology to help people building projects such as high-rise, multifamily buildings identify new sites,” says Devin Tu, president of MapYourProperty.
MapYourProperty’s technology streamlines due diligence for developers. “It lets them look at issues such as zoning, land use and transit corridors at properties they’re considering buying. A typical developer will look at up to 200 properties per year and only buy one or two to develop; our tool lets them focus on those one or two sites they’ll likely choose,” Mr. Tu says.
“This is the kind of work that can take up to two weeks of research. Our proptech tool can shorten this to 30 seconds,” he adds.
MapYourProperty is part of a new wave of proptech apps and tech tools that are extending the use of technology beyond project management and building maintenance into every aspect of the commercial real estate sector.
“It’s an exciting new industry; it’s early stage,” says Benjamin Shinewald, president and chief executive officer of BOMA Canada, a national umbrella group for building and maintenance operators. “There are new applications and areas of use being created all the time.”
Different areas of the real estate sector are taking notice of proptech’s possibilities. In February, MapYourProperty received a $2.5-million award from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.’s data-driven funding program to help organizations – including Habitat for Humanity Canada, Rural Development Network and Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson) Centre for Urban Research and Land Development (CUR) – identify affordable housing sites.
Another Toronto proptech company, Lane Technologies, which enables building owners and office tenants to manage office life digitally, was acquired by U.S. firm VTS for US$200-million in October, 2021, one of the largest proptech deals to date.
This acquisition anticipates workers returning to offices after COVID-19. Lane’s proptech allows owners to manage leases, while tenants and office workers can use the app to book conference rooms, order food, get through security and connect with nearby restaurants, entertainment venues and other local businesses.
“In our experience, we’re seeing proptech expand to cover a lot of different aspects of the real estate sector,” Mr. Tu says.
“In our case, it’s on the predevelopment side; we’re planning to expand our operation to cover areas representing 50 per cent of the population across Canada within the next 18 months. We’re also seeing other proptech being used more to manage office and retail space.”
He says proptech is expanding to areas with programs that use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict housing prices near a development, by factoring in variables such as transit access, nearby prices and infrastructure to come up with ballpark prices in a nanosecond. “But AI can be overhyped. You can use it to predict some things, but not everything,” Mr. Tu says.
Proptech is becoming more important to the circular economy, says Molly Westbrook, executive asset managing director at Cushman & Wakefield Canada.
The goal of a circular economy is to minimize waste in every aspect of a business operation, by reducing waste and reusing and recycling materials.
“There are some [proptech] items that are really moving the needle on sustainability,” Ms. Westbrook says. Proptech is already used widely to help buildings increase energy efficiency, enabling operators to manage heating and cooling remotely and to better know exactly where and when maintenance is needed.
Managing waste is the next frontier, Ms. Westbrook says. “Recycling is really key to a building’s operation – how a building streams, diverts and reuses paper, cardboard and plastic can really make a difference to its operating cost and efficiency,” she notes.
“We’ve been introducing AI technology to increase the efficiency of these types of operations,” she explains. Algorithms determine which materials go where to be recycled or reused.
It’s a way to overcome the situation in Canada where, for example, only 9 per cent of plastic waste now gets recycled.
Proptech can also simplify low-tech tasks such as garbage collection, Mr. Shinewald adds.
“In the past, waste haulers would remove garbage from the large bins in the ground floors of the buildings on a schedule, say every Tuesday. With proptech, you can put a sensor in the bin to send a message to the hauler when it is full,” he says.
“That way, haulers come on demand rather than on a fixed schedule when the bin may or may not be full. This is not only more cost efficient, but it is more sustainable; it will result in fewer trips to the building,” he says.
As proptech continues to grow in significance, it’s important to reach a common understanding of what it actually is, Mr. Shinewald adds.
“We’re piloting a program that will be the first smart buildings standard for the industry,” he says. This will help current proptech companies, new entrants and potential users know what tools to consider and watch for.
He says BOMA expects to announce the first certified buildings soon, followed by a larger and more public launch of certified smart buildings in the spring.
“This is a made-in-Canada program created by and for the commercial real estate industry,” he says. “It will bring transparency and standards to the sector.”
There’s ample opportunity for proptech to grow in Canada, Mr. Tu adds.
“The field is wide open. In the United States proptech is used more widely, but it’s spreading widely here fast, with new companies and new applications all the time,” he says.

Sales of protected lands now set to be carved up raise questions: A substantial piece of the Greenbelt sold for $80-million, weeks before the province publicized its plans

Full text: Since Ontario Premier Doug Ford was first elected four years ago, developers have paid tens of millions of dollars for a number of properties that include protected lands the province is now proposing to carve out of the Greenbelt.
Among those properties is a substantial piece of land lying largely in the Greenbelt that sold for $80-million in September, just weeks before the government revealed its new plan.
During the 2018 election campaign, Mr. Ford promised not to touch the Greenbelt – a vast arc of farmland, forests and wetlands across Southern Ontario.
The pledge followed public uproar over a video that showed him saying he would allow housing development on a “big chunk” of the protected area.
Again, in late 2020, he made a similar promise.
The Ford government reversed itself earlier this month, announcing plans to remove 7,400 acres from the Greenbelt for the construction of at least 50,000 new homes. At the same time, land elsewhere would be added to the Greenbelt that, the government says, would result in a net increase of 2,000 acres.
The proposal to open up the Greenbelt to development has sparked protest from environmentalists, agriculture advocates and land-use experts, who argue that swapping one piece for another may be ineffective, because land has different environmental values, and that this also paves the way for other developers to push for their properties to be removed from the Greenbelt.
The proposed carve-outs of 15 areas of land include at least nine properties that were bought by developers for $10-million or more – transactions that topped $300-million in total – since the Progressive Conservatives took office in 2018, property records show.
At least four developers who bought the properties the government is now proposing to remove from the Greenbelt have either donated to the PC Party, hired Conservative lobbyists, or both.
The government defended the decision to open up parcels of Greenbelt land to development but did not address questions related to the developers.
“Ontario is in a housing-supply crisis, and our government is considering every possible option to get more homes built faster,” Victoria Podbielski, press secretary to Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark, said by e-mail.
On Nov. 4, the province announced 30 days of consultation on removing these lands from the Greenbelt. The province says owners would have to make “significant progress” on development approvals by the end of next year and begin construction by 2025 or the government would “begin the process” of returning those properties to the Greenbelt.
Since the announcement, The Globe and Mail has been examining property and transaction data, as well as corporate records, of the pieces of land Queen’s Park is proposing to carve out of the Greenbelt.
The Globe looked most closely at six of the province’s 11 maps of Greenbelt carve-outs, which together included 19 properties that had sold since the late 1990s. Of those, six properties changed hands between the Greenbelt being created in 2005 and the Tories taking office in 2018.
Another 10 have sold since the 2018 change of government. Nine of these were to developers and numbered companies, most for large amounts, and the remaining one did not involve a corporate buyer.
The Greenbelt is about two million acres of protected land, established in 2005 by then-premier Dalton McGuinty’s Liberal government, stretching across the Greater Toronto and Niagara areas. It was designed to protect farmland and environmental habitat while encouraging denser development by limiting suburban sprawl.
The plan for the Greenbelt is part of a suite of recent announcements designed to accelerate home construction in a region with a housing-affordability crisis.
The Ford government has pledged to facilitate the construction of 1.5 million homes in Ontario over the next decade.
Mayors in Toronto and Ottawa have been given expanded authority, and could soon be able to pass bylaws with only onethird support on council.
Conservation authorities have had their mandate reduced. And cities will no longer be able to levy development charges – which fund sewers, parks and other civic amenities – on certain kinds of housing.
Critics say that these measures undermine local democracy, threaten the environment and will deprive cash-strapped cities of hundreds of millions of dollars – without necessarily resulting in more homes being built.
Victor Doyle, a former provincial land-use expert considered the main architect of the Greenbelt, questioned why developers would have paid so much for land that was considered off-limits for development.
“It’s beyond belief,” said Mr. Doyle, who says the government’s plan will only encourage sprawl.
“It makes no sense to continue this massive outward growth, which the government has been pursuing with unbelievable vigour, undoing so much, and based on a big lie that we’re running out of land.”
Among the sales in the Greenbelt parcels up for potential development, the most recent occurred in mid-September, about six weeks before the government’s announcement.
On Sept. 15, a company controlled by developer Michael Rice bought the 280-hectare property in the Township of King for $80-million.
The real estate agent who sold the property promoted it as a “prime land-banking opportunity,” referring to the practice of holding undeveloped land for future opportunities.
The property had previously traded hands in 2000 – before the Greenbelt protections were put in place – for about $9.3-million.
Mr. Rice did not respond to emails requesting comment.
Almost immediately after the government’s announcement, the local municipality threw its support behind allowing the land to be carved out of the Greenbelt so it could be used for a new hospital.
The local council passed a resolution just one business day later, saying the property owner is “committed to providing the necessary lands” for a new hospital “for a nominal fee.”
Township of King Mayor Steve Pellegrini said in a statement that “a discussion took place some time ago” with the property owner who “wanted to give back to the community by providing land” for a new Southlake Regional Health Centre site. Mr. Pellegrini said neither he nor representatives of the municipality discussed removing the 280hectare property from the Greenbelt with the government.
The new hospital site requires up to 40 hectares, according to Southlake spokeswoman Lindsey Furlanic. She said officials will “evaluate this potential opportunity” after the province’s consultations.
Another high-value sale occurred in the spring of 2021, only five months after Mr. Ford’s most recent promise not to allow Greenbelt development. The property in Vaughan – which included protected land – sold for $50-million.
The buyer was TACC Developments (Block 41) Inc., which is controlled by prominent developer Silvio De Gasperis and members of his family. The company borrowed $100-million from CIBC to cover the purchase, at an interest rate of 21 per cent annually, records show.
Mr. De Gasperis, who owns multiple properties on the development list, did not respond to e-mails requesting comment.
One Greenbelt property changed hands after the 2018 election for only $2, and was subsequently used as collateral to borrow $15-million.
Two sales included vendor take-back mortgages, in which the seller lends the buyer money for the purchase. One purchase was financed by a company that appears, based on its corporate profile, to be a wrecking yard.
Other buyers of these properties included a series of numbered companies, one named for the address of the land it bought and TORCA I Inc. and TORCA II Inc. The Globe reached out to executives or directors associated with all of these companies. All declined to comment or did not respond.
Two companies tied to Mr. De Gasperis hired former federal Conservative cabinet minister Peter Van Loan to lobby the Ford government about issues including land-use planning and development, according to Ontario’s lobbyist registry. Mr. Van Loan said in an e-mail that he did not lobby the government about removing land from the Greenbelt on behalf of Mr. De Gasperis’s companies.
Mr. De Gasperis is also a PC Party donor. Elections Ontario records show total donations of more than $17,000 to the PC Party since 2018 under variations of Mr. De Gasperis’s name. There were also donations to the Liberal Party under the same names.
As well, donors with the same names as several of Mr. De Gasperis’s executives and family members have donated tens of thousands of dollars to the PC Party.
Mr. Rice’s development company, Rice Group, hired Frank Klees, a former Ontario PC cabinet minister, between 2019-20 to lobby the government “on the economic development opportunities represented by a number of the client’s emerging projects,” the lobbyist registry says.
The contract predated Mr. Rice’s purchase of the land in King Township. Mr. Klees did not return an e-mail seeking comment.
In addition, provincial records also show that a person with the name Michael Rice has donated more than $10,500 to the PC Party since 2018. This individual also donated money to the Liberals in 2018. As well, three donors with the same names as Rice Group executives have given the PC Party thousands of dollars since 2018.
Jack Gibbons, chair of the North Gwillimbury Forest Alliance, questioned why the province is “sacrificing” the Greenbelt.
“It just doesn’t make any sense. The only people who will benefit from sacrificing Greenbelt lands are certain developers.”

Full text: Every year, Canada adds a big city – in a sense. The mass of individuals are spread around, mostly to urban centres, but increasingly to suburbs and far-flung communities. They are here to work, to study, to build a better life.
The expansion is historic. From July to September, Canada’s population grew by around 285,000, a 0.7-per-cent gain that was the largest since Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949.
More than 700,000 people have been added over the past year, roughly the same as the population of Mississauga, the seventhlargest municipality in the country.
The trend picked up when the federal Liberal Party came to power. Since 2016, the country has grown at nearly double the rate of its Group of Seven peers. For the most part, that growth is driven by immigration.
The push is deliberate. Policy makers say higher immigration is necessary to fuel Canada’s economic growth, and in particular, to ease labour shortages that have frustrated the corporate sector.
It is, however, a population boom with its share of growing pains.
Consider that over the past year, fewer than 200,000 housing units were completed. There were 3.6 new residents for every home added, the highest ratio since at least 1991. Affordability is deteriorating in most places. There is a fundamental mismatch between home supply and demand – and the population boom is contributing to the divide.
At the same time, Canadian governments are struggling to deliver basic services. Surgeries are getting cancelled in crammed hospitals. Canadians can’t find family doctors, let alone newcomers trying to navigate an ailing health care system. Cashstrapped cities can’t refurbish their infrastructure as fast as it’s falling into disrepair.
To cope with the affordability crisis, a growing number of people are fleeing our cities. They include teachers, nurses and construction workers – the very people who keep those cities running.
In this fraught environment, Ottawa has its foot on the accelerator. After admitting about 405,000 permanent residents last year, the federal government is aiming for 500,000 in 2025. And that’s just a portion of the migration wave: At last count, there were 1.4 million residents with temporary work or study permits.
Canada is facing a complicated adjustment. Notably, developers are scrapping or delaying housing projects, owing to rising interest rates and waning profitability.
Just when more homes are needed, fewer are being built.
Several economists question why the federal government would create more demand for services, when so many pillars of social infrastructure are in distress. They wonder if Ottawa is singularly focused on hitting its immigration targets, with insufficient planning for how to successfully absorb those newcomers.
For its part, the federal government says the solution to so many of these problems is simple: more immigration. They’re planning to bring in more doctors and nurses from abroad, along with people to build homes.
Many recent immigrants have waited years for admission. Now they’re arriving at a time of decades-high inflation and slowing economic growth. Highly-skilled newcomers will likely manage the transition just fine. But others are discovering the Canadian dream is a pricey proposition – and perhaps not what they bargained for.
Ash Gopalani knew Toronto would be expensive. Just not this expensive.
He and his wife, Sneha, arrived in September, after a stressful three-year process to get their permanent resident cards. Finding an apartment was the next hurdle. Too often, the listings were in cramped basements, with little natural light, or far removed from the city’s core or public transit.
Mr. Gopalani eventually signed a lease for a one-bedroom unit in the city’s west end for $1,800 a month, the top end of his expected range. What he didn’t anticipate was paying six months of rent – $10,800 – up front, because the couple from Mumbai has no credit history here. Now, they have less of a financial buffer as they search for jobs.
Mr. Gopalani was hoping to follow a familiar playbook for newcomers. Establish a career. Save up money. Then buy a house – preferably big enough that their family from India could stay a while.
But the experience of moving here has been a reality check.
“We don’t know if we can afford building a life in Canada,” he said.
The rental market is ground zero for where immigrants get a taste of the cost-of-living crisis, in which fierce competition and bidding wars for relatively few units have led to jacked-up prices.
For Alexiane Sauvaire, it was a rude awakening. She thought finding an apartment in Toronto would be easier than in her native Paris. After eight frustrating days of looking, following her arrival, she moved to Montreal.
“Maybe for rich people, it’s easy. But when you’re not rich, it’s impossible to live right now in Toronto,” she said.
Increasingly, recent immigrants are bypassing the largest metro areas – Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal – to settle elsewhere, although a slim majority still favour those regions, according to the latest census results.
However, costs are rising quickly in other cities, too, as they experience fervent demand from migrating people.
Over the past year, the average rent in Calgary has jumped 18 per cent to around $1,720 a month, according to data for new listings on Rentals.ca. London, Ont., is up 26 per cent. Halifax: 21 per cent.
From a labour standpoint, the affordability crisis is making it difficult to recruit – and retain – important workers.
“There are very significant economic risks to large cities if they do not get housing costs under control,” Aled ab Iorwerth, deputy chief economist at the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., said on a conference call this summer.
“It’s getting increasingly difficult to attract skilled workers and even highly-skilled workers to these cities because they’re just becoming simply unaffordable.”
The task ahead is nothing short of gargantuan. CMHC says that, in order to restore affordability back to levels in 2003 and 2004, Canada would need to build 3.5 million more homes than projected by 2030.
Earlier this year, the federal government unveiled billions in new spending for housing, with a goal of doubling construction over the next decade. That plan looks dead on arrival amid higher borrowing rates.
There is, of course, another problem: labour. In a recent report, CMHC said there were not enough skilled workers to build the homes so desperately needed.
“Even under more ideal conditions, I don’t think we have the capacity to build at a pace that matches the demand through population growth that we’re seeing,” said Shaun Hildebrand, president at real estate firm Urbanation.
Immigration lawyers have a blunt message: The application system is a mess.
And it’s a mess that was largely created in Ottawa.
Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (the federal immigration department) had around 2.2 million applications in its inventories as of Oct. 31. About 1.2 million of them were in backlog, meaning they’ve been in the system for longer than service standards for processing. That’s far higher than before the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The system is falling apart.
I’ve never seen it like this, in the 20 years that I’ve been practising,” said Kerry Molitor, an immigration consultant in Toronto.
After failing to hit immigration targets in 2020, owing to pandemic challenges, the federal government wanted a rebound. Through various decisions, it invited thousands of people already in Canada to apply for permanent residency.
The surge in applications overwhelmed a civil service that struggled to process files efficiently amid office closings and the shift to remote work.
In some cases, applicants are waiting years for a decision. Mr. Gopalani and his wife applied for permanent residency in the fall of 2019. They expected an approval within months, a typical outcome in their stream of immigration.
They weren’t approved until July, 2022.
“The immigration system could have been more sensitive, empathetic, towards the kind of transition that people go through, which didn’t happen,” he said.
Because of the backlog, applicants such as Mr. Gopalani have put their lives on hold for years.
Others are working in Canada, but their permits are nearing expiry, putting their future plans in doubt. These are individuals who, in Canada’s points-based system for economic immigrants, would often be shoo-ins for approval, but now are caught up in a bureaucratic nightmare.
There are “really good, quality people in the pool, and they’re not getting invitations,” said Mikal Skuterud, an economics professor at the University of Waterloo. “What happens now when these folks leave? They say, ‘The hell with this, I’m going back to my country or the U.S. or wherever.’ Now you’re losing all that talent. That’s completely not what this process is supposed to be.”
Despite the administrative headaches, Canada is on pace to welcome 431,000 permanent residents this year, right on target.
The trouble is that talented people are slipping through the cracks – and the immigration system is taking a beating in public opinion.
“There’s this massive psychological toll that the backlogs, the delays and the lack of transparency have on people,” said Lev Abramovich, an immigration lawyer in Toronto. “I don’t think IRCC bureaucrats and politicians understand how much suffering this has caused.”
For all of Ottawa’s talk of targeting the best and brightest, the federal government is also allowing more cheap foreign labour into the country. Earlier this year, it overhauled the Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) program, largely so employers could access more low-wage labour.
Colleges and universities, meanwhile, are ramping up their intake of foreign students, who mostly don’t need work permits.
Increasingly, those students are taking jobs to rack up points for their permanent residency applications.
Around 1.4 million people had temporary work or study permits at the end of 2021, an increase of 85 per cent since 2015. That’s 640,000 people – about equal to the city of Vancouver – who have been added in just six years. Their ranks are set to accelerate this year, after policy changes.
While Ottawa has targets for admissions of permanent residents, there are no such guidelines for other migrants. With students, the federal government has essentially ceded that responsibility to postsecondary institutions, which are inclined to boost their revenues through higher intake of foreign students, who pay lofty tuition fees.
“The number of foreign nationals who receive study permits in any given year is based on demand, not predetermined targets,” Rémi Larivière, a spokesperson for IRCC, said in a statement.
An extreme example: Cape Breton University. Nearly 4,000 of its full-time students this fall had study visas, up a whopping 68 per cent from last year, according to preliminary survey data from the Association of Atlantic Universities. About three-quarters of CBU’s full-time students are from abroad. That’s injecting a surge of new demand for services in sleepy Sydney, N.S. (population: 31,000).
Gurmeet Singh, a second-year student, is trying to help people with their transition. He’s part of a volunteer group that verifies rental listings for incoming students. On average, the group gets three requests daily to check out potential residences. Mr. Singh visits those listings to see if they’re suitable for living – and if they exist.
Fraudulent listings are fairly common, Mr. Singh said; the group finds a scam every couple of days. “We felt it was our moral duty to help our fellow international students,” he said.
That’s not the only source of frustration. In local media this week, CBU students complained that a majority of classes in the two-year postbaccalaureate business program – a popular choice among foreign students – were being held in an unexpected venue: a Cineplex Inc. movie theatre off campus.
Higher immigration is a guiding principle for this iteration of the federal Liberal Party.
Time and again, the party frames immigration as the antidote to an aging population, helping to grow the pool of labour market participants – and thus, too, the economy.
“Immigration is not just good for our economy, it’s essential. We can’t get by without it,” Immigration Minister Sean Fraser told reporters at a recent news conference.
The truth is more complicated.
A vast body of economic literature shows that immigration has little effect on gross domestic product per capita, a popular measure of living standards. Furthermore, while new immigrants are younger than existing residents, the intake is too meagre to offset a demographic wave of aging citizens.
This doesn’t mean immigration is bad for the economy. But it’s not an accelerant, either.
“Often, the argument is made as if it’s obvious that immigration generates economic growth,” said David Green, an economics professor at the University of British Columbia. “Not if you look at the numbers.”
Of late, Ottawa has said various policy changes – including the expansion of the TFW program and allowing foreign postsecondary students to work longer hours – are aimed at easing labour shortages. This has led several economists to accuse the federal government of kowtowing to corporate pressure, flooding the job market with low-wage foreign labour, rather than forcing companies to hike wages or make investments.
“There’s lots of evidence that holding employers’ feet to the fire in times of tight labour markets is the best way to spur innovation, automation and productivity.
Those are the things you want in an economy,” said Jim Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work, a think tank.
“And if you say to employers, ‘Don’t worry, we’ll let you bring in some low-priced temporary migrants to solve your problem,’ you’re just dissipating the pressure that’s required to achieve a more productive economy.”
Prof. Green questioned the need to admit half a million permanent residents in 2025, given the fragile state of Canada’s social infrastructure and the questionable economic rationale for that target.
“I don’t see the planning here,” he said. “Do you really want to ramp up to 500,000 a year, at a time when we seem to be heading into recession and our housing markets and our health care system are straining at the seams?
That’s a discussion that should be had.”
By and large, surveys suggest Canadians welcome immigrants.
A recent poll, conducted by the Environics Institute for Survey Research, found nearly seven in 10 respondents support current levels of immigration, about double the share in late 1970s. The vast majority of respondents – 85 per cent – agreed that immigration is positive for the economy, a view that has held strong for decades.
But Prof. Green suggests we shouldn’t take that for granted. If the country struggles to integrate newcomers, then perhaps Canadians will start to eye them suspiciously. “It’s politically dangerous, to my mind,” he said.
For now, that’s a worry. But it’s not the experience of Tanushree Holker and Nishant Kalia, who moved to Toronto from New Delhi in the summer of 2019. Their expectation of Canada as a welcoming country has checked out.
“That perception about Canada being a country which accepts immigrants with open arms, it is true when you come here,” Ms. Holker said.
The couple has shared their journey in Canada on YouTube; their channel, In The North, has nearly 100,000 subscribers, to whom they dispense their acquired wisdom on everything from buying a car to navigating a complex immigration system.
Mr. Kalia started the channel after getting laid off early in the pandemic. He’s since built a career in human resources, while his wife works for a Big Six bank.
In recent videos, they’ve documented a major life change: They moved to Calgary. By doing so, they’re saving $350 a month on a similar-sized rental unit, and they expect to buy a home within six to nine months. Despite any number of financial complications, their version of the Canadian dream is going to plan.
“After we made our trip to Alberta, we realized that there is actually a life in Canada beyond Toronto and Vancouver,” Mr. Kalia said in a video. “To our surprise, [Calgary] was much better than we expected.”

Full text: THE LISTING Real estate startup Properly has laid off about half its workforce just months after raising $36-million in new venture capital.
CEO Anshul Ruparell announced a 71-person layoff in a public blog post after hosting an all-hands meeting with staff on Nov. 15.
Mr. Ruparell called the move an “excruciating but necessary decision” in an e-mailed response to questions from The Globe. In his blog post he wrote: “We’re very sorry to be taking this step, and I take responsibility for the choices that brought us here. … Conditions have deteriorated much faster than we anticipated and we cannot predict when the market will recover.”
The type of workers laid off runs the gamut from software developers, recruiters, data scientists, pricing analysts, real estate sales managers and mortgage advisors to some executives in charge of growth marketing and customer experience. Even Mr. Ruparell’s own executive assistant was on the chopping block and one former employee announced on LinkedIn that she had been laid off on her birthday.
Properly has set up a number of supports to help former staff find new roles.
“I would be shocked if people internally didn’t see this coming, or maybe not … because of the scale,” said Cam McWatt, who worked as a recruiter for Properly from September, 2021, to July, 2022, and saw the company boom before he was laid off in a batch that included about 10 other workers. “From the time I was there, we doubled the company; I joined at 70, and left at 140 [employees],” he said. “A couple months into the year there was a big slowdown but at the time we were still hiring. Then in the early spring we acknowledged things were starting to shift … hiring was slowing down, decisions were taking longer to make.”
On Aug. 8, Properly announced it had raised another $35-million from many of the same investors – including Bain Capital and Intact Ventures (the VC arm of Canadian insurer Intact Insurance) – that had pumped $44-million into the company in July, 2021.
According to some former employees, internally the company told workers this new funding would extend Properly’s operational “runway” for up to three years and that no new layoffs would be necessary. That said, when it announced the funding Properly’s leadership warned it would pause its expansion to new Canadian markets as real estate activity cooled.
“We are now experiencing one of the most significant corrections in the history of the Canadian housing market,” Mr. Ruparell wrote in his layoff announcement.
According to Mr. McWatt there were signs before the slowdown that the business was struggling to find its way. “The roadmap would change rapidly, we’d always be exploring new opportunities,” he said.
Among those was a partnership with the Canadian home renovation television duo Jonathan and Drew Scott, known as The Property Brothers (which may have led to some brand confusion, seeing as Properly has never offered renovation services).
Properly initially began life in 2018 in Calgary as a so-called “iBuyer” company – like U.S. company OpenDoor, which used data to buy undervalued properties for flip and resale – but pivoted to the hybrid buying model in the face of a weak local real estate market.
Counted among the company’s finances is a $100-million credit facility from Silicon Valley Bank to backstop what was the company’s key market offering – referred to as sale assurance – which would allow clients to tap into their home equity to complete a real estate purchase with a guarantee that Properly would buy their initial home at a prescribed price if another buyer couldn’t be found.
As real estate markets across Canada slowed in 2022 amid rising interest rates, some of Properly’s former employees (who declined to speak on the record) say real estate sales people working with the company began to play down or omit any mention of the sales guarantees at all. Mr. Ruparell declined to answer questions about whether Properly has been forced to use its own funds to purchase any homes in 2022, though back in 2021 he asserted it had yet to happen.
Properly and Mr. Ruparell declined to offer comment on the future of the sale assurance program, or whether the company was pivoting again to a new business model.

Wheatley explosion spurs class-action: The municipality had warned the province repeatedly about dangerous leaks in the city prior to the town’s explosion

Full text: A collection of residents and businesses affected by a 2021 explosion that decimated the downtown core of a rural Ontario town has launched a class-action lawsuit, claiming negligence against the local municipality and a company hired to figure out the source of gas leaking before the blast.
The explosion at 15 Erie St. in Wheatley on Aug. 26, 2021, destroyed two buildings, injured 20 people and left dozens barred from their homes for more than a year, some of whom still aren’t able to return.
Strosberg Sasso Sutts LLP, a law firm in Windsor, filed a statement of claim in the Chatham Superior Court of Justice on Friday.
A recent Globe investigation revealed that experts and provincial government engineers warned for years that Ontario needs to be more pro-active in hunting down its potentially leaky orphan gas wells, some of which date from the 19th century and many of which may not have been properly plugged.
It also found that the municipality warned the province repeatedly about dangerous leaks in Wheatley before the town exploded.
The blast was the result of an explosive combination of methane and hydrogen sulphide leaking from a well through one or all three floor drains into the basement of a former Irish pub called the Pogue.
One of the appliances in the basement then ignited the gas.
The proposed lawsuit alleges that the Corporation of the Municipality of Chatham-Kent and HSE Integrated Ltd. failed on multiple fronts to deal with the hydrogen sulphide gas leaking into 15 Erie St. – including not properly ventilating or removing explosive gas from the building, not searching for the origin of the hydrogen sulphide, and failing to appreciate the true risk of the explosive gas.
Nor did they set up H2S sensors or other equipment in the vicinity of the leak, the lawsuit says, or promptly respond to the smell of hydrogen sulphide just before the explosion.
None of the allegations has been proven in court.
The suit seeks $100-million in compensation for psychological and personal injury from the blast, as well as property damages and lost income from businesses affected by the explosion and the resulting closing of Wheatley’s downtown core.
“The value of their real estate and property in Wheatley has decreased and will continue to decrease. They have incurred and continue to incur expenses including relocation costs, costs to purchase the necessities of life while they are displaced from their homes, lost income and profits, and costs to purchase necessary supplies, equipment and services while they are displaced from their businesses,” the lawsuit says.
Chatham-Kent’s director of legal services, David Taylor, confirmed Tuesday that Chatham-Kent has been served with the documents in the lawsuit, but said it was too early to comment on the claim.
“Our focus remains on supporting the citizens who have been impacted by this explosion in the gas release and really implementing safety systems for the site,” he told The Globe and Mail.
HSE did not return a request for comment on Tuesday afternoon.

Full text: THE LISTING A mid the controversy over the Ontario government’s proposal to carve up chunks of the protected Greenbelt land for housing development, another raft of land carve outs is being criticized for rewarding specific landowners while doing little to deliver housing in the near term.
On Nov. 4 – the same Friday night it announced plans to redevelop portions of the Greenbelt – The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing released more than 100 amendments large and small to several official plans in the Golden Horseshoe region as well as for the City of Ottawa.
The amendments addressed a range of provincial priorities but in many cases they included adding thousands of hectares of land to urban boundaries against the will of such councils as Hamilton, Halton and Ottawa. Now, local politicians are questioning whether the changes will positively impact housing affordability.
“Many of the changes were not minor, the amendment the province added in their approval of our plan would add up to 3,300 hectares of land to our urban area.
We’re still working to try to understand … the implication of these changes,” said Tom Adams an Oakville city councillor and chair of Halton Region’s planning and public works committee. The region’s infrastructure plans also do not extend to the newly expanded areas, meaning it could be a decade or more before it is able to begin the hugely expensive water, sewer and transportation servicing necessary to build homes there. “The land being contemplated isn’t really required, it’s not going to do anything for in terms of getting more homes built in the next 10 years,” Mr. Adams said.
Inside the plans there were dozens of site-specific changes that in many cases redesignated employment or farmland to community or urban use to allow for housing construction. A search of the land registry shows several long-time PC party donors have interests in a number of sites the ministry favoured in its amendments, and others are owned by land developers who lobbied the government extensively.
In four cases Aird and Berlis lawyer Peter Van Loan – a former federal Conservative Party of Canada cabinet minister – is recorded in the provincial integrity commissioner’s lobbyist registry pitching for a client that obtained a site-specific change to an official plan.
In July, the registry records an entry from Mr. Van Loan describing his lobbying of the Office of the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing (MMAH), the Office of the Premier and Cabinet Office on behalf of Branthaven Homes. Branthaven has an application in Burlington, Ont., to build eight towers of mixed residential and commercial between 11 and 30 storeys tall on Oval Court that could account for 1,996 housing units. In the Nov. 4 official plan amendments this site was redesignated from employment to urban use.
Since 2018, Steve Stipsits, president and owner of Branthaven, has donated $10,710 to the PC Party of Ontario, including a 2020 donation of $946 to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark’s own Leeds-Grenville-Thousand Islands and Rideau Lake riding association.
Also in July, Mr. Van Loan Lobbied MMAH and MPPs on behalf of Burloak Marketplace. The Burloak site at 3515-3545 Rebecca St., in Oakville was then removed from employment lands designations on Nov. 4. Property records show Starwright Management Inc., purchased the Burloak site for $10,504,865 in 2016 (it has since been transferred to two other related corporate entities for $2 in 2017 and 2018).
In August, Mr. Van Loan lobbied on behalf of Paletta International, and on Nov. 4 several sites controlled by Paletta companies in Burlington were redesignated from employment to urban use. The Paletta family is connected to a number of meat processing businesses and is one of the largest landowners in Burlington; Since 2019 CEO Angelo Paletta has personally donated $7,395 to the PC Party, bundled together with other Paletta family members the donations exceed $22,000.
The registry records that in October Mr. Van Loan lobbied several ministries – Economic Development Job Creation and Trade, MMAH and Transportation – on behalf of Argo TFP, which obtained a sitespecific amendment covering 4144 Fourth Line, the site of The Oakville Executive Golf Course. Property records show Argo River Limited Partnership purchased that site for $20-million on Jan. 13, 2022. The CEO of Argo Development Corp. is Gord Buck, who donated $13,251 to Ontario politicians since 2018 (all PC Party with the exception of $1,200 for former Liberal Finance Minister Charles Sousa in 2018).
“The Minister is doing the right thing, by ensuring that these major planning decisions accord with the legal requirements,” Mr. Van Loan wrote in an e-mailed response to a request for comment on his lobbying activity. He said his submissions to the minister were based on a view that both Hamilton and Halton’s official plans failed to meet the standards set by the Province’s Growth Plan. “The fact that both Councils ignored, and overrode, the advice of their own professional planning staff is a pretty clear indication of why the Minister had no choice but to modify the plans to deliver an appropriate quantity and mix of housing,” Mr. Van Loan wrote.
“The Minister has the responsibility to ensure that these plans will maximize housing outcomes for all Ontarians,” Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing spokesperson Melissa Diakoumeas said.
“That is why, after careful review of the plans and review of all of the comments received through consultation, the Minister took the necessary action to accommodate the significant growth the province is experiencing.”
Phil Pothen, a land use planning lawyer who is counsel for Environmental Defence, a registered charity and advocacy group, said the number of times Mr. Clark has used his powers over planning in the province to select specific areas for rezoning using the Ministerial Zoning Orders is unprecedented. “They have been picking and choosing particular sites based on who walks in the door. … It’s astounding the arbitrariness that results in this approach to development.”
Mr. Pothen also argues the latest changes seem to have little to do with building more housing sooner.
“Currently there are vast areas in Halton [for example] of existing designated greenfield areas sitting unused for ages,” he said. “What this is, is stacking a vast glut of land on top of an existing glut of land. [The redesignations] multiply the value of that land many times over. … It’s a giant increase in the wealth of people who found these golden tickets.”

Full text: 746 Janetville Rd.
JANET VILLE, ONT.
Asking Price: $2.7-million Taxes: $7,123.74 (2022) Lot Size: 5.46 acres Listing Agents: David Marsh, Re/Max All-Stars Realty Inc. and Donny Mangos, Keller Williams Referred Urban Realty THE BACKSTORY It was more than 40 years ago when Paulette Sopoci first laid eyes on her dream house.
“I was a poor farm kid down the street.
Every day I drove by in the bus,” Ms. Sopoci said of the Victorian manor on the outskirts outside tiny Janetville (population about 300) just east of Lake Scugog in the municipality of Kawartha Lakes. Her family, immigrants from then Czechoslovakia, moved to the area in the late 1970s and the 45 minute bus ride to school had one particular bright spot. “I loved pretty homes and pretty things, I was a big fan of Barbie, and this beautiful regal home just spoke to me,” she said.
In 2020 she was chatting with a childhood friend who mentioned “The Doctor’s House” (the local nickname) was for sale.
“It’s a dump,” Ms. Sopoci said she was told.
“It looked like a haunted castle, never seen more cobwebs. … There were bats in the attic, there were honeybees in the soffit and fascia. … The walls and ceilings were crumbling, the old man that lived here didn’t put the heat on very much.”
But Ms. Sopoci saw past “the spooky” and had visions of a new life for herself. She was living in Toronto but the pandemic was still new and she was like many urban dwellers who believed the time was ripe to move to the country.
A $1.9-million purchase price (financed in part by the $3-million sale of her Riverdale home) and more than $750,000 in renovations later and “The Doctor’s House” has new life, a new name – “Primrose Hill” – and a renewed connection to the community thanks to Ms. Sopoci’s determination to share her castle through heritage tours, ice cream socials and other activities.
“I hope whoever purchases her is going to be as passionate about her history or taking care of her as much as I was. She needs to be loved very deeply,” Ms. Sopoci said.
THE HOUSE TODAY According to the heritage documentation from Kawartha Lakes, 746 Janetville Rd.
was something of a folly constructed by Dr.
John McAlpine in 1880 on the belief that the town would become a metropolitan centre thanks to an expected rail hub. When the Lindsay, Bobcaygeon and Pontypool railway line was rerouted, Dr. McAlpine is said to have moved to Lindsay in 1884. Nevertheless, several other doctors purchased the Italianate-style home over the years.
Among the interior features original to the house are the staircase (done in Jacobean style that popularized ornate wooden staircases as a central feature in a home in the 17th century), the ornate parquet flooring on the main level, plaster ceiling medallions and the coffered ceiling in the library. The entryway also has bold red glass panels (made of ruby-flashed glass popularized in the late 1800s) in transom windows and sidelights.
To the left of the centre hall is a grand parlour with an adorned archway connecting to a formal dining room. This room is almost completely restored, even keeping the elaborate iron radiator screens made in 1880, despite the fact house has been switched to forced-air heating and cooling.
Windows and a doorway connect these spaces to the covered side porch.
Back through the central hall and to the other side of the house is a family/TV room that connects to the kitchen (which is also accessible from the back of the central hall).
“The bathrooms and the kitchen were like 1970s, 1980s vintage, so I could modernize them as I saw fit,” said Ms. Sopoci, who estimates she spent $130,000 alone on the bright, white kitchen kitted out with brass hardware and corner-squares tiles. A stone-topped island with bar seating centres the space and built-in window seats add a little more comfort.
Upstairs is the family space, with more archways, tall baseboards and deep crown moulding in the central hall. There are two decent-sized children’s rooms and a larger primary bedroom with its own fireplace and dressing area. An updated shared bathroom with standalone tub and shower serves this floor.
One of the only almost fully original interiors belongs to the library on this level.
“This was the only room in the house where the wallpaper was in perfect condition; all the other walls were crumbling. I don’t know why this room is so well protected, but it deserved to remain as is,” Ms. Sopoci said. The dark wood of the fireplace mantle, shelves and coffered ceiling match well with the deep greens and lighter pinks and golds of the floral paper. A covered, screened-in sun porch off the library overlooking the grounds completes the portrait of a room for contemplation and escape.
There is one more bedroom (likely servant’s quarters) off the largely unfinished attic, accessible from a stair behind a doorway beside the primary bedroom.
UNTAPPED POTENTIAL The grounds are exceptionally private, filled with trees, gardens, lawns and statuary from previous owners. There’s a barn and separated garage on the site as well as a large pool (restored by Ms. Sopoci).
“Twice a year I have the ice cream social,” using only Kawartha Lakes Dairy all-star flavours of course, “I have people coming from all over Toronto,” Ms. Sopoci said. “I love sharing this home, it’s such a special place in the middle of nowhere, and it’s a beautiful country drive.”
In her research she uncovered that one of the early owners, a Dr. Naismith (no apparent relation to the basketball-inventing Naismith) also held a social with ice cream, strawberries, a brass band and croquet for the townspeople. Indeed, there was a Jane Primrose Naismith who owned the home as well, a happy coincidence because Ms. Sopoci had already landed on Primrose Hill as the name for her new home.
She had grand plans to create a Christmas market on the site, and still more community events like tea services and programming throughout the year. But ultimately, she has missed being in Toronto: her young children still go to school there, and despite being in the city three days a week she feels she’s missing too much.
Still, how many people can say they got to live – even if only for a while – in their own childhood Barbie dream house?

Vancouver leads country in mom-and-pop landlords: Growth of small family-owned rentals coincided with period of low interest rates

Full text: Recently released statistics show that Vancouver has the highest percentage of mom-and-pop landlords in Canada, which may not come as a surprise for anyone with a mortgage to cover.
Statistics Canada said 11.2 per cent of Vancouver homeowners reported income from a rental unit. In 2020, 7.9 per cent of Canadian households overall reported rental income. The data only includes small landlords, not trusts and corporations that manage buildings.
The report says the growth of small family-owned rental properties coincided with low interest rates, which had enabled people to buy second investment homes or homes that contain a suite.
The most common of these small property owners, who some observers have called “artisanal landlords,” are couples living in big cities. Close to half are between 45 and 64 years old. Two out of three earn a regular income as well as income from their rental sideline.
The data line up with previously released StatCan statistics that showed one in five homeowners own a second or third property in Vancouver. Region wide, the figure is 16.4 per cent, similar to Toronto.
Mom and pop property management will only become more popular as the population grows, says a long-time real estate marketer. What is not known, is what type of accommodation they are renting out, such as short-term vacation rentals.
Vancouver is a landlord city for a few reasons, explains BakerWest partner Jacky Chan. Mr. Chan, former CEO of Park Georgia Realty, specializes in the presale market but is involved in the sale and management of all housing types, and he says investors are active right now, particularly wealthy buyers. Those buyers aren’t at the mercy of inflation or dependent on a recordlow interest rate in order to buy.
Mr. Chan is seeing this activity play out with the buildings that his company is currently marketing in Vancouver and Toronto.
BakerWest parent company Baker Real Estate has sold at least $1.2-billion worth of real estate in the past six months in just two Toronto projects, one, known as 8 Elm and the other, Forma, a two-tower complex of 73 and 84 storeys on King Street West designed by architect Frank Gehry.
For investors, the fundamentals are clear, Mr. Chan says. They see that Vancouver real estate price increases are always higher after a decade, despite any fluctuations, Mr. Chan says. The fact that the five-year-fixed rate is the same rate as the variable rate of around 5 per cent, tells Mr. Chan that the rate probably won’t go higher.
“What that means is the average rate of the next five years will be what it is now, or lower. So try to ponder that. If the rate in the next four years is going to go higher than what it is now, there is no chance the bank would set the five-year fixed rate at the current percentage level, because if that’s the case, they would all lose money,” Mr. Chan says. “So if you are a smart borrower, you know that in the next five years the average rate of interest is going to be less than the five-year fixed. When you know that, you can really utilize your money and your investment in a very wise way.”
Land costs and construction costs won’t significantly drop any time soon, he says. As well, with the federal government upping the immigration numbers each year, to 500,000 additional people by 2025, demand for housing will only increase.
“I don’t know how it would be mathematically possible for demand and economic activity and retail or anything to drop, because there are just too many people,” Mr. Chan says.
“I think with all those metrics, everyone knows the cost of replacement [housing] is not ever coming down, unless something catastrophic happens. You can lock in your position, knowing that there will be more people, more demand, and not enough supply even at the current levels.
“And because rent has also increased dramatically, around 25 per cent in one year in Toronto and Vancouver, it makes a lot of these investments make sense to be a landlord.”
The provincial and municipal empty homes taxes also turned some owners into landlords. The province commissioned a report released earlier in the summer on its speculation and vacancy tax, which showed about 20,000 secondary market rental homes had been brought online as a result of the tax. The report also showed that foreign demand for investment homes very likely drives up local housing prices.
“Those experienced [investors], opportunists who just park their money, with the empty homes tax measures, it forces them to rent their properties out, which is a good thing,” he says.
“It does solve the supply issue in the rental market, and creates more revenue for the government. Originally we thought that would be detrimental to the landlord situation: ‘oh my God, with the empty home tax and speculation tax we cannot hold onto our properties. We have to sell them.’ But no, that’s not the case. In my experience dealing with many landlords and running property management companies and portfolios, stuff like that, it was probably less than 5 per cent of landlords that decided to sell their properties.”
Vancouver landlords are not, however, necessarily interested in the long-term tenant market.
Vancouver has a lucrative shortterm rental market that would have been included within the Statistics Canada figures, says Simon Fraser University City Program director and adjunct professor Andy Yan. For example, there are many landlords choosing to make $400 a night off their downtown condo rather than rent it for $2,600 a month.
“This latest data release from Statistics Canada allows policy makers to better understand the various types of demands that are made on housing supply in Canada,” Prof. Yan said. “The next step is to decide which demands should have priority, and which ones need to be either supported or discouraged.”
Mr. Chan knows of downtown Vancouver condo buildings that have opened their doors to short-term rental. The downtown Espana at 689 Abbott St., a multiple tower, 446-unit complex allows short-term rental and has a list of Airbnb guidelines on its website. Online it’s easy to find one-month stays at condo tower The Tate, which offers fully furnished apartments. On Craiglist, there’s an ad for short-term stays at a furnished three-bedroom at the luxury Shangri-La near Coal Harbour.
Now that travel has opened up again, the Airbnb type of landlord is getting a lot more active, says Mr. Chan. He has clients who sub-lease rental units in order to run short-term rental properties, and they make a nice profit.
“They will rent a unit for $2,000 a month and run an Airbnb, and still it’s legal. I’ve seen that with my clients. It was very popular before the pandemic. For a lot of companies that’s their entire business. They find these below market or cheap rental units and they just rent them, and right away they turn them into short-term suites for executives and students. That’s coming back for sure.
“It can create an entirely different economic model … and I think Vancouver has that innate competitive advantage for the landlords and property owners to do such things, because it is a very sought after city.”
David Hutniak, CEO of LandlordBC, says he’s not surprised that the secondary rental market is flourishing.
“The primary reason that the secondary market dominates the rental market is because we didn’t build purpose-built rental for 30-plus years,” Mr. Hutniak says. “We’re still just scratching the surface on the construction of new purpose-built rental.”
Mr. Hutniak thinks that the empty homes tax measures as well as restrictions around shortterm rental, including the requirement for a business licence and minimum 30-day stays, likely turned some owners into longterm landlords.
“However, the continuing significant presence of investors in the condo market has also contributed to the number of secondary market landlords. Not sure what that will look like going forward with increasing interest rates.”
Mr. Hutniak mostly represents large landlords, but is in favour of the growing secondary market, and he welcomes small landlords to join the organization.
He’s of the view that the more landlords, the better it is for the housing situation. However, he also advises amateur landlords to either join his organization to mitigate risk, or use a property manager, rather than trying to run a landlord business solo.
“I have no real concerns that there are so many secondary market landlords. We need all the rental we can get,” Mr. Hutniak says.
“In terms of public policy, LandlordBC is of the view that government should be encouraging and incentivizing the construction of an over-abundance of purpose-built rental housing.
That’s the long-term solution to our rental housing crisis in terms of overall supply, and security of tenure, more diverse communities and professional management.”

System for disaster relief is overwhelmed, leaving victims to rebuild on their own

Full text: Disaster relief is an expensive business.
Consider the extensive flooding that struck British Columbia a year ago this week, with estimated recovery costs of $3.9-billion. Canadian taxpayers will pay nearly all of that amount ($3.5-billion) through an obscure program called the Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements (DFAA). The same program has received aid requests from Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador in the aftermath of Fiona, the post-tropical storm that struck the Maritimes in late September. (Official damage estimates from the provinces for Fiona are not yet available.)
Established in 1970 and overseen by the federal Public Safety Department, the DFAA is a mechanism through which provinces and the federal government funnel relief payments to homeowners, businesses and municipalities.
Those payments generally cover part of victims’ food, transportation and shelter costs due to evacuation, as well as damage to homes and furnishings. They also help local governments restore roads, bridges and other damaged infrastructure.
Federal data obtained by The Globe and Mail show the DFAA paid out after roughly 300 disasters since its inception in 1970 – mostly floods, but also wildfires, ice storms, hurricanes, earthquakes and even an encephalitis outbreak.
But it has never endured anything like last year’s triple-whammy from B.C.: In addition to the November floods, the province submitted a separate claim for $956-million for floods earlier in 2021, and a $416-million claim for devastating summer wildfires. Advance payments totaling more than $1-billion have already been announced.
FROM A1 Well before this, federal officials (and more than a few of their provincial counterparts) had already begun to question this aid’s affordability in an era of climate change. Now, with a raft of related reports from task forces, auditors and advisory panels either in hand or imminent, major reforms seem likely. Documents obtained under the Access to Information Act show that one objective of these reforms will be to “reduce contingent liabilities.”
But it’s not just about money.
The DFAA has been accused of shielding property owners, municipalities and provinces from the consequences of their own recklessness.
Even as Ottawa mulls changing the DFAA, it is simultaneously considering how to encourage more Canadians to buy private flood insurance, partly on the logic that insurance premiums will cajole people living in harm’s way to better protect themselves.
Some provinces have already tweaked their own disaster assistance schemes to exclude residents to whom insurance is available.
“The way that they’re expecting homeowners to take on responsibility is by cutting back disaster financial assistance,” said Daniel Henstra, a professor of political science at the University of Waterloo. “If insurance is available, then you’re out of luck.
“This has all changed in the last five years or so. And no one knows it.”
‘YOUR GOVERNMENT IS HERE FOR YOU’ Canada’s disaster financial assistance machine grinds into motion when provincial officials decide to activate their provincial program following widespread suffering and destruction. They identify eligible geographical areas and invite victims to apply.
This presents an almost irresistible opportunity for political grandstanding; premiers and other officials often issue statements congratulating themselves for boldly riding to their constituents’ aid.
Inevitably, though, applicants learn the limitations of this aid as they read the fine print. For starters, not all events or areas are eligible. And these programs were intended to provide minimal relief.
Ontario’s program, Disaster Recovery Assistance for Ontarians (DRAO), pays toward a list of specific items such as a child’s bed (a maximum of $730), a kitchen table with four chairs ($410), television ($450) and a refrigerator ($940).
Denis Lavoie is president of Regroupement Sinistrés Entraide, a group that organized class-action lawsuits against municipalities following floods around Quebec City in 2005 and 2013. He said Quebec’s claims process was “very fair” following those events and most applicants were satisfied, provided they understood the program’s intent.
“Victims who thought they would get money for a second refrigerator or a home theatre were disappointed, that’s for sure,” he wrote in an e-mail to The Globe.
However, he added that he knew of two homes that suffered significant damage to basement foundations or concrete floors; relief payments were “of extraordinary help” to the owners.
Many applicants are turned down, though. Alberta’s Flood Disaster Recovery Program received more than 1,400 requests for relief after floods struck Northern Alberta in 2020, but only 665 were deemed eligible. After extensive flooding along the Ottawa River in the spring of 2019, Ontario’s DRAO program received 197 applications. About a quarter were denied.
Krystine McInnes is among the disappointed. Her organic farm in southern B.C., near the CanadaU.S. border, flooded in May, 2018.
Her application was denied because the farm earned $50,000 more than a revenue threshold, she said.
“We thought the government had all these programs … but by September of that year, we realized we’re totally alone.”
Ms. McInnes’s farm flooded again in November, 2021, and by her reckoning, the repairs will cost more than $200,000. She applied for assistance within weeks, and the province dispatched a representative to assess the damages. A year later, she received a letter.
“They will only support a repair of the property ‘to the previous standard’ and stated that their engineer determined that amount is $30,000,” she said. She added that the repairs recommended by the province’s disaster financial assistance program would violate the province’s Water Sustainability Act. Unable to absorb the recovery costs, Ms. McInnes said her farm is teetering on bankruptcy.
Bryan Riddell has a unique vantage point of how disaster financial assistance performs. He’s chief executive of Team Rubicon Canada, a group that dispatches military veterans to assist recovery efforts. It sent volunteers in the wake of several events since 2018, including to Brantford and Ottawa in Ontario, Fort McMurray, Alta., Fredericton and the recent B.C. floods and wildfires.
He said the system’s intent is laudable, and he hopes governments will continue to administer it. But it “takes a long time” to deliver funds to people in need, he added, largely owing to the “cumbersome” bureaucratic processes.
SETTLING ACCOUNTS Delays are even worse in the leastvisible part of Canada’s disasterrelief system: deciding who pays for what.
Typically a few weeks or months after a disaster, affected provinces send a letter asking the federal government to share the financial burden. Ottawa rarely refuses. A Globe analysis of federal data shows that of the roughly 300 requests received since 1970, only 10 were closed with no payments made; another 12 were withdrawn.
But it can take many years for the process to play out. (The federal government sometimes counteracts the DFAA’s inherent sluggishness by making advance payments: In July, it announced $870-million in DFAA payments to assist B.C.’s recovery efforts from last year’s flooding.)
The DFAA’s cost-sharing formula is structured such that if recovery costs amount to less than $3.38 a provincial resident, the province pays the entire balance.
Above that amount, Ottawa begins shouldering more of the burden; when costs rise above $17 per capita, it covers 90 per cent.
This means Ottawa pays the lion’s share for the most destructive events.
That’s becoming painfully expensive. As early as 2016, the Parliamentary Budget Officer projected the DFAA would continue to incur much higher average costs than it had in the past: $673million annually from flooding, plus another $229-million for other forms of disaster. In retrospect, those projections understated what was to come.
Climate change is partly to blame. The PBO found that warming conditions were contributing to “persistent weather systems in the mid-latitudes as well as extreme weather events.”
Yves Giroux, who became Parliamentary Budget Officer in 2018, noted that Canada’s rising population also contributes. He added: “The more you see inflation rising, the more expensive it is to repair real estate after a disaster.”
When DFAA costs exceed what Ottawa set aside in its budget, Mr. Giroux noted, the federal deficit increases. But he added that even in the context of deficits racked up prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, DFAA expenses were not especially large.
Nor are they huge in relation to major budget line items. In normal circumstances, he noted, the government pays out about $25billion in Employment Insurance benefits each year, and $20-billion or more for national defence.
“In the grand scheme of things, having an unforeseen expense of a few hundred millions dollars under the DFAA is probably not sufficient to have a material impact on the deficit,” he said.
“An exceptional one-off $5-billion expenditure, it’s very significant, but it’s not something that will not have been seen before.”
But Ralph Pentland sees higher liabilities ahead. He is intimately familiar with the DFAA. He worked for the federal government for 30 years and managed the program from 1979 to 1991.
Owing to climate change and “a lot of unwise development going on,” he said, “you probably have flood damages doubling every five years.”
PERVERSE INCENTIVES The larger knock against the DFAA is that it has encouraged irresponsible behavior.
Critics allege that, over time, the DFAA devolved into a free insurance program that protects Canadians from the consequences of risky behaviour. The latest such critique comes from the Task Force on Flood Insurance and Relocation, whose final report was released in August. It
concluded that Canada’s disasterassistance programs contribute “to a moral hazard on multiple levels.” So long as this effectively free insurance remains available, homeowners have no motive to reduce the risk to their properties, and local governments have no reason to prevent development in areas exposed to flooding.
“The DFAA is the elephant in the room in a lot of the governance reform around flood management in Canada,” said Jason Thistlethwaite, a professor at the University of Waterloo’s environment school.
Much of the damage in B.C. last year resulted from dike failures, particularly around Abbotsford, B.C. Two decades ago, the B.C.
government downloaded responsibility for maintaining those dikes to municipal governments.
That decision is now widely acknowledged as a mistake, including by provincial officials; many municipalities couldn’t, or wouldn’t, maintain dikes properly. But owing to the DFAA’s costsharing formula, Canadian taxpayers will pay most of the resulting recovery costs.
The Parliamentary Budget Officer’s 2016 report observed that in Manitoba, municipalities were responsible for regulating building within floodplains, but rules and enforcement were “inconsistent.” In Saskatchewan, extensive drainage of wetlands seemed to be increasing flood risks. In Alberta, it noted widespread failure to deal with flooding caused by groundwater.
Such failures contribute powerfully to rapidly escalating disaster recovery costs. The flood insurance task force’s report found that nearly 90 per cent of the damages from major floods result from just 10 per cent of homes, those at the highest risk. Had municipalities and provinces prevented their construction, recovery costs would be dramatically reduced.
Ottawa tried to entice provinces to do better. In 2008, it amended the DFAA to allow them to receive an additional 15 per cent on top of their claims for repairs and rebuilding projects that reduced vulnerability to future emergencies. That didn’t work. A 2016 study by the Auditor-General of Canada found the DFAA program “did little to encourage provinces and territories to invest in disaster mitigation.”
Tough talk followed. In 2019, Ralph Goodale, then the public safety minister, warned homeowners that if they built in flood zones, they might find themselves ineligible for disaster relief.
But critics say there’s no mechanism for upholding such threats.
A TEST OF RESOLVE Minor tweaks having failed, governments are now pursuing bolder reforms.
One way governments have already limited their liabilities is by capping payments. In B.C., there’s a per-claim limit of $300,000.
Quebec introduced a lifetime maximum payment of $200,000 a house in 2019. Alberta imposed a $500,000 cap last year; what’s more, it declared that once a property has received a DFA payment in any amount, it becomes ineligible for future assistance – even after changing ownership.
“They basically said, yes, we will bail you out – but we’re not going to continue doing it forever,” said Craig Stewart, vice-president of federal affairs with the Insurance Bureau of Canada. “Alberta and Saskatchewan, in particular, have started to evolve their DFA programs to encourage those at high risk to get insurance, so that they’re less on the hook for those payments.”
A video from the Alberta government made its reasoning explicit: “These changes will increase awareness of risks for where you choose to live and do business, and will result in less development in high-risk areas,” the narrator said.
An even bigger change is that some provinces now warn that where flood insurance is available, government assistance won’t be, period.
This tough luck messaging contrasts starkly with the political grandstanding of past DFAA activations. But will tomorrow’s officials resist the temptation to ride to the rescue, even at the risk of sounding heartless? There are reasons to doubt it.
Even as his government looks to reduce DFAA liabilities, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $300-million Hurricane Fiona Recovery Fund in October. It will cover costs over and above those already refundable through the DFAA.
This same impulse – to help people reeling from catastrophe – thwarted DFAA reform from the outset. Mr. Pentland pointed out that even decades ago, DFAA rules prohibited providing assistance for newly-constructed buildings within designated floodplains. But enforcement was lacking, he observed, “because governments just don’t know how to say ‘no.’ ” AN OFF-RAMP TO NOWHERE?
Even if they truly want to, governments are limited in how much disaster liability they can offload.
Overland flood insurance has become widely available to homeowners across Canada (four out of every five Canadians, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada) since its introduction in 2015. But it’s still difficult to insure municipal and provincial infrastructure, which account for the greatest costs.
The DFAA “is probably always going to be there, because you’ll always have uninsurable mass damages that you will need the program for,” said Johanu Botha, Manitoba’s Assistant Deputy Minister for Emergency Management.
And then there’s the 10 per cent of Canadian homes deemed at “high risk.” They’ll likely never be commercially insurable. After the 2020 Northern Alberta floods, the provincial government “determined that overland insurance is not readily and reasonably available” in affected areas, it told The Globe in a statement. Saskatchewan, meanwhile, said overland flood insurance is not “reasonably available” to its residents. In contrast, New Brunswick said flood insurance “is available from most insurers in the province.”
With floods expected to become even more damaging in the decades ahead, it’s unclear how much risk the insurance industry will be willing to bear. What happens if the proportion of “uninsurable” homes rises to 20 per cent?
Team Rubicon’s Bryan Riddell has observed the insurance industry’s risk tolerance firsthand.
In the two weeks following the 2019 floods along the Ottawa River, he said, many homeowners told his organization they’d received letters notifying them that their homes were henceforth ineligible for flood insurance.
“The unfortunate knock-on for DFAA is, as insurance companies continue to try to mitigate their losses and pull away, that means someone’s left with the bill,” he said.
Ms. McInnes has dealt with insurers and B.C.’s disaster-assistance program for flooding on her farm, and sees little difference between the two.
“Even if you do have flood insurance, you will be in a lawsuit to get that insurance policy paid out,” she said. “There’s no way that insurance companies are going to step in to fill the gap.”
History suggests even minor reductions in DFAA assistance will encounter resistance. In 2015, Ottawa announced what were described as “modest” adjustments to the cost-sharing formula – the first tweaks since the program’s introduction. Then Manitoba premier Greg Selinger noted that under the new rules, the federal government’s 90-per-cent threshold wouldn’t be reached until damages reached $20-million, roughly three times the old limit. He fretted about the impacts to rural and northern communities.
“With disaster assistance, the major barrier [to reform] is the provinces,” Dr. Thistlethwaite said.
It’s unclear how much opposition Ottawa might face this time around. Mr. Botha said Manitoba has plenty of common ground with Ottawa when it comes to reforming DFAA to encourage construction of more resilient infrastructure. Clearly, though, the province is not keen to see Ottawa pay less toward disaster recovery than it does today.
“Provinces would prefer to have a lower cost-sharing threshold,” he said. “It’s not a secret that provinces generally feel the federal government should be taking on a bit more of that cost sharing.”

Full text: REAL ESTATE REPORTER 746 Janetville Rd.
JANET VILLE , O N T.
Asking Price: $2.7-million Taxes: $7,123.74 (2022) Lot Size: 5.46 acres Listing Agents: David Marsh, Re/Max All-Stars Realty Inc. and Donny Mangos, Keller Williams Referred Urban Realty THE BACKSTORY It was more than 40 years ago when Paulette Sopoci first laid eyes on her dream house.
“I was a poor farm kid down the street.
Every day I drove by in the bus,” Ms. Sopoci said of the Victorian manor on the outskirts outside tiny Janetville (population about 300) just east of Lake Scugog in the municipality of Kawartha Lakes. Her family, immigrants from then Czechoslovakia, moved to the area in the late 1970s and the 45 minute bus ride to school had one particular bright spot. “I loved pretty homes and pretty things, I was a big fan of Barbie, and this beautiful regal home just spoke to me,” she said.
In 2020 she was chatting with a childhood friend who mentioned “The Doctor’s House” (the local nickname) was for sale.
“It’s a dump,” Ms. Sopoci said she was told.
“It looked like a haunted castle, never seen more cobwebs. … There were bats in the attic, there were honeybees in the soffit and fascia. … The walls and ceilings were crumbling, the old man that lived here didn’t put the heat on very much.”
But Ms. Sopoci saw past “the spooky” and had visions of a new life for herself. She was living in Toronto but the pandemic was still new and she was like many urban dwellers who believed the time was ripe to move to the country.
A $1.9-million purchase price (financed in part by the $3-million sale of her Riverdale home) and more than $750,000 in renovations later and “The Doctor’s House” has new life, a new name – “Primrose Hill” – and a renewed connection to the community thanks to Ms. Sopoci’s determination to share her castle through heritage tours, ice cream socials and other activities.
“I hope whoever purchases her is going to be as passionate about her history or taking care of her as much as I was. She needs to be loved very deeply,” Ms. Sopoci said.
THE HOUSE TODAY According to the heritage documentation from Kawartha Lakes, 746 Janetville Rd.
was something of a folly constructed by Dr.
John McAlpine in 1880 on the belief that the town would become a metropolitan centre thanks to an expected rail hub. When the Lindsay, Bobcaygeon and Pontypool railway line was rerouted, Dr. McAlpine is said to have moved to Lindsay in 1884. Nevertheless, several other doctors purchased the Italianate-style home over the years.
Among the interior features original to the house are the staircase (done in Jacobean style that popularized ornate wooden staircases as a central feature in a home in the 17th century), the ornate parquet flooring on the main level, plaster ceiling medallions and the coffered ceiling in the library. The entryway also has bold red glass panels (made of ruby-flashed glass popularized in the late 1800s) in transom windows and sidelights.
To the left of the centre hall is a grand parlour with an adorned archway connecting to a formal dining room. This room is almost completely restored, even keeping the elaborate iron radiator screens made in 1880, despite the fact house has been switched to forced-air heating and cooling.
Windows and a doorway connect these spaces to the covered side porch.
Back through the central hall and to the other side of the house is a family/TV room that connects to the kitchen (which is also accessible from the back of the central hall).
“The bathrooms and the kitchen were like 1970s, 1980s vintage, so I could modernize them as I saw fit,” said Ms. Sopoci, who estimates she spent $130,000 alone on the bright, white kitchen kitted out with brass hardware and corner-squares tiles. A stone-topped island with bar seating centres the space and built-in window seats add a little more comfort.
Upstairs is the family space, with more archways, tall baseboards and deep crown moulding in the central hall. There are two decent-sized children’s rooms and a larger primary bedroom with its own fireplace and dressing area. An updated shared bathroom with standalone tub and shower serves this floor.
One of the only almost fully original interiors belongs to the library on this level.
“This was the only room in the house where the wallpaper was in perfect condition; all the other walls were crumbling. I don’t know why this room is so well protected, but it deserved to remain as is,” Ms. Sopoci said. The dark wood of the fireplace mantle, shelves and coffered ceiling match well with the deep greens and lighter pinks and golds of the floral paper. A covered, screened-in sun porch off the library overlooking the grounds completes the portrait of a room for contemplation and escape.
There is one more bedroom (likely servant’s quarters) off the largely unfinished attic, accessible from a stair behind a doorway beside the primary bedroom.
UNTAPPED POTENTIAL The grounds are exceptionally private, filled with trees, gardens, lawns and statuary from previous owners. There’s a barn and separated garage on the site as well as a large pool (restored by Ms. Sopoci).
“Twice a year I have the ice cream social,” using only Kawartha Lakes Dairy all-star flavours of course, “I have people coming from all over Toronto,” Ms. Sopoci said. “I love sharing this home, it’s such a special place in the middle of nowhere, and it’s a beautiful country drive.”
In her research she uncovered that one of the early owners, a Dr. Naismith (no apparent relation to the basketball-inventing Naismith) also held a social with ice cream, strawberries, a brass band and croquet for the townspeople. Indeed, there was a Jane Primrose Naismith who owned the home as well, a happy coincidence because Ms. Sopoci had already landed on Primrose Hill as the name for her new home.
She had grand plans to create a Christmas market on the site, and still more community events like tea services and programming throughout the year. But ultimately, she has missed being in Toronto: her young children still go to school there, and despite being in the city three days a week she feels she’s missing too much.
Still, how many people can say they got to live – even if only for a while – in their own childhood Barbie dream house?

Full text: The Morrison Creek lamprey might be beautiful only in the eyes of a biologist. But the jawless fish, with its gaping, disc-shaped mouth and eel-like silver body, has become a preoccupation even among those less susceptible to its charms, because it is found in only one place on Earth: an unusual, drought-proof stretch of wetlands on Vancouver Island.
This species of lamprey has evolved since the last ice age, surviving even dry spells like the one that has left many of the island’s rivers parched over the past few months. That longevity is a result of a special hydrological feature of its home: the creek is constantly replenished by freshwater springs that bubble out of the ground, a gift from the glacier-fed Comox Lake.
While climate change threatens sensitive ecosystems around the globe, this little pocket of forest and wetlands is well buffered.
But most of the land is zoned for heavy industry and owned by a multinational logging company.
“It’s a magical thing, here,” said conservation biologist Tim Ennis, who was running his fingers through one of the small, eternal trickles of water that nurture the wetlands.
Mr. Ennis, the executive director of the Comox Valley Land Trust, has been involved in a 20year-long community effort to protect the Morrison Creek lamprey, which faces extinction if development is allowed.
His goal is just weeks away from being realized. The owner of the headwaters of Morrison Creek, Manulife Investment, has offered to sell a 289-hectare parcel to the land trust. The deadline to close the deal is the end of December, and a network of conservationists has raised most of the $4.75-million purchase price.
British Columbia is home to the greatest amount of biodiversity in the country, but the provincial government and Ottawa have been unable to reach an agreement on securing new protected areas. Where there is progress, it is being achieved by First Nations and non-profits, and sometimes both together, while government talks grind on.
Many of those non-profits are land trusts like the one Mr. Ennis runs – organizations whose primary business is buying private land and protecting it from development. The 148 that currently exist in Canada have collectively assembled more than half a million hectares. They often use seed money from government, which is matched by private contributions.
Their work fills a gap left by halting government action. Canada, along with the other Group of Seven countries, has committed to conserving or protecting at least 30 per cent of its lands, inland waters and coastal and marine areas by 2030. As an interim step, Ottawa has set a target of 25 per cent by 2025, but it has a long way to go.
Less than 14 per cent of Canada’s lands and waters are protected, and on average the country is adding 0.8 per cent annually. That pace does not put Canada on track to succeed.
Morrison Creek has long been eyed for protection by local conservationists, and the status of its unique lamprey is a rallying point. Formally known as Lampetra richardsoni, the fish has been listed as endangered for two decades. The federal government issued a legal order to protect the lamprey’s critical habitat from destruction in 2019, which established a narrow protected area on either side of the water where it lives.
Still, the lamprey, which is “extremely susceptible to habitat loss” according to the federal protection order, is on the decline.
There is constant development pressure in the surrounding urban area of the Comox Valley. A small portion of land near the creek has been protected as parkland, but the land trust’s purchase of the Manulife lands would secure most of the rest of the lamprey’s habitat.
Mr. Ennis was wearing tall waterproof boots to lead a tour through the land he hopes will soon be preserved. The boggy terrain keeps away people for the most part, with their dogs and loud voices, “and so it ends up functioning as like a wildlife refugium,” he explained as he sloshed around the edge of a beaver dam.
Development in the Comox Valley has left few remaining large pockets of nature. “So it’s really important as a way of keeping wildlife in our communities alongside us,” he said.
Morrison Creek is dense with wildlife. Including the lamprey, it is home to 14 species at risk. Red alders lining a well-used wildlife trail are scarred by the claw marks of black bears, and the landscape is shaped by beavers.
A mink peered at a visitor from its shelter in a riverbank before swimming past the carcass of a Coho salmon that had finished spawning. The reliable streamflow has made this a highly productive salmon habitat.
Of all the creatures, Mr. Ennis has a soft spot for the lamprey, which grows to no more than 15 centimetres. “Lamprey are a particularly old lifeform, and seeing how it can evolve into a completely different kind of lamprey in this one place is really a testament to the stability of the hydrology in this ecosystem,” he said. “I think they’re quite beautiful. They are a long very sleek silver fish, and I think quite elegant when you watch them moving in the water.”
The local K’ómoks First Nation call the Morrison Creek headwaters qax mot, meaning “lots of medicine” in their traditional language. Mr. Ennis noted that the conservation effort will ensure the K’ómoks people can access the abundance and diversity of medicinal plants in the area that have been effectively locked up by private land ownership.
The Comox Valley Land Trust has partnered with the BC Parks Foundation to raise the money for the real estate transaction.
The foundation’s chief executive, Andrew Day, said the pandemic has increased the public’s appreciation for nature, and that this has helped drive fundraising efforts.
“There’s a tremendous amount of goodwill and gratitude for the natural areas we live in.
And a tremendous desire to give back,” he said. “But also, there’s just a much higher level of global awareness, particularly in B.C., about climate and our diversity loss. People want to do tangible things about larger issues, and protecting land in your area where you live is a very concrete thing that people can do.”

Full text: Last summer, Alberta’s provincial government launched Alberta is Calling, an advertising campaign to lure skilled workers in Toronto and Vancouver to cities in the Prairie province.
A significant pain-point this effort leverages is the relative affordability of housing in Alberta cities, where not only rents can be up to 25 per cent cheaper than in Vancouver or Toronto, but in this province, owning a spacious single-family home is still an attainable dream.
Despite the recent softening of the housing market across Canada, average benchmark prices have remained well above 2019 rates, according to Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) data.
And even though house prices in the Calgary and Edmonton regions have experienced modest growth in 2022, homes are still significantly more affordable across segments than in most large cities in Canada.
In September, the average benchmark price in Alberta was $463,000. By contrast, average prices in Ontario and B.C. were at least double.
As the Alberta economy has rebounded this year, job growth and relative housing affordability are fuelling interprovincial migration, and many of the new residents are capitalizing from the advantages of a housing market that allows them to get more bang for their buck.
Laura Jones and Ryan Sweet did just this by selling their 1,500square-foot house in Shelbourne, a town north of the Greater Toronto Area, and buying a 3,000square-foot home in Okotoks, a satellite community south of Calgary.
One of the motivations for the millennial couple’s move was to improve their quality of life while they still had some flexibility. “We knew this was kind of that pockettime for us as a couple,” Ms. Jones says. “Just before we decide to do the family and kids, or acquire more responsibilities with our professions.”
Life in Shelbourne meant the couple spent many hours commuting to work in the Greater Toronto Area, especially Mr. Sweet, who’d drive 1½ hours daily to his Mississauga job.
“One of the biggest driving forces for me was the commute time,” Mr. Sweet says, adding it was during those long commutes that he reflected on his life choices and started pondering the possibility of relocating to a more affordable and laid-back area.
“Ontario is really hustle and bustle,” he notes. “A lot of people like to work seven days a week, and it felt to me like a show-andtell presentation … almost like a giant competition.”
In July, after a year of researching their options and assessing work opportunities in Alberta, Ms. Jones, a schoolteacher, and Mr. Sweet, a property manager, drove across the country with their two dogs and started searching for the home of their dreams in the Calgary region.
Three months later, near the end of September, the couple moved on a four-bedroom, singlefamily home in Okotoks that sold for $600,000, 3 per cent below asking price.
“A lot of the homes in [a] comparable budget range at home – you wouldn’t get nearly as much space as you would here,” Ms. Jones said, adding that it was important to them to live in an area where houses weren’t clustered too close together. “We wanted to live in a town or city that didn’t feel overdeveloped.”
Although a similarly sized home in Calgary would have cost them almost twice as much, according to Point2Homes data, the couple felt like they still had more choices in Calgary than in Ontario.
“With a certain budget, you could move anywhere in or outside the city,” Ms. Jones says about Calgary. “Whereas in Ontario, unless you move way out, you’re paying for whatever you can get.”
Despite still having to drive to his Calgary office three days a week, Mr. Sweet’s commute time decreased considerably: from three hours to just one hour a day.
“I got two hours of my life back just in travelling alone,” he says.
The affordability Alberta cities offer, however, is not the product of any kind of plan envisioned to prevent the problems Ontario and B.C. have come to experience in the past 15 years, says Byron Miller, a professor of urban studies at the University of Calgary.
“If you’re just comparing things like housing costs and commute times, then Alberta does stack up pretty well,” he says.
“But it’s not that we’ve solved the problem, it’s that we just haven’t dug ourselves quite as deep a hole yet – but we’re on the same path.”
Indeed, driven by a surge in demand associated with an oil boom, in 2006 house prices in Calgary were not too far from Toronto’s. But after two years of a record-breaking number of housing starts in Alberta, in 2008 the economy tanked, population growth slowed down, and an oversupply of housing kept prices in Edmonton and Calgary from rising at the pace Toronto and Vancouver began experiencing in 2009.
Similarly, in 2014 housing starts in Alberta skyrocketed, only to find a shrinking population by the time these units came online in the years after the economic bust of 2015.
Naturally, the province’s economic setbacks didn’t make Alberta immune to the country’s affordability woes.
Like other Canadian cities, walkable neighbourhoods in Edmonton and Calgary, where most amenities, services and workplaces are located, can be significantly more expensive than some suburban areas and satellite communities. In Calgary’s city centre, the average benchmark price of a detached home is $200,000 higher than in Okotoks.
Members of the construction industry also worry about the ability of Alberta developers and builders to maintain the province’s affordability advantage – especially in the face of rising interest rates, inflation and supply shortages.
For Dhruv Gupta, chair of the board of directors at BILD Alberta, streamlining application processes is essential to create a predictable environment for housing investment and keep pace with a growing demand.
But demand isn’t driven only by those looking for a place to live.
“Housing prices in Vancouver and Toronto were not just driven by users, but also investors,” says Ray Wong, vice-president of data operations at Altus Group, noting that a growing number of investors are noticing the Calgary market and taking advantage of the city’s lower price point.
On the second quarter of 2021, 21.68 per cent of mortgaged home purchases in Calgary were attributed to investors by a Bank of Canada report. That’s slightly higher than Canada’s average of 21.63 per cent and not too far from Toronto’s 23.91 per cent.
Moreover, in the past decade, even Alberta observed a decrease in home-ownership rates, just like B.C. and Ontario. “There’s been this disconnect between locally based incomes and local housing prices,” Prof. Miller says.
“And this is related to inequality on a global scale.”
In Prof. Miller’s view, the growing significance of the affordability issue in Alberta “is a matter of degree, not a matter of kind.”
In Alberta, both provincial and municipal governments have been slow to enact policies that would help mitigate the growing challenge of housing affordability – and just building more is not a silver bullet.
“There are many sorts of landvalue capture mechanisms,” Prof.
Miller says, pointing at examples such as density bonusing and inclusionary zoning. “This is something we should be looking at as we’re pursuing these densification policies, because [land-value capture] creates a real opportunity to fund affordable housing.”

Full text: Paper Hill, an area in Old Montreal once home to the city’s printing industry in the early 20th century, is now home for Google Canada, a company who strives for a paper-free office.
Last week, the tech giant officially opened its 100,000-squarefoot, five-floor office at 425 Viger Ave. W., in the historic Read Building, which dates back to 1910.
The 300,000-square-foot retrofitted building, currently owned by Allied Properties REIT, is located in the urban-chic International District; neighbours include the Palais des Congrès and Caisse de depot.
Paper, whether printed, folder, crumpled or stacked, was the inspiration behind much of the exterior, designed by Lemay architectural firm, such as the polygonal folds between transparent curtains of glass, or the light and the articulated folding inside its central corridor’s ceiling.
The interior of the building, by iN Studio Design Inc., is built to LEED’s Gold sustainability standards and uses enhanced ventilation to conserve energy.
When it first put down roots in Quebec in 2004, the company employed three engineers, who worked in co-working spaces.
Today it has 300 employees, including software and game developers, AI researchers, cybersecurity experts and salespeople, with enough room in the building to accommodate up to 1,000.
The company’s footprint in Quebec and economic impact on Montreal’s community continue to grow, and beyond Quebec, Google is set to open new offices, in Waterloo, Ont., and Toronto, in 2023.
In keeping with the company’s spirit of collaboration, “we engaged the local ‘Googlers’ in a series of interactive sessions for their ideas on what would make the new office the best it could be,” says design expert Anthony Orasi, partner for iN Studio.
“Attention was paid to flow of activity, acoustics and visual stimulation,” he says. “This allowed us to identify ‘collision points’ for collaboration, as well as quiet zones for focused work.”
Shannon Deegan, Google’s vice-president of real estate and workplace services, innovation and governance, says promoting collaboration was essential in creating this new workspace. “A technology company like ours needs to constantly innovate or you stagnate,” he says.
Like most companies coming out of the brunt of the global pandemic, Google has switched to a hybrid work model in which employees come to the office three and a half days a week.
Simple shifts, such as spacing out chairs and reconfiguring the shape of the boardroom table, were made, keeping in mind that not all groups like to work in the same way.
“Sales teams like to come together and talk quick strategy versus engineers, who prefer to tap each other on the shoulder when coding and then go into a conference room to collaborate and flesh out their ideas on a white board,” Mr. Deegan says.
Aside from office space, other amenities built exclusively for employees include a fitness facility, a cafeteria featuring a coffee bar, a meditation room, a music room and a rooftop green terrace with a beehive.
There’s also a bike room to encourage employees to leave their cars at home in favour of a twowheeled commute. The Tech Talk and Training Centre offers spaces to engage Montreal’s broader community, available to hold local events or workshops.
In a tribute to the city, local landmarks and touchstones from the Greater Montreal community were incorporated, as well as artwork of local artists.
The Google Montreal logo in the reception area, for example, is designed to imitate the famed neon Farine Five Roses sign, and each floor reflects a different Montreal neighbourhood: Little Italy, Le Village, Le Plateau, Chinatown and Old Port.
“We wove in a layer of ‘Googliness,’ ” Mr. Orasi explains. ”[For example,] secret messages and puzzles were hidden within artwork, seating booths emulate iconic Montreal architecture and the instantly recognizable signage that greets you at reception remind everyone that this is Montreal – and it is fun!”
The neighbourhoods assigned to each floor also informed the finishes and colours chosen.
“The Old Port floor uses corrugated metal, raw steel and industrial lighting with more primary colours, while the Chinatown floor has a much softer feel and is characterized by deep textures and patterns with various shades of reds and deep green,” Mr. Orasi adds.
“This space was about creating a community.”
Michel Leblanc, president and chief executive officer of the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal, says the Google name and presence sends a strong message to the rest of the business community. “By locating their office in this area that is already strong, Google adds to the district’s cache as a place where other companies will want to set up shop.”
Their decision to set up a state-of-the-art office in a former printing facility offers a reflection of the past and a portal to the future.
Architect Jean-François Gagnon, senior partner and design principal with Lemay, says 425 Vigar is a “befitting next chapter in the building’s grander history of media evolution, connecting print to today’s rapidly evolving technologies.”
“Print, as we know, isn’t a defunct medium,” he says. “It lives on, especially as a source of inspiration. Just as Google is in many ways a keeper and builder of world knowledge, our work sought to preserve and build upon a rich past.”

Is stacked modular the future for affordable rental?: Cloud Apartments has patented a design for apartment modules that can be snapped together during construction

Full text: VANCOUVER California engineer Curtis Wong is applying tech innovation to the affordable housing crisis and hoping his ideas will take hold across the U.S.
The former employee of Elon Musk’s SpaceX is the founder of startup Cloud Apartments, which has a patented design for contemporary, cool-looking apartment modules and snap-together construction. The young company, based in San Francisco’s Bay Area, has received state approvals and they are working on a San Jose, Calif., site to erect a six-storey, 205-unit apartment building over a concrete podium, made up of “tech’d out” studios and one- and two-bedroom units. He has four other deals underway with developers, totalling 1,000 units in the Bay Area. Because off-site, factory-built modular construction is generally much faster than conventional on-site construction, he says the units will be more affordable due to savings of around 30 per cent.
Mr. Wong says it’s going to take a more creative approach that defies the norm if North Americans are going to solve the affordable housing problem. He had worked as a structural engineer for several years but grew tired of the lack of innovation, so he joined space exploration company SpaceX and worked on the launch pad in Cape Canaveral, Fla. The work pace was thrilling but too exhausting, so he went back to school and obtained a masters of business administration degree from Harvard University. He quickly discovered he could apply his tech know-how to housing, by standardizing the process.
“There are reasons that innovation is so hard within construction compared to SpaceX, if you want to compare those two worlds,” Mr. Wong says. “With SpaceX, there are no regulatory government agencies watching you the whole time, making sure you are following building codes.
You cowboy it, do what you want and a lot of cool stuff happens.
Within construction there are lenders, developers, government agencies permitting all that stuff, and it slows you down from innovating. … What I know about innovation, and bringing that back to the construction industry was pretty tempting.”
The goal is to wipe out the negative image of modular construction, the way that the electric car went from being an outlandish idea to today’s Tesla. The unique angle on construction is that the high-tech units are shipped to site 95-per-cent complete, a “plug and play” approach to building.
Cloud’s studio apartment has built-in moveable furniture, such as bed that lifts up to make way for a couch, a projector for TV watching and an integrated battery that can power the unit off the grid for 24 hours. Such features are useful in the face of climate change.
But the key to his concept is not just designing cool interiors, but standardization of the units.
He says they can reduce construction time by 50 per cent, and with their team of collaborators, they have the capacity to build about 10,000 units a year.
A standardized building design would also expedite permitting times because developers wouldn’t have to start all over again as they do with a one-off design.
“If you want to talk about how to use modular to save on costs, you have to think about it like how you think about automotives,” Mr. Wong says. “Henry Ford reduced the cost to build a car based on the assembly line that he pushed. The way he did that, he had the assembly line, mass efficiency through the factory, and standardization of what the automobile is – you paint them all black, you churn them out make them accessible to mainstream America and the world.
“What we are doing with Cloud Apartments is using the same mindset with modular, because currently modular is not standardized. Every building is still a one off, and totally different.
“We are completely standardizing the units by thinking of them like products.”
The hotel industry has already cottoned on, with major hotel brands such as Marriott now building modular construction.
The chain just built the world’s tallest modular hotel in New York with prefabricated and prefurnished guest rooms, a 26-storey building topped off with a modular rooftop bar.
“Building in a factory is how luxury cars are made, so the potential is much higher to make a nicer quality [home]. There are a ton of efficiencies, not just the improved quality, but also driving down the cost of housing.”
His company works with local factories and furniture designers.
The units are state-approved, although they would still have to be approved at the local level.
“Out here, we have state of California permits for factory built housing. We did that whole process so that the Cloud-S unit can be built anywhere in California now.
It’s one little advantage of modular construction, at least in state of California, that you have a better approval process.”
Part of the reason that the industry is starting to look to offsite construction is for the same reasons that European countries and Japan embraced the method: to reduce energy costs. The labour shortage is another.
According to BuildForce Canada, the residential construction sector will need 107,000 new workers over the next decade.
And that number doesn’t even factor in federal initiatives to double the number of new homes built over the next decade, to address record-setting immigration.
“The idea of importing highly skilled tech workers is great, but where are they all going to live?” asks Rocky Sethi, chief operating officer for Adera Developments.
Adera is one of several Vancouver-area developers that have embraced the use of off-site construction. This year the company launched two projects built with its patented mass timber sound absorbing panel system, Pura in Surrey, B.C., and SoL in West Coquitlam, B.C. Mr. Sethi says prefabricated off-site methods used for their Crest condo development in North Vancouver, B.C., resulted in a labour reduction of about 50 per cent. The building was framed 30-per-cent faster than usual, says Mr. Sethi. That’s helpful, because the number of tradespeople is in rapid decline, due to the fact that they’re aging out and the younger generation isn’t going into the trades.
“I’ve been in construction for over 20 years and the funny thing is we always talk about a shortage of labour. Skilled labour has always been a challenge but now it’s a challenge getting labour of any kind. And it’s not just through peak periods,” he adds.
“We don’t have enough people to sustain us through a somewhat slower market over the next six to 12 months.”
But the challenge to using modular is the many municipal regulations that get in the way and don’t necessarily add anything to the project, Mr. Sethi says.
“What the industry needs to focus on is delivery of housing.
Otherwise, it just makes my development more expensive and takes more time for approval.
[For example], reorientating a building, how does that make one bit of difference to somebody who needs a home to live in? It doesn’t.
“I think that modular does have a place, but we have a long way to go until that’s widely adopted for a number of reasons way outside the control of modular home builders. We are talking provincial and municipal rules and regulations, and we have 22 municipalities in Metro Vancouver that all have their own requirements.”
The innovative construction business is not without its risks.
Mr. Wong worked on Starcity Minna, a 16-storey, 270-unit residential modular high-rise targeting middle-income residents that was also started by a tech entrepreneur. Plans for the project fell apart during the pandemic. But despite pushback, it had reached the approval stage. Mr. Wong sees that experience as a learning opportunity.
“That was somewhat of a bomb when the planning commission in San Francisco saw we wanted to do modular. It’s probably the same in Vancouver and everywhere, ‘oh it’s low-quality housing, we don’t want it.’ But one thing that is starting to change is that reaction is disappearing from other cities that have done modular.”
Craig Mitchell, principal of Vancouver-based BlackBox Offsite Solutions and modular construction expert, says he’s been tracking U.S. companies such as Cloud Apartments because they are moving into market-rate rental. In Canada, the modular industry has seen growth because of government-funded social housing.
Mr. Mitchell said there is considerable interest among private U.S. developers to use off-site construction.
“It’s the private developers and owners that have now adopted modular as they are seeing great case studies, which his attracting considerable investment,” he says of the U.S. market.
“The development costs with conventional construction are astronomical, so they are beginning to accept alternate forms of construction more readily, which are bringing new players into the market.”
It helps that the U.S. has denser markets than Canada, he added.

Full text: Harold Steves might be in the middle of wrapping up a 51-year career as a politician, and as one of British Columbia’s greatest champions of agriculture and local food, but as of Monday he still had cows. And so, that morning, he was busy doing the usual.
“I still have to clean the barn. They don’t hold back,” said Mr. Steves, 85, who will go to Richmond city hall Thursday to mark his last day there as a city councillor.
It’s a job he has held almost continuously since 1968, except during a break in the 1970s that included a three-year stint as a provincial MLA. During that time, he helped shepherd in legislation that created B.C.’s unique Agricultural Land Reserve, which has protected vast swaths of land from development, including half of Richmond and a good chunk of Metro Vancouver. His conservation and environmental work has earned him praise – sometimes reluctantly and years later – from both former opponents and long-time admirers.
“He made a lot of us mad at times because he was so persistent and a bit militant,” said Bob Ransford, a real estate developer who is a third-generation resident of the Richmond neighbourhood of Steveston. Richmond’s city council, with Mr. Steves’s support, expropriated Mr. Ransford’s grandfather’s property to add it to a public park.
“But he’s been the conscience of all the issues we now care about today. He was talking about all of those 40 years ago. He moved the agenda because he stopped things and he got things done.”
There are 4.6 million hectares of prime farmland in the reserve, or about 5 per cent of the province’s total land base.
That land is protected from development and other non-farm uses. The Agricultural Land Commission fields applications to remove areas from the reserve or approve non-farming activities.
The law, which Mr. Steves ushered into existence with Dave Stupich, who was agricultural minister at the time, and then-premier Dave Barrett, continues to breed tension in the province. There is often immense pressure put on the commission to turn land over to industrial or residential development.
Mr. Steves has remained a champion of the reserve. In recent years, he has advocated for the commission to ensure agricultural land is not used for megamansions or concrete-floored cannabisproduction facilities.
Before he returned to Richmond city council in the 1970s, he spent a year suing Richmond over its decision to grant development approval for a piece of land at Garry Point Park. He and his allies won that battle, which is why the hugely popular park at the southwestern point of Lulu Island remains as big as it is.
He is also renowned as an early champion of the idea of local food. He was among the first to warn B.C. not to rely on California and other places around the world for its produce.
He has won many other fights. He got park space included in the controversial 1990s Terra Nova development in northwest Richmond. He preserved Japanese boat-building sheds on the Fraser River at what is now the location of the Britannia Shipyards National Historic Site. He worked to create an agricultural school at what was then Kwantlen College. And he was instrumental in preserving the Garden City Lands, a vast area of green space in the middle of west-side Richmond.
Former Vision Vancouver city councillor Andrea Reimer, who started her political career with the Green Party, called Mr. Steves “the ongoing protector.”
She said she admired the way Mr. Steves, who was also a Metro Vancouver director for most of the years he was on Richmond’s council, was willing to work with anyone and use any tactics to achieve what he thought were the right goals.
“Harold is as down to earth as you can get, and he kind of disarms people. He understood intuitively that he needed to reach out broadly.”
Richmond Mayor Malcolm Brodie, who has served alongside Mr. Steves since 1996, said the councillor had always been a pragmatist who would try his best to communicate with everyone, whether they agreed with him or not.
Mr. Steves didn’t start out intending to be a crusader.
In 1959, when he was a graduate student in the agriculture school at the University of British Columbia, his father called and said that their farm – an operation started by Mr. Steves’s grandparents, manoah and Martha Steves, for whom Steveston is named – was under threat because the city had rezoned the land for residential use. The rezoning meant the family no longer had the ability to expand buildings or change equipment to keep up with new dairy-farming requirements.
The farm later lost its standing as agricultural land for land-assessment purposes, which meant heavy new taxes that had to be paid.
Even as Mr. Steves spent a lifetime pushing to preserve farmland and protect the ability of the province to produce its own food, he continued to run a beefcattle operation on his family’s land. He said on Twitter that his Belted Galloway cows went to his son’s ranch earlier this week.
Mr. Steves still frets over the 19,000 hectares of farmland in B.C. that is instead being used for golf courses, megamansions and horse estates.
But he said he feels as though he has accomplished most of what he set out to do, including two projects he made progress on in the past few weeks: an estuarium at Garry Point Park and an effort to open up one of the sloughs at Terra Nova for spawning salmon.
Those were ideas that he had almost half a century ago, but other things got in the way.
“Some things take 50 years to get done,” he said.

Full text: Toronto home prices dropped again in October, contributing to an 18-per-cent decline in real estate values since the Bank of Canada started raising interest rates earlier this year.
The home price index reached $1,098,200 last month, a 1-percent fall from September, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board, or TRREB. The index is the industry’s preferred measure of home prices because it adjusts for volatility and excludes the high end of the market.
The decline began in the March-April period, after the central bank embarked on its plan to arrest runaway inflation through higher lending rates.
Areas that experienced some of the sharpest price increases during the pandemic’s real estate boom are now losing value the fastest. That includes the Halton region, a wealthy area to the west of the city of Toronto, and Durham, which lies east of the city.
Halton is down 23 per cent and Durham is off by 22 per cent.
The recent deterioration in home prices in the Toronto region has wiped out gains made over the past year. The home price index for the region is down 1.34 per cent in the 12 months to October.
The number of home resales last month was similar to that of September after adjusting for seasonal influences, according to TRREB. But compared with October of last year, the volume was down 49 per cent.
The jump in borrowing costs has made it difficult for borrowers to qualify for a large enough mortgage to purchase a property in the Toronto region. That has reduced the number of would-be buyers and slashed competition – and therefore prices – for homes.
At the same time, homeowners have postponed planned home sales or have made the decision not to sell in the current environment, realtors have said.
The number of new listings continues to dwindle into the fall.
TRREB said the “persistent lack of inventory” helped explain why home prices are not declining as quickly as during the spring and summer. “New listings coming on to the market are very low from a historic perspective,” said Jason Mercer, the board’s chief market analyst.
Last month’s slowdown does not reflect the Bank of Canada’s interest-rate announcement last week that pushed the benchmark interest rate up another half a percentage point to 3.75 per cent.
The central bank said it would continue on the same path of rate hikes to get inflation under control, although it indicated it was getting closer to the end. Mortgage rates have more than doubled from levels when a borrower could pay less than 2-per-cent interest on a home loan.
The rise in borrowing costs has cooled real estate activity across the country. In Vancouver, the country’s priciest property market, sales have slowed and home values have also been steadily declining. Across all property types, the home price index was down 0.6 per cent in October over September, and down 9.2 per cent over the past six months, according to the local board. However, compared with October of last year, the index was up 2.1 per cent.
Detached homes in the Vancouver area have lost the most value, with the index declining 0.7 per cent over the past month.
Meanwhile, condo prices fell 0.2 per cent and attached homes dropped 0.5 per cent. Year over year, detached houses are up 1.6 per cent while the others are up 5 per cent and 7 per cent respectively.
The number of resales in the region was down 45.5 per cent year over year, but was up 13 per cent in October compared with September.

Full text: Harold Steves might be in the middle of wrapping up a 51-year career as a politician, and as one of British Columbia’s greatest champions of agriculture and local food, but as of Monday he still had cows. And so, that morning, he was busy doing the usual.
“I still have to clean the barn.
They don’t hold back,” said Mr. Steves, 85, who will go to Richmond city hall Thursday to mark his last day there as a city councillor.
It’s a job he has held almost continuously since 1968, except during a break in the 1970s that included a three-year stint as a provincial MLA. During that time, he helped shepherd in legislation that created B.C.’s unique Agricultural Land Reserve, which has protected vast swaths of land from development, including half of Richmond and a good chunk of Metro Vancouver.
His conservation and environmental work has earned him praise – sometimes reluctantly and years later – from both former opponents and long-time admirers.
“He made a lot of us mad at times because he was so persistent and a bit militant,” said Bob Ransford, a real estate developer who is a third-generation resident of the Richmond neighbourhood of Steveston. Richmond’s city council, with Mr. Steves’s support, expropriated Mr. Ransford’s grandfather’s property to add it to a public park.
“But he’s been the conscience of all the issues we now care about today. He was talking about all of those 40 years ago. He moved the agenda because he stopped things and he got things done.”
There are 4.6 million hectares of prime farmland in the reserve, or about 5 per cent of the province’s total land base. That land is protected from development and other non-farm uses. The Agricultural Land Commission fields applications to remove areas from the reserve or approve non-farming activities.
The law, which Mr. Steves ushered into existence with Dave Stupich, who was agricultural minister at the time, and thenpremier Dave Barrett, continues to breed tension in the province.
There is often immense pressure put on the commission to turn land over to industrial or residential development.
Mr. Steves has remained a champion of the reserve. In recent years, he has advocated for the commission to ensure agricultural land is not used for megamansions or concrete-floored cannabis-production facilities.
Before he returned to Richmond city council in the 1970s, he spent a year suing Richmond over its decision to grant development approval for a piece of land at Garry Point Park. He and his allies won that battle, which is why the hugely popular park at the southwestern point of Lulu Island remains as big as it is.
He is also renowned as an early champion of the idea of local food. He was among the first to warn B.C. not to rely on California and other places around the world for its produce.
He has won many other fights.
He got park space included in the controversial 1990s Terra Nova development in northwest Richmond. He preserved Japanese boat-building sheds on the Fraser River at what is now the location of the Britannia Shipyards National Historic Site. He worked to create an agricultural school at what was then Kwantlen College.
And he was instrumental in preserving the Garden City Lands, a vast area of green space in the middle of west-side Richmond.
Former Vision Vancouver city councillor Andrea Reimer, who started her political career with the Green Party, called Mr. Steves “the ongoing protector.”
She said she admired the way Mr. Steves, who was also a Metro Vancouver director for most of the years he was on Richmond’s council, was willing to work with anyone and use any tactics to achieve what he thought were the right goals.
“Harold is as down to earth as you can get, and he kind of disarms people. He understood intuitively that he needed to reach out broadly.”
Richmond Mayor Malcolm Brodie, who has served alongside Mr. Steves since 1996, said the councillor had always been a pragmatist who would try his best to communicate with everyone, whether they agreed with him or not.
Mr. Steves didn’t start out intending to be a crusader.
In 1959, when he was a graduate student in the agriculture school at the University of British Columbia, his father called and said that their farm – an operation started by Mr. Steves’s grandparents, Manoah and Martha Steves, for whom Steveston is named – was under threat because the city had rezoned the land for residential use.

Ottawa urged to address credit-card fees: Small businesses ask for relief on growing chunk of operating costs, saying action is overdue

Full text: Business groups are calling for action on credit-card swipe fees, saying the federal government has dragged its feet on promises to lower them.
The Liberals promised in the 2021 and 2022 federal budgets to work with the financial industry to lower transaction costs for merchants and bring the fees that small business pay more in line with big businesses, which have more negotiating power with card issuers. The issue is politically sensitive for the government because the fees are used by banks to fund loyalty programs, so the Liberals have also promised to protect Canadians’ rewards points in the process.
But ahead of the federal government’s release of its fall economic statement on Thursday, some business associations say action on this front is long overdue and businesses are unable to absorb the costs as credit-card use rises.
“There’s been virtually no progress made,” said Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which has been lobbying the government to prioritize the issue of credit-card fees in this week’s mini-budget. “I’m hoping this will be featured, and really hoping it’s not just another vague commitment to do something. … I’ve got a lot of businesses that say they spend more on creditcard processing fees than they take out of the business themselves, as the owner.”
In 2020, the fees in Canada were reduced to an average of 1.4 per cent of each transaction from 1.5 per cent, after a voluntary fiveyear deal the government struck with credit-card companies. But that is an average. The fees that merchants pay on credit-card purchases vary widely, depending on factors such as the type of business making the sale and which card a customer uses. The rates can be higher than 2 per cent.
Adrienne Vaupshas, press secretary for Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, said the government has not forgotten about its past promises.
“The government is committed to lowering the cost of credit card fees in a way that benefits small businesses and protects existing reward points for consumers,” Ms. Vaupshas said in an email.
The fees have been in the spotlight again recently after new rules came into effect in early October, allowing businesses to pass on those fees to customers who use credit cards by adding surcharges to their bills.
But many small- and mediumsized business owners say surcharging is not a real solution to the problem, because it has the potential to anger customers who are already struggling with inflation, and to potentially drive them to larger competitors.
Small retailers, for example, say that big-name rivals are better able to absorb the cost of the swipe fees without a surcharge, because they have the clout to negotiate for lower fees with card issuers.
“As an industry, we’ve reached a tipping point,” said Anne Kothawala, president and chief executive of the Convenience Industry Council of Canada, which represents convenience-store owners. With the change in shopping habits over the course of the pandemic, customers are choosing cashless payments much more frequently than they used to, leading to a 55-per-cent increase in swipe fees for store owners, she added.
“The biggest cost of doing business is labour; the secondbiggest cost used to be real estate. Interchange fees have now overtaken real estate,” Ms. Kothawala said. “… Lack of quick movement on credit-card fees threatens the long-term viability of many of these local businesses and the communities they serve.”
The Canadian Federation of Independent Grocers (CFIG) launched a co-ordinated letterwriting campaign in August for members to ask their MPs for more progress on the issue.
“We want the minister to keep the commitment that rates for small and medium-sized businesses should be similar to what’s paid by big business,” said Gary Sands, CFIG’s vice-president of government relations.
Federal lobbying records show the three major credit-card companies (Visa, Mastercard and Amex), banks (including Royal Bank of Canada) and financialservices companies, including Moneris, have registered to talk to the government about its plans to lower credit-card interchange fees.
A number of businesses and groups from a wide array of industries have registered on this topic as well, including Walmart Canada Inc., the Canadian Energy Marketers Association (which represents fuel retailers such as gas stations) and the Canadian Chiropractic Association.
Alison Dantas, chief executive of the Canadian Chiropractic Association, said many health care clinics are operated as small businesses and have faced higher expenses during the pandemic.
She said her members are not in favour of passing on the transaction fees to patients through surcharges, and would rather the government act to lower the fees altogether.
Restaurants Canada was among a number of groups in Ottawa last week advocating on this issue, according to James Rilett, the group’s vice-president for central Canada.
“Even in the best of times, our profit margins are around 4 per cent; postpandemic, on average it’s around 1.5 to 2 per cent,” he said. “We’re basically giving the credit-card companies more money than we’re making ourselves.”

Alberta’s Energy Transition Corridor: Along scenic Highway 3, a multibillion-dollar renewables boom is transforming the energy landscape

Full text: As Grant Arnold strolled down the long rows of black and silver panels at his company’s solar farm near Burdett, a hamlet along Highway 3 in the southeastern corner of Alberta, the October conditions could not have been more ideal for generating clean power. The sun beat down on the 72,500 south-facing solar panels, as a pair of miniature donkeys named Starsky and Hutch kept the facility’s groundskeepers – a herd of a sheep – in line.
The Burdett Solar Farm is a new 20-megawatt facility developed by BluEarth Renewables Inc., where Mr. Arnold is chief executive officer. Burdett and its sister facility, Yellow Lake, 20 km south, cover 85 hectares of farmland.
BluEarth built them amid a massive influx of capital that has flowed into renewable energy along Highway 3.
These investments have made the province that’s long been known as the country’s fossil-fuel centre its green energy hot spot as well. Welcome to Alberta’s Energy Transition Corridor.
The highway cuts across a vast region that is reaping the benefits of famously bright and breezy conditions, a welcoming market for investors and big strides in green technology. Combine the space and the weather with provincial rules that allow power generators to sell directly to users, not just a government utility, and the corridor is uniquely well positioned. “It’s not happening anywhere else,” Mr. Arnold says.
Also called the Crowsnest Highway, the road starts at Medicine Hat in the southeast, then extends 324 km through Taber, Lethbridge, Fort Macleod and on past Pincher Creek in the Rocky Mountain foothills. From there it cuts through the Crowsnest Pass and continues west into British Columbia.
Along the route, signs of Alberta’s tried-and-true industrial lifeblood are everywhere – farming and ranching, food processing, cargo terminals, and oil and gas production. Day and night, heavy trucks trundle back and forth.
Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd.’s tracks parallel the highway across the region’s hills and badlands.
But transformation is also evident. The sunny and gusty southwestern corner of the province has been a hub for clean energy since the 1990s, and development is accelerating, with 17 projects generating 1,032 MW. Wind turbines by the hundreds poke up alongside the highway.
Lately, solar projects have popped up at a brisk pace, too. Many, like Burdett, are east of Lethbridge, developed by a variety of large and small companies. Provincewide, solar generation, at 1,088 MW, is now at the level the Alberta Electricity System Operator (AESO) had forecast last year would not be reached until 2033.
Just five years ago, wind power accounted for 9 per cent of Alberta generation capacity, and solar didn’t even register, according to AESO. Today, the two sources make up 22 per cent. Solar alone is now 6 per cent of the total, and about to take its next leap when Canada’s largest solar project, Greengate Power Corp.’s $700million Travers development, starts up.
There’s also a nascent renewable natural gas (RNG) industry along Highway 3, in which the fuel is generated from agricultural and municipal waste, and plans for increased storage and other technology to level off the variable power supplies from wind and solar.
The former NDP government kick-started development in 2016 with auctions in which wind developers bid on projects – those offering the least expensive power to the grid won. The arrangements have netted the Alberta government $160-million, according to new research by the University of Calgary School of Public Policy, and primed the pump for today’s investment rush.
“The number one driver of renewables in Alberta is private investment,” says Nagwan Al-Guneid, director of Business Renewables Centre-Canada (BRC), a non-profit that provides education and networking services for developers, investors and electricity buyers. “These are private corporations, public institutions, looking to procure renewables through power purchase agreements in Alberta. They have serious ESG [environmental, social and governance] commitments.”
When BRC was established as an initiative of the Pembina Institute three years ago, it set a daunting target of reaching 2 gigawatts of renewable energy contracted by 2025. Alberta has already surpassed that, after $3.75-billion in spending on new generation. All that activity, the organization says, has created 4,500 jobs. Five deals have been signed this year, adding 333 MW of solar and wind power. More is on tap.
Green power is proliferating in other parts of the province as well.
But Highway 3, already long established, can move workers and materials to and from projects quickly as they are constructed.
Most importantly, there’s “the resource” – sunshine and wind.
Southern Alberta has both in spades. Lethbridge, for instance, averages 330 sunny days per year, or over 90 per cent of daytime hours. The region, known for its balmy Chinook winds that race across the Rockies, is also one of the breeziest in Canada, second only to St. John’s, according to Environment Canada. Lethbridge gets more windy days than any other city in the country.
The development has jolted local economies, which suffered with the downturn in oil and gas that began in 2014. Medicine Hat, known historically as The Gas City, has embraced renewables.
Across southeastern Alberta, hotels are booked, restaurants are busy and the real estate market is strong, says Jon Sookocheff, economic development consultant with the city government.
Besides construction jobs, the industry is providing related opportunities, such as maintenance, warehousing and distribution.
Colleges in the region are training the next generation of renewable energy technicians. “I think it’s one of the bigger development stories in Alberta and in Canada, and it’s maybe a bit of a secret right now. But it certainly takes a lot of work to put these production facilities into play,” Mr. Sookocheff says.
“All of a sudden there’s a renewables boom” for communities along Highway 3, says Blake Shaffer, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Calgary, and a former electricity trader. “And they opened the doors to it.”
Driving west from Medicine Hat, here are some of the biggest and most intriguing clean energy projects along the corridor.

Full text: TORONTO Many sellers in the Toronto-area real estate market are choosing to forgo the attention that a sign on the lawn and a social media campaign brings. They are finding more discreet ways to trade properties.
The “exclusive” or “off-market” listing gained traction during the pandemic when people wanted to limit the number of visitors inside their residence. Agents say they are also seeing an increase during the market decline this year as sellers quietly test the market without letting their property become overexposed.
Against that backdrop, many agents were astonished last week when the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) included an item in their newsletter announcing an edict that seeks to limit the practice.
The policy is a fascinating new twist and turn in a market that has already seen a tumultuous few weeks, says real estate agent Gillian Oxley of Oxley Real Estate.
The Realtor Cooperation Policy declares that, within three days of public marketing, agents must place the listing on their local board’s Multiple Listing Service system. CREA oversees the realtor.ca site that displays properties from the MLS of real estate boards across the country.
“This morning I saw a listing that was $20-million on exclusive,” Ms. Oxley says. “There’s not everyone that wants that on MLS.”
CREA’s missive generated tremendous buzz among the agents who quietly share their exclusive listings in Facebook groups and tight networks, she adds.
Kevin Crigger, president of the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board, says he has received a number of calls from member agents.
He also first learned of the change when the CREA missive landed. It was released in advance of a conference hosted by CREA in Ottawa for boards from across the country.
“It’s far from a final policy,” he says. “There was obviously robust discussion while we were in Ottawa.”
While the newsletter item made no mention of seeking input before the policy is slated to come into effect on Jan. 1, Mr. Crigger believes there will be an opportunity to tweak the details.
The announcement put the topic at the top of the agenda for every agent who deals in this sphere of the market, Ms. Oxley says. One big question is how sellers will respond to having more limited options.
“How you want to sell your home should be a choice and a decision that lies fully with the homeowner,” says Ms. Oxley, who has three off-market listings in her folder at the moment. “I’m hand-picking agents that I specifically know have clients that want something I’m able to offer them.”
Public marketing, according to the policy, refers to any representation of the sale of a property, including yard signs, e-mail blasts, flyers and social-media posts, among other means of communication.
Agents will be allowed to trade information on exclusive listings within their own office – but only after the client confirms in writing that the listing agent has informed the seller of the benefits of having their listing publicly marketed and posted on the MLS, and the seller specifically instructs the listing agent not to do so.
Mr. Crigger says the “coming soon” lawn sign that many agents use is frustrating for buyers because there’s nothing in the rules to define “soon.” Potential buyers often see a “sold” sticker on the sign the next time they drive by.
But Mr. Crigger is concerned that the proposed policy intends to limit an agent’s ability to communicate with other agents outside of their own brokerage.
“That is an area where we certainly wouldn’t agree,” Mr. Crigger says of TRREB’s position.
As an agent, Mr. Crigger has represented clients on an exclusive basis. He says there are a number of circumstances in which a seller might crave privacy: the homeowner may be a celebrity, for example, or an executive of a public company might be concerned about raising questions among shareholders.
But he agrees with CREA’s goal of reinforcing the collaboration between realtors and giving buyers access to a “robust offering of properties.”
CREA’s rationale, the document states, is that the policy will increase the level of professionalism of realtors, better serve consumers and strengthen the MLS brand.
Buyers have greater access to inventory and sellers have the increased exposure that may lead to competing offers, CREA says.
At one time, so-called pocket listings tended to be quietly traded among top agents with a big book of business, Ms. Oxley says.
Over time, the practice that began with handshake agreements became formalized with written contracts. Carriage trade agents would often display exclusive listings on their own website but not the public MLS.
Tommy Lioutas, broker with Re/Max Hallmark Realty Ltd., says private sales have become more common in all price ranges in this fall’s precarious market.
Some homeowners, he says, prefer to forgo decluttering and staging for professional photos.
He recently sold a three-bedroom bungalow in Pickering, Ont., without public marketing because the owners didn’t want to go through onerous preparations.
“They have a child so there’s lots of clutter and every wall needed to be painted,” he says.
“It’s really hard to keep a house in show-ready condition.”
He put out the word through his network and sold the house to the first couple who looked at it for the full asking price of $950,000.
Undoubtedly, Mr. Lioutas says, he would have set an offer date in anticipation of multiple offers during the market mania of 2021 and early 2022. But in the current environment, there is the chance a listing will languish.
Buyers are relieved to have the opportunity to buy without competition, he adds. “They love the idea that they’re able to see something before the general public.”
The buyers of the Pickering house had lost out on about a dozen bidding wars in the past, he says.
Mr. Lioutas was also surprised by CREA’s proposed policy.
“I will have clients who will be disappointed with the changes. I would have thought there would have been an opt-out.”
Mr. Lioutas muses that enforcement will likely depend on neighbours reporting on each other if they see a “coming soon” sign lingering on a lawn.
He notes that even under the proposed rule change, agents will be able to market a property within their own brokerage.
“There are still ways to do it if your client is dead-set on going exclusive.”
Robin Pope, broker with Pope Real Estate, says there is some cachet in buying a property off-market, but he believes the practice is useful in limited circumstances among tight circles of agents.
“Not all of the properties by any means are sold by those people – that’s why we have MLS.”
A buyer from Asia, for example, may choose to work with an agent from Markham or Richmond Hill, where there are large Asian communities. That agent may not be well-connected with those who typically trade houses in Yorkville or Forest Hill.
Mr. Pope points to the example of a townhouse on Roxton Road near College Street that sat all summer with an “exclusive” tag on the sign out front. The only way a prospective buyer would see it, he says, is if they happened to be driving by.
“I do agree with their position that having a property on the open market is in the best interests of the property owner.”
Still, Mr. Pope does have reservations about the industry restricting the client’s options. “I also support the idea that a seller should not be dictated to in how they sell their place.”
Agents also wonder why the associations that represent the industry have not been more transparent.
“How could you implement or create a policy without a vote or the opportunity to make a case for why it is such an important tool in our toolbox?” Ms. Oxley asks. “I think there will be a lot of pushback.”
Mr. Pope also questions how the policy will be enforced after it comes into effect.
“How else are they going to have this new procedure implemented – especially if no one knows about it,” he quips.

New housing, same affordability crisis: Ontario’s proposed legislation doesn’t ensure relief for those priced out of the real estate market

Full text: Toronto-based journalist and senior editor for Spacing Magazine With its new sprawling housing reform bill, Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s government has pulled out all the regulatory stops in its bid to build 1.5 million homes over the next decade. The question is, will this gambit succeed in relieving housing affordability pressures in Ontario, and especially across the Greater Golden Horseshoe, or merely enrich developers and promote sprawl?
In several key respects, the legislation will make certain types of high-rise development easier and more straightforward, especially on major arterials and around transit stations. For decades, the City of Toronto dragged its heels with increasing density around dozens of subway stations, either because of local opposition or sclerotic bureaucratic approvals processes established in another era that today do little more than slow virtually inevitable outcomes. That change is long overdue, and will lead to better utilization of the subway, LRT and GO Train networks, and thus reduce car usage.
But the government’s hyped promise to short-circuit NIMBYism and greenlight duplexes and triplexes in the house neighbourhoods that dominate most southern Ontario cities is more of a mixed bag. (House neighbourhoods are also known, incorrectly, as neighbourhoods zoned for single family housing – typically large areas built after the Second World War that excluded duplexes, triplexes and small apartment buildings.)
Planning law, by its nature, applies to the entire province, from semi-rural Ancaster to the intensely urban Annex neighbourhood in Toronto. The new rules say that residential properties can now be retrofitted with up to three dwelling units, provided the footprint of the home doesn’t change. In smaller cities, this change marks a departure. But in the City of Toronto, council in the past few years has already passed “missing middle” policies that allow, in addition to the main dwelling, a secondary suite, and a laneway house or a so-called garden suite.
The next council, in fact, will be debating a change in Toronto’s official plan to allow “multiplexes” in neighbourhoods – duplexes and triplexes, but also fourplexes and small-scale apartments. That proposal goes well past Queen’s Park’s reforms and aims to retrofit house neighbourhoods with a broader range of housing options to staunch population loss.
Indeed, Mayor John Tory and the members of Toronto city council won’t be able to look for a helping legislative hand from the province when they sit down to debate these changes, which essentially represent a sweeping and historic up-zoning of every house neighbourhood in the city, including all the post-war areas that were long zoned exclusively for detached homes. However, whether all these changes expand the availability of moderate or deeply affordable housing is open to debate. The new legislation significantly waters down “inclusionary zoning” requirements meant to ensure that developers add affordable units to high-rises near transit stops. As well, changes to allow duplexes and triplexes won’t add large volumes of new housing, and what is built will likely fetch high rents, as has been the case with Toronto’s laneway rental units.
Lastly, the cities of Toronto and Mississauga both face a potential challenge to their respective “rental replacement” rules, which currently require that builders redeveloping larger apartment buildings replace every rental unit with another of a similar size.
These rules, which date back a generation and are enshrined in provincial law, were intended to provide protection for vulnerable tenants who find themselves evicted from apartments when their landlords sell. Queen’s Park says it plans to spend a year consulting on proposals to change the rental replacement regulations; the onus will be on mayors John Tory and Bonnie Crombie to make a case for protecting them.
It’s worth noting that the province can exercise its power to alter land-use planning law, but its powers are far more limited when it comes to the other factors that exacerbate the affordability crisis: worsening shortages of skilled trades construction workers who have to build all this new housing; spiking interest rates that have sidelined both market and nonprofit housing projects; and supply chain snafus that drive up the price of construction materials.
Ultimately, the entire effort is premised on an orthodox reading of market economics: that by increasing the supply of a scarce commodity (housing), prices will fall, and some measure of equilibrium will be restored. The problem is that these macro-economic assumptions don’t ensure that each newly completed condo tower or apartment building will be affordable to the ever-expanding swath of urban society that is priced out of the housing market.
Those guarantees require not just government funding, but also targeted regulatory protections.
What remains to be seen is whether these reforms, in the short term, create more bureaucratic confusion and trigger a market frenzy that gobbles up the tens of thousands of affordable rental apartments, inadvertently making the Ford government’s cure to the housing crisis worse than the disease.

Ontario to cut fees for affordable housing: New legislation aims to boost density as province works to have 1.5 million homes built over the next decade

Full text: The government of Ontario Premier Doug Ford has introduced sweeping new legislation aimed at speeding up housing construction that will cut fees for affordable and rental projects and spur “gentle density” by allowing three units on any residential lot across the province.
But Ontario’s Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Steve Clark, could not say how many more units the changes would contribute to the province’s goal of getting 1.5 million new homes built over the next 10 years – a goal at current growth rates that Ontario’s own projections show it will fall well short of hitting.
The package of legislative changes unveiled on Tuesday sets new housing targets for the province’s 29 largest and fastest growing municipalities but with no penalties set for failing to meet them. Toronto’s target is 285,000 new homes over the next decade.
Affordable housing, rental housing and non-profit housing would see reductions, exemptions or freezes on the development charges and parkland charges they are normally expected to pay municipalities to cover the costs of new infrastructure needed to keep up with growth. Mr. Clark said he hoped to look at whether federal housing money could be used to fill the hole this would create in municipal finances, while noting municipalities, including Toronto, have billions in development charge and park fund reserves.
The bill also includes other measures the government expects to generate blowback. Among them is a provision that would bar “third parties” who are not the developer or the municipality involved, such as residents or environmental groups, from challenging a project before the province’s land tribunal.
And it gives Mr. Clark the power to override the section of the City of Toronto Act that allows that city to force developers tearing down rental housing to replace it – although the minister told reporters he wants to have a dialogue with Toronto on this issue.
A summary of the bill provided to reporters on Tuesday says it would “streamline” the ability of the province’s local conservation authorities to review and approve developments in sensitive wetlands of floodplains.
But Phil Pothen, Ontario environment program manager with Environmental Defence, said the bill’s provisions would further weaken conservation authorities’ ability to block environmentally damaging development projects. He also said the legislation’s approval of the extension of sewage capacity into undeveloped areas of York and Durham regions outside Toronto will only spur more sprawl.
The bill’s “minor tweaks” to allow more density in cities were a “bait and switch,” he said, saying the bill would actually “squander construction resources on McMansion sprawl in wetlands in outlying areas of Durham and York Region.”
The bill would loosen municipal controls over projects with fewer than 10 units.
It would reduce the role of the province’s regional governments to approve housing projects, leaving this to the “lower-tier” municipalities within those regions. The move that would leave regional governments, who are responsible for water and sewers and other infrastructure, with less control over where development occurs.
Speaking to reporters at Queen’s Park, Mr. Clark said economic factors, including inflation, high interest rates and slowing growth are expected to dampen new construction even as the province faces a continuing housing crisis. But he said when the economy recovers, Ontario’s new cuts to red tape would help more housing get built.
He has repeatedly taken credit for the more than 100,000 new housing starts Ontario had last year, breaking a record that dates from 1987. But Mr. Clark acknowledges even this rate would fall well short of 1.5 million homes in 10 years.
While he would not produce any estimates on Tuesday, an internal government document obtained by The Globe and Mail shows that the government thinks its “gentle density” move to automatically allow three units – two in a main building and one in ancillary building, such as a laneway house, provided there are no structural changes – could generate 50,000 new homes over 10 years. (Toronto already allows for this kind of development.)
Earlier this year, the government’s blueribbon housing task force called for allowing four units and six storeys without needing any zoning changes, but Mr. Clark has so far not acted on this recommendation.
In the briefing documents handed to reporters, the government also says it intends to pass legislation requiring more density near transit stations, and provisions in Tuesday’s bill would require municipalities to update their zoning to comply within a year.
On Tuesday, both the Premier and Mr. Clark addressed a business luncheon sponsored by the Ontario Real Estate Association and the Federation of Rental-housing Providers of Ontario and summarized some of the key planks in the new legislation. OREA president Tim Hudak, a former Progressive Conservative leader, issued a statement praising the bill.
Media were not allowed to attend the sold-out Toronto Region Board of Trade event, for which tickets were $105 a head for non-members of the organization. But the event was livestreamed on the Premier’s YouTube channel. And Mr. Clark addressed reporters, who had received a technical briefing through teleconference, after the bill was tabled. The text of the proposed legislation was posted online late Tuesday.
“The policies would, if passed, represent the boldest, most transformational changes made to date,” Mr. Clark told the Board of Trade event. “They are going to cut through red tape, unnecessary costs, other bottlenecks that are standing in the way of housing supply for too long in our province.”
The province’s new proposed changes come on top of an announcement on Monday that the government was increasing it non-resident speculation tax to 25 per cent from 20 per cent.
Opposition NDP housing critic Jessica Bell said the bill would do little for renters who are facing steep increases. Liberal MPP Stephen Blais said waiving development charges could leave municipalities struggling to cover the costs of needed new roads, pipes and parks.

Tory handily re-elected to third term as mayor of Toronto

Full text: John Tory cruised to a third term as mayor of Toronto in Monday’s municipal elections, after a campaign that was short on real competition or drama, even in the face of a deepening housing crisis and a perception that city services are deteriorating.
Mr. Tory, who first took office in 2014, was re-elected with more than 60 per cent of the vote. He will now be the first Toronto leader given strong-mayor powers by the provincial government, which will make it easier for him to impose his will on city council. He has said he intends to make housing one of his top priorities. The average price of a home in the city has more than doubled since the start of his first term.
“We’re going to work with the provincial and federal governments to keep getting the big things done,” Mr. Tory told his victory party. “We’re going to get housing built. Much more housing and much more affordable and supportive housing in many more places across this city.”
The 68-year-old will remain head of a local government that faces major financial troubles. Residents routinely complain about basic municipal failures, including unreliable public transportation, increasingly shabby streets, overflowing public garbage cans and broken-down public toilets. Mr. Tory’s opponents argue that he has contributed to this state of affairs by holding property taxes down throughout his tenure.
He ran in this election on a promise to continue holding tax increases below the rate of inflation.
“We’re going to make sure that city hall is focused on the nuts and bolts services that you and all the people of Toronto rely on every single day,” Mr. Tory said during his victory speech. “I indicated during the campaign, I am not satisfied that some of those basics are as they should be and we must and we will get to work on that tomorrow morning.”
Prominent local progressive politicians, including Josh Matlow, Joe Cressy and Mike Layton, decided to sit out this mayoral contest. Mr. Layton, a city councillor, and Mr. Cressy, who resigned his council seat in April, have said they are leaving politics entirely.
Mr. Matlow was re-elected on Monday as councillor for the ward of Toronto-St. Paul’s.
The crowded slate of candidates running against Mr. Tory lacked household name recognition. He had no significant opponent until July, when progressive urbanist and consultant Gil Penalosa decided to throw his hat into the ring.
Mr. Penalosa advanced a slew of policy ideas, focusing on the public realm and housing. But he never posed a significant threat to Mr. Tory, and by late evening on election day had captured just under 18 per cent of the vote, with over 90 per cent of polls reporting.
Mr. Penalosa urged Mr. Tory to draw upon his ideas, such as by increasing housing density along public transit lines. “John Tory has the opportunity in the next four years to make it good for everyone,” Mr. Penalosa told supporters Monday night.
Housing emerged early in the municipal election campaign as one of the top issues of the race.
Surging demand for houses and condos has pushed the cost of real estate out of reach for many. Even a recent slowdown in sales and price increases has not brought relief, as rising mortgage rates squeeze owners and discourage potential buyers.
The imbalance between wages and housing costs has caused some residents to leave the city, particularly young families. And it has raised questions about the city’s future attractiveness to immigrants.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Tory said he would build on the city’s progress toward allowing what’s known as “gentle density,” meaning laneway housing and small multi-unit housing structures such as duplexes and triplexes.
He also vowed to cut red tape that can delay residential construction projects for years. And he said he planned to explore with the province a “use it or lose it” concept that might force real estate developers who move slowly to reapply for building permissions. He has not yet elaborated on the details of that policy.
Drew Fagan, a professor at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the University of Toronto, said the re-elected mayor may receive some help in achieving his housing goals from a federal government attuned to city issues.
“Ottawa is interested in this file – in the urban file generally, but housing in particular – in a way it hasn’t been in two generations,” Mr. Fagan said. “And they’re the ones with the money.”
But Mark Richardson of Housing Now, a group that advocates for affordable rental apartments, said the city’s housing development goals are at risk, because rising interest rates and construction costs have made the financial math impossible for a lot of housing projects. He added that the days when the city could simply provide land for housing have passed. Toronto will now have to come up with real funding as well, he said. He blamed the city for not moving fast enough during years of cheap credit.
“That window of opportunity is gone now,” he said. “We wasted it talking about affordable housing rather than aggressively executing on constructing affordable housing.”
Toronto needs a strong real estate market to balance its books.
The city’s finances rely heavily on the municipal land transfer tax, which gives the local government a percentage of the value of every land transaction within Toronto’s borders. The city is now facing an estimated $850-million shortfall in its operating budget for the coming year, a gap that could widen if home sales and prices falter further.
The city is confronting huge financial hurdles in its capital budget as well. The backlog in repairs for roads, public transit and parks alone is projected to grow to about $13-billion over the next decade.
Mr. Tory, a former broadcaster, provincial politician and telecom executive, succeeded the scandal-plagued Rob Ford. He swept to power on a promise to return stability and dignity to the mayor’s office.
While campaigning in 2014, he made repeated pledges to seek only two terms in office. Late in his first term he began hinting at the possibility of running more than twice. He now characterizes those pledges as promises not to the city, but to his wife, whom he has said now backs his third term.
If he completes a third term, Mr. Tory would become the longestserving mayor in Toronto history.

Full text: When Vancouver was planning its Olympic Village on the southeast shore of False Creek in the mid-2000s, the city council of the day had lofty ambitions. Local politicians wanted to build a mix of housing that would seem almost European in the way it catered to renters of different income levels.
Under the initial proposal, one-third of the new neighbourhood’s apartments would have been reserved for people who could pay only the lowest of rents.
Another third would have been priced to suit people making minimum wage or slightly more, who would have paid rent geared to their incomes. And the rest of the village would have been for those who could afford to pay the city’s market-rate rents.
That dream ended when a new, more conservative council was elected in 2005. Everything was scaled back over concerns that the city couldn’t afford the huge subsidies that would have been required, especially as costs rose and the 2008 recession set in.
Most of the village was sold as condos. A couple of social-housing buildings and one co-op were all that survived of the original vision.
Since then, only the most stubborn local housing activists have clung to the idea that Vancouver could ever achieve the same kind of affordable-housing successes as some European cities, where developers must ensure that as much as two-thirds of the apartments in new housing development projects rent below peak market rates.
But it doesn’t have to be that way, according to Maria Vassilakou, the deputy mayor of Vienna, a city notable for its work creating buildings and neighbourhoods where low-income residents coexist with wealthier neighbours.
And while Vienna has been leading the way in housing affordability for decades, other cities, such as Hamburg in Germany, have demonstrated in recent years how much progress a concentrated effort can produce in a relatively short time.
“What we are doing is transferable. I think all of it is transferable,” Ms. Vassilakou said.
There are many reasons affordable housing continues to be in short supply in Vancouver. One of them is that the housing development process pits all the parties involved against one another.
Each new development requires a new round of talks. Private developers barter for extra height on their buildings in exchange for reserving a negotiated number of apartments to be rented at lower-than-market rates.
The city, meanwhile, is constantly trying to pry money out of the provincial and federal governments for social housing. The same holds true in most other Canadian cities. The battle to build even a tiny bit of housing that is not subject to unregulated price increases is continual.
Ms. Vassilakou, who was in Vancouver recently to speak with local housing advocates, told The Globe and Mail her city is not immune to the real-estate madness that has gripped Canada and the United States in the past decade.
The difference, she said, is that some European politicians have used their negotiating leverage and authority over public land more deliberately and effectively than their North American counterparts.
Vienna’s model can’t be transplanted wholesale to other countries, she added, but that doesn’t mean Canada can’t implement it.
“What is transferable is a collaborative effort with non-profits, and with federal agencies that also own land,” she said.
In 2019, Vienna introduced a new housing requirement for any project with more than 150 units: two-thirds had to be affordable, with a mix of rents subsidized at different prescribed levels, similar to the way Vancouver’s Olympic Village was initially supposed to be.
“That, of course, was a radical step,” Ms. Vassilakou acknowledged.
In Vancouver, the proportion of affordable housing units the city requires in large new developments is just 20 per cent.
There are other mechanisms Vienna has been using for longer periods of time. The city aggressively buys land, then rezones it for high-density real-estate development, sells part for a profit and uses that money for housing. And the local government already owns a lot of developable land – decommissioned hospitals, abandoned airfields – that can also be upzoned and sold.
That puts it in a better position than Vancouver, where large chunks of land are owned by the federal or provincial governments, both of which are reluctant to sell.
Another thing working in favour of affordable housing in Vienna is that the city is effectively its own province, meaning it gets a portion of all the taxes collected by the Austrian national government. Vienna has to pay for a much wider array of services than Canadian cities do – everything from welfare to health care.
But the transfer payments give it money to work with.
The city of Hamburg, in northern Germany – the country’s second-largest after Berlin – has also changed its housing dynamics through sheer force of political will.
Hamburg’s housing policy is the political legacy of the man who is now Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz. In the city-state’s mayoral election in 2011, he ran on a promise to tackle the local housing crisis, and won. Once in office, he set up the Alliance for Housing, a partnership between the city government and housing industry associations. The arrangement has been renewed in every legislative period since.
Under the current agreement, the city, with a population of about 1.8 million, sets a goal of 10,000 approved new housing units a year. (The goal isn’t always met. This year, the city is falling short because of high construction costs.) The aim is for 3,000 of those units to be subsidized for lower-income renters.
The alliance is founded on a contract between the city of Hamburg and its seven districts. Those mini-municipalities receive 350 for each unit approved, a direct incentive for green-lighting development.
In 2011, the year the alliance started, 6,811 housing units were approved in the city. Ten years later, that number had increased to 10,207.
Jan Grade, managing director of the German research and consulting firm Empirica Regio, said rents in Hamburg have remained relatively stable over the past 10 years, even as prices elsewhere in the country have risen sharply.
Empirica data show that rents in Hamburg have increased by an average of 2.3 per cent annually since 2011, compared with an average of 3.7 per cent across Germany’s seven largest cities.
That has happened even though Hamburg has seen an influx of immigrants since 2015.
The successes of Hamburg and Vienna rely on the willingness of local politicians to work together with the private development industry, and to insist on a housing system that doesn’t focus only on the poorest of possible tenants.
“It’s important that social housing should not target only low-income groups,” Ms. Vassilakou said. “It should target the middle class, which is the backbone of society.”
Things are not perfect in either city. Construction and energy costs have skyrocketed because of the war in Ukraine and pandemic-related supply-chain issues. Interest rates are rising, and manpower is in short supply, as is land.
Implementing similar models in Canada would require overcoming not only global economic challenges, but also all the obstacles that are particular to this country.
“It is worthwhile to build on the model, but it must be adapted to current and, above all, local and regional conditions,” Empirica’s Ms. Grade said.
Ms. Vassilakou agreed. “You can never transplant a model from one city to another directly, but you can interpret and adapt the parts that can be useful,” she said.
The hardest thing to transfer to Canada, she added, might be Europe’s long culture of supporting social housing. It’s politically accepted in Europe that the state will intervene to make sure that people at all income levels can find housing.
That idea is still up for debate in Canada and the U.S., where residents fondly remember how the private market satisfied most of the huge postwar boom in demand for housing. That unprecedented building spree has been unmatched since then.
“There’s two things politicians tend to fear most,” Ms. Vassilakou said. “One is public opinion and one is taking risk. They’re very risk-averse and, every year, it gets more and more.”

Full text: The turmoil in British politics – which led to the pound plunging to a historic low last month – has hit the pocket books of thousands of Canadians with investments and pensions in the U.K., including federal ministers who own rental properties.
Among them is Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, who rents out a house and a flat on a street in central London near the River Thames.
François-Philippe Champagne, who rents out two apartments in expensive neighbourhoods of London, has also seen the value of his rents dip along with the value of the pound.
Thousands of seniors who have lived in Britain have also seen the value of their pensions, which are calculated in pounds, fluctuate with plunges in the value of stirling.
Among them is Senator Tony Dean, a former senior federal public servant who grew up in Birmingham, England, and went to university in Hull.
He said he does not rely on his British pension but sympathizes with thousands of people living in Canada who depend on U.K.
pensions to help them with the high cost of living.
“With mortgage rates going up and inflation eating into wealth, it’s a double whammy, and if you include currency exchange into the mix, it’s a serious issue,” he said.
Last month, in reaction to Prime Minister Liz Truss’s mini-budget, the pound plunged to a historic low, dramatically cutting its value against the Canadian dollar.
Stirling collapsed after Ms. Truss gambled that she could cut taxes for the rich while borrowing billions of pounds to help consumers and businesses struggling with energy bills.
She was forced into a policy U-turn, and fired her chancellor in an attempt to reassure the markets and save her job.
Stirling recovered to its former value. But on Thursday, the pound dipped and then rallied again when Ms. Truss announced she will step down after only 45 days in office.
The pound’s value against the Canadian dollar has dropped by around 9 per cent over the past year, fuelled by political instability.
Ms. Truss’s predecessor as Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, announced his resignation in July.
Canada holds currency reserves that include millions in stirling, the value of which has fluctuated with the turmoil in exchange rates.
Canadians selling property and other assets in the U.K. and receiving rents when the British pound collapsed last month saw their income plunge when they converted the funds to Canadian dollars. Some decided to keep their money in the U.K. until the pound recovered.
The Finance Minister, who worked in London as deputy editor of Financial Times, bought a red-brick, terraced house, which used to be social housing owned by Lambeth Council, with her husband, Graham Bowley, in 2002.
They bought a first-floor flat opposite their house in 2004.
It was previously a council flat that had been sold off. A similar property on the same street in Waterloo, South East London, is rented at £1,650 per month, according to a local real estate listings.
Ms. Freeland has declared rental income from both properties according to Parliamentary rules. Her office declined to comment.
Mr. Champagne has also declared rental income from his London flats according to the rules. He has repaid two mortgages he held with the Bank of China on the properties. His office declined to comment.
Also affected by the diminished value of the pound over the past year are 127,000 people living in Canada receiving pensions from the U.K., because they lived and worked there.
The U.K. government freezes the value of the pensions once people move to Canada.
Ian Andexser, chairman of the Canadian Alliance of British pensioners, criticized successive U.K. governments for refusing to uprate the value of British pensions in Canada to keep up with inflation.
The value of the pound and “tumultuous” exchange rates is causing added uncertainty for British retirees living in Canada, he said.
“When the pound fluctuates to the extent it has this year, it exacerbates the problems with the frozen value of the pension. It’s tragic.”

WHO BUYS A HOUSE SIGHT UNSEEN?: EVERY MOVE IS FRAUGHT WITH RISK, BUT THERE’S ALSO THE PROMISE OF NEW ADVENTURES AND EXCITING EXPERIENCES, CHRIS MCDOWALL WRITES

Full text: Less than one year ago, we bought a house before ever setting foot in it. It was not exactly the most financially sound decision we’ve ever made. This was compounded by the fact that less than two years ago, we had no intention of moving from our urban home.
It started innocently enough. Conversations with friends who had retired or were about to lit a fire in us that didn’t need much fuel to ignite our own plans. Soon I was receiving listings from real estate agents all over the lower mainland of British Columbia, Vancouver Island and B.C.’s Gulf Islands. Twice we came within days of buying a home without ever setting foot inside it. Luckily, saner heads prevailed.
“Who does that?! Not us,” we said with a healthy dollop of smugness. Then, no less than two months later, we did exactly that – and bought a home based mostly on seeing listing photos. Needless to say, our decision raised a few eyebrows.
But to be fair to ourselves, we weren’t relying entirely on those photos.
A good friend had told us, “For obvious reasons, real estate listing photos generally focus on just the house and not so much on the local surroundings. Is the house next to a maximum-security prison or the town landfill site?” They suggested using Google Earth to get a “birds’ eye” view of the property and its neighbours. After establishing that there weren’t any surprises, we gave ourselves the green light. We bought this new home in record time.
Our new home ticked all the right boxes. It’s nestled on the side of a steep hill with a stunning view of the Sechelt Inlet, and just two hours from Vancouver. It was love at first sight. It matched our search criteria perfectly, including its minimal use of stairs.
Given that we’re both close to retirement age, we thought it was a wise and mature decision to look for a home with a minimum of ups and downs. Buying a house virtually? Piece of cake, we thought and felt pretty good about our purchase.
Our smugness would turn into a slap in the face.
We had heard many a cautionary tale in which the home buyers got caught up in the emotion of the purchase, which led to some shocking discoveries down the road: rodent infestations, leaky pipes or the empty lot across the street getting rezoned for a fast-food restaurant. Nope. That wasn’t going to happen to us, and it didn’t. But our “thorough” review of the sellers’ photos missed one tiny, but far-reaching fact about our new home. What appeared to be a slightly steep, short driveway turned out to be the exact opposite. At close to 100 feet long and angled like a rocket launcher, the G-force produced when ascending our driveway is noticeable. Regardless, we felt we could master this minor oversight in no time flat. The same cannot be said about delivery vans, starting with the moving company.
The mover didn’t arrive with a large tractor trailer – thank goodness – but the truck was still uncomfortably long. They first tackled the driveway headon – four times in fact – but never reached a satisfactory unloading point. They tried backing up the incline three times; the last time two of the back wheels slipped off the side of the concrete. We were afraid our worldly possessions were about to pass before our eyes as we watched the truck list toward the forest that bordered our driveway. Luckily, a small correction avoided a catastrophe, and the truck was quickly emptied.
There were more attempted summits of our driveway, some successful, but at a price. Others were simply aborted. The day after we arrived, we heard a knock at our door. I opened it to find a middle-aged woman bent over, her arm leaning on the door jam too breathless to speak. There was a bouquet of flowers between her feet. I thanked her for the delivery and offered her a glass of water. The guys driving the truck delivering our closet organizer and media centre didn’t even attempt the driveway.
They unloaded on the sidewalk and took three separate dolly trips that we needed to help push up the driveway.
That took over 45 minutes.
We had our own harrowing experience on our driveway following a rare large dump of snow. After shovelling as much as we could while sliding downhill, we hopped in the car for a trip into town. By the time we reached the last third of the driveway, our car somehow turned 90 degrees and slid toward the street and the steep cliff nearby. Luckily, my Grade 10 driver training skills kicked in and we managed to straighten out in time.
We realized we were going to have make some changes after a few ill-advised trips down the driveway with the recycling bin. Fully loaded, this blue behemoth weighs more than I do. Navigating a driveway with a 45 degree decline is just asking for trouble every two weeks.
So after much hemming and hawing, it was decided. Our beautiful home on the Sunshine Coast that has just three stairs needed the addition of 24 stairs carved out of the side of hill adjacent to our monster driveway. The irony was not lost on either of us.
To be honest, we quite like the stairs. But ask us how we feel about them when we’re in our 70s. We could have a different answer. For now, though, they provide a lovely, winding route through our little forest on a much softer, albeit bumpier route for taking out the bins.
While delivery drivers may give us the “stink eye” when they see our driveway, and friends may shake their heads at how we purchased our home, we know our decision was the right one for us.
Would we do it again? Absolutely. Every move is fraught with risk, but there’s also the promise of new adventures and exciting experiences. That’s what we chose to focus on.

Housing top concern as the city heads to the polls: Affordability, long wait times and zoning rules are issues that some candidates have made promises to address

Full text: Amid provincial out-migration and growing concerns that Toronto could become too expensive to attract people, housing has emerged as one of the top issues in the campaign ahead of Monday’s municipal election.
The two leading candidates for mayor have promised to build a lot more housing. But there are questions about whether they would be tough enough to push back against local neighbourhood opposition – and whether they are thinking big enough.
John Tory is running for a third term as mayor in the Oct.
24 vote. His main opponent on the crowded slate is Gil Penalosa, an urbanist and consultant whose campaign is considered a long shot to unseat the incumbent.
The winning candidate will be the first Toronto leader to govern with stronger powers put in place by the provincial government that allow the mayor to override council on matters deemed important by the province. Premier Doug Ford has cited the need to quickly build significant amounts of new housing as he argued for the changes.
“This is going to be hard and there’s no way of solving the affordable housing crisis that does not involve upsetting the neighbours,” said Mark Richardson of the group Housing Now, which advocates for affordable rental.
“Both of [the leading candidates] are incredibly timid and I understand that’s how you get elected in politics. But if this is a crisis, you don’t solve a crisis with timidity.”
Housing in Toronto is often called a crisis. But Mr. Richardson pointed out it’s not just one.
The issue is complicated because it is actually several distinct crises.
There are long waiting times for affordable housing, pointing to the need to build more for people who might otherwise be homeless. And then there’s another form of affordability, which has some middle-class people, even with good jobs, unable to buy a home in Toronto. And rents have soared even as real estate prices have faltered, pushing that option out of reach for many.
Not all of this can be tackled by a mayor, but the leading candidates have made promises that could move the dial.
Mr. Tory says he would build on the city’s progress toward allowing what’s known as gentle density, such as laneway housing, and vows to cut red tape that can delay projects for years.
He would explore with the province a still-undefined “use it or lose it” concept that might force developers who move too slowly to reapply for building permissions.
“People can’t sit on land indefinitely, because we do have instances where people have sat on land for a long time,” he said during a recent meeting with The Globe and Mail’s editorial board.
“I recognize the fact that’s driven in fact by marketplace-related decisions, which I respect. But at the same time we have an urgent situation in hand here with the need for an increased supply of housing and so we’ll have to work out what [such a policy] means.”
Mr. Penalosa vows to push for publicly built affordable housing on public land and create a role of city architect. He would also end exclusionary zoning, which designates by law vast swaths of Toronto for only single-family homes, and pledges to allow development of up to six units a lot everywhere in the city.
“We have more than enough space with a friendly density to have a really, really good city,” he said during his own visit with The Globe’s editorial board. “It doesn’t have to be Manhattan or Houston, there’s a lot of things in the middle.”
The pledges to relax zoning rules come against a backdrop of politicians in Ottawa and Queen’s Park blaming cities for standing in the way of more housing. This argument has been made most prominently by federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and Ontario Premier Doug Ford.
There is some truth to the accusation.
In cities across Canada, zoning protects neighbourhoods primarily made up of single-family homes from added density, even as many of these areas are losing people. A change as minor as adding a rear second-floor addition requires public consultation, where unhappy neighbours can voice their opposition. As a result, nearly all recent growth in Toronto has been accommodated by a relatively small portion of the city’s area.
But this is not a new situation, and Mr. Ford did not act on the recommendation of his own expert panel earlier this year to end exclusionary zoning provincewide.
Matti Siemiatycki, a professor of geography and planning at the University of Toronto, says the fault lies not only with stubborn neighbourhoods, pointing as well to the situation of land owned privately by people that choose not to build.
“Some of the big retailers own huge sites that could house intensification that for a variety of reasons have remained unchanged for decades,” he said.
“So you know, there’s different parts of the system that each have their own incentives and reasons for why things have been slow.”
Toronto, which is home to just under 2.8 million people, projects its population growing by about one million by 2041. If this comes to pass, access to housing, which is already under pressure, could become much worse.
Mr. Richardson, the advocate, believes the strong mayor powers could help speed housing construction but only if the successful candidate is willing to be ambitious and tough.
He criticized Mr. Penalosa for proposing mid-rise buildings on busy streets that could accommodate much greater height.
And he pointed to Mr. Tory’s decision to appoint as a deputy mayor Stephen Holyday, who routinely votes against affordable housing, as an indication the incumbent is reluctant to act decisively.
“If you’re willing to crack the whip on affordable housing, you’d be cracking it at Stephen Holyday,” he said. “And so far there’s been an unwillingness to do that.”

Full text: The current crop of Toronto city councillors is more white and more male than the citizens they govern.
But there’s also a less obvious lack of diversity on council: Toronto is led overwhelmingly by homeowners at a time when nearly half the city rents.
As Toronto prepares to elect its next crop of local politicians in the city’s municipal election on Oct. 24, critics say a majority-homeowner council can’t properly represent the people it leads.
This is underlined by the fact that anti-renter bias often seems the last acceptable prejudice at city hall, where tenants are routinely portrayed as disruptive, bad for neighbourhoods and possibly criminal.
Montreal and Vancouver are the only big cities in Canada where most people rent. But Toronto has been edging for years towards majority-renter status. According to 2021 census data released last month, 48.1 per cent of the city’s residents live in rental housing.
“One of the things I think I can relate to, as a tenant, is that it’s really hard to imagine that things can even change, you know, when you’ve been disappointed by elected officials year after year after year,” said Chiara Padovani, who is running for city council in York SouthWeston.
Ms. Padovani, one of two renter candidates who have been endorsed by the advocacy group ACORN Tenants Union, is trying again to unseat veteran politician Frances Nunziata, who serves as council speaker and has been in office for 34 years.
John Tory, who is running for his third term as mayor, owns a large condo. He has promised to put in place several renter-friendly measures if he is reelected, including faster development approvals for rental housing and higher density limits in neighbourhoods.
His most prominent opponent in the mayoral race, urbanist Gil Penalosa, who owns a house, has pledged a variety of tenant protections, including rent control for buildings that receive city funding.
But the interests of renters have played a minor part so far in this race.
Tenant advocates have raised a number of concerns about the current city council’s approach to tenant issues. There was outcry when councillors voted against a measure that would have required apartment buildings to post signs warning prospective renters about building maintenance and quality issues.
Council has twice deferred a vote on regulating rooming houses citywide, which supporters argue would force illegal operators to meet higher safety standards. And councillors have refused to mandate maximum indoor temperatures for apartments in summer.
Critics also say inattention to tenant needs has been feeding into problems such as insufficient park maintenance, because councillors have their own backyards, and therefore have less need than renters for public space.
The growing prevalence of renting reflects both the surging cost of buying a house in Toronto and the city’s strict rules about what sort of housing can be built, and where.
Much of the city is protected from any serious housing development, but a few areas have seen massive growth of condominiums. Many of the owners of those condos rent them out.
And yet the rise in renters has not been reflected on city council.
Inquiries to councillors and a search of public records confirmed that a large majority of them own property in the city.
“We do know one thing from studying representation: if people aren’t at the table, it’s much more likely their issues are not going to be given the importance that other issues are,” said Dennis Pilon, an associate professor of politics at York University.
“I always say to my students, ‘Look, the problems of our society all fall on the municipal doorstep … and if local level representation isn’t good, then it means that whatever policy you try to work with is not going to be effective.’” The lack of renters on council may have to do with the fact that many councillors have been in office for extended periods of time. At today’s prices, a newly elected councillor entering the real estate market would struggle to cover a home’s carrying costs on their municipal salary alone.
But long-time councillors were often able to buy homes when prices were lower. Now, they are protected by a strong incumbency advantage. There is little turnover on council.
Also, breaking into Toronto municipal politics requires resources that renters may not have. There is no party system for up-andcomers to join.
Having more renters on council could change the city’s political discourse and priorities.
“Many good, awesome communities around this planet, whether it’s New York or London or Berlin, they have much more of a rental culture.
Great. But that hasn’t been the Canadian way,” said University of British Columbia assistant professor Paul Kershaw, founder of Generation Squeeze, an organization that advocates on behalf of young adults.
“I think we are evolving in a way where renting is going to become more common.”
Such a rise could lead to broad recognition that renting is not necessarily a transitional stage prior to buying a home.
Toronto’s city council may eventually reflect that.

Full text: Last summer, Hamilton realtor Sean St Cyr promoted a lucrative real estate investing opportunity across a number of Facebook groups. Investors could receive an average annual return of 20.2 per cent, the post stated, if they gave him a minimum of $100,000 to purchase a derelict three-storey building in the city’s east end, an area that has been in decline since a steel plant there started running into trouble decades ago.
“Have you ever wanted to learn how to make serious money in real estate like the pros?” Mr. St Cyr said in one of his many promotions for the deal.
On Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn, Mr. St Cyr regularly shares tips with his thousands of followers about how to make money through real estate investing. They are posted alongside photos of his travels and meals from the 35 countries he says he has visited.
Mr. St Cyr, a self-described international real estate investor and foodie, is one of the many investors looking for other people’s money, or OPM, on social media to fund real estate deals.
He and legions of other promoters have helped fuel the real estate investing craze in Canada that revved up when home prices soared and COVID-19 restrictions led people to spend more time online.
Every day, across the country, there’s a steady stream of requests in Facebook groups and personal pages for money to buy rental properties. Many of the promoters are everyday Canadians who have learned investing techniques online themselves.
Some of them promise mind-blowing profits and often dispense real estate investment advice.
No one knows how many investors have got involved in real estate because of this explosion of online promotion. But over the first year of the pandemic, investor buying of residential properties doubled in Canada. By the middle of last year, investors accounted for more than a fifth of the country’s home purchases.
However, with interest rates rising and real estate markets cooling, promoters may not be able to deliver the profits they have promised their investors.
That has upped the pressure on them to further raise rents, worsening the country’s affordable housing problem at a time when inflation has eaten away at Canadians’ pocketbooks.
When things go wrong with real estate, they can really go wrong. Tenants, including society’s most vulnerable, can be harshly evicted in the name of investment returns. Investors, many of whom call themselves risk-averse, lose their life savings. And no one has a full grasp of the impact these investors have on the real estate market.
Regulators do not appear to be paying attention, either. Many promotions appear to be skirting securities rules. Promoters are either unaware of the rules or know they can get away with not complying with them. Without enforcement, promoters are raising capital with little to no legal scrutiny.
“It could be that a lot of this activity is going on and the regulator’s enforcement staff is just not capturing it,” said Doug Sarro, a lawyer and University of Toronto adjunct professor who is researching how securities regulators respond to financial innovations. “Gaps in detecting and responding to misconduct reduce confidence in our markets. Market participants can’t help but ask themselves what else might be going undetected.”
Many real estate investors are unaware of the laws governing private capital markets. There, individuals and businesses raise money from a small number of sources such as wealthy individuals. That’s different from selling stocks, bonds or other securities to the public on a market such as the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Private capital markets have typically been used by small businesses and startups to help grow their operations without having to go through the greater legal requirements for selling investments on an exchange.
Because there is a lack of understanding, real estate investors often rely on word of mouth for guidance, and on friends and family.
Some also pay thousands of dollars to join private investment groups on Facebook, weekly meetups and classes. They hire mentors and investment coaches, many of whom have no training in capital markets and investor protection, unlike investment advisers who have gone through rigorous training and are subject to regulatory oversight.
Carolyn Robinson relied on one of the many real estate investment influencers in Canada. The 57-year-old worked long hours as a sales rep in the construction industry and was looking for a passive investment.
After selling her house in Maple Ridge, B.C., in 2021, Ms. Robinson moved to Vancouver when real estate and the stock market were on a roll. With inflation increasing, she didn’t want to keep her cash in a chequing account. “I didn’t want it to just sit there and do nothing or sit there and shrink,” she said.
She had heard about real estate guru Jodi Vetterl, whose website said she had a 20year career in high-tech software sales for Fortune 100 companies. Ms. Vetterl’s mantra is to “invest only if you understand the investment, ensure that you can sleep at night and determine your exit strategy.”
Ms. Robinson read Ms. Vetterl’s book and paid $5,000 to access training modules and join a network of investors.
The book included a chapter on Saskatchewan-based real estate company Epic Alliance Inc., and a description of the company’s investment opportunities.
At the time, Ms. Vetterl was promoting promissory notes, or short-term loans, for the company that would provide an annualized return of 18 per cent. Investors could take their money out after six months and receive a return of 9 per cent.
Ms. Robinson said it seemed like a good way to take her first step into real estate investing. Until that point, she had mainly invested in mutual funds.
She also researched Epic online, and could only find glowing reviews. So, Ms. Robinson made a sizable investment in a promissory note in mid-September, 2021.
In October, she invested in another. Later that month, the Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority (Saskatchewan’s securities regulator) issued a temporary ceasetrade order telling Epic to stop trading securities.
Ms. Robinson was shocked. She had never heard of the FCAA. She said she received an e-mail from Ms. Vetterl, who repeated that investors had to do their own due diligence.
What Ms. Robinson did not know was that, according to other investors, in May, 2021, Epic had told investors the FCAA may contact them about their investment. Ms. Robinson had joined Ms. Vetterl’s investor group in June – one month after the Epic disclosure. “I wasn’t even aware of it when I joined the group,” she said. “There was no care taken to make sure that I knew.” A few months later, in January, Epic’s founders shuttered operations, stating the business’s money was gone and it was bankrupt.
The company had acquired at least 700 houses in Saskatoon and North Battleford and told investors it was either flipping or renting the homes for profit. But some of the homes had no tenants. And many weren’t generating enough rent to earn the promised returns, according to a report by court-appointed inspector Ernst & Young.
Instead, Epic was using funds from share issuances and promissory notes to cover various operating expenses and shortfalls in its business, according to the E&Y report.
By early August, a bankruptcy order was issued against Epic, according to filings.
More than 200 individuals, including Ms. Robinson, are seeking to recoup their investments, which totalled $211.9-million.
Ms. Vetterl did not respond to multiple requests for comment. After The Globe and Mail started reaching out to Ms. Vetterl, her personal website changed to say it was undergoing scheduled maintenance.
It’s not clear if Ms. Vetterl had a referral arrangement with Epic. She is named as an investor on E&Y’s list of creditors. Epic operated a program in which existing investors were paid $1,000 for each referral of a new one, as well as 1 per cent of promissory note proceeds.
Reflecting on what went wrong, Ms. Robinson said, “I knew that due diligence was important. I had hoped that the track record of people who know more about this added some safety. And I was wrong.”
A key tenet espoused by real estate investment gurus is to finance deals using OPM.
And the search for that money has exploded on social media.
In Facebook real estate investing groups, there are all types of offerings from resorts in Ontario’s cottage country and student housing in Sackville, N.B., to small rental buildings in Hamilton, Saskatoon and Edmonton.
Some marketing materials tout investments as “money-making heaven,” and promise annual returns of 20 per cent, 40 per cent, 60 per cent, 80 per cent and even “infinite returns.”
Real estate investment promoters ask
their friends, family, colleagues and pretty much anyone for money. They often say all it takes is the proper mindset to successfully find OPM – also known as capital raising.
That has led everyday investors into the world of private capital, which is dominated by wealthy people and is considered risky because the investments generally lack transparency and lock investors in for a period of time.
While securities watchdogs are only in charge of securities, not real estate, many of the requests for OPM seem to cross into the world of securities. There are two main reasons for this. The first is that securities regulators oversee private capital markets, which are also known as the exempt market because offerings can be exempt from filing a prospectus. A prospectus is a document filed with regulators that contains financial statements – normally audited – and details about the promoter and the deal.
The second reason is that many deals appear to line up with a decades-old legal test that defines a security as an investment contract. As part of that contract, an individual must invest money in an enterprise and reasonably expect to make a profit, thanks to the efforts of another party.
Securities experts say the requests for OPM generally fit that definition.
“When someone raises capital to buy and manage real estate, they’re issuing securities. There’s no ambiguity here. They need to comply with securities law,” said Mr. Sarro, who used to develop investor protection policy at the Ontario Securities Commission.
However, it is easy to play fast and loose with the rules because they are complicated and easy to evade.
On Facebook, there are reams of real estate investment pitches that appear to be securities. They include offerings to socalled accredited investors (who are wealthy and assumed to be sophisticated) or the promoter’s close relations, including friends, family and business associates. The two categories exempt the promoter from filing a prospectus, but the trade must still be filed with regulators.
Many real estate promoters who pitch deals on Facebook appear to be completely unaware of securities rules. Others show some awareness and say the deal is for accredited investors or close relations. But in many of those pitches reviewed by The Globe, there was no evidence promoters filed the required documents with regulators.
As well, Facebook feeds are teeming with promoters looking for joint venture partners to provide capital for a property that is expected to generate high double-digit returns. But the promoters seem to lack knowledge that it could be a security.
For example, a company called Serenity Business Facilitators Inc. pitched a “money-making heaven” for an investment in a resort in Coboconk, Ont., in cottage country. The Facebook posting, from fall of last year, said the return on investment was 62.77 per cent and the 11-unit waterfront property qualified by itself for a mortgage.
The company said it was looking for one or more joint-venture investor partners and the minimum investment was $300,000.
A former securities regulator called these types of double-digit returns ludicrous.
“People have to worry about, you know, good stuff versus bad stuff. Forty per cent ROI annually? That’s like, that’s ridiculous,” David Gilkes, a former Ontario securities regulator who helped the province develop exempt market rules and now runs compliance firm North Star Compliance and Regulatory Solutions Inc.
Serenity is not registered with regulators. The company’s chief executive, Sergio Amatller, said his offerings were not securities and he had never heard of the exempt market. Mr. Amatller has taken courses by prominent Canadian real estate investing educators. He said he was taught that as long as it was a joint-venture deal, it was not a security. “I have to explicitly show that I’m looking for partners,” he said.
Mr. Amatller said he works with a lawyer who specializes in real estate investing and has never been told otherwise. After talking to a Globe reporter, Mr. Amatller said he would consult a securities lawyer immediately. “If it is a security, well I will start working properly,” said Mr. Amatller, adding he could not imagine having troubles with regulators because of a misunderstanding or lack of education.
Serenity included a disclaimer in tiny print in its offering documents. Disclaimers are used to warn potential investors of any risks associated with the investment.
They are not supposed to be used to shield the issuer from all responsibility.
In Serenity’s pitch, the disclaimer said it was an “estimate only and cannot represent the exact return for this property as it may fluctuate depending on the market.”
In Mr. St Cyr’s pitch, his disclaimer said the pitch “is intended for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon by recipients hereof.” Other common disclaimers say the pitch is “for educational and discussion purposes only.”
Securities lawyers dismiss boilerplate disclaimers and say there are rules against misrepresentations.
“You can’t cover yourself like that. ‘I plan on boldface lying to you. So I think that I’ve covered myself by saying, or putting a disclaimer you know that these numbers may not be accurate,’” said Alixe Cormick, a lawyer who runs Vancouver-based securities law firm Venture Law Corp.
A common use of OPM is a business arrangement that real estate investment gurus call a joint venture, or JV.
The JV is typically set up as an agreement between the experienced promoter (active partner) and an investor (money partner).
JVs are often used by promoters who can no longer qualify for residential mortgages in their name because they’ve reached borrowing limits. Many promotions specify they’re looking for an investor who can also be a mortgage qualifier.
Here, the investor provides the down payment, gets the mortgage, goes on the property’s title and becomes the legal owner of the property. The promoter manages the property and renovations. The partners have a separate agreement – the JV agreement – that stipulates they both own the joint venture and will split the proceeds (or losses) when it comes time to sell.
Mandy Branham is known in the real estate investing world as the JV Queen because that is how she has built her real estate empire of more than 100 properties in Canada. Ms. Branham tells her followers it is important to sign the JV agreement after the money partner, or passive investor gets the mortgage. She calls the two parties coventurers and said what they have signed is a profit-sharing agreement. She has told her followers her JVs do not cross any lines with banks.
“There’s no money transferred from them to me to be able to close on the property. The property is not in my name, I am not on title,” Ms. Branham said in an interview.
Federal banking rules stipulate that “any equity investor or arrangement that may impact equity should be disclosed to the lender,” according to the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. The regulator said the guideline focuses on the due diligence leading up to the mortgage qualification.
And lenders say they are strict about beneficial owner disclosures. Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s largest mortgage lender, said all individuals with an interest in a residential property must be disclosed.
If the co-ownership arrangement is signed after the bank provides the mortgage, the borrower must get approval from their lender. “The client is required by the terms of the mortgage to obtain the consent of the bank of the change in beneficial or legal ownership,” said Beth Herrema, RBC’s vicepresident of home equity financing. “Failure to obtain the bank’s consent would give the bank the right to demand immediate repayment.”
Ms. Branham reiterated that she does not own the property. “There’s no lines being crossed because I am not, I’m not vested in the property, I am vested in the profit or loss of said property.”
She compared her role to that of a glorified property manager. “To a lender, I’m a property manager and anything that a property manager can do, that’s what I do,” she said.
Real estate JVs can also be considered an investment contract. A recent FCAA enforcement case determined that a JV-owned rental property in Regina was an investment contract, according to a panel decision dated March 7.
Even though the investors owned the land and the building through the JV agreement, the FCAA panel said it was an investment contract, not real estate, because the investors were only responsible for providing the capital and therefore were passive investors. As well, the promoter was responsible for the management and success of the property – components of the legal test that determines whether an asset is an investment contract.
However, the issue is not clear cut. The Canadian Securities Administrators would not comment on whether a JV was a security. The CSA said it is best to consult a securities lawyer.
Like Serenity’s Mr. Amatller, Ms. Branham said none of the major real estate investing educators have mentioned securities rules. “If there’s something that somebody said to me ‘Mandy, you need to legalize.’ Tell me. Tell my accountant. Tell my lawyer and I will make sure that I can conform to that,” she said.
Sean St Cyr’s Hamilton investment mentioned using a popular real estate investing method that involves renovating the building to attract higher rents. That method is known as BRRRR and stands for Buy, Renovate, Rent, Refinance, Repeat.
“This property has MASSIVE uplift potential and will be an excellent BRRRR opportunity!” wrote Mr. St Cyr in his Facebook post dated July 5, 2022.
He was offering $100,000 stakes in a limited partnership that would form a corporation to own the property. The plan would convert the building from nine residential units to 14, and increase rents by 75 per cent.
Tenant Matt Logie was one of the last holdouts at 573-577 Barton Street East in Hamilton in the months after it was sold to Mr. St Cyr and his investors.
Mr. Logie rented a single room on the second floor of the three-storey building for $550 a month.
There were broken doors and windows, electrical problems, bedbug and mice infestations, and no smoke alarms. Neighbouring business owners said for years the previous owner had rented out the boarded-up, ground-floor commercial space for people to live in.
It was all the 54-year-old Mr. Logie could afford.
He is a carpenter, but has been unable to work for the past two years. His injuries began when a beam fell on his shoulder while on the job in 1999. Now, some days he can’t walk.
“I’ve got pins and wires in my shoulder, herniated discs in my back and my nerves – sciatica.”
The social assistance income he receives all goes to rent. He can’t afford a phone.
Mr. Logie lived in a room not much bigger than a closet and shared a kitchen and bathroom with a good friend. They kept their section neat and tidy, and tried to make it livable. They sealed up cracks with steel wool to keep the mice out, and paid for pest control and smoke alarms out of their own pockets.
Many people on this stretch of Barton live in deep poverty – more than a quarter have a household income under $25,000 a year.
Mr. St Cyr’s plan to deliver a 20.2-per-cent annual return to investors relied on increasing rents by 75 per cent after evicting tenants and renovating the building.
But Mr. Logie and another tenant in the building say they never received an eviction notice for renovations.
Mr. St Cyr said several eviction notices for renovations were served to tenants, according to a letter Mr. St Cyr’s paralegal, Andrew Choubeta, sent to The Globe. The letter declined to provide documentation, citing confidentiality.
On Sept. 15, 2021, The New Colonial Ltd, of which Mr. St Cyr is a director, purchased the property for $1.6-million.
As soon as the new company took ownership, tenants say the new owners relentlessly put pressure on them to move out – entering units without notice and threatening to throw their belongings out if they didn’t move right away.
In response to the allegation, the Choubeta letter said he served the tenants with eviction notices and then filed the required paperwork with the province. The letter said landlords are encouraged to work with tenants under provincial rules.
Then, the new owners started demolition work, tearing out walls, kicking up a storm of dust and piling construction debris that blocked hallways and fire escapes. Mr. Logie says that one day, the vibrations coming from the work above his room were so strong a heavy pane of glass fell from his cabinet. Mr. Logie had to move quickly to stop it from falling on his cat, but it smashed his TV.
Mr. Logie’s elderly neighbour started having trouble breathing and her nose wouldn’t stop bleeding, according to the superintendent. She was hospitalized for six days, the superintendent said. According to the letter, Mr. St Cyr was unaware of any medical issue resulting from the construction.
Then one Saturday morning in November, the power was shut off. A notice posted on the front door of the ground floor said: “We will shut off the electricity of the building for safety purposes. Please contact my paralegal Andrew Choubeta for any questions or concerns.” The tenants said Mr. Choubeta and Mr. St Cyr didn’t answer the phone. Tenants also said power was restored on Sunday night, but that only occurred after they contacted a local news station.
In response to the allegations, Mr. Choubeta’s letter said his office fielded calls from more than 33 tenants and provided a timeline for the repair, which he said was necessitated by someone tampering with the electrical panel.
The few remaining tenants could have fought to stay, but they were at their breaking point. They eventually agreed to leave. Mr. Logie received $3,000. Others got less or nothing. The tenants say the compensation was offered only after advocacy group ACORN stepped in and told the landlord they couldn’t terminate the tenancies without an eviction order.
Mr. Choubeta’s letter said the landlord had offered additional compensation above the guideline required by the province long before ACORN’s involvement.
At the end of January, 2022, Mr. Logie and his friend moved out. They helped the couple move into a seniors’ residence.
On April 2, 2022, Mr. St Cyr posted a video promoting a networking event. It included footage taken at the property, including altercations with tenants, photos of their personal belongings and lock change notices. It also showed ripped-out walls and ceilings – the work done without permits and while tenants were living there. “We are going to be walking through our gutted 15 unit conversion and showing how we nearly doubled our investor returns in just 7 months!,” said a caption on the video.
By mid-April, the property was transferred to 13785840 Canada Inc. for $2,750,000. The price jumped $1,150,000 in just seven months, without any completed renovations or tenants. It’s not clear if Mr. St Cyr relied on any exemptions for capital raising. No reports of the trade were filed with regulators by any companies named in the deal.
According to the letter, Mr. St Cyr declined to comment on the structure of the deal and whether he had complied with securities rules. Confidential reasons were also cited for not providing information.
Mr. Logie says he and the other tenants were forced out. “Jeez, I’m crippled and I got to run around trying to find a place.
Find a place, no phone, no nothing.” He managed to find another room, this one for $580 a month, but it’s also in disrepair.
He’s living without his friend. He says they had a good thing going at the old place.
“We were driven out.”
One of the perennial problems for regulators is the lack of resources. Securities watchdogs don’t have the time or people to investigate every potential investment opportunity that pops up on Facebook.
At the same time, securities regulators can take an expansive view of what a security is, particularly if no other financial regulator seems to be policing transactions that look like promoters soliciting investors for money-making opportunities.
A spokesperson for the Canadian Securities Administrators, the national umbrella group for provincial and territorial securities regulators, would not say whether regulators were looking at broadening enforcement to take in a wide range of real estate fundraising solicitations, including those posted on social media.
Ilana Kelemen, the spokesperson, said the exempt market is inherently higher risk but “anyone who is seeking investors to raise capital” should know the rules and “operate in compliance with investment regulations.”
She said regulators have generally increased their focus on digital spaces. Provincial securities regulators are monitoring online communities and social-media platforms to detect potential misconduct, she said. Asked if regulators were looking at capital raising among real estate promoters on social media, Ms. Kelemen said, “We have not publicly announced a review of this issue.”
There’s a school of thought in policing called “broken windows” that says a small sign of disorder leads to more disorder, and eventually more serious crimes. If the broken window does not get fixed, it shows that no one cares and it is okay to break more windows.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission employed a broken-windows enforcement strategy to go after minor securities violations, saying when they are ignored, that can “foster a culture where laws are increasingly treated as toothless guidelines.”
Perhaps Canadian regulators could take a page from the SEC’s playbook.
Until then, anything goes in the world of real estate investing. No one appears to worry about the rules because nothing ever happens.
Real estate lawyer Barry McGuire, who runs a real estate investing education group on Facebook, sums up the prevailing attitude.
In one of Mr. McGuire’s YouTube videos called “joint ventures: legal level 2,” he said that one of the best defences is to ensure the joint-venture investment is a “roaring success.”
“There is probably, you know, a 99.999per-cent chance that if you’ve worked with someone and you have a very successful joint venture, you’re never gonna be in trouble with the securities commission because you’re never going to be reported,” he said.
In response to a query from The Globe, Mr. McGuire said that was a “practical observation, but definitely not legal advice.”

Full text: 38 Avoca Ave., Ph 7, Toronto ROSE DALE - MOORE PARK Asking price: $599,000 (August, 2022) Previous asking price: $688,000 (June, 2022); $648,000 (July, 2022) Selling price: $602,000 (August, 2022) Taxes: $2,540 (2022) Days on the market: Two Listing agent: Elli Davis, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada THE ACTION It took seven weeks this summer and two price cuts to find a buyer for this one-bedroom penthouse near David A.
Balfour Park. As soon as a previous visitor learned the unit’s price tag had been reduced to $599,000, they came back and negotiated a deal sweetened by a $3,000 bonus at $602,000.
“Right now, we’re in a transitional market, so it’s hard to pinpoint exactly when you think something will sell, so you always have to try and see, and if it doesn’t move, you have to adjust,” agent Elli Davis said.
WHAT THEY GOT This 683-square-foot unit on the 16th floor of a 24-year-old building has nine-foot ceilings and travertine stone flooring in the foyer and kitchen.
The combined living and dining area has hardwood flooring, a gas fireplace and sliding balcony doors.
The unit includes a storage locker and parking. Monthly fees of $794 cover the cost of utilities, cable and 24-hour concierge.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s a penthouse with an uncovered balcony and nice west view toward Yonge and St. Clair,” Ms. Davis said.
“It’s a smaller unit in a building that has larger units and much higher prices, so you have the benefit of living in a luxury building, like a smaller house on a great street.”
The building has a private courtyard and is close to local shops and eateries. “The building itself is lovely, right by a ravine, walking trail and subway,” Ms. Davis said.

Full text: 888 Barrick Rd.
PORTCOL BORNE, ONT.
Asking Price: 2,650,000 Taxes: $8,046.93 (2022) Land Size: 26.7 acres Agents: Paul Maranger and Christian Vermast, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada THE BACKSTORY It was the promise of a fly-fishing adventure on the Restigouche River that first lured Nicolas Secord into the fiddlehead business in the early 1970s.
Young Nick grew up fishing and foraging for fiddleheads in and around Saint John. A friend who ran the local Dominion store needed a supply of the seasonal delicacy for his customers. In return for a bounty of fresh greens, the grocer would include him on a fishing trip aboard his boat.
Mr. Secord tramped through nearby woods and wetlands, collecting the curled shoots of young fern plants for diners to savour during the short window between the plants poking up through the soil and unfurling their fronds.
After Mr. Secord had secured his spot on the fishing boat, other grocers began calling him, hoping to place an order. Mr. Secord’s entrepreneurial instincts kicked in and he launched his own business.
At the time, most Canadians had little familiarity with the vegetable so popular in Quebec and the Maritimes. Over the years, Mr. Secord began to push to the west.
Nick and Nina Secord met in 2003, and gradually Ms. Secord became more involved in her husband’s business. In 2007, they purchased a 26.7-acre plot of agricultural land outside her hometown of Port Colborne, Ont.
“It was a total bog, really, when we purchased it,” recalls Ms. Secord.
But that moisture is essential for cultivating ferns.
As their business expanded in Canada and beyond, the couple set out to establish the first fiddlehead farm in North America.
THE FARM TODAY The Secords began by excavating the wetlands and using the soil to build a road into the property. That effort created six man-made ponds, including one for swimming.
In the late fall, they had 300,000 dormant fern plants harvested on the Gaspe Peninsula in Quebec and packed into jute bags to be transported to the farm by truck.
“There is no manual or book on how to plant or take care of fiddleheads,” Ms. Secord says.
The couple paid local workers by the sack to replant the ferns. Most of the workers dug rows, as they would for growing tomatoes or potatoes.
But one worker figured he would get more money for less work if he dug larger holes and dumped the plants in by the sackful.
As it turned out, those were the ferns that thrived.
“What we discovered is that fiddleheads like to be together,” Ms. Secord says.
The plants, which spread by underground rhizomes, caught extremely well and pop up again each spring, Ms. Secord says.
The couple had the plants spread out around the ponds and created pathways through the low-lying areas to reach them.
During that time, the Secords began work on a house, which they set on a high point of land.
The bungalow, which took two years to build, has 4,465 square feet of living space on two levels.
Ms. Secord says she and her husband designed the house to accommodate large groups of friends and family. Her aim was to create a comfortable setting for relaxing.
Many casual gatherings have taken place in the great room, with a vaulted ceiling 15-feet high. A fireplace with stone surround faces the kitchen and dining area.
Outside, there’s a large terrace overlooking the pond, with space for dining al fresco under a pergola.
The primary bedroom has an ensuite bathroom with an air jet tub and a shower. There’s also a door leading to a private balcony overlooking the pond.
The lower level has a home office, a recreation room and a sauna. There’s also a walkout to the garden.
A 519-square-foot guest house attached to the main building can be used as a groundskeeper’s residence or an apartment for extended family.
Outside, the couple created walking trails and planted willow trees around the ponds.
Over the years, Ms. Secord has held many events on the farm, including award presentations for the winners of culinary contests.
In order to educated home cooks about the preparation of fiddleheads, the Secords invited chefs from culinary schools to create their own recipes and enter them into competition.
Ms. Secord recruited well-known chefs as judges and invited the finalists to the farm for a cook-off. One year, the entrant from a culinary school in New York won with his Jamaican take on fiddlehead greens.
Over the years, Ms. Secord has seen the vegetable turned into soups, smoothies, pate, quiches, pizza and ice cream.
Ms. Secord is retiring and her daughter is taking over the business under the new brand name of Forage Girl. While some of the ferns planted on the Ontario farm remain in the landscape, Forage Girl has a plant in Quebec for cleaning and packaging the fiddleheads – 99 per cent of which are collected in that province.
The farm is located in a rural area with the Wainfleet Bog Conservation Area and hiking and cycling trails nearby.
Port Colborne sits on the north shore of Lake Erie at the upper entrance of the Welland Ship Canal.
Niagara Falls and the wineries of the Niagara region are a short drive away.
The U.S. city of Buffalo is about 30 minutes away by car.
THE BEST FEATURE Ms. Secord enjoys the tranquility of the farm. The ferns surrounding the ponds sway in the breeze, and birds and wildlife pass by.
“It’s a beautiful property for children,” she says. “They swim the ponds. They fish the ponds.”
Ms. Secord says the fiddleheads are the first green shoots to appear each year.
“You always know it’s spring when the fiddleheads pop. It makes the property even more beautiful.”

Why investors dominate the Calgary condo market: More than 60 per cent of the city’s units are rented out — the largest share in Canada

Full text: Unlike similar properties in Vancouver and Toronto, condos in Calgary are often regarded as a questionable investment due to their sensitivity to local economic swings.
Nevertheless, in 2021 Statistics Canada found that more than 60 per cent of condo units in Calgary’s central neighbourhoods were rented out by investors –the largest share in Canada.
Some of the reasons for this are related to the lower barriers investors face in entering this market, compared to more expensive cities, as well as the prevalence of “makeshift” investors in Calgary’s condo market, explains Amanda Ku, a Calgary realtor and property manager.
The availability of larger homes at a reasonable pricepoint, means that for many Calgarians condo living is a temporary choice. And although new residents initially choose to live in a condo upon moving to Calgary, eventually they relocate to a more spacious home elsewhere in the city. “Calgary has been positioned as bigger bang for your buck, based on the affordability compared to Vancouver and Toronto,” says Ray Wong, vice-president of data operations at Altus Group.
Indeed, seeking more space in the face of lifestyle changes, Calgarians usually live in a condo for up to seven years, Ms. Ku says, but in Calgary’s boom-and-bust economy, this often means condo owners have to choose between selling at a loss or holding on to their property until the market shifts – and many choose the latter.
After the birth of their first child in the fall of 2020, Ryan Meier and Christina Mattern realized that their idea of raising a child in a two-bedroom condo in Calgary’s Beltline would be more challenging than they expected.
With both working from home during the pandemic, space in their unit became insufficient.
The couple was also concerned about construction and vehicle noise interrupting their newborn’s sleep patterns. “The sound was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Ms. Mattern says, noting that having the grandparents had been an important consideration.
“We want a space where we can have our family visit and feel comfortable, and for us to be comfortable in our own space,” she says. “So that got us thinking we need[ed] to stretch our wings and leave the downtown to find something with at least another bedroom.”
While life in the Beltline was ideal for the millennial couple, they had to trade some of the perks of living at this location for the spaciousness of a four-bedroom duplex in Mount Pleasant, an inner-city neighbourhood in Calgary’s northwest.
“I originally chose the Beltline largely for the lifestyle,” Mr. Meier says, emphasizing the neighbourhood’s walkability and being in close proximity to friends, work and nightlife on 17th Avenue. “It was the place to live, if you’re going to live in a condo.”
Having purchased the Beltline condo in the summer of 2015, when condo prices were starting their steep decline, Mr. Meier decided to hold on to the property instead of selling at a loss when he and his wife moved out in 2021. “[We’re] waiting for the market to turn around a bit more in terms of the value of properties in the condo market,” he says. “That would be a factor that would impact our decision to sell, if we can recoup what we put into the original purchase price – that’s a gap for us at this moment.”
Mr. Meier and Ms. Mattern are well-positioned to make this decision, as he purposefully acquired a condo property that would be competitive in Calgary’s rental market in the future, and opted for a larger unit in a recently renovated building with reasonable condo fees, as well as inexpensive amenities.
And his effort paid off. In the summer of 2021, the couple rented out their condo to tenants who’ve renewed their lease for a second year. “We were a bit worried at the time,” Mr. Meier says.
“But we didn’t have any trouble finding what turned out to be really great tenants.”
For those looking at their condo property as a long-term investment, Calgary’s market can present many opportunities, as roughly 40 per cent of the rental market in this city is supplied by condo units. According to Ms. Ku, investors in her portfolio tend hold on to their condo properties in Calgary between 10 to 15 years.
“It really depends on the individual’s return expectations,” Mr. Wong says. “How long do they want to hold the asset before using that to get started in the real estate sector and eventually using that property to buy another, or to fund their own place down the road.”
This year, an influx of people relocating to Calgary has reinvigorated the demand for condo properties in both the resale and rental market. In the second quarter of 2022, net interprovincial migration in Alberta recorded the largest increase since 2014.
Additionally, higher interest rates have been beneficial for this segment. “The higher interest rates will push people out of various property types, and impact what people can afford,” says Ann-Marie Lurie, chief economist at the Calgary Real Estate Board (CREB).
In September, despite a softening of Calgary’s residential market, year-over-year sales in the condo segment increased by 60 per cent, according to CREB data, creating balanced market conditions for the first time in eight years.
“We haven’t had a threemonth supply scenario since back in 2014,” Ms. Lurie says, noting that since the economic downturn the months of supply in September have averaged about five months.
Driven by interprovincial migration, increased demand has also allowed for moderate price gains in this segment, with condo benchmark prices rising over 10 per cent so far this year – the largest yearly increase since 2014.
“[Prices] have had some strong gains,” Ms. Lurie says. “But for some condo sellers, it still depends on when they bought.”
For those who purchased a condo unit in the wake of the 2014 downturn, like Mr. Meier, prices are yet to catch up. In September, 2014, the benchmark price for a condo unit in Calgary was $298,800, today it’s $277,900.
Newer builds located in walkable, amenity-rich communities are better positioned to capitalize on price gains, Ms. Ku says, as the growing demand for this type of property ensures a competitive cash flow for investors whether a unit is rented out in the long- or short-term market.
In the coming months, however, price gains and sales in Calgary’s condo market could be affected by further interest rate hikes, Mr. Wong says. “Potentially two more interest rate increases this year may slow down investors.”
Higher interest rates are also likely to limit the opportunities for first-time buyers to enter the market, he adds, fuelling the demand for rentals and boosting the appeal of condos as investment property.
“I don’t think we’re going to see an overall downward trend [in prices], but we may see a levelling off – it depends on how many people are looking at this from an investment perspective.”
