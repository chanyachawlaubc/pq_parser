Full text: The first meeting of Evan Siddall’s new CEO Council had an inauspicious start. The newly appointed chief executive officer of Alberta Investment Management Corp. gathered fellow leaders of the fund manager’s pension plan clients in Edmonton in the fall of 2021, but he got a chilly response: “I wouldn’t say hostile,” Mr. Siddall said in an interview, but it was “pretty dry ... certainly guarded conversation.”
It was easy to understand why. Those clients – representing pension plans for public servants, teachers, municipal employees, law enforcement officers and academics in the province, among others – were still stinging from AIMCo’s $2.1-billion loss on a trading strategy gone wrong when COVID-19 struck in the spring of 2020 under previous leadership.
AIMCo had been making complex derivative bets against market volatility for years, and profiting from them. But the strategy failed spectacularly when markets plunged early in the pandemic.
At the time, clients wanted AIMCo’s executives to be held accountable, but felt the pension fund manager was not forthcoming about the failures that exposed client pension plans to steep losses. It was only under pressure that AIMCo’s board conducted a formal investigation that found a poor approach to risk management, with insufficient oversight. Several top executives departed, including CEO Kevin Uebelein and chief investment officer Dale McMaster.
After Mr. Siddall arrived in Edmonton to start a new chapter at AIMCo in July, 2021, he started holding the CEO Council meetings to begin repairing damaged relationships with clients. The gatherings are held four or five times annually to give the CEOs of client plans a closer look at what the $146-billion pension fund manager is doing for the 32 pension, endowment and government funds it serves.
Two years later, there are clear signs of a thaw in relations, Mr. Siddall said as we spoke in AIMCo’s offices in Edmonton. Recent meetings have been “animated, familiar, fun, collegial.” But there’s still work to do.
“They have gone from not trusting us or being cynical, maybe, about how we approach things — a treatment we earned — to being constructively skeptical,” Mr. Siddall said. “And that’s fine, that’s totally fine.”
The council is one of a suite of new initiatives brought in since Mr. Siddall was hired to engineer an overhaul of AIMCo’s relations with its clients as well as its strategies for investing their pension dollars – and its own leadership.
Mr. Siddall thinks “transformation” is an overused word, but it would be hard to describe what he’s undertaken from his modest corner office at AIMCo’s Edmonton headquarters as anything less. In slightly more than two years at the helm of Canada’s sixth-largest pension fund manager, he has changed most of its executive team, launched a revamp of its technology systems, opened new offices abroad and shifted the way it manages risk in its investments.
Day to day, Mr. Siddall is trying to anchor AIMCo’s focus on its client base at home, even as he works to expand its investment teams abroad. Its Edmonton offices have sweeping, mostly unobstructed views across Alberta’s capital city, offering a contrast in perspectives to the crowded skylines of Bay Street or Wall Street.
“We deliberately try to put the ‘A’ back in AIMCo with our strategy and say that we serve people who serve Albertans – that’s important,” Mr. Siddall said.
That mantra rings differently now, with Alberta Premier Danielle Smith pushing a proposal to withdraw Alberta from the Canada Pension Plan and set up a provincial alternative. If she follows through on an Alberta Pension Plan, which is far from certain, AIMCo would be a plausible manager of such a fund, putting it squarely in the crossfire of a contentious national debate over the fairest course of action for pensioners.
Mr. Siddall is trying his best to steer clear of political fights, refusing to join the fray over a potential APP: “I can and have to stay out of it,” he told The Globe and Mail. “It’s not my job. It’s a policy maker’s job... And if we’re told to add clients, we’ll do the best job for them.”
He echoed that same sentiment again last week, declining to comment on the government’s plans, saying AIMCo’s focus is on “helping our clients secure longterm prosperity.” And when pressed on the matter during a lunchtime appearance at the Canadian Club Toronto this week, he added: “We haven’t even thought about it.”
Before he landed at AIMCo, Mr. Siddall had stints as a Goldman Sachs banker and Bank of Canada adviser, then earned a reputation for being outspoken – and occasionally taking controversial, if principled, stances – as CEO of the country’s national housing agency, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.
In the early months of the pandemic, CMHC predicted the average selling price of a home could plunge by up to 18 per cent in a worst-case scenario, and mortgage arrears could soar – a forecast Mr. Siddall repeatedly defended as a responsible warning even though it turned out to be wrong.
Months later, after CMHC tightened its standards for borrowers to qualify for mortgage insurance, and lost market share to private-sector rivals, he alienated prominent mortgage lenders with a sharply worded letter that chastised them for not following suit and, in his view, putting short-term profits above the country’s interests.
He speaks fast and plainly, avoiding much of the polished jargon many CEOs employ. But in his current role, he has tempered his style to be more conciliatory.
At the core of AIMCo’s new operating model is what Mr. Siddall once promised would be “a new covenant with clients,” manifested most clearly in a range of outreach efforts by the pension fund manager.
For his first year in charge, AIMCo kept count of how often it was meeting or interacting with clients – to measure its engagement with them. It rolled out an updated portal that makes it easier for clients to find information, and launched the CEO Council. It also committed to “meaningful consultations” with clients on almost anything important.
“We don’t make big decisions without them,” Mr. Siddall said.
Spokespeople for some of AIMCo’s largest clients, such as the Alberta Teachers’ Retirement Fund and Local Authorities Pension Plan, declined to discuss current relations with AIMCo. But Cory Kerr, the president of the Alberta Federation of Police Associations – a sponsor of the Special Forces Pension Plan, which is an AIMCo client – said early indications are that “AIMCo has taken the appropriate steps to avoid those missteps from the past.”
The friction between AIMCo and its pension plan and endowment clients runs deeper than the fallout from a large one-time loss on a misguided trading strategy.
It stems, in part, from the fact that most AIMCo clients are “captive,” Mr. Siddall said – required by government to entrust their pensions to the fund manager.
To cite one example, there were drawn-out, bitter negotiations with representatives for Alberta’s teachers over the province’s efforts to force the teachers’ pensions to be managed by AIMCo, until the two sides reached an investment agreement that resolved the standoff in 2021.
“Naturally, they don’t like the fact they don’t have choice,” Mr. Siddall said. But part of the answer, he added, is that AIMCo must adopt a mindset to operate as though the clients did have other options.
The outcome of AIMCo’s rapid retooling are hard to gauge at this stage. The pension fund manager posted a 3.4-per-cent loss in 2022 – which still beat the benchmark it uses to measure its performance. It was a tough year for pension plans, in which stocks and bonds took a rare simultaneous plunge, although most large Canadian plans managed to eke out modest gains.
Then, in the first half of 2023, AIMCo’s returns rebounded and it gained 4.5 per cent.
Those results may not yet be a full reflection of the new regime, as some of AIMCo’s most important hires since Mr. Siddall took over are only just getting their feet wet. New chief investment officer Marlene Puffer, who was CEO at Canadian National Railway Co.’s pension plan, started at the end of January. That same month, the Alberta manager hired David Scudellari from the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, tapping him as head of international investment and tasking him with building AIMCo’s private credit business from a newly-opened New York office.
Chief risk officer Suzanne Akers joined in April, 2022, from Franklin Templeton. “We got her from California to come to Edmonton – we told her it was cooler here,” Mr. Siddall said, as the temperature outside crept toward a high of 16 degrees on a July afternoon. And AIMCo poached chief technology officer Denise Man from Alberta-based ATB Financial that same month.
There is another notable change coming: Board chair Mark Wiseman, former CEO of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, who came in three years ago to help steer AIMCo’s turnaround and hired Mr. Siddall, is stepping down at the end of the year. His successor is expected to be named soon. And it is now much more likely that Mr. Siddall’s own successor as AIMCo’s CEO will come from inside the organization’s ranks – he said there are four internal candidates who “know who they are.”
A robust succession plan means that in the unlikely event Mr. Siddall were to have to leave suddenly, “there’s an answer now,” he said. “There’s a better answer five years from now, but there’s an answer now.”
Ms. Puffer and Mr. Scudellari, in particular, are leading a shift in the way AIMCo invests its clients’ money. For years, it has allocated a greater share of its investments to private assets such as infrastructure, real estate and private equity, which make up about 40 per cent of its portfolio, up from 27 per cent in 2019. Those assets have generally outperformed stocks and bonds in recent years, and are attractive to long-term investors such as pension funds, which can lock up money for longer periods in exchange for higher returns.
AIMCo plans to continue adding more private assets to its portfolio, when clients agree to it, Mr. Siddall said. But the investing environment – with higher interest rates than before and stubborn inflation – has meant that large institutional investors such as AIMCo have to be more careful about where they invest.
For years, many pension funds including AIMCo were still ramping up their private-market investing, chasing an abundance of deals and pushing money out the door to reach the target asset allocations they had set. Now, especially after the prices of stocks and bonds fell last year, pension funds are often at or near those targets, and have less spare money at hand to put into new investments.
“We do have dry powder, just not as much as we used to have,” Ms. Puffer said in an interview.
“We’re now in an environment where we have to be more thoughtful.”
In many cases, that means being “smarter about each asset class relative to each other,” and whether a dollar is better spent investing in a toll road or a private equity buyout.
One area that is likely to get more attention is AIMCo’s private debt and loan team, which closed 15 transactions worth more than $300-million in the first half of 2023. Building that business from New York is Mr. Scudellari, who worked with Mr. Siddall at Goldman Sachs earlier in his career.
The private debt market is growing fast, with higher interest rates and tighter lending standards at banks creating attractive conditions for private lenders. Ms. Puffer said some of AIMCo’s private debt investments yield “double-digit” returns in percentage terms, and “we’re not reaching for risk.”
Even so, AIMCo’s investment decisions are also under a tighter risk management regime, led by the new risk chief Ms. Akers, and informed by the painful lessons of the board review of 2020’s losses.
Some of the risk controls now in place at AIMCo are technical in nature – parameters for risk tolerance, sophisticated models that envision harsh scenarios and systems to analyze data. But an equally important project has been to make sure investment teams and risk managers work in tandem on investment decisions, in healthy tension.
“If you don’t have credibility, if you don’t have the relationship and the trust, then there’s not really a conversation going on,” Ms. Akers said.
Mr. Siddall described an undisclosed deal AIMCo was considering in July as an example. The head of the asset class involved was pushing for the deal, but “risk had a big problem with it,” he said. Ms. Akers took her concerns to Ms. Puffer, who held off on making a decision and called a further investment committee meeting to discuss it, inviting in more senior people – including Mr. Siddall, even though the size of the potential deal fell below the typical threshold where he gets involved.
“Marlene said, ‘Let’s have you come in and let’s have a few more eyes on this thing,’” Mr. Siddall said. “That’s good, that’s the way it should work.”
Even after so many changes in a short span, AIMCo is still a fund manager in transition.
Its international expansion in Singapore, New York and London is just getting started. Its technology refresh is in its early stages. It is still turning over its portfolio to find the right balance of public and private assets, and risk and reward, to secure its clients’ pensions for future decades. And if an APP were to become a reality – a momentous change that would take years to be negotiated – it could dramatically alter AIMCo’s role in Canada’s pension sector.
Crucially, Mr. Siddall now has a story to tell about AIMCo – to its clients, investment partners and prospective new hires – that is no longer dominated by its past mistakes.
“It’s a place with momentum,” Mr. Siddall said. “It’s undergoing change that makes sense because it’s grounded in a strategy people understand.”

Influx of new buyers driving older renters from central Calgary: Sales for condo units in city’s $1-million-plus segment doubled in first half of 2023 from 2022

Full text: Ahigh-profile corner in central Calgary is about to get a major refresh. While the growing demand for high-end units at a strategic location represents an opportunity for affluent buyers, it is bad news for existing tenants, who have to move out by July, 2024.
Located at the intersection of Kensington Road and 10th Street NW, Kensington Gate is a mixeduse, multifamily building constructed in 1991. The structure comprises 15 retail spaces and 80 rental units, as well as 10,000 square feet of office space and a 200-stall parkade.
Adrienne McManmon has rented a two-bedroom, two-bathroom penthouse in this building since 2020, after she downsized and moved to Calgary from Ontario. Paying roughly $2,000 a month in rent, Ms. McManmon’s 1,300-square-foot apartment is a rare find in one of Calgary’s most desirable areas.
“I like walking out the door here and just going to see my friends,” she says, emphasizing the importance of being surrounded by the services and amenities she needs to enable her lifestyle. “I support every business in the neighbourhood.”
But her days of enjoying these perks at a moderate cost are numbered.
In April, Sable Gate, the company that owns and operates the building, submitted a development application to transform Kensington Gate into the Kenten, a luxury condo building with units starting at $1-million – an amount well beyond Ms. McManmon’s budget. “When my husband passed, I sold our house and came to Calgary hoping to live on that money.”
A combination of factors influenced Sable Gate’s decision to rejuvenate the asset, says Sam Boguslavsky, the company’s founder and president. One is the rising cost of maintaining Kensington Gate’s aging structure, the other is a nascent demand for high-end apartments in Calgary’s urban core.
“This building is over 30 years old now, and you start seeing failures in all of its systems,” Mr. Boguslavsky says, pointing at deficiencies in the building’s mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems. “Over the last number of years, we’ve tried to protect the tenants from significant rental escalations. But as the building ages, it requires more capital, and interest rates have gone up significantly. Then, you have no alternative but to look at viable options.”
This setback gave Mr. Boguslavsky’s company pause to re-envision the future of “the most interesting corner in Calgary.
“Calgary has a lot of very interesting things going forward,” Mr. Boguslavsky says, noting that the city’s economic vibrancy and high quality of life are attracting people from all over the world.
“So when you have something unique like this project, you want to bring it into the market at a time when it feels optimal.”
In the first half of 2023, Sotheby’s International reported a doubling in sales for condo units in Calgary’s $1-million-plus segment, relative to the first half of 2022. This growth has been driven by increased demand from young professionals and downsizers looking for more space and fewer responsibilities – a market the Kenten seeks to capitalize on.
While maintaining the building’s bottom two storeys, including all retail, parking and office space, the proposal put forward by Davignon Martin, a local architecture firm, includes the reconstruction of the top seven storeys of the structure to accommodate 50 condos and 19 different layouts ranging in size between 1,115 and 4,715 square feet.
“A lot of people are downsizing, but they still want to entertain, they still want to have their kids come over, so they need a footprint,” Mr. Boguslavsky says.
“And that’s what the Kenten is doing. It provides a product that’s not readily available in the inner city.”
Kensington is a business area in central Calgary, nestled between two neighbourhoods established in the early 1900s, Hillhurst and Sunnyside. Consequently, the area is walkable and amenity-rich, with ready access to transit and surrounded by attractive green spaces such as the Bow River Pathway, Riley Park and McHugh Bluff.
“It’s a very quaint and special place,” Mr. Boguslavsky says. “It is relatively small geographically; it interacts with the downtown and the Bow [River]. The community itself has a lot of niche operators, whether it’s restaurants and galleries and movie theatres – it’s very unique not only in Western Canada, but locally as well.” The features that make Kensington attractive to affluent buyers and investors, however, are the same perks renters like Ms. McManmon enjoy. And as the appeal of this area increases, so do the concerns regarding its long-term affordability.
According to the latest data available, between 2016 and 2011, the number of households spending more than $2,000 a month in shelter costs increased by more than 60 per cent in Hillhurst and Sunnyside, as the construction of higher-end condo buildings replaced older structures.
For this reason, when the community association receives new development applications, affordability is top of mind. “For communities to thrive, no matter what its size, you need to have a mixture of incomes, education [and] family sizes,” says Becky Poschmann, a community planning co-ordinator at the Hillhurst-Sunnyside Community Association. “We want to make sure that we have that.”
(Community associations play a key role in Calgary’s planning process, as they act as liaisons between neighbours, councillors and city administration.)
The feedback the HSCA provided in response to the Kenten’s development application highlights both the net loss of rental units and of affordable units, Ms. Poschmann says. “Although we respect the introduction of more family-friendly sized condos, when the price point is a little bit higher, it does make it unaffordable for a large portion of the population.”
But the input from community associations are only suggestions.
To prevent the loss of moderately priced rental units (which are the result of decades of filtering), stronger policies are needed, says Steve Pomeroy, a researcher with McMaster University’s Canadian Housing Evidence Collaborative. “As municipalities try to focus on transit-oriented development, they also need to think about what are the logical consequences of that policy, and its potential impacts.”
There are two ways cities can ensure new buildings in transitoriented areas support affordable housing, he explains. One is by implementing an inclusionary policy that requires developers to include a percentage of affordable units, and the other is a rental replacement bylaw to either create the same number of units at a similar cost or pay cash in lieu to an affordable housing fund.
“I think having that certainty embedded in the system, ahead of development actually happening, you’ve sent the signal to the market that there are clear requirements that these developers are going to have to meet if they’re going to go ahead,” Mr. Pomeroy says.
Although Calgary City Council approved a refreshed housing strategy on Sept. 16, addressing the loss of moderately priced rental units in transit-oriented areas wasn’t part of the actions put forward. Instead, the focus of this document is on increasing the supply of housing across the city.
According to the area’s councillor, Terry Wong, the net loss of rental and affordable units in Kensington will be offset by office-to-residential conversions in the downtown core. And in terms of policy, “the thing that council can do is to add more supply,” he adds. “But also turn over lands city owns to providers at a discounted price.”
Preconstruction sales for the Kenten launched in May, but the project’s development permit is currently under review.

Jericho Lands advocates see a trade off between towers and green space: Developers argue they need to higher in order to have lots of open space

Full text: Within a few scant months, the park-like setting that is Vancouver’s Jericho Lands will be one step closer to becoming a master-planned community, developed in a joint venture partnership between MST Development Corp., and Canada Lands Co.
And emerging as the heart of the matter is the balance between green space and density – particularly height.
Proponents of towers say you can’t have both without going higher, while others argue that you can accommodate significant density without reaching for the sky.
“In order to have a lot of open space, the towers need to be a little bit higher,” says Adrienne Charlie, Squamish nation cultural liaison and member of the planning committee. “That’s a give and take of what we are trying to offer, and what people are looking for, and what we’re allowed within the parameters of what the city has for us,” Architect James Cheng said if it were his project, he’d turn the usual design process on its head and start with the green spaces.
“To me, it’s a golden opportunity for the design professional and the First Nations people,” says Mr. Cheng, designer of about 50 downtown towers, including the new zero-carbon Stack tower – the city’s tallest office building. His fear is Vancouver could turn into a concrete jungle.
“The colonial way of doing things was to divide and conquer,” said Mr. Cheng. “So we sent in engineers to subdivide the whole country into grids, and the roads and the infrastructure govern the life of the people.
“If I were working on [Jericho], I would turn it around and say, ‘How can I preserve the land? And then put the buildings around them,’ instead of fitting the density in, and then just plant a few gardens.”
The MST/Canada Lands plan so far is for 13,000 homes, although that number could change. Of that, about 2,600 would be social housing units. A city staff policy statement is expected to go to the council by January at the latest, and it could contain some recommended changes, said the city.
A revised illustration released to the public in June showed many mid-rises and three towers called The Sentinels at 49 storeys – a key concern for a residents group called the Jericho Coalition, and some others.
“We were initially looking for higher with the Sentinels, but being a little bit courteous with the people that live there, we eased up on the height,” said Ms. Charlie. “This is not a complete finish of what the design will look like.”
Density and building height haven’t been confirmed yet, she said.
The MST Development Corp.
is a partnership between the Squamish, Musqueam and TsleilWaututh nations. MSTDC and Canada Lands, the federal government’s real estate arm, own the Jericho Lands jointly.
Once the policy statement is approved, the first phase of rezoning will begin, including an official development plan. That plan will take about six months to complete and will also go before the council.
Jericho Lands is an exciting recognition of reconciliation, said Mr. Cheng.
He’d like to see a plan that honours tradition and looks beyond the site, to the reactivation of West 10th Avenue and a connection to the beaches.
He said residents’ concerns about height could be addressed by determining what views are most important to them. Some will be lost, but a compromise is achievable. So far, he said, it seems the two sides aren’t working together.
“It needs to be a connected society. We are all living in Vancouver,” said Mr. Cheng.
Peter Waldkirch, spokesperson with Abundant Housing, a group that advocates for more housing supply, said he’s less concerned about the aesthetics and more with number of units.
He fully supports the MST plan.
“We’re not talking about just shapes of buildings or how high they are,” said Mr. Waldkirch. “I think a lot of people would love to live in tall buildings if they are close to their jobs. I think there’s a huge demand for that lifestyle.” Elisa Campbell oversees Jericho Lands for Canada Lands as vice-president, west region. The only way to deliver substantial density and keep the site green is by going higher, she said. Lower heights won’t achieve the partners’ goals of sustainability and housing.
“It is through height that you can deliver a whole range of important benefits,” she said.
“Combine the number of housing units needed … and the desire to create an amazing neighbourhood, and you are going to have some height – that’s the only way to do it.
“Nobody has gotten this land for free in this project. It’s been at market value,” she added.
“I can tell you this, because I’m an architect by training and I’ve been deeply involved with our design team on this, and there is no way you can achieve all the things this project needs to achieve … with the way that others might be proposing, [such as] a lower height distribution of building. Not possible.”
If designed carefully, tall towers can work at Jericho Lands, said retired architect and urban designer Ralph Segal, who worked for the city for 25 years and led the city’s urban design group.
He called the extent and quality of the open space network of the MST plan “particularly outstanding.”
“The one aspect that raises a concern is the close-packed clustering of towers on the northeasterly portion of the site, several of which appear to have notably larger floor plates, resulting in a collective massing that has excessive shadow implications,” he said.
Mr. Segal would also like a minimum 45-per-cent affordable housing, and a definition of “affordable” that applies to actual household incomes.
The Jericho Coalition, made up of residents who served on the city’s advisory committee, drafted an alternate version of Jericho Lands. It consists of midrise buildings, up to eight storeys, mostly made of mass timber, with large courtyards and plazas and parks. Their concept is around 80 units per acre, or 7,200 units. The River District, another master-planned community, by comparison, is 56 units per acre.
They’d like to see larger units to accommodate families and a population of around 16,000 people. That compares to the MST vision of 24,000 residents.
Their concerns about the current design include too little affordable housing and investors driving up prices.
Randy Sharp, a landscape architect, said towers don’t afford a lot of landscaping because they have wide setbacks from streets and public areas, and an expanse of underground concrete parkades limits any tree growth.
“I don’t fault the MST for asking for the world. They are a developer,” added Murray Hendren, a retired BC Hydro engineer who’s concerned about the development’s environmental impact.
“But the city has a duty as well, and the city has to look after the needs of what the city requires. They’re not doing that as far as I can see.”
They fear a sea of concrete towers that are occupied by parttime visitors to the city, who aren’t around to support local businesses.
“We don’t need another Coal Harbour,” says residential designer Larry Benge, referring to the quiet downtown neighbourhood of luxury concrete towers.
“We are trying to show there is a different way.”

Full text: If you’re a CEO feeling stressed about debt, the president of US$1-trillion asset manager Blackstone Inc. wants to hear from you.
Jonathan Gray is in Canada this week to open an office in Toronto and pitch Blackstone funds – private debt, real estate and private equity – to institutional clients such as insurers and pension plans. His message is the “megatrend to alternative assets” is stronger than ever, with the headwinds facing the global economy creating more opportunities for fund managers willing to commit their capital.
Mr. Gray, 53-year-old heir apparent to Blackstone co-founder and chief executive officer Stephen Schwarzman, is also scouting for opportunities to put the New York-based asset manager’s cash to work at Canadian companies squeezed by rising interest rates and banks that are increasingly reluctant to lend.
“In credit markets, we’re seeing more opportunities to help quality companies that are stressed by balance sheet issues,” Mr. Gray said in an interview. “We’re less interested in distressed situations.”
Mr. Gray also sees an opportunity to help institutional investors that are overallocated to some asset classes or pinched for liquidity by buying parts of their commitments to funds in the secondaries market – stakes that Blackstone can pick up at “a pretty meaningful discount” of 10 per cent to 15 per cent in many cases.
At a time when high interest rates and slowing economies are making it much tougher to do deals and recycle capital, being a liquidity provider to these large investors “makes a lot of sense,” he said.
Blackstone is one of the world’s largest players in the rapidly growing private debt sector, with US$295-billion of client capital committed to credit. Mr. Gray said recent stress in credit markets, caused in part by pressures facing U.S. regional banks, is creating opportunity for lenders willing to make long-term commitments to companies.
“In credit markets, lenders can trade liquidity for superior returns,” Mr. Gray said. Over the past 12 months, private credit is Blackstone’s best performing asset class, returning 12.7 per cent.
While the amount of capital earmarked for North American private debt funds has increased fourfold since 2010, according to data serve Preqin, Mr. Gray said the sector remains far less competitive than public equity markets, with a relatively small number of fund managers lending in a US$12-trillion debt market.
Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated interest rates would likely stay higher for longer than it had previously anticipated in order to bring down inflation.
Mr. Gray said Blackstone’s fund managers concur with this view and are prepared for an economic slowdown. “You don’t fight the Fed,” he said.
Blackstone is steering clear of distressed debt – buying loans that are in default or lending to companies that have missed interest payments – because at this point in the credit cycle, the bulk of candidates are “buggy-whip business,” left behind by advances in technology or shifting consumer habits, Mr. Gray said. He also said banks tend to lock up the best assets at distressed companies, leaving private lenders with little collateral.
Blackstone also recently opened offices in Paris and Frankfurt, Germany. Mr. Gray said as the 38-year-old fund manager expands, “we are trying to be more local” by having investment professionals in major markets. In Canada, Blackstone owns a portfolio that includes warehouses and data centres.
As part of the fund manager’s energy transition investments, Blackstone is building a 546-kilometre electrical transmission line to link Hydro-Québec to New York, a US$6-billion project. Globally, Mr. Gray said the fund manager plans to invest US$100-billion over the next decade in businesses that will play a role in transition from fossil fuels to renewable power.
In Canada, Mr. Gray said Blackstone is targeting investments in student housing, a strategy that reflects the “housing challenges” that come with a population that is growing at five times the rate of the United States. Mr. Gray ran Blackstone’s real estate portfolio prior to becoming president in 2018.

Birmingham eyes drastic measures after years of financial woes lead U.K.’s second-largest city to file insolvency notice

Full text: A visitor to Birmingham might find it hard to believe that Britain’s second-largest city is in the midst of a financial crisis that has forced the local council to file for a form of bankruptcy.
The city’s streets are bustling and construction is booming. There are nearly £4-billion worth of projects in the downtown area, including one called Paradise, which consists of offices, hotels, restaurants, shops and a 49-storey condominium designed in the shape of an octagon. A new train station is being built for a high-speed rail service to London, and the city’s Alexander Stadium got a £72-million facelift for last year’s Commonwealth Games.
And yet, earlier this month Birmingham’s council stunned residents by announcing that it could no longer cover its expenses and had to file a notice of insolvency with the government at Westminster, which oversees municipalities.
Last week, Michael Gove, the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, appointed a set of commissioners who will take over the city’s finances and consider a range of drastic measures. They are expected to include a hike in property taxes of up to 10 per cent, cuts to local services, layoffs and the sale of cityowned assets such as the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, the Library of Birmingham and even Council House, the seat of the city government.
“These are worrying times, and I am sorry for that,” lead councillor John Cotton said during a special council meeting on Monday. “There is no quick fix. The road ahead will be extremely challenging.”
The scale of the financial challenge is staggering.
The council faces a £760-million bill to resolve a pay equity dispute with thousands of female workers who were paid around 25 per cent less than their male counterparts for years. City officials have also botched the instalment of an Oracle IT system to manage procurement and human resources. Mr. Cotton said fixing the system will cost up to £100-million, roughly five times the initial price tag.
On top of all that, the city’s financial officer said this year’s budget has an £87-million shortfall, excluding pay equity claims.
The deficit is forecast to keep growing and reach £180-million by 2028.
Eddie O’Hara, a resident and long-time social worker, is worried about where the cuts will fall, and said Birmingham has been a city of contrasts for years. The disconnect between the glittering real estate projects and the city’s dire financial state reflects deep inequality that’s about to get worse as spending restraints take hold.
“We’ve got between about 40 to 54 per cent of our children living in poverty and yet we are a phenomenally rich city,” Mr. O’Hara said as he sat on a bench outside Council House before Monday’s meeting. He gestured toward the Paradise project across the street and added: “That development that you see there, most of that will go to people who are already part of the rich affluent.”
There’s been plenty of fingerpointing over how Birmingham got into this predicament.
Councillors had been warned nearly 10 years ago about the city’s poor management practices and looming financial pressure. “The council faces very significant budget difficulties in the next few years and does not yet have credible plans to meet these,” senior civil servant Robert Kerslake said in a 2014 review of the city’s governance.
Some critics blame what they say is a bloated council of 101 members who can’t make decisions. Calgary has roughly the same population as Birmingham, around 1.1 million, but only 14 city councillors plus the mayor.
Others criticize Westminster, and say years of cuts to local funding has crippled Birmingham and other cities.
Like most cities in Britain, Birmingham relies on grants from the central government for the bulk of its £3-billion annual budget. Over the past decade, that funding has fallen by 31 per cent in real terms, according to a study by the Institute for Government, a London-based think tank.
“We’ve got a stranglehold of London,” said Carl Chinn, a local social historian. He said there was a time back in the 1800s when Birmingham ran its own affairs and had the ambition to drive the Industrial Revolution.
“We had our own water company. We had our own gas company. We had our own public transport company. We had our own police force. What happened in the 20th century was that Westminster greedily grabbed power from dynamic local authorities like Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds.”
Dr. Chinn said Birmingham’s residents have been caught for years between a Conservative government in London bent on cutting costs and a Labour-controlled council that’s plagued by incompetence.
There is little indication that the crisis will end soon. The pay equity claims could take years to settle and the unions representing city staff have no intention of backing down. If anything, union officials have uncovered more discrepancies in Birmingham and other cities.
“Something fundamentally is rotten if we allow in any organization a situation where women workers have been discriminated against to the extent that they are here,” said Stuart Richards, a Birmingham organizer for the GMB Union. The GMB, which represents roughly half of the city’s 10,000 staff, is pursuing claims on behalf of 3,000 current and former female employees.
Lost in much of the debate over finances are people such as Elizabeth Jordan. She works for RE:Future Collective, a non-profit organization that offers art programs for disadvantaged people.
The collective relies on the city for around half of its funding, which is now at risk as commissioners look for ways to save money. “We’re here to make our voices heard and to express how important it is for the city to not lose its culture,” Ms. Jordan said as she joined a small protest outside Council House on Monday.
As councillors filed into the meeting they passed signs proclaiming the city’s slogan – “Be Bold, Be Birmingham” – which was adopted last year just before the Commonwealth Games. With the city now effectively bankrupt, some argue a better slogan might have been, “Be Careful.”

Proposed class action over commissions in real estate survives first test in court

Full text: A proposed class-action lawsuit that takes aim at real estate commissions in Canada’s largest home-sales market that have affected billions of dollars worth of transactions over the past decade has survived a first test in court.
A judge ruled earlier this week against an attempt by the local real estate board and several large brokerages to have the case thrown out.
At issue is the practice of a seller listing their home for sale and offering a co-operating commission to the buyer’s agent.
The practice is widely used in real estate around the world, but the proposed lawsuit argues that the rules imposed by the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB) and the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) create anti-competitive controls and limit how those commissions can be negotiated. The suit was filed by class-action specialists Kalloghlian Myers.
The case centres on the Toronto market where traditionally home sellers can expect to pay a 2.5-per-cent commission on a sale to a buyer’s agent, while listing agents could expect to receive the same or less.
In recent years, those percentages have shifted, with buyer agents sometimes accepting 2 per cent and listing agents accepting as low as 1 per cent or 1.5 per cent.
But while the percentages are small the dollar amounts can be huge: A 2.5-per-cent commission on an average detached home sale in 2013 was about $17,144; rising prices have pushed a 2.5-percent commission to $35,409 on the same type of home in August.
The lawsuit names TRREB, CREA, seven major real estate brokerages and five franchisors of real estate brokerages as defendants. A Toronto man named Mark Sunderland, who sold a property in 2020 and paid the standard commission, is the representative plaintiff. The case has yet to be certified as a class action.
The defendants sought to block the case, but Federal Court Chief Justice Paul Crampton issued a ruling on Monday that allows the proposed lawsuit to proceed to the certification phase.
Chief Justice Crampton concluded that the plaintiff’s arguments, that rules created by TRREB and CREA “control” buyer commissions in violation of the Competition Act, were not “doomed to fail.” He dismissed the defendants’ motion to strike those arguments.
However, the judge said there was not enough evidence that the defendants attempted to “fix” or “increase” prices, and he also ruled that there wasn’t enough evidence to include the country’s largest real estate franchisors as defendants.
The judgment pointed to specific “buyer commission rules” at TRREB and CREA that specify that the seller must pay those commissions. The rules don’t allow buyer commissions to be modified or negotiated by the seller in an agreement of purchase and sale.
“I consider it arguable that these aspects of the buyer broker commission rule are unambiguously harmful to competition and purchasers of co-operating brokerage services in the GTA,” the ruling reads.
The initial statement of claim also included the large national franchising companies, or franchisors – RE/Max Integra, Century 21 Canada Limited Partnership, Residential Income Fund L.P.
(Royal LePage), HomeLife Realty Services Inc. and Sutton Group Realty Services Ltd. The argument was that by opening new brokerages that agreed to TRREB’s rules, they were aiding and abetting the conspiracy to violate the Competition Act with the buyer commission structure.
However, Chief Justice Crampton excluded them from the action in his ruling, saying their conduct appears to fall short of the legal definition of aiding and abetting.
“Merely requiring franchisees to sign a Franchise Agreement, which in turn requires them to comply with and implement TRREB and CREA’s Rules, implicitly including the Buyer Brokerage Commission Rule, does not arguably rise to the level of deliberately encouraging or actively inducing the commission of a criminal offence,” the ruling reads.
However, many of the city’s largest brokerages will remain defendants because they explicitly agreed to follow TRREB’s rules on commissions while operating their businesses. They include Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd., Right at Home Realty Inc., Forest Hill Real Estate Inc., iPro Realty Ltd., Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd., Chestnut Park Real Estate Limited and Max Wright Real Estate Corporation (operating as Sotheby’s International Realty).
The ruling means a case on the “control” elements of the claim can proceed to the next phase, in which the court would rule on whether to certify the class of victims. The lawsuit seeks to have the class defined as anyone in the Toronto region who paid a buyer commission when they sold their home in the past decade.
However, one of the lawyers for the plaintiff predicted that the remaining defendants will appeal the ruling, which could take months if not another year and push back the certification phase of the case even further.
“Quite frankly, this is the business model of the real estate industry so I expect they will fight it,” said Garth Myers, partner with Kalloghlian Myers.
Royal LePage and Peerage Capital (which owns Chestnut Park and Sotheby’s Canada) declined to comment as the matter is still before the courts.
Pierre Leduc, spokesperson for CREA, said: “We are reviewing the decision, and continue to believe that the claims are without merit.”
Other defendants did not respond to request for comment.

Ottawa boosts bond program to help fund rental projects: Government to issue additional $20-billion a year in mortgage bonds with new builds planned

Full text: The federal government is increasing the size of its mortgage bond program by 50 per cent in an attempt to funnel more private capital toward rental home construction amid surging demand for financing from developers.
Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland announced on Tuesday plans to increase the annual issuance of Canada Mortgage Bonds to $60-billion from $40-billion, with the additional proceeds going toward financing rental building construction. Two weeks ago, the federal government announced it would remove the goods and services tax from rental home construction.
Ottawa has been under pressure to create more affordable housing with the average monthly rent across the country exceeding $2,000 and the typical selling price of a home more than $700,000.
Canada Mortgage Bonds are a pillar of the country’s housing finance system. They are issued by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC), which uses the proceeds to buy pools of insured mortgages, known as mortgage-backed securities, from private lenders. This ultimately reduces the cost of financing for developers.
The government is not making loans to developers through the bond program.
Rather, it is helping channel private capital toward mortgage lenders by transforming relatively unpopular mortgage-backed securities into a higher-quality asset that investors want. This provides an important source of funding for smaller banks and alternative lenders that have less access to traditional sources of funding, such as bank deposits.
“It is foundational to multiunit rental construction in Canada,” Ms. Freeland said about the Canada Mortgage Bond program during a news conference Tuesday.
“We know that it’s going to become even more important, both because interest rates are elevated … and also because having lifted the GST, we are already seeing new projects get under way, and this is to ensure that the financing is available for those projects.”
The government claims the change will help build up to 30,000 more rental apartments a year.
The recent spike in building and financing costs had been slowing the pace of rental construction. That is because rentalonly buildings, also known as purpose-built rental, require developers to use their capital over a longer period of time.
Purpose-built rental developers only recover their expenses and earn a profit after their units have been rented. In contrast, condo and house developers realize their profits as soon as the unit is sold.
Since Ottawa announced it would eliminate the 5-per-cent GST on new purpose-built rental units, apartment developers have announced plans for thousands of rental apartments.
Dream Unlimited said the GST waiver would allow it to proceed with more than 5,000 new rental units in Ottawa, Saskatoon, Calgary and Toronto. Dream president Michael Cooper called the waiver a “game changer,” and said his company will start construction on 1,350 units this year and the remaining 3,700 over the following two years.
Fitzrovia Real Estate said the tax discount would allow it to build 3,000 more rental units within the next 10 months. Tricon Residential Inc. said it would start work on more than 1,000 units within the next six months.
Even before the GST change, CMHC was directing an increasing portion of the Canada Mortgage Bond program toward multiunit developments. In a background briefing, a Department of Finance official said that 53 per cent of the bond issuance so far this year has been 10-year bonds, which are used to finance larger developments.
Tenant advocates have pushed for more purpose-built rental units because it typically provides renters with a more secure form of housing. If a renter is leasing a house or condo from a homeowner, their tenancy can end if the homeowner decides to move back into the unit or sell their property.
Purpose-built rental units used to be the dominant form of housing for renters, but that started to shift in the 1990s when builders turned to condo development.
Federal and local governments have been pushing for more purpose-built rental though the rate of construction has fallen short of demand from renters.
The announcement on Tuesday appeared to be something of an about-face in the government’s approach to the Canada Mortgage Bond program. In its spring budget, the government contemplated scrapping the program and funding the purchase of mortgage-backed securities by issuing more Government of Canada bonds. The government said it could potentially save money by doing this, but the idea was widely criticized on Bay Street, where investors like having access to these bonds and dealers make money administering the program.
Ms. Freeland said the announcement on Tuesday was “separate from our ongoing consideration of how the Canada Mortgage Bond program itself will work.”
She added that the government had finished the first stage of consultations on the proposal to consolidate the bonds into general government borrowing and that it was approaching the issue “very deliberately.”

Full text: Henry and Mary Rempel had retired from their middle-income jobs and had reached a stage of life when many people take up golf and travel the world. Instead, they became investors, acquiring a substantial number of properties throughout British Columbia.
They started small, using savings to purchase a couple of rental buildings in Prince George in the mid-1980s, then leveraging those properties and purchasing others, in places like Nanaimo, Parksville, Courtenay, Fort St.
John and Chilliwack. Most of their holdings were rental apartments but they also acquired acreage ripe for development.
They took risks, when most financial planners tell you not to.
And they worked hard: Mary, a former teacher, oversaw the dayto-day management of the apartments; and Henry, a retired psychologist, focused on the acquisitions.
“Once they got a nest egg rolling, they just used the other properties as collateral, and they were able to lever it and go forward. It was a big risk,” says their lawyer and friend Bill Battison. “These were truly self-made people.”
Their acquisitions made them rich, but they lived as frugally as they always had, in a modest apartment in New Westminster, nothing flashy about them. When Mary died in 2014, Henry kept the property businesses going. And then, Henry died this past June at age 97.
The hard work in real estate had paid off: he and Mary had amassed a portfolio worth $229.6-million.
The Rempels left it all to the Mennonite Central Committee British Columbia (MCC BC), a donation that the religious charity revealed this past week. The organization will use the Rempels’s real estate portfolio, including smaller gifts of property that began in 2012, to generate income in what the charity compared to an endowment.
Donating the land had been the Rempels’s intention all along.
In other words, the couple, who’d never had children, had sacrificed leisure for decades of fundraising.
Henry’s only indulgence was the Mercedes-Benz he drove. Otherwise, nobody knew the scope of their wealth.
Their backstories very likely shaped their choices, says Mr. Battison. Both came from refugee families. Henry’s family, devout Mennonites, fled persecution in the former Soviet Union. And Mary’s family fled Lithuania during the Second World War.
Mennonites, many of whom are pacifists and had refused conscription, had been persecuted in Europe for centuries, forced to flee from one country to another.
Henry’s family was among thousands of Mennonites who fled Soviet-controlled Ukraine in the 1920s. They received aid from the Mennonite Central Committee, which had formed to help Ukrainian Mennonite refugees travel to North America.
But when Henry’s family passed through Moscow en route to Canada in 1929, his brother Jacob was born in deplorable conditions.
“The Soviets took everything from them,” says Mr. Battison, who made a point of learning Henry’s early stories. “At one point, they weren’t even allowed diapers.”
Jacob acquired a virus that left him with severe brain damage, blind, unable to speak, and in pain. When the family got to Montreal, they made their way to Winnipeg, and then settled in the Fraser Valley community of Yarrow, where about 20,000 Mennonites from Ukraine had arrived.
His father bought a small farm and grew strawberries and vegetables, and had a few cows. A skilled carpenter, he also built houses and barns for locals. His mother had another son in 1934, named Wilhelm, and she cared for Jacob around the clock.
As a child, Henry took odd jobs, such as working in the sugar-beet fields or picking raspberries all day. And he was competitive, hoeing rows of hops faster than the other boys. He put off high-school graduation for several years, to help his parents.
He later obtained a master’s degree in psychology and then took a job at the Woodlands psychiatric hospital in New Westminster, where Jacob had once been treated for a few weeks when mother became ill. He worked there for 17 years. It seemed to Mr. Battison that Henry’s posting at the hospital was his way of making it up to Jacob, who died at age 20. “His brother’s illness made a huge impact on him,” says Mr. Battison.
Henry and Mary’s retirement goal was simple: build a portfolio that would generate revenue in perpetuity, to help those with hardship. They seldom sold a property, and if they did, it would get reinvested. They’d consolidated all their holdings in B.C., and whoever took them over had to follow the same mandate.
“It had been a point of discussion for quite a number of years,” explains Wayne Bremner, executive director of MCC BC, the same group that helped the Rempel family get to Canada.
The Mennonite Central Committee was founded in 1920 in Chicago, with the mandate to provide disaster relief and peacebuilding around the world, including refugee assistance. The organization helps vulnerable refugees, regardless of religion, nationality or ethnicity.
“In 2010, they called and asked if MCC would be the beneficiary of their estate, with the understanding that we would hold those properties as revenue generating assets – similar to an endowment,” Mr. Bremner says.
“We would have known generally they had rental property and land. We didn’t know the full scope at the time.
“My answer at the moment was, ‘I think we could do that.’ ” With a Mennonite network at the ready, Mr. Bremner pulled together a committee with legal and financial expertise to form a charity.
Two years later, the couple made their first donation, a pair of apartment buildings with 250 units in Prince George and 32 acres of land in Parksville, a package worth about $17-million, he estimates.
A developer who had also fled southern Russia in his youth offered to volunteer his services and went on to develop the Parksville acreage into a successful single-family-home project.
A year later, the Rempels donated acreage in Chilliwack, worth about $20-million.
MCC BC then formed HyLand Properties, to oversee the holdings. Mr. Bremner believes the couple was testing the waters with those initial donations, making sure that MCC was the right collaborator.
Revenue from the Rempels’s gift will go toward helping millions of people, says Mr. Bremner, including Ukrainians and displaced people in South Sudan, for example. The Rempels had gifted a significant amount of cash early on to helping African communities deprived of clean water.
“Both knew what it was like to be poor and have a hard life and be fleeing,” says Mr. Bremner. “So that’s where they wanted their contributions to go.”

Full text: When designers Salina and Jason Marshall of Marshall Design Studio had a professional photographer document Jeffrey and Anne Parker’s Peterborough, Ont., house, the couple was on vacation.
Which makes sense, of course, but it was also too bad, “because you look like your house; it’s very reflective of your style, your personality,” Ms. Marshall says.
“Wow, I think that’s the best compliment anyone’s ever given me,” says Ms. Parker as she places her cup on the matte-black kitchen island.
But let’s be clear: This is not like the bulldog owner with the similarly drooping jowls; it’s more like if one were to peek in the Parkers’ closet, or cup hands on the bistro window to see what they’ve ordered for lunch.
The chunky amber-and-grey terrazzo tile in the foyer, which wraps around a corner to become the Malm fireplace hearth, for instance, speaks of informality, playfulness and love of mid-century modern design, but also of low maintenance and quick cleanup, which the shift-working health care providers require. So, too, does soundproofing achieved from pocket doors, and the walkout basement entrance to a guest bedroom “where sometimes I’ll sleep after I’ve been working all night,” says Mr. Parker.
The primary bedroom is also designed in such a way that one Parker can be tucked under the covers while the other is tucked away in the dressing area or shower, out of sight.
But it’s not all practicality.
Prominent use of black in the kitchen – from backsplash and countertops to faucets and light fixtures – is purely an aesthetic choice. It’s bold, it’s graphic, it’s what the Parkers wanted and, adds Ms. Marshall, “was driven by the architectural [choices] – the outside being black, bringing some of that inside, and then same with the black windows.”
While one might not want to go all Stygian in a small bedroom (unless one is a teenager), it works here because of two things: the abundance of golden birch and the creamy-white cathedral ceiling. The birch, which is used on multiple screens throughout the space, informs the ribbed shape of the fireplace wall, and it clads “The Block.”
The Block, both couples laugh, was the name given to the slightly monolithic piece of millwork that presents itself as a coat closet upon entry (but is really a pantry and vacuum cleaner storage, the coat closet is elsewhere), and then turns a corner to become the fridge, then more storage, and then, finally, wraps to house a microwave and more storage opposite the couple’s espresso station.
“Sometimes I just walk by The Block and touch it because it’s so smooth and silky,” Ms. Parker says with a big laugh. “Even the kids will rub up against it.”
The high, peaked ceiling – under which are the public areas of the house – was present before the gutted-to-the-studs renovation, but the peak originally faced the other way. “A big turning point for the design was rotating this roof,” says Ms. Marshall, who met her clients while picking up her little one at preschool. “We had a 3-D model of it.”
“They had two models,” Mr. Parker corrects, “one with the roof this way, and one the other way, and we didn’t even look at the other one.”
The home, when the Parkers purchased it in 2021, looked pretty much as it had in the early 1950s, when a General Electric engineer (Peterborough had a huge GE plant for 126 years) drew up plans himself and, says Mr. Parker with a chuckle, “overbuilt everything.” On a deep yet rather narrow lot, the home, then as now, faces the long wall of shrubbery to the south rather than the street itself; it’s the two-car garage a passerby will notice first. And while that configuration might send a different owner into a teardown tizzy, the Parkers appreciate the buffer.
“Instead of volume we put our money into the details … quality over size,” Mr. Parker says.
He’s right: from the microcosm of machined, black light switches and floor vents camouflaged in wood or tile, to the macro of millwork so precise gaps almost disappear (by Kawartha Cabinets) or, on the exterior, the gorgeous New Brunswick Fraser siding and a standing seam roof so crisp one could use it to fold origami, it’s a visual and tactile dream of a dwelling. When everything follows a certain order, geometry and logic, a sense of calm results.
“People may not even realize it, but [they do] subconsciously notice it’s a real material,” says Mr. Marshall, looking down at the white oak floors. “You can tell fake wood.”
The couple’s collection of artwork is equally ‘real’ and includes an Indigenous stone print purchased when the couple lived in Iqaluit, and actual red-and-blue 3-D screen prints (that come with glasses!) by Paul G. Hammond and Seth A. Smith.
Inside or out, whether in the private or public areas, it’s a strikingly modern yet warm and unpretentious house that reflects its owners to a T. And while it was hard finding a local contractor who grasped this type of build, the Marshalls and Parkers were thrilled with Alan Didone Construction Ltd.
“You won’t find a house like this in Peterborough,” says Mr. Marshall, matter-of-factly. “No matter how hard you look.”
“I think the big thing is that we come home to a house that makes us happy,” finishes Mr. Parker.

Climate may put billions at risk in U.S. housing market: New projections suggest a reckoning is coming, with implications for the Canadian economy

Full text: Over the half-decade since California’s devastating Camp Fire burned down nearly 19,000 structures, U.S. housing markets have given little indication that wildfire threats have any bearing on the valuation of a home.
With the arrival of the pandemic, in fact, the opposite was true. Demand rose dramatically for homes in rural areas and in the coastal communities where flooding has become a mounting concern.
But new projections suggest a reckoning is coming, one that could have profound implications for a bedrock of the U.S. economy – and for Canada, as well.
As much as a quarter of the residential properties in the U.S. “are overvalued in some way,” based on their relative climate risk, said Matthew Eby, the founder of First Street Foundation, a non-profit that researches climate risk.
It’s a bubble that amounts to the “high hundreds of billions, if not trillions” of dollars across the U.S., he said.
It’s an estimate based, in part, on a new First Street wildfire model, which suggests that over the next three decades, the number of structures – homes, garages and the like – destroyed by flames on average every year in the U.S. is likely to double to nearly 34,000. That’s roughly the number of structures in Asheville, N.C., with a population of 95,000.
“It’s because these wildfires are becoming so intense and so big that we actually can’t prevent them from getting into the urban environment,” said Mr. Eby.
The devastating Maui fire that devoured more than 2,200 structures in Lahaina is just the latest example.
The First Street analysis, which matched climate modelling with details on building characteristics across the country, suggests such devastation is likely to grow more commonplace.
It estimates California’s Riverside County alone will lose, on average, more than 2,300 structures a year to fire by 2053 – more than any other county in the U.S.
It’s a grim prognostication that stands at odds with a sunny outlook in California’s property industry. Take Riverside County, a semi-arid region east of Los Angeles where dun mountains rise up over dry shrublands punctuated by suburbs and citrus orchards. Riverside numbered among the destinations for people leaving major urban centres in recent years, its population up 2.3 per cent since 2020.
A decade ago, a three-bedroom twobathroom home here might have fetched US$190,000, said Amado Hernandez, a Riverside real estate agent who is president of the Inland Valleys Association of Realtors. Today, “that same house averages $590,000,” he said. He dismissed the concern that fire risk might be a factor in property values.
“There is no bubble,” he said, introducing a visiting reporter to John Miechowicz, the local sales director for All Solutions Insurance. Each insurer uses a different fire map, Mr. Miechowicz said, so a property deemed high risk by one could be considered zero risk by another. That creates enough uncertainty for some buyers to shake off concerns.
“If someone wants a house, they want a house,” he said.
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, too, warns about placing too much reliance on what Tim Chavez, one of the department’s top wildfire forecasters, calls “speculative computer modelling.”
California is working to reduce flammable fuels and build fuel breaks around communities, Mr. Chavez said. The state also maintains a database with decades of information on burned and damaged structures. It has yielded insights into how to keep homes from catching fire, by managing nearby vegetation and closing off entry points for embers.
“I just don’t see the losses continuing at their current pace – even if fires do continue to get more intense and larger,” he said.
But there are already warning signs for homes in vulnerable areas of the U.S., with some insurers pulling out of Florida and California.
California has suppressed the rate of insurance premium increases. But elsewhere, rising costs are likely to add pressure to home values, said Dave Burt, chief executive of DeltaTerra Capital, a climate risk intelligence firm.
“If you get to the point where your insurance premium is going to be more than what you would pay to rent a property, that property is essentially worthless,” he said.
Mr. Burt’s research helped underpin the “Big Short” bet against the U.S. housing market. Changes in home insurance availability are “happening just as dramatically as credit being yanked from the system for sub-prime mortgages in 2007,” he said.
His firm has tracked numbers that show sales in the past two years waning for homes in areas at risk for wildfire and floods. They are at risk of “the type of correction that the whole country saw in 2007 to 2012,” he said.
He estimates the countrywide overvaluation at US$1.2-trillion.
Similar data are not publicly available for Canada. Nor can Canadians easily access climate risk data for individual properties.
But California may offer lessons for Canada, particularly about the importance of attaching climate risk to the housing market, said Maryam Golnaraghi, the West Vancouver-based director of climate change and environment for The Geneva Association, an international association of insurance companies. That’s not simply a question of properly priced insurance. It may also mean provocative new steps, such as introducing climate risk to mortgages.
“If we get to a point where you go to a bank and get different rates depending on where you’re buying, that might change behaviour,” she said.
Evaluating climate risk in physical assets “is one of the most fundamental things that the world needs to be thinking about,” said Ron Denbo, the founder and CEO of Riskthinking.AI. It’s a Torontobased company that has built well-regarded tools that have evaluated climate risk on the physical assets of thousands of publicly traded companies; it has also worked with banks to analyze mortgage portfolios.
“We have a very mispriced market when it comes to climate change,” Mr. Denbo said. He pointed to recent events that demonstrate the cause for concern in Canada: fires and floods in British Columbia and Alberta, rising hurricane threats to the East Coast. A confluence of such events “could bring the housing market to a real crisis,” he said.
“Canada is in for a big surprise,” he added. “We have definite, serious risks.”

Climate change directly affecting home insurance rates: A rise in disasters, such as wildfires, and the soaring price of building lead to rising costs

Full text: Last weekend in B.C.’s Kelowna region, the air was still strong with wildfire smoke after a summer of seemingly endless fires, including the fire that destroyed nearly 200 homes in West Kelowna.
In the past seven years, the province has experienced “four of the most severe wildfire seasons of the last century,” according to a paper in Nature, written by Canadian academics.
Fires across Canada are predicted to increase in frequency and severity, according to Health Canada. As well, there is an ongoing risk of floods, landslides and earthquakes, depending on the region.
In the meantime, homeowners and developers can expect insurance premiums to increase, which will have an impact on an already beleaguered housing supply. In turn, that will impact the affordability of housing, which is already a crisis.
Craig Stewart, who is the vice-president of climate change and federal issues for the Insurance Bureau of Canada, the association for property, automobiles and business insurance, Stewart said insurance premiums have gone up on average 5 to 10 per cent in the last year, according to Statistics Canada figures. That’s the biggest bump he’s seen in premiums for property insurance. And we can blame that on climate change, he says.
Insurers buy their coverage from global reinsurance companies that are raising their premiums because they see higher risk. As a result, so too have a lot of local insurers. Some expect those reinsurance premiums to continue to rise, he says.
“Global reinsurers price risk for countries and regions around the world. So if you live in a place of high risk, such as California or Louisiana – and now Western Canada – we are seeing reinsurance prices are going up in those areas,” he says. Mr. Stewart is based in Nova Scotia, which experienced catastrophic wildfires and flooding this summer.
The risks are so high that some homes no longer qualify for insurance. Mr. Stewart said there are about 1.5 million homes in Canada that cannot get flood insurance, although the IBC is working with the federal government to address the issue.
Insurers are extremely concerned about the potential for an earthquake disaster in B.C., says Mr. Stewart. That, combined with higher reinsurer premiums are largely the reasons behind increased premiums in the Lower Mainland.
In Richmond and Surrey, there are areas where soil subsidence is a potential issue, so there are some homes that do not have insurance if they were to suddenly sink into the ground because of an earthquake, he said.
“There is some overall cross-subsidization, but most of [the increased cost] is location specific. You are typically paying for your own risk. Earthquake premiums have gone up because in 2019 the federal government realized the impacts from a significant quake in B.C. were double than what was previously understood.”
The strain on the housing system is compacted by the high cost of rebuilding housing lost in natural disasters.
“When you add rebuilding to the mix, it can be very expensive to rebuild a home, in the present labour market,” said Mr. Stewart.
“When insurers are pricing policies, they take a look at what it would cost in a particular market at this point in time to rebuild that house,” he says. “And what we are seeing is, it’s often costing much more to rebuild a house than the value of the house itself.”
As well, between B.C. and Nova Scotia alone, there might be 1,000 homes that need to be rebuilt due to disaster.
“That takes away from labour available to build new homes,” he says.
The real estate community is becoming increasingly aware of climate change as an ongoing challenge.
“[Climate change] will become increasingly important and get focus,” says Andrew Lis, director of economics and data analytics for the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.
“But with things climate-related, history has shown people prefer to kick the can as far down the road [as possible],” he adds.
“As we move into the future with climate change, the risks are hard to forecast. [They] can seemingly come out of the blue, with furious consequences.
“Already, some condo and strata insurance premiums are rising dramatically, and some buildings are not even insurable. If it gets bad enough, the government might have to step in and become insurer.”
Vancouver resident and developer Michael Geller said he was shocked to find the insurance coverage for his own home had reached $8,000 this year. After surveying neighbours and friends, he found premiums that were “all over the map” in terms of cost. Developers, he says, are also facing steep hikes, which will add to the cost of housing.
“It used to be that insurance was a line item in a pro forma, but it wasn’t a major cost. But just as property taxes [have increased], now we have property insurance adding significantly to the cost.”
The financial implications of climate change include the impact it has on affordable housing, says Lindsay Brugger, vicepresident of urban resilience for the Urban Land Institute in Washington.
Ms. Brugger recalled Hurricane Sandy, the deadly storm that hit the New York area in 2012. “When a disaster of that scale hits New York City and you consider the amount of GDP that comes out of that specific region, it was a huge wake up call for a lot of people across the industry.”
“Climate change is a threat multiplier, so it makes everything worse,” says Ms. Brugger.
“When we think about all the housing we already need before a disaster even strikes, and then after a disaster, that housing is even further dwindling. We want to address shocks and stresses.
Shocks are acute disasters; stresses are the chronic issues, like lack of affordable housing already plaguing our communities that are made all the worse when a disaster does happen.”
She says that for every dollar spent on developing resilient buildings, more than $6 is saved in recovery.
“When consumers start asking questions like, ‘Is my home elevated?’ and ‘Is my home ember resistant?’ I think then there will be more motivation for home builders and others in the real estate pipeline to design for that consumer demand.
“I anticipate that consumer demand for resilience will only increase. The market indicators are there. We are already seeing it in some leading developers, some leading master-planned communities.”
Kelowna realtor Richard Deacon says in terms of sales it was a slower summer than last year. A couple of his buyers decided to pause their home search because of the wildfires. It’s becoming part of a realtor’s job to educate buyers on neighbourhoods that are safer than others, such as places that only have one road in and out, or are distant from a firehall.
He predicts that in the Kelowna neighbourhood where 200 homes were lost, all will be rebuilt in the next two years. The question will become how they get rebuilt.
“This is when insurance companies and lenders, hopefully, the building code, and builders come into play so that everyone understands you shouldn’t just slap up the same home.
“You get your $1-million insurance cheque, and you want to build the same dream home you had before.

Mr. Stewart said the insurance industry is advocating for a federal system that would rate the resiliency of a home in the face of disaster, much the way that energy efficiency programs operate.

Full text: Last weekend in B.C.’s Kelowna region, the air was still strong with wildfire smoke after a summer of seemingly endless fires, including the fire that destroyed nearly 200 homes in West Kelowna.
In the past seven years, the province has experienced “four of the most severe wildfire seasons of the last century,” according to a paper in Nature, written by Canadian academics.
Fires across Canada are predicted to increase in frequency and severity, according to Health Canada. As well, there is an ongoing risk of floods, landslides and earthquakes, depending on the region.
In the meantime, homeowners and developers can expect insurance premiums to increase, which will have an impact on an already beleaguered housing supply. In turn, that will impact the affordability of housing, which is already a crisis.
Craig Stewart, who is the vicepresident of climate change and federal issues for the Insurance Bureau of Canada, the association for property, automobiles and business insurance, Stewart said insurance premiums have gone up on average 5 to 10 per cent in the last year, according to Statistics Canada figures. That’s the biggest bump he’s seen in premiums for property insurance. And we can blame that on climate change, he says.
Insurers buy their coverage from global reinsurance companies that are raising their premiums because they see higher risk.
As a result, so too have a lot of local insurers. Some expect those reinsurance premiums to continue to rise, he says.
“Global reinsurers price risk for countries and regions around the world. So if you live in a place of high risk, such as California or Louisiana – and now Western Canada – we are seeing reinsurance prices are going up in those areas,” he says. Mr. Stewart is based in Nova Scotia, which experienced catastrophic wildfires and flooding this summer.
The risks are so high that some homes no longer qualify for insurance. Mr. Stewart said there are about 1.5 million homes in Canada that cannot get flood insurance, although the IBC is working with the federal government to address the issue.
Insurers are extremely concerned about the potential for an earthquake disaster in B.C., says Mr. Stewart. That, combined with higher reinsurer premiums are largely the reasons behind increased premiums in the Lower Mainland.
In Richmond and Surrey, there are areas where soil subsidence is a potential issue, so there are some homes that do not have insurance if they were to suddenly sink into the ground because of an earthquake, he said.
“There is some overall crosssubsidization, but most of [the increased cost] is location specific. You are typically paying for your own risk. Earthquake premiums have gone up because in 2019 the federal government realized the impacts from a significant quake in B.C. were double than what was previously understood.”
The strain on the housing system is compacted by the high cost of rebuilding housing lost in natural disasters.
“When you add rebuilding to the mix, it can be very expensive to rebuild a home, in the present labour market,” said Mr. Stewart.
“When insurers are pricing policies, they take a look at what it would cost in a particular market at this point in time to rebuild that house,” he says. “And what we are seeing is, it’s often costing much more to rebuild a house than the value of the house itself.”
As well, between B.C. and Nova Scotia alone, there might be 1,000 homes that need to be rebuilt due to disaster.
“That takes away from labour available to build new homes,” he says.
The real estate community is becoming increasingly aware of climate change as an ongoing challenge.
“[Climate change] will become increasingly important and get focus,” says Andrew Lis, director of economics and data analytics for the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.
“But with things climate-related, history has shown people prefer to kick the can as far down the road [as possible],” he adds.
“As we move into the future with climate change, the risks are hard to forecast. [They] can seemingly come out of the blue, with furious consequences.
“Already, some condo and strata insurance premiums are rising dramatically, and some buildings are not even insurable. If it gets bad enough, the government might have to step in and become insurer.”
Vancouver resident and developer Michael Geller said he was shocked to find the insurance coverage for his own home had reached $8,000 this year. After surveying neighbours and friends, he found premiums that were “all over the map” in terms of cost. Developers, he says, are also facing steep hikes, which will add to the cost of housing.
“It used to be that insurance was a line item in a pro forma, but it wasn’t a major cost. But just as property taxes [have increased], now we have property insurance adding significantly to the cost.”
The financial implications of climate change include the impact it has on affordable housing, says Lindsay Brugger, vice-president of urban resilience for the Urban Land Institute in Washington.
Ms. Brugger recalled Hurricane Sandy, the deadly storm that hit the New York area in 2012. “When a disaster of that scale hits New York City and you consider the amount of GDP that comes out of that specific region, it was a huge wake up call for a lot of people across the industry.”
“Climate change is a threat multiplier, so it makes everything worse,” says Ms. Brugger.
“When we think about all the housing we already need before a disaster even strikes, and then after a disaster, that housing is even further dwindling. We want to address shocks and stresses. Shocks are acute disasters; stresses are the chronic issues, like lack of affordable housing already plaguing our communities that are made all the worse when a disaster does happen.”
She says that for every dollar spent on developing resilient buildings, more than $6 is saved in recovery.
“When consumers start asking questions like, ‘Is my home elevated?’ and ‘Is my home ember resistant?’ I think then there will be more motivation for home builders and others in the real estate pipeline to design for that consumer demand.
“I anticipate that consumer demand for resilience will only increase. The market indicators are there. We are already seeing it in some leading developers, some leading master-planned communities.”
Kelowna realtor Richard Deacon says in terms of sales it was a slower summer than last year. A couple of his buyers decided to pause their home search because of the wildfires. It’s becoming part of a realtor’s job to educate buyers on neighbourhoods that are safer than others, such as places that only have one road in and out, or are distant from a firehall.
He predicts that in the Kelowna neighbourhood where 200 homes were lost, all will be rebuilt in the next two years. The question will become how they get rebuilt.
“This is when insurance companies and lenders, hopefully, the building code, and builders come into play so that everyone understands you shouldn’t just slap up the same home.
“You get your $1-million insurance cheque, and you want to build the same dream home you had before. But shouldn’t we be looking at sprinkler systems, fireproof materials and landscaping design that can mitigate fire?” Melissa Hamer lives on the top floor of a Vancouver apartment building that becomes uncomfortably hot during the summer.

Ford promises $500,000 homes to young people but offers few details

Full text: Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s office is providing few details about a surprise promise he made to a crowd of supporters that his government would donate land and offer young people 1,600-square-foot homes with backyards, driveways and finished basements for a steeply discounted $500,000 or less.
The pledge won cheers at the latest of his self-styled “Ford Fest” barbecues held in Kitchener, Ont., on Friday. The crowd also applauded comments from the Premier warning against teachers who “indoctrinate” students and saying schools should be obligated to inform parents when their children change their pronouns or gender identities.
A spokesperson for the Premier, Ivana Yelich, said on Sunday in an e-mail that more information about the housing promise would follow “in the coming months.” She said “modular homes” – a cheaper mode of construction that sees components produced at a central facility and then assembled on-site – would be part of the plan.
The promise of $500,000 homes follows weeks of the Progressive Conservative government being dogged by corruption allegations for allowing connected developers to build housing on parts of the province’s protected Greenbelt, which encircles the Greater Toronto Area.
Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Friday’s event to demand the return of the almost 3,000 hectares Ontario removed from the 800,000-hectare Greenbelt. Both the Auditor-General and the Integrity Commissioner have issued reports criticizing the rushed process for selecting the land, saying it favoured a select group of developers who collectively won an $8.3-billion windfall in increased property values.
At one point on Friday, demonstrators blocked an SUV that appeared to be part of Mr. Ford’s police security detail from entering Ford Fest.
The Premier’s new promise of cheap homes did not mention the former Greenbelt sites, where the government has said it expects developers to provide at least 10 per cent “attainable/affordable” housing. Mr. Ford said the government will put up provincial land across the province. And he pledged to build “thousands and thousands” of “starter” homes, alluding to the home-building push that followed the Second World War.
“Let me give you a promise. We’re going to make sure that we’re going to donate land.
We’re going to work with our municipalities.
We’re going to offer a 1,600-square-foot home, with a basement that’s finished that you can rent out or have family there. You’re going to have a backyard with a fence. You’re going to have a paved driveway – under $500,000,” Mr. Ford told cheering supporters.
Such a plan would require a large discount in today’s market, or extensive subsidies. The average price of a home in the Greater Toronto Area last month was $1.08-million, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board.
The Premier’s idea resembles an affordable housing plan already launched in Waterloo Region, where Mr. Ford made his speech Friday night. Spearheaded by the charity Habitat for Humanity, the Build Now: Waterloo Region initiative aims to use donated municipal land, waived fees and partnerships with local developers who agree to eliminate mark-ups and build at cost. It hopes to build 10,000 homes by 2030 for sale or rent at half the local market price.
But the homes would only be available to families who need them, as determined by Habitat for Humanity screening. And buyers would be prevented from flipping the discounted units. These homes are also set to be more dense than the Premier’s vision of houses with backyards and basements, as the Waterloo plan outlines four-to-six-storey buildings made up of units with one to three bedrooms each.
Kevin Eby, a former director of community planning for the Region of Waterloo, said this kind of initiative could have real potential. But he said the province’s focus on pleasing large developers has done it no favours with municipalities, non-profits, co-operatives and other groups needed to build affordable housing.
“Instead of bringing groups together, what this government did was they alienated everybody right at the start,” Mr. Eby said in an interview.
The Greenbelt issue has had the government scrambling. Mr. Ford’s previous housing minister, Steve Clark, resigned on Labour Day, after the Integrity Commissioner found Mr. Clark had violated ethics rules for failing to oversee the way the Greenbelt land was chosen by his chief of staff. Last week, Mr. Ford and his new Housing Minister, Paul Calandra, vowed to review the entire Greenbelt, but said the process could see even more land removed. Supporters at Ford Fest on Friday, including assembled PC cabinet ministers and MPPs, applauded the Premier when he weighed in on the controversy over whether schools should be obligated to inform parents when their child changes their pronouns or their gender expression at school.
“Most important is the parents’ rights, the parents’ rights to listen and make sure they are informed when their children make a decision,” Mr. Ford said, not actually mentioning gender issues specifically. “It’s not up to the teachers, it’s not up to the school boards to indoctrinate our kids.”
The issue has flared up in New Brunswick and Saskatchewan, where governments have issued formal policies requiring parental permission for children to change pronouns. Critics say doing so could force young people to come out to families hostile to their new identity and subject them to abuse.
Ontario Education Minister Stephen Lecce said last month that parents must be “fully involved and fully aware of what’s happening in the life of their children.” But he also said teachers and school boards already consider a student’s home environment and whether there is a risk of harm.

Full text: Toronto’s housing market waned in August with sales falling for the third straight month, as higher borrowing costs made it more expensive for buyers to get a mortgage.
The volume of home resales in the Toronto region fell 1 per cent from July to August after removing seasonal influences, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB), though the decline was not as steep as the previous two months.
Activity has slowed since the Bank of Canada resumed raising interest rates in June after a fourmonth break earlier this year.
That made it harder for would-be buyers to qualify for a mortgage and reduced the amount they could borrow.
“This could prompt these buyers to make an offer on a home less than the asking price,” said Jason Mercer, TRREB’s chief market analyst. “Not all sellers have chosen to take lower than expected selling prices, resulting in fewer sales.”
The Home Price Index, which excludes the most expensive transactions, fell 0.1 per cent to $1,163,700 from July to August on a seasonally adjusted basis. That was the first decline since March, when homebuyers flooded the market after the central bank announced it would take a break from raising interest rates.
The city of Toronto recorded the greatest monthly decline, falling 2 per cent on a non-seasonally adjusted basis. The suburbs of Toronto, which saw home prices increase significantly during the pandemic’s real estate boom, also recorded similar declines. Peel, to the northwest of the city, and Durham, to the east, both decreased by 2 per cent over the same period.
However, when compared with a year ago, the Home Price Index was up 2.4 per cent across the Toronto region.
The number of new listings continued to climb when adjusted for seasonal influences, rising 1.3 per cent last month. That was the fifth straight month of increases.
TRREB said there would be continued volatility in the market as “buyers and sellers wait for more certainty on the direction of borrowing costs and the overall economy.”
Analysts expect the Bank of Canada to keep the benchmark interest rate at 5 per cent owing to signs that the economy is slowing.
The bank is due to make its scheduled interest-rate announcement on Wednesday.
In Vancouver, the higher interest rates also contributed to the region’s real estate slowdown.
The number of sales fell 6.5 per cent from July to August and was 14 per cent below the 10-year average, according to the local board.
Fewer Vancouver homeowners put their properties up for sale, sending listings down 15 per cent.
The Home Price Index decreased by 0.2 per cent to $1,208,400, with higher prices for detached houses offsetting declining values for condos and semi-detached houses.

Coppley building restoration enhances downtown Hamilton: Historic former textile factory repositioned as a sustainable social and economic hub

Full text: Mazyar Mortazavi loves to quote urban theorist Jane Jacobs, who in her landmark book The Death and Life of Great American Cities remarked: “You need old buildings to create new ideas.”
As chief executive officer of Toronto-based real estate developer TAS, these eight words, penned more than 60 years ago, guide Mr. Mortazavi whenever he considers a new project or investment.
Repositioning and retrofitting commercial properties for adaptive mixed reuse is TAS’s raison d’être and what led Mr. Mortazavi to invest in the historic Coppley building in Hamilton.
The neglected 167-year-old pair of attached buildings, on the corner of York Boulevard and MacNab Street in the downtown core, had sat empty since the former textile factory, which produced made-to-measure men’s wear, moved its operations three years ago four blocks away to 107 MacNab St. N.
Constructed by Scottish stonemasons, the building is one of the few surviving pre-Confederation commercial structures in the city. Thanks to TAS, which purchased the building in November, 2021 – along with minority owner the Hamilton Community Foundation (HCF) – the site is being reimagined into a sustainable social and economic hub.
A second-generation development company, TAS uses real estate not just for profit, but also for a social purpose.
This is TAS’s first Steeltown project. What attracted them was the site’s potential to bring new ideas to an old building and protect one of Hamilton’s oldest structures from the wrecking ball.
“There is a deep culture and context to the Coppley,” Mr. Mortazavi explains. “I’m a big believer in maintaining the cultural fabric of a city and its cultural foundation. To paraphrase Jacobs, ‘old buildings give new ideas.’ I see lots of that in Hamilton.”
“Our aim is to retain as much of the existing building’s character while creating updated spaces that are functional and highly accessible,” he adds.
The HCF drives positive change by connecting diverse people, ideas and resources to create an inclusive city; it makes sense that they are a founding minority investor – and the anchor tenant – of the reimagined Coppley building.
“This landmark has meant so much to the vibrancy of our city’s core and the lives of many Hamiltonians who once worked here,” says Terry Cooke, CEO of HCF.
“[The building] is going to be fabulous when it’s finished. We look forward to working and partnering with TAS to deliver a new hub for commercial and social activity in downtown Hamilton.”
TAS looks not just for historic buildings, but locales with a rich history already well on the renewal path. Gentrification it is not. Rather, TAS’s goal is the integration and revitalization of unloved pockets of cities. One of its core objectives, Mr. Mortazavi says, is to use social capital to create neighbourhoods – and ultimately cities – where people can thrive and belong.
This is the case with the Coppley, which is another piece of the continuing urban renewal of Ward 2 (Hamilton’s downtown core), which is once again becoming a vibrant community hub.
Across the street from the former luxury clothier is the historic Farmers’ Market at 35 York Blvd., which, along with the Central Hamilton Public Library that shares the space, has been in this location since 1980. Nearby is another heritage building – the global headquarters of G.S. Dunn Ltd., the world’s largest dry mustard miller, founded in Hamilton in 1867.
The redevelopment of commercial spaces in Hamilton’s core also includes the planned $500-million new entertainment hub that incorporates FirstOntario Concert Hall, the FirstOntario Centre, the Hamilton Convention Centre and the Art Gallery of Hamilton.
The Coppley building will house the new HCF office, along with a mix of other communitycentred businesses, not-for-profits and retailers on the ground floor that might include a microbrewery and an independent coffee shop.
Another feature of the historic building is a pair of interior courtyards, originally designed for horse-drawn carriages to bring in supplies. TAS plans to reimagine these spaces as a yearround covered community gathering spot for art crawls, public events, lectures and live music.
“It’s a unique project,” says Cameron Kroetsch, councillor of Ward 2. “I’ve toured the building and talked to others about TAS’s vision and how they want to make it an inclusive space, not just by housing the Hamilton Community Foundation, but they also have plans to include BIPOC groups as tenants.”
Before blueprints were drafted, TAS solicited feedback from more than a dozen local community organizations. Themes that emerged from these meetings included several conclusions that TAS is taking to heart as it begins design.
“Heritage is important,” Mr. Mortazavi explains. “This is a local landmark that needs preserving. Collaboration and connectedness are keys in designing the space, along with affordability and access for all to shared amenities. This fits our community hub strategy, which we’ve used to lead the adaptive reuse, lease-up and operations of underutilized warehouse spaces across the GTA.”
Mr. Kroetsch says he’s happy the Coppley is being preserved “as almost every other building around there is being demolished.”
“We went through a similar redevelopment 50 years ago when the entire downtown core around city hall was demolished to make way for Hamilton Place and the convention centre and it did not go well if you read the history; there was a lot of acrimony, construction delays and problems with the developer,” he explains. “There is so much construction planned for the downtown over the next five years. I’m glad they are staggering these projects and taking their time.”
Originally set to reopen as part of Phase 1 in 2023, the pandemic and a few other delays lengthened the project’s timeline. With the removal of the old textile equipment, the interior demolition work is now complete, and the new target for completion of Phase 1 (mostly office space designed to promote interaction between tenants with some ground-floor retail) is mid-to-late 2024.
“We see ourselves as just a piece of the puzzle, not the solution,” Mr. Mortazavi says.

Full text: In 2012, Ontario’s Conestoga College had about 10,000 full-time students, nearly nine out of 10 of them Canadians. A decade later, the college had about the same number of domestic students, but it has more than doubled in size thanks to huge enrolment from abroad. And with those foreign students has come a tripling of revenue and a massive windfall for the school.
The college, located an hour’s drive west of Toronto in Kitchener, Ont., had more international study permits issued last year than any school in Canada, and almost as many as two of the country’s leading universities, the University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia, combined.
Conestoga’s transformation is part of a broader shift to internationalization in Canadian postsecondary education, one that some Ontario colleges have embraced. In 2016, a little more than 35,000 study permits were issued for Ontario colleges.
Now it’s more than 100,000 a year and rising.
At least seven of Ontario’s 24 publicly funded colleges, job-focused institutions that primarily offer one and two-year programs, had more international students than domestic in 2021-22. Sarnia’s Lambton College, for instance, was 82 per cent international students, according to full-time student stats from the provincial government. Northern College, based in Timmins, was about 80 per cent international students; North Bay’s Canadore College was 72 per cent; and Sault College about 60 per cent. Cambrian College and Loyalist College, based in Sudbury and Belleville, were more than half international students. In several cases, the growth in international enrolment is focused at satellite campuses or partner schools in the Greater Toronto Area.
As governments have chosen to allow postsecondary funding to stagnate, colleges and universities have found financial salvation in international student fees, which can range from three to 10 times greater than those for domestic students.
But the speed and scale of this transformation has had other consequences. The presence of more than 800,000 foreign students in Canada in 2022 has exacerbated a housing crisis. It has also added a large pool of low-wage labour that has been described as a new temporary foreign worker stream.
The result is that international students have become a hot political issue. Last week, Canada’s Housing Minister Sean Fraser suggested the federal government consider a cap on study permits to alleviate some of the pressure. That drew immediate opposition from Quebec, which portrayed the idea as a federal incursion on education. It was also met with concern by Colleges and Institutes Canada (CIC), the national lobby group, which called the remarks “troubling.”
“We want to emphasize that students are not to blame for Canada’s housing crisis; they are among the most impacted,” the statement from CIC said.
The next day Prime Minister Justin Trudeau struck a more cautious note, saying international students were the latest group to be blamed for a multifaceted crisis.
The largest cohort at Canadian colleges today hails from India. At least six of Ontario’s colleges have more full-time students from India than Canada. More than 150 countries send international students to Canada, but recent data show about 40 per cent of permits went to India, followed by China at 12 per cent, Philippines at 4 per cent and many other countries with smaller shares.
When they enroll, international students are charged a higher price because their seats are not subsidized by a provincial grant. But their higher fees are also supporting a postsecondary system that wouldn’t exist at its current scale without them.
While an image persists of international students as the children of privileged families, that’s not necessarily the case. Many take on huge loans to fund their studies. And in communities such as Kitchener, international students are also living with the consequences of a dire shortage of affordable housing.
Kartik Purani, 23, shares a 625-square-foot onebedroom apartment in Kitchener with three other students from India. One sleeps in the hallway just inside the front door. One sleeps on a mattress in the living room, and two share a bedroom. They eat their meals on the tile floor. Each pays between $400 and $500 of the $1,800 monthly rent.
Mr. Purani already has a three-year bachelor of commerce from an Indian university. He’s pursuing a graduate certificate in financial technology at Conestoga, for which he’s paying about $15,000 in tuition, and plans to take another certificate afterward in order to apply for what he hopes will be the maximum three-year postgraduate work permit. He dreams of working in high finance.
He spent the first semester studying entirely online, and after living in Canada for several months, he has visited the college campus fewer than five times, he said. He has played pool twice and gone for vegan shawarma once, but otherwise hasn’t experienced much of what would be considered college life. His singular preoccupation is finding work.
“I’m under pressure. I have to earn the fees,” Mr. Purani said.
Without more work, he won’t be able to pay for his next semester of courses, he said. He had a job collecting eggs at a farm in nearby Elmira, Ont., but the employer also asked him to dispose of carcasses, which he found troubling, so he quit. He has a job at an Amazon warehouse on weekends, but the job is more than 50 kilometres away in Hamilton. He has to book a ride, which eats a chunk of his earnings.
The pressure and anxiety weigh on him, he says.
His roommates have come home to find him crying a few times. Last week he visited a mall food court to look for work. The coffee shop and fastfood employees he spoke to were kind, but they weren’t hiring, they told him. He attended a restaurant job fair, but by the time he arrived, there were already 800 applicants ahead of him, mostly international students.
Mr. Purani is clear that he chose to study in Canada, rather than the U.S. or the U.K., because its immigration rules are attractive. Students can work while they study, get a two- or three-year work permit after graduation and have a shot at being granted permanent residency. (Statistics Canada data show about 30 per cent of students get permanent residency after 10 years, but rates are higher in recent years for those who get a postgrad work permit.) The price of tuition is high relative to incomes in India, but the gamble is worth it, many students say.
“Permanent residency policies are the main attraction,” says Vaibhav Patel, one of Mr. Purani’s roommates and the apartment’s elder statesman at 30 years old. He had a well-paid job as a software engineer in India but gave it up to pursue a life in Canada. Now he washes dishes on the late shift at a café in Kitchener and rides a bicycle home after the 2 a.m. closing time on weekends. He sleeps in the main room next to the kitchen, so he has no privacy. He shrugs off the hardship.
“It’s okay if you’re a student,” Mr. Patel said.
In the long run it will pay off, he added. “Students do jobs that Canadians won’t do,” Mr. Patel said. “And colleges and universities have reached a point where they can’t survive without the money that international students bring in.”
There are currently two federal government reviews of the international student program under way, one by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and one by Global Affairs. But attempts to curtail the program will have to reckon with its impact on the schools, because international funding has become crucial to Canadian higher education.
Many of the Ontario colleges that have a large proportion of international students have expanded via branch campuses in the Greater Toronto Area or partnerships with private educational providers. The partner schools teach curricula from the colleges and the students receive Ontario college degrees and postgraduate work rights. Both Conservative and Liberal provincial governments have made attempts to limit the size of these lucrative public-private operations. The latest policy imposes a per-college cap of 7,500 students.
Cambrian College, which has a partnership with a private college in the GTA, said its home campus enrolment still has a domestic majority. It said it takes a measured approach because it doesn’t want to bring in more international students than the college or the Sudbury community can accommodate.
The schools have been encouraged on the international path by both provincial and federal governments. The federal government, which aims to attract half a million immigrants a year by 2025, is hoping to build a talent pipeline already equipped with Canadian educational credentials.
The provincial governments benefit by placing a growing share of the postsecondary funding burden on prospective immigrants.
According to a report from Ontario AuditorGeneral Bonnie Lysyk, Queen’s Park provided by far the lowest level of government support to colleges of any province in 2018-19. The funding gap that colleges face has been exacerbated by the Doug Ford government’s decision to cut domestic tuition fees by 10 per cent in 2019 and freeze them at that level.
McMaster University economist Arthur Sweetman, an expert on immigration and public policy, said the growth in international students is an example of what happens when policy makers misunderstand the incentives they create.
The federal government has placed no limits on student visas, he said, and the provinces are happy not to increase their grants to postsecondary institutions. The result is that some schools have pushed the envelope.
“I think it’s a regulatory failure,” Prof. Sweetman said. “If you tell people to go make money and here are the rules, people are going to make money and go right up to the edge of the rules.”
Conestoga said in a statement that the wellbeing of its students is a priority and that it works with them to find affordable housing options. This year, it signed onto a sector-wide set of standards on how best to support international students.
Revenue generated through increased enrolment has helped the college boost hiring, invest in new facilities as well as in new programs and student services, the statement added, including supports for students seeking employment. It has expanded its Kitchener campus, opened one in downtown Guelph and will open two new locations in Milton next year.
David Agnew, president of Seneca, said international students are now the majority at his Toronto college, and that they enrich the learning environment and college experience for everyone on campus. Domestic students aren’t displaced by the international students, as schools are required to offer places in high-demand programs to Ontario applicants first and Canadians second. The school is, however, able to offer more programs for domestic students thanks to the funding that international students provide.
“We haven’t had a grant increase in more than a decade and now we have frozen tuition. We [wouldn’t] have enough money to operate anything close to the high-quality educational institution that Ontarians should expect,” Mr. Agnew said.
Seneca recently crossed the international majority threshold among full-time students, but the ratio drops to 39 per cent when continuing education students are included. Mr. Agnew admits that the concentration of international students at some Ontario colleges could be perceived as a concern by some people. But he says it’s wrong to lay the blame for housing shortages at the feet of international students.
He said housing affordability is an issue that cuts across society. Seneca has about 1,350 residence spaces and more than 28,000 students. The college would like to work with governments and the private sector to build more, Mr. Agnew said.
“Let’s not demonize international students,” Mr. Agnew said. “Let’s work on solutions to the affordable housing issue rather than trying to blame people.”
International enrolments have been growing steadily for years. What made it a political issue this summer is the realization that additional renters are having an impact on an already stretched housing market.
In a presentation to Hamilton City Council this year, Steve Pomeroy, an industry professor at McMaster’s Canadian Housing Evidence Collaborative, said the biggest added pressure in the housing market is the rapid increase in non-permanent residents, a large chunk of whom are international students or former students. He places the inflection point at 2016, when international enrolments began to jump.
“When these folks come into the housing system they’re trying to find relatively affordable housing and they’re also displacing other folks who are trying to find relatively affordable rental housing,” Prof. Pomeroy said.
The competition heats up and international students, who are nearly all renters, often outbid lowincome Canadians in the bottom quartile of the rental market.
With as many as 900,000 students expected in the country this year, Prof. Pomeroy said in an interview it’s reasonable to assume they’re adding demand equal to somewhere between 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the national rental housing market of 4.5 million homes.
Economist Mike Moffatt was surprised when he first noticed the close links between the real estate crunch and higher education in London, Ont., where he teaches at the University of Western Ontario’s Ivey Business School. The share of the impact on rent prices attributable to international students hasn’t been quantified, Prof. Moffatt said, but rent increases are happening at the start of term and appear to be rising faster in locations near campus.
London, Kitchener, Windsor – mid-sized Ontario cities that have both university and college campuses and high numbers of international students – have seen record rent increases and the lowest vacancy rates in 20 years, according to a January report from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.
The international students do not deserve any blame, Prof. Moffatt said.
“Enrolment growth is not being fed into housing policy and it’s causing all kinds of local tensions,” he said.
At a Brampton gurdwara on an August Sunday, a steady stream of students from a range of Ontario colleges with GTA campuses arrives to join the prayers and stay for a free meal served by the community kitchen. Many of them say it’s a struggle to pay tuition and meet their basic needs.
Jaspal Kaur, a 26-year-old from Amritsar, said she hasn’t been able to find a steady job in Canada.
Her husband has come over from India to join her on an open work permit (spouses of students can apply to enter Canada and work) and his job installing kitchen cabinets has kept them going.
They share a basement apartment with two other people, paying $1,000 in rent.
She can afford her groceries at the moment, but there’s no savings.
Ms. Kaur said she needs to raise $9,000 by November to pay her tuition at Loyalist College, which has a branch campus in the Toronto area.
Sahil Bhatia, a 20-year-old studying at Canadore College’s GTA campus, works at a Brampton grocer for minimum wage and lives in a four-bedroom house shared by 12 people. Rent is $425 a month, he said. His family, farmers in India’s Punjab province, borrowed to fund his studies. His $15,000 tuition is about six times their annual income. For it to pay off, he needs to succeed in getting permanent residency.
Amardeep Kaur, 22, is an office administration student at St. Clair College’s GTA campus. She takes a break from her job at a restaurant a short drive from the gurdwara to explain that she wants to one day work in a hospital or clinic. She shares a single rented room in a house with her parents, who have come on a visitor’s visa, and works 20 hours a week. Eight people share the basement of the house where she lives in Brampton. Her younger sister wants to follow her, but Ms. Kaur said she’s trying to dissuade her.
“I told her, but everybody has a dream,” she said. “They don’t know the reality.”
A generation ago, international students weren’t allowed to work off campus. The thinking was that students should be focused on their studies. In 2000, just slightly more than 20,000 international students declared earnings from work. That increased more than ten-fold by 2019, according to a Statscan study, and has only accelerated since.
At the moment, international students are permitted to work up to 20 hours a week off campus.
A special pilot project announced by the Liberal government last fall, however, temporarily bumped that rule to 40 hours a week for some. The move was framed as an attempt to address a labour shortage, while also allowing hard-pressed students to earn more money.
Employers have been supportive, while economists have pointed out that an increase in the supply of labour at the low-end of the wage scale tends to keep wages from rising.
For those who have come to Canada to study, the experience they describe is often mixed.
At Conestoga’s downtown campus in Kitchener, Mr. Purani walks hallways that are still unfamiliar to him. He hasn’t studied in any of these classrooms yet. He doesn’t bump into anyone he knows.
He recalls that when he was working at the farm, he found it difficult to also manage his studies, which required about 30 hours of class time and study a week. Still, he’s desperate to find another job. Not working is much worse.
Every day his roommates go to work and he stays home with online classes and YouTube for company.
“I overthink a lot,” he said. “What will happen next if I don’t get my fees in time? You have the burden of debt on you.”
He passes a bulletin board decorated with encouraging messages about mental health. A handwritten poster proclaims, “The purpose of our lives is to be happy.”
He believes that, he says, even if happiness is fleeting right now.
“You have to go through the struggle to get to happiness at the end. That’s the goal,” he said.

Full text: North of Nowhere Allison Brennan (Minotaur, 368 pages) I regularly get thrillers falsely promising that “I won’t be able to stop reading.” But North of Nowhere is the real deal. I started this novel on a Friday afternoon and didn’t stop until the final pages.
Kristen and Ryan McIntyre are children in hiding. For five years they’ve been on a ranch in rural Montana with the man they call father but their real father is a Los Angeles crime boss who has been in prison.
Now he’s out and he wants his kids back but they don’t want him. That’s the opening background for this chase thriller but as Kristen and Ryan (who is deaf) escape in a small plane, there’s a crash. They are alone in the Montana wilderness with a blizzard approaching and three people are hunting them. One is a friend, one is a killer and one is their aunt, an Oregon architect. Someone is going to get to them, but meanwhile, the kids have to survive and stay on the run and it’s Kristen who’s got to carry the game.
Can any 17-year-old be smart and cunning enough to make this run? It’s a testament to Brennan’s ability to create a character that I fell for Kristen in 10 pages and cheered on her every move. If you need an airplane read, this is it.
An Evil Heart Linda Castillo (Minotaur, 320 pages) Castillo’s Kate Burkholder series is longrunning but it’s not close to being out of steam. Set in rural Ohio in Amish country, An Evil Heart is a fresh story that shows Castillo’s strong mystery-writing skills through her descriptions of solid, hardgrinding police work. This is a procedural without urban grit and, like the other Burkholders, it’s a treat.
The beginning is blunt and horrible. A young Amish man riding his bicycle to work is cut off on a rural road. Castillo pulls no punches: The boy is shot in the back with a crossbow and then savagely murdered.
The body is found as Kate is being fitted for her wedding dress. She’s come to terms with her Amish history and family and while she’ll never be one of them, they’ve learned to co-exist. Kate knows the family of the dead boy Aron, a lively, handsome member of the community who was engaged to be married and is a much loved friend. Obviously, someone somewhere hated this perfect young man and with her small local force, she’s got to ferret out the why of a particularly evil crime. Uncovering the motive requires slogging police work and Castillo walks us through it as the clues tax even Kate’s strength and intelligence.
That’s the gist of one of the best of the Burkholder books so far. And yes, there is a twist. More than one, in fact.
None of This Is True Lisa Jewell (Simon & Schuster, 384 pages) Two women turn 45 on the same day. By coincidence, they both choose to celebrate in the same upscale London restaurant. One is Alix Summer, a beautiful wealthy wife and mother with a successful podcast career. The other is Josie Fair, mother of two, wife of a much older retired man. She works as a seamstress in a D walk-in tailoring shop and her life is very, B very quiet. But all that is about to change H because Alix and Josie were born on the s same day in the same hospital in the same d London neighbourhood and, although i their lifestyles are drastically different, a they still live close to one another. Josie m instantly sees a message here and makes a H point of “meeting” Alix in the washroom.
Within days, she’s approached her with a F podcast idea. Josie’s life is about to change s radically. What if Alix documents that s change in a new podcast? a In no time, Josie and Alix are at work on i the podcast. Two women from two differ- c ent worlds. For Alix, it’s a creative chal- c lenge but it’s far more to Josie and, as we s discover, there are ramifications to the a chance restaurant meeting that lead to murder. Whose? What? Jewell moves P slowly, ratcheting up the suspense until L the surprise confrontation. Be warned. (This one doesn’t end with all the bits neat- I ly tied up. a a Voices of the Dead a Ambrose Parry p (Canongate, 401 pages) B A medical-historian friend put me onto S this series and I was hooked from the first page. My friend was dazzled by the med- h ical accuracy and surprised that he found t the mystery good too. Not so strange h when you learn that one of the two part- a ners that comprise “Ambrose Parry” is the d brilliant Chris Brookmyre. The other t member is his equally talented wife, Dr. “Marisa Haetzman. Together they’ve writ- g ten four superb novels set in Victorian h Edinburgh: Voices of the Dead is the latest t and best. n It’s 1853 and science is on the march. c Queen Victoria has just given birth to a j healthy baby boy assisted by the newly t discovered anesthetic, chloroform. Florence Nightingale is readying women to i go to war and form what will become the t nursing profession. In the midst of all this, F Dr. Will Raven has crimes on his hands.
Body parts are appearing in Surgeon’s Hall, bringing back bad memories of body snatchers and opening the door to scandal. Meanwhile, Raven’s own life is changing; married and a father, he’s ready for advancement. A new practice of his own means leaving Simpson, his boss, and the Hall behind.
All the while, aspiring doctor Sarah Fisher’s life is stalled. There is no way she’ll be admitted to the medical profession she wants. Meanwhile, quackery abounds as the new “science” of mesmerism is gaining adherents and pseudoscience offers women both promise and cure. This book has everything: atmosphere, setting and a feeling of a world about to change.
Prom Mom Laura Lippman (HarperCollins, 320 pages) I loved all Laura Lippman’s Tess Monaghan books but I’m not sorry she’s given Tess a rest and has concentrated on standalones since 2015. Prom Mom is another superb story set in Lippman’s hometown of Baltimore, Md., but it’s really the United States in microcosm.
We begin in 1997 as Amber Glass, a high-school junior, gives birth in a hotel toilet. It’s prom night and Amber’s date, high-school hero Joe Simpson, is dancing away with his ex-girlfriend. Amber, who didn’t even realize she was pregnant (yes, this is possible), went to the toilet with a “stomach ache.” Terrified and alone, forgotten by Joe, she washes up and heads home, leaving the very premature infant to die. When she’s found out, it all hits the news. She’s “Prom Mom” and Joe has become “Cad Dad.” She ends up in juvenile jail and he goes to Texas to learn real estate from a relative.
Cut ahead 20 years and Amber is back in Baltimore. She’s discovered a lot about the world since that prom. She majored in French at university and learned about art and culture in New Orleans. She’s inherited some money and is opening a gallery to assist people who, like her, don’t always have happy histories. Joe, meanwhile, is married to Meredith, a prominent plastic surgeon who knows and forgives his past.
He’s made a career in real estate and his only concession to Cad Dad is that he wants no children.
Lippman is a wonderful storyteller and she lets the characters move the action.
Joe seems a bit of a cliché but Meredith and Amber carry the action well. Then COVID comes to town and wrecks the real estate market and George Floyd riots charge the atmosphere. We are leading to something but what? Prom Mom ends with a bang. Do not read the last chapter first.
Deadlock James Byrne (Minotaur, 368 pages) This sequel to The Gatekeeper brings back Desmond Aloysius Limerick, a man with a shady past and an uncertain future. “Dez” is retired from a past that enabled him to develop some very useful survival skills and hone some equally useful contacts. In this novel, he’s approached by Raziah Swann for help; her sister Jaleh has been attacked and seriously injured. Jaleh is a business journalist who was working on a story about an auditor who has been murdered. The auditor worked for an international tech company called Clockjack, located in Portland, Ore. Raziah wants Dez to come to Portland and protect her sister.
Dez is barely on the case when the sisters are attacked by hired thugs. It’s clear that someone, somewhere wants the Swann women dead. The only clues lead to Clockjack, a firm with billions to spend and international connections that lead everywhere. I found this one a lot of fun and I raced out and got The Gatekeeper, which is just as good. Dez Limerick is here to stay.

PENDER ISLAND, B.C .
Asking Price: $19.8-million Taxes: $29,027 (2023) Lot Size: 104 acres Agents: Nicole Eastman, Paul Hague, Christa Elizabeth Frosch, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada THE BACKSTORY Global investment strategist Kiril Sokoloff has gained a reputation for making bold calls over the decades.
As the founder and chairman of 13D Research & Strategy LLC, some of his major themes revolved around disruptive technologies, oil production, and the growing economic power of China.
About 20 years ago, Mr. Sokoloff says, he began to become increasingly worried about pandemics, extreme weather events and social unrest.
While he delved into the implications for investing, he began looking for a sanctuary.
“I wanted a place that I could go to where I could be safe and secure with my family,” Mr. Sokoloff recalls.
Canada’s West Coast seemed like a good place to start, says the U.S.-born investor, who considered British Columbia one of the most beautiful places in the world and Vancouver one of the most livable cities.
Mr. Sokoloff’s search led him to the Gulf Islands, where he found a sustainable, organic farm dating to 1874 at the north end of Pender Island. The 104-acre property includes one kilometre of oceanfront, with rocky cliffs rising from a tidal beach.
Two of the early landowners were Spencer Percival and Neptune Grimmer, according to Sotheby’s International Realty Canada. The farm went on to have various owners through the years, including a retired mathematics teacher who named the property AfterMath.
Later, an Air Canada pilot kept a small plane on the land and commuted to work at Vancouver International Airport. A new owner took over the property in 1981 and built a biodynamic farm.
After that, an Alberta businessman operated the property as an agri-tourism business with accommodations, a wedding venue and a 5.5-acre vineyard.
When Mr. Sokoloff purchased Clam Bay Farm in 2011, there was an existing farmhouse, along with accommodations for farm workers, a barn and a beach house, among other outbuildings.
“I loved the fact that it was a farm and self-sufficient,” he says.
THE ESTATE TODAY After purchasing the land, Mr. Sokoloff began looking for a local architectural practice with a depth of knowledge and experience in building for the West Coast climate and landscape.
Blue Sky Architecture has garnered numerous awards for its style of contemporary West Coast architecture. The firm has become renowned for its use of curves, swooping roofs and organic forms to create buildings that meld into the landscape.
Mr. Sokoloff commissioned architects Kim Smith and Bo Helliwell to design a new family residence on a point of land jutting into the Salish Sea.
A few years were spent lining up the permits, he says, which included having the property rezoned from agri-tourism to residential.
Point House, finished in 2020, provides five bedrooms and six bathrooms in 6,603 square feet of living space.
A long driveway winds through the property to a house of stone, glass and wood designed with a combination of conventional framing and timber framing.
“Great care was taken to shape the dynamic yet gentle form of the building,” the architects say in describing the project. “Sitting very naturally, conforming to the lines of the forested hill, the point and the sea, it is always changing as one walks through and around the building.”
At the centre, an indoor-outdoor space divides the plan into social and family spaces on one side with guest and service space on the other.
The combined living room and dining room is a soaring, arched space topped by a ceiling of Douglas fir. The split granite fireplace anchors the room at one end and a wall of glass optimizes views of the sea.
Throughout the house, floors are finished with wide-plank white oak and stone tiles.
From the water, the building is barely visible, Mr. Sokoloff says.
“It’s very much blended into the environment.”
Today the property includes the farm, vineyard, acres of untouched old-growth forest, a pond, a sawmill, a water treatment plant and a powerful generator.
While the house was under construction, Mr. Sokoloff spent time around the orchards, greenhouses and gardens each summer.
“We used to go and bring in the grapes,” he says of visits to the vineyard with his three daughters.
Hiking trails wind through the property, and the house sits on a meadow surrounded by arbutus, fir and maple trees. One Douglas fir on the land is 800 years old, Mr. Sokoloff adds.
The vineyard, planted with ortega, pinot noir and siegerrebe grapes, is leased to Sea Star Winery.
The estate has a 260-foot pier stretching through the shallows to the deeper waters of Davidson Bay, and a commercial-grade 50foot dock to accommodate sailboats, power boats and sea planes.
Ferries from Victoria and Vancouver run to Pender Island’s Otter Bay daily. Sea planes, chartered from Vancouver, can reach the property in about 20 minutes, and there’s room to land a helicopter on site.
Mr. Sokoloff is often described as a contrarian, but he chuckles at the label. There are times when it pays to be a contrarian and times to do nothing, he says. At other times he switches between bullish and bearish as the big picture changes, as it has with oil prices over the years.
Looking back to the early 2000s, Mr. Sokoloff’s fears of pandemics, extreme weather and water shortages turned out to be prescient, he acknowledges.
His change in perspective now stems from the fact his younger daughters have started school in Switzerland and the family’s centre of gravity has shifted to Europe.
They can no longer spend two or three months a year on the island and Mr. Sokoloff hopes a new owner will enjoy the tranquility.
“Pender itself is just a beautiful place,” he says.
THE BEST FEATURE The sea life along the coast is amazing, says Mr. Sokoloff.
The waters surrounding Pender Island are home to otters, sea lions, seals, porpoises and shorebirds. Orcas and humpback whales sometimes pass through the channel.
“The site was so spectacular,” he says of his choice to set the house on the point. “You can see Mount Baker in the distance and the whales coming by.”
As a follower of the principles of feng shui, Mr. Sokoloff also appreciates the home’s position overlooking the waters of Navy Channel.
“The energy and the flow of water in a place is very important,” he says. “It’s flowing back and forth and back right in front of you.”

Full text: The young mother’s patience is wearing thin. Her two young boys simply won’t leave the fountain. While the river rocks beside the giant clam fascinate the older one, the young one stares in wide-eyed wonder at the mermaid.
It is worthy of a good stare: The unusual mermaid sports two tails in order to straddle the merhorse – the equine has gills and its body ends in a fish tail – and the frozen scene of merhorse rearing up at the sight of the angry, hissing clam as its nude rider grips the reins, well, it looks like something out of a fantasy movie.
“Or a theme park,” says Neil Park of the Etobicoke Historical Society. “And no one in the family really knows what, truly, the inspiration was for [the sculptor].
When the mother’s Uber arrives, she’s had enough: The two tykes are ordered into the car.
But I haven’t had enough, so Mr. Park and I stroll the short distance from 90 Cordova Ave. to 1276 Islington Ave. to look at the less fantastical and more Henry Moore-ish fountain in front of that building. This one, also by Alfio Bartoletti, consists of a graceful arch with an attached disc; four bowls simultaneously contain and eject water.
It’s at this fountain that Mr. Park’s journey into learning about Mr. Bartoletti’s incredible life began. A number of years ago, a curious passerby contacted the Etobicoke Historical Society about the fountain. But, since the little plaque was tarnished, the person wasn’t able to make out the name. They e-mailed: “All I see is Fio Bartolet.” Since a Google search turned up nothing under that name, Mr. Park came out to investigate and, using his thumb as a tiny squeegee, uncovered a few more letters.
An online mention of a 32page book, Alfio Bartoletti: Film Studio Artist, by Mario Bartoletti, and an obituary for the author, provided Mr. Park with the names of children and grandchildren. He struck gold when a granddaughter in California wrote back and sent him an ecopy of the book. “You’re not going to find it in any library or anything, it was just for the family,” says Mr. Park.
It turns out the developer of the two apartment buildings, the Fidani family, were related to the Bartolettis. Both families were from Porto Civitanova on Italy’s Adriatic coast.
Born in 1900, Alfio Bartoletti studied art in Padua and Florence and then moved to the University of Rome in 1921; there, he found part-time work in the Italian film industry. After a run-in with Mussolini’s Blackshirts, he immigrated to Buffalo, where he opened an artist’s studio. After it failed in 1929, he borrowed money from his uncle in Toronto to move to Hollywood.
In Hollywood, he found a wife, Rosa Thomas (from B.C.), fathered two sons, and found work sculpting set pieces for films such as The Scarlett Empress and The Hurricane. During the Second World War he’d work on airframe plaster casts for Convair and Lockheed. After the war, he returned to glitz and glamour via films such as Tycoon, Arch of Triumph and Wake of the Red Witch, which saw John Wayne battle a large, Bartoletti-created octopus.
Unfortunately, in 1949, Mr. Bartoletti was blacklisted after failing to show up at an employee screening of The Red Menace.
While he was busy at work on plaster castings, it was assumed he must be a communist sympathizer. So, in 1953, the Bartoletti family relocated to Toronto. In Toronto, he’d design a bronze plaque to commemorate swimmer Marilyn Bell’s historic crossing of Lake Ontario in 1954 (on the CNE grounds), create a large trillium for the Royal York Hotel’s Ontario Room and help restore the crumbling plaster at St. Lawrence Hall.
After a brief stay in Jamaica and some work for the first James Bond film, Dr. No, Mr. Bartoletti returned to Toronto and was hired by ornamental plasterer Balmer Studios, where he probably did the work for his cousin, Orey Fidani, who built the two Etobicoke apartment buildings in 1964 and 1965.
The 1960s, Mr. Park and I surmise, were a good time for art and architecture to form alliances even without the family connection. With Expo 67 and the Canadian Centennial in the air, there was a shared belief that the two not only went hand-in-hand, they made for a better world.
Shaking Mr. Park’s hand and thanking him for such a fascinating story, I head north to see what’s become of the better world that an “all electric” neighbourhood provided in 1963. Also to be found at etobicokehistorical.com, Denise Harris’s story of Albion Grove Village – a subdivision behind the apartment towers at Albion Road and Martin Grove Road – may not have a Hollywood connection, but I’m on the hunt for the Oscar-like medallions that read “Live Better Electrically” above every doorbell.
While I’m unable to spot any, I think of how every one of these homes sported electric heating, 100 amp service, an electric water heater, and (mostly) electric appliances, but that, six decades on, that many of those things have likely been replaced or renovated away, much like the little medallions. I do, however, enjoy discovering some of the house models that were on offer by Jobert Construction; in addition to the ubiquitous side- and back-splits, there is one that sports an ornamental bit of post-and-beam roof that makes for a bit of rain protection over the front door.
And, as I open my car door to leave, I remind myself that local historical societies do amazing work, and they are deserving of our support.

Full text: Rouge Mona Awad (Hamish Hamilton, September) In an article in The New York Times Style Magazine earlier this year, Margaret Atwood named Awad as her “literary heir apparent” (for reasons that go beyond their strangely similar last names). Described as “Snow White meets Eyes Wide Shut,” this horror-and-satire-tinged novel about a young woman who gets involved with a cult-like beauty spa after the death of her mother has been optioned for a film to be helmed by Johan Renck, the director of HBO’s acclaimed Chernobyl.
The Marvels of Youth Tim Bowling (Buckrider Books, October) News that the owner of the beloved comic-book shop he used to frequent on the shores of the Fraser River died sends Sean, the protagonist of this novel, back 40 years to consider the series of lifechanging events that took place in his small fishing town during “that bittersweet spot of time between the release of Jaws and the release of the first Star Wars movie.”
Semi-Detached Elizabeth Ruth (Cormorant, September) Straddling two iconic Toronto winter weather events – the Ice Storm of 2013 and the Great Snowstorm of 1944 – this ghostmeets-romance-meets-mystery novel by the author of Ten Good Seconds of Silence centres on real estate agent Laura who delves into the past of a comatose elderly client while preparing to sell the latter’s home.
Yara Tamara Faith Berger (Coach House, October) Berger’s writing – uncomfortably sexual more than sexy – isn’t for everyone, but there’s no denying its power; her novels are never uninteresting. In Yara, set in the early 2000s, a woman sends her titular teen daughter on a birthright trip to Israel to get her away from the controlling, possibly abusive older woman Yara’s been dating.
The Circle Katherena Vermette (Hamish Hamilton, September) Told through a series of voices, many of which will be familiar to readers of Vermette’s previous novels The Break and AtwoodGibson-Prize-winner The Strangers, The Circle’s format is meant to mirror a restorative justice circle.
The final instalment in the author’s trilogy about the Winnipeg Métis Stranger family focuses on the impact on the community when Phoenix Stranger is released from prison following her role in a brutal assault on a local girl.
Wild Hope Joan Thomas (HarperCollins, September) Thomas’s talent remains largely unsung, despite her winning the 2019 Governor-General’s Fiction Award for her novel Five Wives.
The Winnipeg native’s fourth novel is about a restaurant owner who goes missing during a camping trip shortly after he spars with a childhood friend turned that most modern of villains: a bottled-water magnate.
Study for Obedience Sarah Bernstein (Knopf, August) In this unsettling and beguiling novel by Scotland-based, Montreal-born Bernstein, animals start going mad and dying in mysterious ways after a young woman comes to an unnamed northern town, where her family was once persecuted, to act as housekeeper to her wealthy, domineering older brother.
Empty Spaces Jordan Abel (McClelland & Stewart, August) The title plays off of James Fenimore Cooper’s endless descriptions of landscape in his 18th-century novel The Last of the Mohicans, but Abel’s paragraph-less “reimagining” of the novel, from the perspective of a Nisga’a person whose relationship to their land is upended by colonialism, is – visually at least – the opposite of empty space.
Whispering City Horace Brown (Véhicule Press, September) The latest in the Véhicule Press’ Ricochet series of vintage noir mysteries resurrects what it claims is one of the most soughtafter Canadian pulp novels. Originally published in 1947, it gives us Renée Brancourt, a Québécoise former pin-up driven to madness by the shocking death of her lover, and who now, from her own deathbed, sets intrepid reporter Mary Roberts on the trail of his possible assassin.
The Cobra and the Key Sam Shelstad (Brindle & Glass, October) Described by its publisher as How Fiction Works by James Wood meets Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov, Shelstad’s novel about asyet-to-be published novelist Sam, who’s biding his time as a Value Village cashier while waiting for the world to recognize his literary genius, is presented in the guise of a guide to writing fiction, which – if you’re still with me – was also written by (character) Sam.
Moon of the Turning Leaves Waubgeshig Rice (Knopf Random House, October) Rice had a hit with Moon of the Crusted Snow, a postapocalyptic novel about a northern Anishinaabe community that descends into chaos when it’s inexplicably thrust into a permanent blackout.
In this follow-up, set 10 years later, the community sends a scouting mission south to find out what, if anything, is left of the rest of the world.
The Observer Marina Endicott (Knopf, September) Endicott drew on personal experience to tell the story of a woman who becomes editor of a local newspaper in the small Alberta town where her RCMP officer husband receives his first posting.
The Saskatchewan author’s husband, also an RCMP officer, was stationed in Mayerthorpe, Alta.
Daughter Claudia Dey (Doubleday, September) Dey’s third novel (after Stunt and Heartbreaker) offers an emotionally astute exploration of gender and family dynamics in the story of Mona, a playwright and occasional muse to her philandering, manipulative novelist father Paul, who’s still grasping at the laurels from his one great novel, Daughter.

Real estate market eases back into balance: A surge in listings means that housing supply and demand have levelled off

Full text: TORONTO The Bank of Canada’s backto-back interest-rate hikes put a damper on the housing market rebound this summer, with sales edging down in July for the first time in six months.
Royal Bank of Canada economists Robert Hogue and Rachel Battaglia say extremely hot weather and massive forest fires may have held back activity in some regions as well.
New listings have now surged 24 per cent since April, they note.
These changing conditions have brought supply and demand back into balance after tightening surprisingly quickly in the spring, they add.
The spring rebound in sales across the country led to a bounce in prices in the TeranetNational Bank National Composite House Price Index (HPI) in July, according to National Bank of Canada economist Daren King.
The composite HPI, which covers 11 major markets in Canada, jumped 2.4 per cent from June to July on a seasonally adjusted basis.
Mr. King notes that the rise was the second-highest increase in a single month after the gain recorded in July, 2006.
Halifax led the way with a 4.9per-cent jump, followed by Hamilton with 4.4 per cent, Vancouver with 3.9 per cent and Toronto, 3.5 per cent.
Compared with July, 2022, the composite index slipped by 1.9 per cent, with Toronto down 2.1 per cent.
The Teranet-National Bank HPI tracks prices after they have been recorded at land registry offices, which means the numbers lag those of local real estate boards.
On a year-over-year basis, the largest declines were seen in St.Catharine’s-Niagara with a 10.5per-cent drop, Brantford with 9.08 per cent and London with 9.25 per cent.
Some smaller markets have seen sharp drops from their peak prices in the spring of last year.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the Peterborough, Ont., index decreased 16.3 per cent from its peak in May, 2022. Windsor, Ont., fell 15.1 per cent in the same period. Abbotsford-Mission, B.C., slid 14.2 per cent from the index peak in April, 2022.
Mr. King says index prices could continue to rise in the third quarter, bolstered by strong population growth and tight supply.
After that, however, prices will likely face headwinds as recent interest-rate increases hamper affordability and the economy loses some buoyancy, Mr. King cautions.
As for sales in July, the national picture shows a small dip of 0.7 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis.
Saskatchewan, Quebec and Alberta saw stronger sales, Mr. King points out, but British Columbia and Ontario saw their upward trend reversed.
In the Toronto area, sales fell 8.7 per cent in July from June following an 8.5-per-cent decline the previous month.
On the supply side, Mr. King says, new listings rose 5.6 per cent nationally in July to mark a fourth consecutive monthly increase.
The number of months of inventory, which measures how long it would take to sell all available listings at the current pace of sales, rose to 3.2 in July from 3.1 in June. That’s higher than the trough of 1.7 during the pandemic, Mr. King says, but low on a historical basis.
Looking ahead, Mr. King says the growing impact of interestrate hikes and his expectation of a slower labour market may lead to a loss of momentum in real estate in the months ahead.
Record demographic growth, however, will likely prevent a significant drop in activity, he adds.
Farah Omran, senior economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, believes the spring sales rally was premature. Ms. Omran points to a widespread conviction in the real estate market that the Bank of Canada was finished with its rate-hiking cycle and that cuts were imminent as a reason for the optimism.
The resurgence in some part fuelled the central bank’s decision to resume tightening in June and adopt a more hawkish tone on the outlook for future hikes, she says, because the action undermined the efforts of policy makers to slow down economic activity and bring inflation back to the Bank’s 2-percent target.
The Bank of Canada’s increases in June and July, along with the change in tone, pushed variable and fixed mortgage rates up, she adds, leading to higher borrowing costs and slower demand.
“We continue to believe that the bigger driver of the slowdown in housing activity in recent months is the uncertainty effect created by the Bank of Canada actions,” Ms. Omran says in a note to clients.
The Bank signalled that a pause is not a guarantee of an end, she adds, leading potential buyers to realize that the future of rates, inflation and economic activity remains uncertain.
The Bank’s message also helped to thwart speculative activity because investors are even more sensitive to the suggestion of higher borrowing costs for longer, which could in turn mean lower profits, Ms. Omran adds.

Full text: When Hamilton’s 541 Eatery & Exchange opened in 2014, it was a faithbased coffee shop and community hub with a mandate to give back. Customers could buy buttons along with their lattes, which could be redeemed by neighbours in need of a free sandwich or coffee.
Today, that need has become so overwhelming that the café – which had grown into a lifeline for the neighbourhood, providing free meals to 150 people each day – has been forced to close its doors.
“It’s safe to say we’re not resourced properly to offer all the support that our staff and community need, and we’re bearing witness to the harm this is causing,” the organization posted to social media in late July, announcing what it hopes is a temporary closure.
As homelessness reaches emergency levels in Hamilton, the café had become a critical piece of the social services infrastructure, without the funding or support to sustain it. The button jars were chronically empty. Staff and volunteers – who are baristas, not social workers – struggled with the impact of witnessing mental-health crises and overdoses on a daily basis, knowing there were few other places in the city for people to go.
The housing affordability crisis that has hit communities across the country is acutely visible in Hamilton, where real estate prices have risen faster than anywhere else in Canada, and where an increasing number of both building cranes and homeless encampments dot the downtown core.
At Woodlands Park, less than a minute from the 541 café on Barton Street, more than two dozen tents are set up in one of the city’s largest encampments. The city recently passed a protocol that puts rules in place – there can be no more than five tents in any given spot, and they must keep 100 metres away from schools, daycares, playgrounds, pools and splash pads – in recognition that encampments will be a reality for the near future.
As the city scrambles to deal with housing issues – which also include a 6,100-name waitlist for social housing and a chronically full shelter system – experts warn that addressing the crisis entails not just building and acquiring new affordable and supportive housing stock, but hanging on to what little is left.
Over the last decade, according to the census, the city has lost roughly 16,000 private-market rental units going for $750 or less a month.
Rents are controlled in Ontario as long as tenants are in a unit. But the moment they leave – either on their own accord, or through eviction – landlords can hike the price as high as the market will allow.
Overnight, a $900-a-month apartment can see the rent jump to between $1,600 and $2,000.
“We’ve kind of eroded and lost that lower end of the rent distribution,” says Steve Pomeroy, a professor who is part of McMaster University’s Canadian Housing Evidence Collaborative (CHEC).
“So there is just an absolute lack of lower rent units for low-income people.”
Particularly in cases where someone is evicted or squeezed out, the problem becomes twofold, says Professor Jim Dunn, also with CHEC.
“Not only does it create an affordability problem for the person leaving, but it also means we’ve lost an affordable unit.”
Experts are seeing this happen on a large scale. Prof. Dunn recalls first hearing back in 2017 that a local apartment building owner had offered to cut cheques for tenants who would agree to move out. It was a troubling sign of how lucrative it was for them to turn over these units.
“Vacancy decontrol has created this situation where institutional investors and large landlords come in, they buy up these older buildings, and they’re underperforming because they’ve got all these tenants that are grandfathered into inflation-controlled rents,” Prof. Dunn said.
“There’s an incentive to get rid of them.” In a recent presentation to city council, Prof. Dunn and Prof. Pomeroy, outlined a roadmap to tackle the local housing crisis, stressing, among other things, the importance of boosting rental assistance to help keep tenants in affordable units when they are struggling to pay their rent.
“We want to keep those people in those units as long as possible,” Prof. Dunn said. “It would actually be a valuable investment for the city – for any municipality – to put money into those people’s hands.”
On Friday, City Council was set to vote to enact a “safe apartment buildings bylaw” that would enforce stricter maintenance standards to help keep them from falling into disrepair (which landlords then use to justify renovictions).
Prof. Dunn and Prof. Pomeroy also stressed the value of helping local non-profits acquire rental properties, which would be much faster and cheaper than building new ones.
Ultimately, they say the crisis is also one of income inadequacy.
“The bottom line is growth in housing costs, both rental and ownership, are drastically outstripping increases in incomes,” Prof. Dunn said. “Social assistance is a joke, relative to current rents, for sure – but even people who are working are struggling.”
Currently, single working-age adults receive $733 a month through Ontario Works, the province’s main income assistance program, or $1,306 a month through the Ontario Disability Support Program.
A person working full time at minimum wage (currently $15.50 an hour, and set to rise to $16.55 an hour in October) would make about $2,700 a month, or $32,00 a year, before taxes.
An average one-bedroom apartment in the city now goes for $1,855, according to Rentals.ca.
According to Hamilton Food Share’s 2022 Hunger Report, more than 55 per cent of people using emergency food banks reported spending at least half of their income on rent – putting them at “extreme risk of homelessness.” Once a person loses their housing, they fall into a backlogged and overloaded system that only exacerbates their challenges.
At a recent town hall on encampments – which drew more than 1,000 people – the city’s director of housing services, Michelle Baird, spoke about the shelter system’s capacity issues, and an ever-growing waitlist for housing.
“Because rent costs overall are quite high and continue to grow, people who are in rent-geared-toincome units often can’t find another affordable place to move out to. So the system is a bit stuck,” she said in an interview.
“We don’t have a lot of movement.”
Experts agree there is a desperate need for more supportive housing units, which provide wrap-around support for people on site, for everything from mental-health issues to diabetes management or meal supply.
Building new apartments, Ms. Baird said, costs somewhere between $500,000 and $550,000 per unit.
“It’s not something the municipality can take on on their own,” she said, adding that the city is working to maximize partnerships with other levels of government.
But like Mr. Pomeroy and Prof.
Dunn, Ms. Baird said another key piece of the solution “is really to invest in the units we have and make sure they stay in the system.”

Boom in rec businesses at malls points to fast-evolving trend: Look for pickleball, e-karts and indoor bike trails coming soon to a complex near you

Full text: Canadian malls have long featured recreation facilities – gyms are everywhere, and West Edmonton Mall’s waterpark has been a draw since the mid-1980s – but the recent launch of numerous, elaborate recreation centres in shopping complexes large and small points to a fast-evolving trend, insiders say.
“Entertainment has become a necessary part of the shoppingcentre experience,” says David Wyatt, senior vice-president of retail at Morguard Investments Ltd., which owns or manages 17 malls across Canada.
Last September, Morguard’s Bramalea City Centre in Brampton, Ont., launched Activate, a 13,000-square-foot gaming facility where groups play life-sized video games, dodging and blasting through 11 different competitions that challenge agility and problem solving.
At the company’s Cambridge Centre in Cambridge, Ont., a vacant Target store was transformed in 2018 into a massive Kingpin, where customers can play laser tag, throw axes and more.
And early next year should see the development of e-kart racetracks at two of the company’s malls (the names of which will be announced next month, Mr. Wyatt says).
Mr. Wyatt says he is working with four-year-old Canadian startup Activate (which claims to be the world’s first active gaming facility and is developing its 10th location) and Kitchener, Ont.,based Bingemans, which owns Kingpin, to bring these amusement centres to more of its mall properties. He says he’s noticed an increase in mall competition for these types of entertainment concepts.
“More users are looking. The market is growing.”
Mr. Wyatt adds that as more U.S. malls embrace everything from indoor skiing and skydiving facilities to pickleball courts and golf ranges, Canadian mall owners are taking note.
“A lot of times in retail, we see innovation in the U.S. and then it migrates to Canada,” Mr. Wyatt explains.
Morguard first introduced entertainment at its shopping centres with Cineplex cinemas. But popular options now “are more interactive so people can get physically involved. They just don’t sit and watch. And that’s exciting for everyone.”
By drawing more footfall and new retail tenants aiming to capitalize on it, the increase in recreation centres is benefiting shopping centres, says Susan Thompson, associate director of research at global real estate brokerage firm Colliers.
According to Colliers’ recent Canadian Retail Outlook report, “retail rents reached record highs for most enclosed centres” in the first quarter of 2023, while “vacancy rates dropped nationwide.”
Average retail vacancies hover between just 4 per cent and 9 per cent, depending on asset class, and rents range from $17 to $37 a square foot, according to the report.
Ms. Thompson says that even given the Canadian closing announcements for U.S. retail giants Bed Bath & Beyond and Nordstrom, rising interest rates and a slowing economy, “the market has proven its underlying resilience and willingness to embrace change.”
This change “definitely includes the introduction of a wider array of entertainment and recreation coming into shopping centres,” Ms. Thompson says.
“Owners want to create an environment where all of the different parts work together, so people who come to be entertained will participate in other mall offerings.”
QuadReal Property Group, which owns 13 malls across Canada, launched a massive indoor bike park at its Capilano Mall in North Vancouver in June.
Chrystal Burns, QuadReal’s senior vice-president of retail for Western Canada, says recreation concepts at malls have become “a deep trend” representing “a structural shift in how we are consuming and how we want to see our spaces and places used.”
With Canadian consumer spending on services and experiences outpacing spending on goods, Ms. Burns says QuadReal aims to feature recreation amenities at every one of its malls. The company is on its way to that goal with such facilities as Goh Ballet school and Hammam Spa at Toronto’s Bayview Village and the new pickleball courts by Toronto’s trailblazing Fairgrounds club – at Cloverdale Mall in Etobicoke, and Assembly Park in Vaughan.
To develop the North Shore Bike Park – said to be the world’s first indoor bike park at a mall – QuadReal partnered with the facility’s 10 North Vancouver owners to ensure successful rezoning and building permits and negotiated a lease for the tenants of the former Sears space.
“We really win when our tenants are successful,” Ms. Burns says. “In terms of lease structure, we’ll provide relief in the beginning of the term with increases over time as their business grows.”
QuadReal’s assist in marketing led to discount cards for park patrons to redeem at other mall retailers – a bonus for parents who drop off kids and then go shopping, Ms. Burns says.
North Shore Bike Park’s allwooden structures can’t compare with the popular bike trails in the mountains just a few kilometres north of Capilano Mall. But the 65,000-square-foot space’s indoor environment lets cyclists ride its flowy, jumpy terrain not only during the cold off-season, “but also during summer heat waves,” says Ed Johnson, North Shore Bike Park’s co-owner and commercial director.
Mr. Johnson says locating the bike park in a mall was always the intention.
“It makes sense for us,” Mr. Johnson says. “There’s already footfall, food and drink offerings, parking, and it’s a known location that people can get to.”
In terms of the size of buildings they require, and scaling the business, “we really saw an opportunity in all the shopping centres’ vacant big-box spaces,” he adds.
“Often these sites are what used to be a hub of a local community, so it’s also a way of returning them to that former glory.”

Beijing’s economic woes raise risk of chaos in Western markets

Full text: The world’s second-largest economy is sputtering out, with China facing trials and tribulations that include record youth unemployment and consumer price deflation, raising the spectre of prolonged economic misery that could rip through financial markets.
Already grappling with 21-percent joblessness among 16- to 24year-olds and its weakest GDP growth in decades – “around 5 per cent,” according to the government – China’s hoped-for economic rebound from rigid COVID-19 lockdowns is showing signs of severe strain.
In the past week, China reported that new bank lending in July had fallen to its lowest level since 2009; yet another major developer, Country Garden, missed interest debt payments; and consumer prices fell year-over-year last month, confirming fears that domestic demand is uncharacteristically soft.
At a campaign event Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden referred to China’s economy as a “ticking time bomb.”
The country’s financial outlook is deteriorating quickly.
Some economists now fear its stimulus-fuelled property bubble could finally burst.
This could turn China into another Japan, mired in muted growth and financial pain for decades.
Should such a scenario unfold, the knock-on effects in Western markets would be substantial.
The hope for resurgent Chinese demand has propped up the prices of multiple commodities – many of which are produced by Canadian companies – and China’s rebound was expected to offset slowing economic growth as inflation bites in Europe and North America.
At this point it is unclear if China will fall into such an economic trap. The country has faced significant financial disruptions before but found its way out by unleashing major government spending, notably in 2008 and 2016. The trouble this time is that China may already be maxed out, with total debt-to-GDP hovering near 300 per cent in 2022, higher than both the United States and the euro zone, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
“They can’t really make much use of the old playbook,” said David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, and a former economic and financial emissary to China for the U.S. Treasury. “And they’re reluctant to shift to a new playbook.”
Chinese President Xi Jinping has also signalled that he now wants a different type of economy – one less dependent on government money propping up real estate values and funding infrastructure development. The Communist Party’s “sustained emphasis on ‘high quality growth’ signals that the authorities are not ready for an all-out stimulus,” wrote Bert Hoffman, the director of the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore and the World Bank’s country director for China from 2014 to 2019, in a recent report.
Because a Chinese downturn has the potential to degenerate into an economic collapse, the default thinking among many Western analysts is that Beijing will step in once the pain really starts to hit. However, China experts stress that Mr. Xi has a much different mindset, and they point to China’s recent crackdown on its booming tech sector as an example of how ruthless the government can be; even though the sector was a major boon for the economy, the ruling party worried that tech giants such as Alibaba were growing too powerful.
“Security, broadly defined, is more important than economic development,” Mr. Dollar said of the government’s mentality.
China’s economic woes have been brewing for years, spurred by structural forces such as an aging population and soaring government debt, particularly at the local level. For years the country kept these forces at bay with heavy government spending, money that often found a home in the real estate sector.
But even before the pandemic hit, Beijing seemed aware that the sector was overheated and started using the mantra “housing is for living in, not for speculation.” The government tightened developers’ access to credit, forcing them to rely more on advanced sales to fund their projects. Much of that financing dried up during the pandemic, and the drought contributed to developer woes that came to light when Evergrande, a massive real estate company, defaulted on debt in 2021.
The company has since posted US$81-billion in losses.
With China’s real estate sector wobbling, the economy has started a downward spiral that is now showing up in record youth unemployment and in deflation, with the consumer price index falling 0.3 per cent in July from the year prior. The fear now is that psychological forces will take over and consumers will be scared to spend because there is so much uncertainty.
Despite the pain, Jia Wang, interim director of the China Institute at the University of Alberta, said China has mistakenly been written off before. “We shouldn’t underestimate its ability to bounce back from a sluggish recovery,” she said in an interview.
Plus, she added, the government is still mindful of the mass protests that erupted after years of draconian pandemic lockdowns. “That’s something the central government really doesn’t want,” she said.

Renting your first home can jeopardize thousands in tax benefits

Full text: It doesn’t matter what Canadian real estate market you’re in: The increased costs of paying a mortgage are scary when you buy your first home.
For me, my monthly housing costs doubled when I went from renting a one-bedroom apartment to owning one, and that’s before factoring any sort of maintenance or renovations. At first, I figured that I could always move in with friends again and rent out my apartment if the costs became too much. It would be even more savvy if I used those savings to make extra payments on my mortgage, right?
Well, I’m here to tell you that I quickly learned that it’s not that simple, especially if you’re a firsttime homebuyer.
That’s because there are thousands of dollars of tax benefits you get if you’re purchasing a home for the first time. That includes an exemption for land transfer taxes in some provinces, which are an upfront cost that can’t be factored into your mortgage. In B.C., where I live, local governments will give you a rebate on your property tax if your home is also your primary residence.
“People are not always aware of the complications that come with using your house as a rental,” said Yannick Lemay, a tax specialist with H&R Block.
In B.C., the land transfer tax exemption for a $500,000 home would amount to a savings of $8,000, a sum that immediately comes off your closing costs.
But to actually qualify for the program, you have to live in your home continuously for the full year after your purchase. If you move out, you may have to repay a portion of the rebate, although Mr. Lemay says the province isn’t clear on what happens in this scenario. A similar program in Ontario is more lenient – requiring only that you move into your property within 92 days after your purchase to be eligible.
Then there’s the B.C. homeowner grant, which is a property tax rebate for homeowners. In my area, it amounts to $770, but anyone renting out their home isn’t eligible for it.
And lastly, the federal FirstTime Home Buyer’s Tax Credit is a $10,000 credit deducted off your income when you file for taxes. That can represent up to $1,500 in actual savings on your tax return. The qualification rules are a bit more lenient here (you only have to occupy the home one year after purchase), but it still could limit your plans.
Tally that up, and you’re looking at $10,000 in tax benefits that could be at risk if you end up renting the home you planned to live in.
However, there is good news for people who purchase larger homes with more bedrooms: None of these incentives are at risk if you rent out a room in your home while still living in it.
That’s because these credits generally hinge on the home being your primary residence, so if that’s the case, you’re all good.
In my housing search, I saw many one-bedroom and twobedroom condos listed for fairly similar prices. The one-bedroom units were fancier, while the twobedroom units might have been less updated and in lesser buildings.
I ended up going the one-bedroom route, and I don’t regret it at all. But for some people, the flexibility that a two-bedroom apartment offers could be worth it, especially considering that you have an option to rent out your apartment that doesn’t jeopardize your access to thousands of dollars in tax savings.
Be warned, though: You might have some lengthy discussions with a tax specialist if you end up renting your whole apartment.

Full text: Norma Millar had designed the little green bungalow herself. It was to be the place she and her husband Lawrence would live out their retirement years together, surrounded by 45 acres of woods, old apple trees and a flowering meadow.
Heatherdale Road, a rolling strip of asphalt that slices through farmland and woodlot in eastern Prince Edward Island, seemed like the kind of place where they could embrace the quiet, country life.
But, almost as soon as they moved in, their neighbours started moving away. First, the farm down the road sold, then the family next door moved out, then the owners of the home directly across from them left.
Then came the knock on their door.
It was two men in orange robes, with their heads shaved and an offer in hand. They had been sent from a Buddhist institute that had recently opened across the road. The monks had been buying real estate around Kings County, acquiring family farms and homes. And now they were standing in the Millars’ doorway, asking to buy their home.
“We barely had the framing up when they first visited us,” Ms. Millar recalled. “They said they wanted to buy the land and the house. We said, ‘No, this is our home. We don’t want to sell. We want to live here.’” The Millars bought the property on Heatherdale Road in 2007 after returning to their home province from British Columbia. By the fall of 2011, they were already encircled. Over the next six years, all but two properties within a roughly two-kilometre stretch of the monks’ facility, known as Great Enlightenment Buddhist Institute Society, or GEBIS, had been bought up by the Buddhists.
Initially, the Millars tried to push back. They opposed a rezoning application from GEBIS, which was asking for more farmland to be deemed institutional to accommodate its growing campus. They also wrote letters to the local council and told the monks to leave them alone. For the next few years, the visits and the phone calls stopped.
Then, in 2017, a new realtor appeared at the Millars’ door, saying she had been hired by the monks to try one last time. With most of their neighbours now gone, and more money on the table, they finally agreed to sell. What the Millars didn’t understand at the time was that changes were coming that would be far more transformative than what was happening on their quiet country road. The sales on Heatherdale were just a small part of a larger expansion effort by Bliss and Wisdom, a Taiwan-based, China-linked Buddhist organization whose presence has sparked a fierce debate over land ownership on the island.
The group, fuelled by tens of millions of dollars in international donations and led by a globe-trotting Chinese-Canadian woman known to adherents as Master Zhen-Ru, is linked to hundreds of land transactions in eastern PEI – an acquisition spree that has led to calls for a public inquiry.
Bliss and Wisdom now has five affiliated campuses in PEI, with hundreds of students seeking enlightenment in the Buddhist tradition. Each year, more monks and nuns keep coming – and with them, more land sales linked to Bliss and Wisdom and its followers.
The influx of faith-minded newcomers has raised alarms on PEI, where issues related to land are emotional because there’s so little of it, and because links to that land often go back generations.
The island is covered in family farms. Even though its population is only about 174,000, it’s the most densely populated province in Canada. PEI has also has a unique law, the Lands Protection Act, that was enacted in the early 1980s specifically to prevent individual landowners from dominating the island.
It allows a maximum of 3,000 acres of arable land to be bought by corporations and 1,000 by individuals.
Non-residents are limited to just five acres each, and can only buy property on the island once it has been publicly listed on the market for 90 days.
Islanders complain that the Bliss and Wisdomlinked land purchases exploit loopholes in the legislation by dividing up transactions through a network of companies and individual followers. Bliss and Wisdom says its land purchases on PEI, which the organization considers a central part of its global expansion, are perfectly legitimate.
But many islanders believe they see something more – a highly co-ordinated land grab. They contend that many of the properties linked to the group are left vacant for much of the year. And they say the effect of these land purchases has been to inflate real estate prices in their rural communities at a time when a pressing housing crisis is making it hard for families to find homes.
A citizens’ group called the Coalition for the Protection of P.E.I. Lands estimates that more than 17,000 acres has been bought up by Bliss and Wisdom and people affiliated with the organization.
That includes five educational institutions: two
campuses, GEBIS and the Great Wisdom Buddhist Institute (GWBI), are tailored to Taiwanese men and women, and the three others are designed exclusively for Chinese students, who are kept apart from those from Taiwan.
If that 17,000-acre figure is accurate, the group and its followers control about 4 per cent of all the land in Kings County, which makes up around a quarter of PEI.
But getting an accurate picture of the group’s total land holdings remains difficult. The Globe and Mail analyzed hundreds of land title documents, and cross-referenced those with directors of known Bliss and Wisdom-linked corporations. Even so, much of the land on PEI now linked to Bliss and Wisdom is owned in the names of individual followers.
Because the organization doesn’t publish a list of its members, it’s almost impossible to get a handle on the size of its footprint.
Officially, the Bliss and Wisdom foundations say the group’s PEI campuses are separate legal entities that only share religious views and a spiritual leader, Ms. Zhen-Ru – who the organization’s chief executive says has final say on significant purchases, such as land acquisition.
Bliss and Wisdom’s spokespeople say its followers are acting independently and are only buying up land around the group’s campuses because they want to be near the students there. The group has said it needs “buffer zones” around the schools to protect against pesticides and other development.
“No one would question this if we were all Catholics,” said Venerable Eli Kelly, one of the few PEI-born monks at GEBIS, who spoke to The Globe. “Any new group that has ever come to PEI in history has gone through the same thing.”
But Bliss and Wisdom isn’t just a religious following. It’s also a big business, with jewellery, electronics, organic farming, translation and export divisions intertwined with an ever-growing network of followers’ numbered companies, affiliated foundations, shell corporations and donors’ financial gifts.
An analysis of its business holdings in Asia shows a complex web of corporate entities, run by a small group of senior members, of which the Buddhist schools are only one part.
The amount of cash that has flowed into Canada from the group’s overseas donors and business operations in Taiwan and China is in the hundreds of millions of dollars, according to filings with the Canada Revenue Agency and provincial land sales records.
For a while, all of that new capital coming into eastern PEI was a welcome surprise.
Peggy Coffin, the former mayor of Brudenell, a community since amalgamated into the Kings County town of Three Rivers, said when the land buying began in 2008 local farmers were thrilled to get good money from the Buddhists and ease into retirement. “Initially, it seemed like a gift from God,” she said. “But it just never stopped. They just kept gulping up more and more farmland. They had a plan from the get-go that we didn’t really understand.”
In 2008, when a group of Taiwanese monks first arrived in the Three Rivers community of Montague, they were seen as something of a novelty.
They moved into an old seafood restaurant and motel called the Lobster Shanty, and began introducing themselves through a series of publicity stunts. In one event, they released live lobster from a local Atlantic Superstore back into the Northumberland Strait, to rescue them from islanders’ dinner plates.
The monks made inroads with local politicians and met with members of the premier’s office. And they began bringing investment and people into a province that at the time was looking for new sources of revenue and immigration to boost its economy.
Part of what drew Bliss and Wisdom to PEI – a “land of ice and snow,” as it was described on the group’s website to followers back in Taiwan – was a federal immigration program called the Provincial Nominee Program, which allowed affluent newcomers to fast-track their way to Canadian residency.
That program, since overhauled by Ottawa because of concerns over abuse, brought millions in new revenue into the province.
For years, the program enjoyed support at the highest levels of the island’s government. Robert Ghiz, a former premier, met with Ke-Zhou Lu, the chief executive officer of Bliss and Wisdom’s noncharitable corporate divisions, and saw the organization as a way to increase immigration and investment in PEI.
Mr. Ghiz, who is now CEO of the Canadian Telecommunications Association, was unavailable to comment, according to a spokesperson.
The group’s followers say they’re particularly attracted to PEI because land is cheaper than it is in Taiwan, and because Bliss and Wisdom needed neutral ground where it could train monks and nuns who couldn’t travel easily between Taiwan and China as a result of political tensions between the two.
Another factor is Ms. Zhen-Ru herself, who has moved Bliss and Wisdom away from its roots in Tibetan-style Buddhism, headed by the Dalai Lama, toward a more Chinese-centred version of the religion that places her as the supreme leader. Her travel privileges were temporarily suspended by Taiwan after an issue with her visa more than a decade ago, but she did return there in 2016, Mr. Lu said in an interview.
Bliss and Wisdom has said that uncertainty around her ability to enter Taiwan is part of the reason resources are being directed away from there and toward PEI.
Soon after Bliss and Wisdom appeared on PEI, talk of the group’s publicity efforts gave way to rumours about a strange new group of land buyers, some of them offering large cash payments and insisting on total confidentiality.
The rumours remained rumours, partly because sellers were often required to sign non-disclosure agreements. In many cases the ultimate sources of the money were unclear.
What is clear is that Bliss and Wisdom’s arrival coincided with a number of complex land purchases on PEI that in some cases appear as though they were designed to circumvent Lands Protection Act limits on ownership by non-residents. Rather than being purchased by Bliss and Wisdom’s schools, the properties were bought by laypeople – a term for followers who aren’t monks or nuns – or by companies that seem to exist only on paper.
Many of these corporate entities are linked through directors and companies that share addresses, and many of those enterprises link back to directors of the Bliss and Wisdom network of schools.
A nun named Venerable Gan Jing, for example, is a director of the Compassion and Grace Institute, another Buddhist school. Since arriving on PEI, she has acquired one of the larger pieces of commercial property in Three Rivers, the main building at the old Holland College campus. All of the tenants in the building are affiliated with Bliss and Wisdom: a Buddhist educational charity, a consulting firm and a hostel for international students.
Ms. Jing and the rest of the nuns from Compassion and Grace live in an old motel owned by GEBIS, and get their student visas handled by Moonlight International, another Bliss and Wisdom-affiliated company, while their study permits are issued by GWBI.
While these are all separate corporate entities, the people behind them overlap. A monastery that was incorporated in 2016, called the Guan Yin Monastery, shares the same corporate address in Stratford, PEI, as a director of a company called Hopetown Corporation, which bought 504 acres in 2020 in Three Rivers and was planning a major development there.
That land was previously owned by a woman named Bin Sun, wife of Xiofeng Li, who is a director of the Compassion and Grace Institute. Prior to this, Yaw-Hui Chen, a director of the Bliss and Wisdom Education Foundation in Taiwan, had attempted to buy the same land but was denied by the province.
Although in many cases it is not possible to trace the origins of the money used for land purchases by Bliss and Wisdom followers, one person in a position to observe the flows of funds during the group’s early days on PEI was Jian Qinghua, who was among the first wave of arrivals and lived on the island from 2008 to 2012.
Mr. Qinghua served as Bliss and Wisdom’s first senior abbot, but was dismissed from the group’s inner circle after criticizing Ms. Zhen-Ru’s leadership.
He left the group in 2017 and is now master of another monastery in Taiwan, where he spoke to The Globe.
Mr. Qinghua said Bliss and Wisdom required monks to hand over their bank passbooks, and that these accounts were often used to transfer money on behalf of the organization. In the early stages of the organization’s expansion into PEI, monks travelling to Canada were also instructed to carry suitcases containing $10,000 each to help finance temple construction, he said.
He filed complaints with Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau, alleging his personal bank accounts along with those of about 30 other monks were used to move millions in Bliss and Wisdom funds out of Taiwan without their knowledge, but nothing ever came of his complaint. A former chief of staff at Bliss and Wisdom, Li Yan Zhong, also told The Globe he quit in 2005 because he was growing frustrated with what he believed was mismanagement of followers’ money.
Bliss and Wisdom’s leaders have dismissed these allegations, saying the claims are being pushed by a handful of disgruntled former members and that no government office has discovered any wrongdoing.
“For almost a decade now, the same group of former followers and monastics who left on bad terms have repeatedly tried and failed to establish these accusations,” a senior monk named Venerable Dan Chang said.
A monk named Qing Jie, who goes by Venerable Kelvin Lin, said in the early days of the group’s arrival its followers sometimes bought land with cash because it was suggested as preferable by the PEI sellers and their realtors.
He said language barriers prevented them from understanding that large cash transactions must be reported to federal authorities.
But Mr. Lu, the Bliss and Wisdom CEO, did not dispute all of Mr. Qinghua’s story. He told The Globe it is true that Mr. Qinghua’s bank accounts were accessible by other monks. But he said this was a common arrangement for dealing with donations, which followers sometimes make to individual monks rather than the organization itself.
MONKS, A12
Mr. Lu said banking restrictions between China and Taiwan sometimes made it difficult for the organization to transfer funds internationally, and that using the personal accounts of its followers was more convenient.
E-mails and banking records shared with government officials and provided to The Globe by a source show that in some cases lines were blurred between the finances of Bliss and Wisdom followers and the finances of some of the Buddhist organizations buying land on PEI. The Globe is not naming the source because they were not authorized to share the documents.
In an e-mail to a PEI lawyer in 2016, Yvonne Tsai, a former director of finance for GWBI, said Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce was questioning her about nearly $1.15-million in deposits into her personal account in the span of 13 days in 2015.
The money, she said, came from donors in Taiwan. The e-mail didn’t explain why the cash was being put in her bank account and not in GWBI’s.
Other e-mails obtained by The Globe suggest GWBI’s directors withheld information from the Island Regulatory and Appeals Commission, PEI’s land ownership enforcement body. In one instance, Ms. Tsai said a student who owned land should be considered “a friend” of the organization rather than a nun, which would allow GWBI to discount her property from the group’s total holdings.
GWBI said Ms. Tsai was unavailable for comment, and was no longer responsible for the group’s finances. GWBI’s spokespeople, Heather Chang and Joanna Ho, said in a statement that Ms. Tsai made a “personal decision to help as a friend” because she was fluent in English and understood the Canadian banking system, but they acknowledged this made it appear that GWBI was involved in nuns’ land purchases.
“As our Buddhist nuns consider the monastery their home, those who own land would certainly hope their properties could somehow support the monastery’s needs. But any land transaction, gifting, or even monastery use of individual properties would abide by the spirit of the [Lands Protection Act] and follow all IRAC procedures,” the statement said. “In the past, we did experience some culture shock as newcomers, and our lack of local knowledge resulted in inadequate handling of some situations.”
Other e-mails from senior nuns suggest the organization co-ordinated the purchase of land on behalf of its followers. In separate messages, Ms. Tsai confirmed she paid the property tax for another nun, and another senior nun directed an employee on which names and addresses to use to file a land purchase with the province.
“Let’s pretend the lay people are buying first for better negotiation and then transfer later to GWBI before closing,” the senior nun, named Venerable Janet, wrote in an August, 2016, e-mail.
At the centre of Bliss and Wisdom’s move into PEI is its spiritual leader, Ms. Zhen-Ru, who led the arrival in the province in 2008. She is a Chinese-born layperson who managed to rise to the top of the religious order, where senior roles have typically been reserved only for those with years of monastic training.
Ms. Zhen-Ru became leader after the death of Bliss and Wisdom’s founder, Master Jih-Chang, in 2004. While her appointment – as a woman and layperson – was contentious, the group has said the handover had the blessing of Mr. Lu, who according to the provincial land registry owns nine properties on PEI. Since Ms. Zhen-Ru took over, Bliss and Wisdom has embarked on an ambitious global expansion effort. The group says the number of its students worldwide has grown from 20,000 to 100,000, with more than 800 monks and 600 nuns.
Both Ms. Zhen-Ru, whose birth name is Meng Rong Jin, and Mr. Lu, known as “General Lu,” have shown they are skilled at amassing power. The organization says Ms. Zhen-Ru does not hold any executive position or hold shares in any of the Bliss and Wisdom network of companies, although she owns a small music studio that produces Buddhist music.
She also owns a 35-per-cent stake in a Chinese electronics company, Senpu Electronics Co., Ltd.
Although spokespeople for Bliss and Wisdom have said frequently that the land purchases on PEI by the group’s followers have been made independently of the organization, Mr. Lu said in his interview with The Globe that Ms. Zhen-Ru, in her role as master, wields influence over such “significant endeavours.”
He said followers “always report to Master ZhenRu, and she guides us from a Buddhist perspective on what is favourable and what is unfavourable.”
Mr. Lu, meanwhile, is deeply involved in the business side of things. Among the ventures he has brought to PEI is an enterprise focused on exporting PEI-grown organic soybeans, Leezen Company.
Ms. Zhen-Ru divides her time between properties around the globe registered to family members and close associates. Now a Canadian citizen, she spends about half the year on PEI, and a few months in other parts of Canada, Singapore, the U.S. and elsewhere, according to Mr. Chang, the GEBIS spokesperson.
While Bliss and Wisdom students are taught to reject material goods, when Ms. Zhen-Ru travels around PEI she is sometimes surrounded by an entourage who dress in business attire and drive in a convoy of SUVs led by a black Mercedes. Neighbours near the GWBI temple in Brudenell said they have seen her walking with handlers holding umbrellas over her head to shield her from the sun.
Mr. Chang said the Mercedes was a gift from a follower. He said the other vehicles are used to transport monks on special visits.
“The monastery does not need expensive cars for transportation, but if one is offered to us with a good intent, we would not discard it either,” he said.
But it’s the perception of Ms. Zhen-Ru’s close links to China that is most unsettling for some former followers in Taiwan. Political tension between China and the self-ruled island remains high, and some see her position at the top of Bliss and Wisdom as evidence of China’s attempts to use Buddhism as a tool to push Taiwan toward what Beijing calls “reunification” – the political union of Taiwan and China, which is overwhelmingly opposed by the Taiwanese population. Buddhism remains a major religion in Taiwan, with about a third of its citizens describing themselves as followers of the faith.
Requests to interview Ms. Zhen-Ru were declined.
Mr. Qinghua, the former head abbot, was sent by Bliss and Wisdom to China to teach Buddhism. He said the organization used to have a close relationship with a monk named Venerable Xuecheng, the former head of the Buddhist Association of China, which is run by the Communist Party of China. He said this arrangement helped the group’s growth in China and allowed it to operate in the country, where religious groups are strictly controlled.
Bliss and Wisdom dissidents also cite Ms. ZhenRu’s connection with Harwa Rinpoche, a monk appointed by the Chinese government to run a religious school in China. Mr. Rinpoche was Ms. ZhenRu’s mentor and the person who introduced her to Bliss and Wisdom. He continues to support her, including by collaborating with her on writing books, according to the organization’s website.
Bliss and Wisdom’s leaders said in a statement that Ms. Zhen-Ru hasn’t been in China or Hong Kong in 15 years, and they vehemently denied any links to the Communist Party, saying those concerns are being spread by a handful of dissidents. As evidence of the group’s independence from China, Mr. Lu, the Bliss and Wisdom top executive, told The Globe he was detained by Chinese police during a visit to Kunming, China, in September, 2010. He said officials told him to stop his group’s Taiwanese followers from organizing group visits to the Dalai Lama in India.
“I told them that I don’t have such authority.
Whether Bliss and Wisdom sends a group to India for teachings is not within my power to decide. However, they kept pressuring me to agree to their demands,” Mr. Lu said.
In the Asia-Pacific region, the friction between Taiwan and China looms large. But Ms. Zhen-Ru takes no position on the conflict, according to Mr. Chang.
“Like many spiritual leaders, what Teacher ZhenRu cares most about is not taking sides on political issues, which can hardly bring peace and happiness when such a stand is used to create division,” he said.
Many PEI residents who sold to the Buddhists are hesitant to talk. Others have been silenced because nondisclosure agreements were a condition of the sales.
The land issue came to a head at a public meeting in March, inside a community hall above the hockey rink in Three Rivers. Hundreds of residents listened to speakers call for a formal investigation by the province. People who couldn’t squeeze into the room listened in a stairwell.
Shane MacDonald, a local contractor who spoke in opposition to the land transactions, said Bliss and Wisdom’s leaders haven’t been honest about their plans for PEI. He accused the province of dismissing residents’ concerns.
“The lack of transparency is really troubling.
There’s a total cloak of secrecy over all of this,” he said. “It’s our right to be worried about what’s happening. What we know may just be the tip of the iceberg.”
Islanders at the meeting complained about unusual land transactions – such as 15 monks buying one 75-acre farm property, apparently to get around the five-acre limit for non-residents, or two nuns who have taken a vow of poverty, but who still, according to land title documents, spent more than $1million on 40 acres of property included in expansion plans by a convent up the hill.
Mr. Chang admitted that “ill-advised mistakes did happen” with some properties, but insisted the organization is trying to be more sensitive to islanders’ concerns about land. In the case of the 15 monks who bought a farm together, he said, they were “misled” by a local realtor, and later subdivided the land, resold a portion to a farmer and rented out a house.
“This is far from the ‘land grabbing’ or ‘land speculation’ accusations that Buddhist monks often receive,” Mr. Chang said.
In June, dozens of people protested near Charlottetown’s legislature building to voice their concerns about the Buddhist land acquisitions. They have the support of Wayne Easter, a former long-time MP for the PEI riding of Malpeque, who says a provincial inquiry that can independently investigate and subpoena witnesses is needed to get to the bottom of islanders’ concerns about Bliss and Wisdom.
“Briefcases of cash were being used to buy farms,” Mr. Easter said in an interview. “I’ve been concerned about this for years.”
PEI Premier Dennis King has said in media statements that he is looking into issues of land ownership on the island, and insists his government is rejecting applications to turn farmland over to developers.
The mayor of Three Rivers, Debbie Johnston, is among those who sold their homes to the Buddhists, along with Allen Roach, PEI’s former minister of finance, who sold his waterfront property to two GWBI devotees in 2017. After the sale, Mr. Roach sat on a standing committee that examined land issues connected to the group. He stepped down from cabinet in 2018.
Mr. Roach said in an interview that the land sale did not influence any of his decision-making at the committee. A lawyer representing him said in an emailed letter that Mr. Roach disclosed the land sale in his declarations to PEI’s Conflict of Interest Commissioner, who had no concerns or objections.
In a statement, Ms. Johnston said the sale of her property was a “private matter” and that it has not affected her decision-making as mayor.
Anne Van Donkersgoed, a Three Rivers town councillor, said the municipality’s hands are tied when it comes to concerns about land issues connected to Bliss and Wisdom.
IRAC, the land regulator, is frequently overruled by the province, which, under the Lands Protection Act, has the power to exempt buyers from the regulations.
“We have no control over who’s buying land,” she said. “The regulator will say ‘No, you’re not allowed to buy that,’ and then provincial cabinet overrules it, because it’s bringing money into the province.”
Ms. Van Donkersgoed thinks the province needs a tax on empty properties to dissuade out-of-country owners from leaving homes vacant for most of the year. She said she supports immigration and development, but that she’s concerned about the amount of land being transferred out of the hands of local farmers.
In 2018, IRAC completed an investigation into the land holdings of five Buddhist organizations on the island, but declined requests from the media, citizens’ groups and opposition politicians to release its report because it had found no evidence of an infraction.
Cory Deagle, a provincial MLA for Montague-Kilmuir, said the land issue dominated complaints from voters during the recent provincial election.
“I’m concerned young people won’t be able to buy a first-time home, the way things are looking now,” he said.
He added that he is raising the issue within cabinet, but stopped short of saying a provincial inquiry is needed. He argued that many other corporations, including land developers and large agriculture companies, are exploiting loopholes in the Lands Protection Act.
While the island waits for word on whether the government will commit to a public inquiry, the upheaval in Kings County continues.
The Millars say they don’t like to drive down Heatherdale Road and see all the empty homes and silent farms.
It makes them realize how much their community has changed. Today, they live in Stratford, a suburb of Charlottetown.
When PEI was first colonized, much of the island was owned by wealthy absentee landlords. It’s that same history that gave rise to the Lands Protection Act.
“We could go back to that, if we’re not diligent to stop it,” Ms. Millar said.

Full text: ST. MARYS, ONT.
Try as I might, I will never know as much about St. Marys, Ont., as Larry Pfaff.
Mr. Pfaff grew up in the pretty little town of 7,300 and, despite living and working in Toronto for 45 years (as the Art Gallery of Ontario’s head of reader services), he maintains a house there with a killer view of the Thames River.
Oh, and then there’s the incredible research that went into three books he authored on the town (one, with L.W. Wilson, while I was still in elementary school).
Yet, with typical Canadian modesty, he’s invited Paul King along on our architour to ensure all the (heritage) bases are covered. Mr. King, a retired real estate lawyer, is a member of the St. Marys Heritage Committee and a founding member of the local Architectural Conservancy of Ontario branch.
On a sunny summer day, we gather first in the manicured gardens beside Town Hall, a lovely, 1891 Romanesque Revival building by Toronto architect George W. Gouinlock (1861-1932) that’s currently undergoing some restoration work.
And here, Mr. Pfaff gives me the lay of the land, literally. A British surveyor arrives in 1839; it’s an ideal spot since Trout Creek and the Thames River meet plus there is “water power potential” there’s an outcrop of limestone; a sawmill comes first, followed by a gristmill and then log cabins; by the 1850s and 60s “Scottish, some Irish, some English stonemasons came and they started to build houses” brick comes into vogue in the 1870s and 80s; stone returns and is used at St. Marys Town Hall.
The town thrived, Mr. Pfaff continues, because of the rich soil, farming and the grain trade: “There was a whole group of middlemen called grain merchants, and in the fall of the year, the farmers would bring the grain in, they’d line up on Queen Street, from top to bottom, and these merchants would come along and vie to buy the grains.”
So, like good grain merchants, we decide to walk along Queen towards the Thames. But first, Mr. Pfaff points down Church Street N. to ensure we take in the stately, limestone, Carnegie-funded library (1904, local architect J.A.
Humphris); stone is rare for Carnegies, says Mr. Pfaff, but an exception was made due to “the proximity to Town Hall.”
As we walk down Queen, I learn of the town’s connection to Timothy Eaton – brother Robert had a dry goods store here first and then Timothy and James opened a general store in 1860 – and Mr. King points to Timothy’s building, now called The Chocolate Factory (No. 166).
“This is one of our best streetscapes,” Mr. Pfaff says of Mr. Eaton’s old building and its neighbours. “We have turn-of-thecentury Queen Anne storefronts [with] lovely stained glass and great cornices.” At No. 159 is what Mr. Pfaff considers the town’s “best preserved store,” which was originally built for shoemaker George McIntyre; the enormous windows allowed light to travel deep into the rear work areas.
Walking a little further and admiring the buildings with roundtopped windows, we stop at the mansard-and-clock capped Andrew’s Jeweller (1884), which still houses a jeweller today. The curved shop windows at street level are particularly impressive.
After a walk past a row of five “sober” limestone buildings (1850s) we arrive at the intersection of Queen and Water Street S.
Before getting a tour of the building on the southwest corner, we take in the architectural frenzy that is the former Oddfellows’ temple/St. Marys Opera House.
Built of limestone in 1879-80, this Scottish Baronial-style building was designed by London, Ont.based architect Silas Henry Weekes, who died of tuberculosis in his late twenties.
To lighten the mood, the smiling Tracey Pritchard opens the door of the Flour Mill to our little group and welcomes us in. Ms. Pritchard, a caterer and food writer, took possession of the long building in June, 2019.
“And then we just started gutting,” she says with a laugh. “I really had no idea what was going to happen next; my kids would come from Toronto on weekends [and] we just got dumpster and dumpster.”
What happened, however, was what always happens when a creative soul combines hard work and a sense of adventure: a mustsee destination is born. That Ms. Pritchard lives upstairs only adds to the magic: “all kudos to Tracey,” Mr. Pfaff says. “This is what we wanted for years, people to live in the downtown, over the stores.”
And speaking of where St. Marys folk live, after a delicious lunch (purchased from the Flour Mill), we jump into Mr. Pfaff’s car and hit Thomas Street to ogle some stonemason’s cottages. After drive-bys of Westover Inn (1867) and the Hutton family’s garden mound (no space to explain here!), the Baseball Hall of Fame and the quarry-turnedswimming-pool, we admire the Quarry Road cement-block houses built by St. Marys Cement for its workers in 1915.
A walk of the grounds of the St.
Marys Museum is refreshing, as is a look at the Queen Anne mansion beside it, but I’m ready for some oddballs, and Mr. Pfaff doesn’t disappoint. Concrete houses at Nos. 341 and 418 Elizabeth St. can only be described as Art Modern/Spanish. And stunning. Designed by W.J. Stafford, the concrete on each, says Mr. Pfaff, was “stuccoed over and the [flat] roof is drained at the back [and] radiant heating in the floor.”
A few more Peel and King street grain merchant mansions – many are featured in Mr. Pfaff’s books, which are available at the St. Marys Museum – and we end our day with a visit to the impressionist Arthur Meighen statue in Lind Park (Canada’s ninth Prime Minister), and a stop at Broken Rail Brewing, to remind ourselves that St. Marys was once a stop on the Grand Trunk Railway.
“Checking out these different communities [in Southern Ontario], well, we don’t have any big mountains, but it’s amazing what’s hidden,” Mr. King says. “If you pay attention to what’s around you, it’s quite incredible.”
I couldn’t agree more. So keep an eye on this space and discover them with me.

Full text: 507 Oakridge Place, Waterloo, Ont.
WATER LOO Asking price: $769,000 (June, 2023) Selling price: $827,000 (June, 2023) Previous selling price: $195,000 (August, 2004); $127,000 (April, 1999) Taxes: $3,124 (2022) Days on the market: Seven Listing agent: Manu Singh, Urbanis Property Group, Right at Home Realty Inc.
THE ACTION This three-bedroom bungalow near the popular St.
Jacobs Farmers’ Market went up for sale just as the local market was experiencing a lull. The asking price was set low in expectation of another interest rate hike.
“Waterloo was going through an up and down market, so it was extremely competitive and hot several months ago, then out of nowhere it just fell off a cliff so to speak,” said agent Manu Singh. “There were no showings and properties weren’t selling over 30 days ”Then, the market started to creep up a little bit, so we placed our offer night on June 6 and the following day was going to be the Bank of Canada’s rate announcement.”
The best out of three bids came in at $827,000 with lowrisk terms. “We ended up choosing the one with no finance conditions, but it did have a longer closing of about 60 days,” Mr. Singh said.
“But [the sellers] were willing to take on the extra carrying costs.”
WHAT THEY GOT This 52-year-old bungalow has 1,047 square feet of living space and a carport on a 40- by 117-foot corner lot.
Inside, the flooring, bathrooms and kitchens on two levels were all updated.
The basement has been waterproofed and has an entertaining area, three bedrooms and a separate entrance.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “You could do so many things with it – you can rent some of it or have extended family live there,” Mr. Singh said.
“A lot of the older bungalows just have two or three bedrooms and one washroom.
“Lakeshore Village is a highly desirable pocket because it’s very accessible to the University of Waterloo, all the retail, highways, parks and schools.”

Full text: China’s leaders are currently gathered for their annual summer retreat at Beidaihe, a resort on the Bohai Sea, some 250 kilometres east of Beijing. Exactly what is discussed at such meetings is kept highly secret, but one topic certain to come up this year is the increasingly dire state of the Chinese economy.
While much of the West continues to grapple with inflation, China this week revealed it was experiencing the opposite, as consumer prices tipped into deflationary territory for the first time in two years, adding more stress to an economy already dealing with widespread (and worsening) unemployment, sluggish exports and a housing downturn. Deflation can lower spending as consumers put off purchases and companies respond by slowing production, potentially leading to layoffs.
On Wednesday, Washington added to those woes when President Joe Biden signed an executive order limiting U.S. hightech investments in China. Most analysts see this as just a preview of far more aggressive U.S. policy to come, particularly if Republicans win control of the government next year.
Ottawa said it was in close contact with Washington in order to understand the new regulations and how they might affect Canadian businesses. Beijing, meanwhile, denounced Mr. Biden’s order Thursday as “deviating from the principles of market economy and fair competition.”
Elaine Dezenski, a senior director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the move comes “at an inopportune moment for Beijing.”
Foreign investment in China is already at a 25-year low, the result of a pandemic-era pullback amid lockdowns and supply chain disruptions, increasingly hostile policy-making from Beijing and concern among foreign companies about additional scrutiny and pressure back home for their ties to China.
Reacting to Mr. Biden’s executive order, Marco Rubio, a leading Republican China hawk, called it “laughable” and promised to introduce tougher legislation. He previously sponsored a bill that would block federal retirement plans from investing in Chinese companies.
Canadian pension funds are already reassessing their exposure to China, given the uncertainty surrounding the country’s economy and growing scrutiny of any ties to Beijing amid concerns about Chinese interference in Canadian politics.
“Investors have been really disappointed about the scope of the rebound and are pessimistic about the future,” said Nick Marro, the lead global trade analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.
“But they’re also worried about geopolitics, and it’s those anxieties, not just over Taiwan or U.S.China relations, but also around policy restrictions coming from home markets which can really complicate investment moving forward.”
Domestically, the picture is just as dire. Draconian COVID-19 restrictions created a severe drag on the economy, and a hoped-for recovery has been lacklustre and already looks to be petering out.
This has combined with recordhigh youth unemployment – which hit 21.3 per cent in June and is likely to worsen as millions more graduates hit the job market next month – low exports and renewed concerns over a housing sector widely seen as a bubble.
Property sales are down about 20 per cent from last year, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. Home prices have fallen some 14 per cent from a peak in August, 2021, while rents are down 5 per cent in the same period, the New York Times reported, citing analysis from Beike Research Institute, a Tianjin firm.
Previous attempts by the government to gradually ease home prices almost caused the collapse of one of the country’s largest developers, Evergrande, and led to protests outside its offices. For many Chinese households, apartments are their main store of wealth, and a sharp drop in prices could spark widespread dissatisfaction and even unrest, while further suppressing consumer spending.
Beijing has long struggled to promote domestic demand, seen as vital to rebalancing the economy away from a dependence on exports. China’s consumer price index fell 0.3 per cent in July, after remaining static the previous month. The Producer Price Index, which tracks what businesses pay suppliers, is down 4.4 per cent.
“Consumption has always been the tricky part of the Chinese growth story, and over the pandemic consumption really collapsed, because how can you consume when you’re in lockdown?” said Mr. Marro. “The legacy of the pandemic has been long-lasting: You had shocks to income, shocks to employment, shocks to sentiment, which has been really, really hard to rebuild.”
Despite insistence from officials that the picture is not as gloomy as it seems, Mr. Marro said the feeling on the ground “is one of a lot of anxiety,” which is leading many to tighten their belts ever further.
Ms. Dezenski said increased private-sector aversion to investment “will only compound the dangerously high youth unemployment, deflation risks and sagging exports – creating a perfect storm of conditions for a Chinese economic collapse.”
Fears of such a spiral have renewed calls for a government stimulus, but so far policy makers have been cautious. Even during the pandemic, China did not employ the type of direct cash transfers to boost spending widely used in the West and several Asian territories, including Hong Kong.
Last week, officials called on local and provincial governments to boost spending, but many regions are already in a precarious financial condition, and experimentation has become rare because Chinese President Xi Jinping has centralized power under himself, including a tight grip on economic policy.
“There’s a lot of concern around potential missteps,” Mr. Marro said. “There’s fear that if you do something which isn’t completely signed off by the very top of the government, that it could be a mistake and put you in jeopardy.”
He doubted that China would technically enter a recession – defined as two-quarters of negative GDP growth – given the many tools policy makers have used in the past to boost the economy and juice official figures. But he warned that Chinese consumers may feel like they are in one regardless.
“That could hold back consumer spending even more. It could hold back business investment and further sour foreign investors on China,” Mr. Marro said. “And so even if we don’t see a classical recession, that doesn’t necessarily mean the Chinese economy is in a good state.”

Full text: VANCOUVER The Jeffs Residences is a grand old Queen Anne house built around 1907, and it sits on a corner lot at Salsbury Drive and Charles Street, in a leafy historic enclave east of Vancouver’s Commercial Drive.
The house has been carved up into seven condo units and to the north is a row of 13 townhomes.
Developer James Evans restored and redeveloped the property a decade ago, and went on to redevelop several more within a fiveblock radius. They are all near transit, shopping and schools, and affordable enough for locals.
The Jeffs Residences, which includes 13 three-bedroom units, and consists of mostly families, is Mr. Evans’s personal favourite.
“At the time we built these, if you were looking for a three-bedroom house, your options were essentially a new half-duplex, like those across the street, and those were running around $800,000 at the time. I thought, ‘If we could do the same thing here but make them a little bit smaller, and make the site more efficient because obviously it’s a bit denser, then we could bring them out for about $150,000 less a door than a comparable half duplex.’ ”And that’s what we did.”
He refers to his multifamily projects as “stealth densification,” a way of introducing the highly livable “missing middle” density that people crave while sensitively preserving character of neighbourhoods.
The city has the same idea with its new “missing middle” multiplex proposal to streamline zoning, increase allowable floor space, and allow up to six units on a larger residential lot and up to four on a standard 33-foot lot.
But ironically, his form of stealth density will become difficult to deliver if the city’s policy goes through, he says.
Staff presented their recommendations to council last week and the proposal was approved for the next phase, a public hearing in September, followed by a vote. New permit applications would be accepted as early as October. But as is, Mr. Evans says, the proposal disincentivizes the retention of old character houses, which won’t be eligible for the higher density of a multiplex.
As well, he’d obtained his stealth density for his projects using a Heritage Revitalization Agreement, which, he says, the city would not allow on his next project at nearby Napier Street and Semlin Drive. Instead, he was limited by character retention incentives, which allowed only seven units on the 99-foot-wide corner lot, including a duplex in the main home and five infill units. If he’d obtained an HRA, he says he could have built 14 units, but an HRA wasn’t in the cards for reasons he’s never understood.
“Two things frustrate me,” he says. “First, as currently written, we won’t be able to do this again.
And secondly, why hasn’t the city looked at successful examples of projects that have been done?
“There seems to be this amnesia about successful examples of missing middle type housing, where you have a mix of different unit types, all within the context of the lot geometry in the city,” he says. “There’s been no review, no conversation about it. We’re just going to start again.”
Others have concerns that the city’s neighbourhood character could get lost, especially on the less expensive east side.
Macdonald Commercial Real Estate managing director Tony Letvinchuk, who’s in favour of the proposal, hopes the Vancouver Special doesn’t get lost in the process. He says the Vancouver Special could easily be “plumped up” to accommodate four units with another in the backyard, for example.
And then there’s the affordability piece, which could be greater, says Small Housing B.C. founder Jake Fry, who builds laneway housing. The proposal offers extra density and a break on fees in exchange for providing a belowmarket rental unit.
“Within the larger lots, there’s an opportunity to do one unit below-market and then you are forgiven city fees, but the problem is they aren’t adding enough density or living space, so that’s the least financially viable option,” Mr. Fry says. “And yet the very thing this program could deliver better than a high-rise, or even free land, is to give it enough of a bonus – density, or whatever it might be – so that it became the most financially viable option.
“They’re missing the biggest win. If it didn’t work, no harm, and if it did – they would have the most cost-effective units built at no expense to the public.”
In order to add density and protect existing character – and prevent wasteful demolitions – Mr. Evans proposes the proposal give character buildings the same density as multiplexing, and allow the same square footage and number of units.
“The policy they are proposing will be a bunch of ‘identikit’ homes that will start rolling out and we will gradually lose old homes like this one,” he says, standing at Parker Street and Victoria Drive, in front of Brookhouse Residences, which he built five years ago.
Without the small but meaningful change to the new policy, it will be the end of the era for these heritage projects, he says, and he has many examples of how it can be done.
At Brookhouse, he took another large heritage house on a 66foot lot and turned it into 10 strata units, including six condos in the restored house and four new three-storey row houses, with garages, to the rear. A courtyard separates the main house from the row houses. The boarded up, vacant house had formerly been zoned as a two-family residence, but with a Heritage Revitalization Agreement, Mr. Evans restored the property and had it designated as a heritage property in exchange for a rezoning. He built the Jeffs Residence using an HRA as well.
Mr. Evans lives in the neighbourhood and is proud that there’s been little turnover in his projects, that he’s delivered desirable family housing.
“You shouldn’t be planning buildings, you should be planning neighbourhoods,” he says.
He cites the variety of housing in the area. There’s a former church on Salsbury that’s now loft apartment units, with row houses, similar to one of his own projects. Across from that, there’s a historic brick apartment building.
On Victoria, there are some of the city’s most extravagant examples of Queen Anne houses, hearkening back to the time in Vancouver’s history when wealthy people lived in Grandview before they moved to Shaughnessy. Grandview, as the name suggests, had the great mountain views.
Currently, if a developer retains a character house, they are permitted 3,422 square feet on a standard 33-foot-wide lot. If they build a multiplex, they can go up to 4,026 sq. ft.
“There will be no incentive to keep something like this,” he says of Brookhouse. “Because your density is capped and you have to go through a separate [permit] process, whereas with a multiplex, you bulldoze everything and you build 1.0 FSR [floor space ratio]. Why would you do character retention if you have to cap your density?
“We have one chance to get this right, because this feels like one of those seminal lurches that we make in Vancouver once every decade. Twenty years ago, it was basement suites … then it was carriage houses … now we have moved to next logical stage.
“I support it, not because I’m a developer, but because I’d like a place for my kids to live, and we can’t put all people in highrises on the Broadway corridor. So we need to balance it so we can retain some of what you see around here, in the form of all the old houses and still allow people to build new product.
“That’s my only concern on this thing, is to treat [character] equally and provide incentives for people to do what you see here.”

Small-scale retail boosts livability in Calgary neighbourhoods: Mom-and-pop shops can help build communities and become attractions

Full text: Increasingly, cities across Canada move toward the creation of complete neighbourhoods where spaces to live, work, learn and play are within walking distance from each other – and Calgary is no exception.
In 2019, the City of Calgary launched Next Generation Planning, a program that integrates nine initiatives to incentivize a wider breadth of uses across the city’s residential neighbourhoods, and transform them from sleepy bedroom communities to vibrant hubs of activity with actions ranging from public realm improvements to updated local area plans.
However, livability and vitality require more than a mix of compatible uses, says Neal LaMontagne, a city planner and associate lecturer at the University of Alberta.
“What is livable is not something that’s easily measured,” he says, pointing at the difference between uses that simply satisfy a basic need, such as a grocery store, and those that are also conducive to social interaction.
“[Retail] should also be a place for community,” Mr. LaMontagne says. “It’s the classic idea that we go down to the neighbourhood coffee shop and we see neighbours – it supports social life, not just everyday life.”
This is something that smaller, mom-and-pop shops are often able to achieve, as these businesses tend to feel like they’re part of the community and contribute to the sense of place of a neighbourhood, Mr. LaMontagne explains.
“There is something richer [when] an enterprise feels part of the community, because you feel like you know the owners, it serves a need that can’t be replaced by a larger corporation.”
To incentivize a heterogenous mix of uses and business types in a new building, Calgary’s landuse bylaw regulates façade widths and floor areas, as smaller commercial retail units (CRUs) can provide the affordability and flexibility required by independent businesses. However, it is developers who ultimately determine what’s the most viable mix of CRU sizes.
“[Developers] want to lease space quickly,” Mr. LaMontagne says. “But they also want to lease with the least amount of hassle – and this where the rub is. The easiest way to lease is to a known tenant of national scale where there’s existing relationships.”
This situation often comes at the expense of a neighbourhood’s livability, as the national chains expected to lease a commercial unit require an area of at least 1,300 square feet, a size that prices out many mom-and-pop shops.
But not all developers are the same, Mr. LaMontagne notes, pointing at exceptions where developers are “willing to take a gamble on these kinds of [smaller] businesses because they believe they build community.”
Indeed, despite the risks, some Calgary developers are tapping on the potential of smaller CRUs, and reusing older structures in residential neighbourhoods in ways that benefit local businesses and residents alike.
Five years ago, Rod Leonard, founder of Leonard Development Group, envisioned a unique form of retail space that would become the Shops at Avenue Thirty Four, a state-of-the-art commercial strip comprised by 30 CRUs spread across three buildings: a seventies fourplex, and two character homes built in the 1910s.
Initially, Mr. Leonard’s plan was to transform a single character home into a live-work space for his mom, an experienced florist. But when the flower shop opened, he realized there was potential for growth.
“We got a lot of people popping in and asking us if we were going to be doing more of the small shops, because they wanted to open their store in Marda Loop,” Mr. Leonard says. “But they were looking for a bit of a smaller space.”
As redevelopment steadily transforms Marda Loop, an upand-coming commercial area in Calgary’s south, a growing number of businesses are setting up shop in the neighbourhood. But as larger storefronts on the ground floor of new apartment buildings attract established tenants, such as banking institutions and pharmacy chains, Mr. Leonard saw the need of providing smaller units that would fit the needs of independent businesses.
“A lot of developments are renting out 1,000-, 2,000-, 3,000square-foot spaces,” Mr. Leonard says. “And the rent is so expensive that you can only really attract the larger chains.”
Repurposing the existing structures along 34th Avenue SW allowed Mr. Leonard to create CRUs whose sizes range between 120 and 550 square feet, and lease out these units to unique tenants, including a yarn shop, a men’s clothing store, a hair salon, a therapist’s office, a speakeasy and a French café.
“I think that’s what Marda Loop was missing: a spot where we could bring more local shops into the area.”
But Mr. Leonard’s brainchild does more than satisfy the basic needs of neighbours and smallbusiness owners. The Europeaninspired commercial strip also creates a place where the serendipitous encounters that build community happen.
“Community starts to happen in places of ‘weak links,’ ” Mr. LaMontagne explains, noting that weak links are the social interactions with strangers that can keep residents from feeling disconnected or isolated. ”Retail has a small role in that because that’s one of those places that we identify with.”
Like Mr. Leonard, other property owners in Calgary are capitalizing on the potential of smaller CRUs while revitalizing formerly derelict areas.
Since 2016, residents of Crescent Heights, an inner-city neighbourhood just north of the Bow River, have witnessed a commercial renaissance in their neighbourhood, as Certus Developments, a real estate developer, began leasing out underperforming commercial space to independent businesses that were just staring out.
“When we started filling out Tigerstedt Block, it was really focusing on mom-and-pop kind of small businesses,” says Alice Lam, a portfolio manager at Certus Developments, noting that the size of the commercial spaces had been a deterrent for national chains and franchises to lease a unit in the 1928 building.
With CRUs ranging in size between 500 and 1,000 square feet, the Tigerstedt Block sat mostly vacant for nearly a decade, but this challenge has become an opportunity, as leasing these units to independent businesses has had a positive effect on the neighbourhood and its livability.
“These individual mom-andpop businesses that are more unique, offering a service that isn’t available elsewhere, drew their own clientele, and [became] a destination-type business,” Ms. Lam says, adding that “not only were they a destination for people all over the city, but the local community started seeing Tigerstedt as a community hub – as a place where you could get coffee, food, hang out, get a beer afterwards, or do a bit of shopping.”

Full text: Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s government is targeting school lands in his next bid to boost the province’s housing stock under wide-ranging legislation that puts his administration – not locally elected trustees – in charge of deciding which properties can be sold and developed.
Bill 98 empowers the government to direct a school board to sell an entire unused school site, portions of it or other board-owned property if it determines that land is not needed to meet current or future student accommodation needs for the next 10 years.
Education Minister Stephen Lecce said the bill gives him an “overarching lens” of what school assets are available to use for the next generation, including the thousands of people immigrating to Canada and settling in Ontario every year.
“I think that macro lens is missing,” Mr. Lecce said in an interview with The Globe and Mail. “We’ve never had an overseer of a 60-plus billion-dollar asset base.”
The legislation compels the province’s 72 boards to provide the government with an inventory of schools that are not being used for learning and are leased out, administration buildings and empty parcels of land.
The government decides whether to sell a property to another school board or use it for a provincial priority, such as a nursing home or housing, before putting it up for sale on the open market.
In interviews with The Globe, trustees across the province said they are alarmed by the bill. By granting the government unlimited authority to set priorities for the public education system, they say, it further diminishes their role as stewards of school properties.
“There certainly was no consultation with school boards on the appropriate use of our property,” said Cathy Abraham, a trustee and president of the Ontario Public School Boards’ Association, which represents 46 boards across the province. “We believe that this legislation takes away that ability for us to reflect the needs of our communities. It’s like a chipping away of our autonomy.”
The Ford government is going places no one anticipated it would venture, all in the name of addressing the province’s urgent need for new housing. It is allowing development on 3,000 hectares of the Greenbelt, breaking a promise to permanently protect farmland, forests and wetlands around the Greater Toronto Area.
It is also using an unprecedented number of minister’s zoning orders to allow property developers to bypass local planning processes.
School lands are the next frontier.
The government pegs the combined asset value of Ontario’s 4,600 operating schools at $64billion. Most of the properties remain off limits to development or sale under a long-standing moratorium on closing schools. The former Liberal government suspended further closings in 2017, after complaints from parents, especially in rural and northern communities where boards are grappling with declining enrolment. Mr. Ford’s Progressive Conservatives have no immediate plans to lift the moratorium. Only school properties declared surplus prior to the ban on closings can be sold or developed under Bill 98.
Trustees know their local communities, making them more capable than a centralized government of planning for future growth, said Lyra Evans, chair of the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board.
“To start carving up public assets and selling them to private companies to turn them into housing or even long-term care, I think does a disservice to future generations,” she said.
School boards look well beyond a 14-year cycle for students – from junior kindergarten to Grade 12 – when projecting how much classroom space they need.
They worry that the government could have a shorter planning horizon.
Ms. Evans cites the example of the Cambridge Street Community Public School in Ottawa’s LeBreton Flats neighbourhood, which is using less than a third of its space with just 80 students.
The Ottawa-Carleton board’s projections show that enrolment is expected to climb significantly at the elementary school once young families move into new housing units under construction in the area.
“There’s going to be a number of years where that school is going to look ludicrously underutilized,” Ms. Evans said. But it would be a mistake to sell the school, she said, because its proximity to downtown Ottawa is attracting urban dwellers who enjoy the area’s mix of residential and commercial spaces.
During two days of public hearings into Bill 98 in May, Toronto District School Board chair Rachel Chernos Lin told lawmakers how demographic change affects trustees’ decisions. Her board is reopening Bannockburn Public School in September to address significant growth in its North Toronto neighbourhood. The school had closed in 1981 because of declining enrolment, and the board has been leasing the building to a Montessori school.
School boards don’t always get it right when making their forecasts. In 2004, the HamiltonWentworth District School Board sold the former Scott Park Secondary School for $650,000 because of declining enrolment, only to expropriate the property from a developer nine years later.
For his part, Mr. Lecce said he needs the legal authority contained in Bill 98 to direct school boards on a range of priorities.
“It’s for me a bizarre reality that so little centralized power exists in the Ministry,” he told The Globe. “So much of the power has been devolved to school boards.”
Ontario is not alone in taking decision-making out of the hands of local officials. In fact, two provinces have abolished school boards altogether. Nova Scotia dissolved its seven English-language boards and eliminated the role of trustees in 2018.
Premier François Legault’s Coalition Avenir Québec used its majority in 2020 to invoke closing of a contentious bill that scrapped all school boards in the province and replaced them with “service centres.”
New Brunswick was the first province to eliminate school boards in 1996 only to reverse course by restoring a version of an elected body after public pressure. Manitoba also unveiled plans in 2021 to eliminate trustees but backed down after public outcry.
In Ontario, successive governments have marginalized the role of trustees. In the late 1990s, Mike Harris’s Progressive Conservative government merged 129 school boards into 72, cut the number of trustees by nearly one-third and capped their pay at $5,000 a year.
Trustees now earn between $7,500 and $29,500.
The Harris government also removed the ability of school boards to generate their own capital funds for new schools by taxing homes and businesses. Under the current regime, each school board can submit up to five capital projects a year. The government has approved nearly 200 school construction projects since 2018.
Lori-Ann Pizzolato, chair of the Thames Valley District School Board, said the government has approved funding for two of the 11 new schools needed in London, Ontario’s fastest-growing city. But getting approval takes too long, she said.
The board applied for funding to build the Summerside Public School in 2015 and got the goahead in 2018. The elementary school built for 553 students was overflowing the day it opened in September, 2022, with a dozen portables and enrolment capped at 800. Other children in the southeast London neighbourhood – a hub for newcomers to Canada and migration from larger cities – were bused to another school.
Until 2018, overall enrolment in the Thames Valley board was declining and it was closing schools. Since then, the population has grown rapidly.
“Now, we can’t even keep up,” Ms. Pizzolato said.
The board’s higher enrolment makes it eligible for the first time to collect what are known as education development charges (EDCs) from home builders to fund land costs for new schools.
The playing field in Ontario is far from level, however.
Under provincial legislation, boards are eligible to collect EDCs if the total number of students enrolled in its schools exceeds the capacity in its overall elementary or secondary system. Twenty-seven boards have such bylaws in place.
The Toronto District School Board – the largest in Canada with 235,000 students – is not eligible.
That’s because 27 per cent of its schools use 65 per cent or less of their capacity, according to a Globe tally. The Toronto Catholic District School Board, by contrast, has sufficient pupils, allowing it to collect such fees to accommodate growth and has been doing so since 2019.
Bill 98 passed its final reading in June, but the government has yet to release regulations detailing how it will control school land sales.
Mr. Lecce said the legislation will speed up building new schools. The government plans to work with real estate experts – Infrastructure Ontario, the agency that manages the province’s major public-sector building projects, and private sector property developers.
“Coupled with the government’s commitment to build 1.5 million homes over the next 10 years, it’s more important than ever that we get this right and that we maximize the use of our space and our tax dollars,” Mr. Lecce said.
Ms. Chernos Lin, the chair of the Toronto board, said in an interview that she does not think Bill 98 is about schools. “I suspect it has to do with building housing.”

Home sales in Toronto decline in July for second straight month: Bank of Canada’s June interest-rate hike has led to concern around borrowing costs, overall economy, analyst says

Full text: Toronto’s real estate activity slowed further in July after the Bank of Canada’s latest interestrate hike injected uncertainty back into the housing market.
The volume of resales in the Toronto region fell 8.8 per cent from June to July after removing seasonal influences, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board. It was the second straight month of declines and comes after the central bank resumed raising interest rates in June after keeping them steady from February through May.
The Bank of Canada has said it is willing to raise rates above the current 5 per cent if economic indicators aren’t on the right path, which has provided no clarity on the future of borrowing costs.
“Uncertainty surrounding the direction of borrowing costs, jobs and the overall economy has impacted home sales over the last two months,” the real estate board’s chief market analyst Jason Mercer said in a news release.
More homeowners put their properties up for sale, with new listings rising 7.7 per cent from June to July on a seasonally adjusted basis. The volume was about 4 per cent below the 10year average.
The home price index, which removes the highest priced homes, was $1,170,400 last month. That was a 1.1-per-cent increase over June and the fifth straight month of price gains.
Although mortgage rates are much higher than a year ago, the competition for housing has remained strong. A record number of new permanent residents and newcomers are being admitted to the country as the federal government boosts immigration levels in part to help fill labour vacancies.
The real estate board said Canada’s population growth “will be unsustainable if people can’t find an affordable place to live.”
Many economists have said there is a mismatch between housing supply and demand.
One economist suggested Ottawa should lower its immigration targets. “As housing affordability pressures continue to mount across the country, we believe Ottawa should consider revising its immigration targets to allow supply to catch up with demand,” Stéfane Marion, chief economist with National Bank of Canada, said in a report.
In Vancouver, it was a similar situation in terms of activity.
Home sales fell 18 per cent from June to July. Compared with the same month last year, the volume of sales was up 29 per cent.
The local real estate board said that was a sign of robust demand. More homeowners put their properties up for sale and new listings grew year over year, but the number of new listings was 5 per cent lower than the 10year average.
The home price index reached $1,210,700 last month, a 0.6 per cent increase from June. Home prices increased the most for detached houses followed by condos and semi-detached houses.

Full text: In 2021, the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (LADBS) glommed on to a new way to manage the torrent of applications for accessory dwelling units (ADUs), as garden suites are known in the U.S. The boom began in the late 2010s, when state legislators passed a series of laws meant to prevent municipalities from blocking ADUs. These included a mandatory two-month turn-around on applications – a time-line that remains something of a fantasy here.
To circumnavigate the cumbersome work of processing individual applications, LADBS officials set to work preapproving standardized designs produced by local architecture firms.
According to the department’s website, homeowners can choose from 72 models, in various shapes and sizes. These are itemized in a kind of online catalogue, complete with floor plans and renderings, not unlike the “pattern books” that Canada Mortgage and Housing created in the 1940s and 1950s to hasten new home construction.
The designs are the intellectual property of the firm that created them. LADPS also publishes approvals metrics.
California is by no means alone in expediting ADUs as a means of battling the urban housing crisis. For example, in Portland, widely seen as ground zero of the American ADU revolution, turn-around times run from two to four months.
Not all California cities have embraced the new rules. A recent study by the Pacific Legal Foundation found that the city of San Diego, for example, saw its application-turnaround times lengthen in the past few years in response to opposition from local politicians and homeowners. Still, as Toronto architect Francoise Abbott points out, Toronto’s planning department should set up a dedicated team of planners that only processes ADUs, as is done in some U.S.
cities. “That’s so smart,” he says. “Because the amount of the knowledge you need to approve one or to understand what’s happening is so simple.
It’s so simple.”

Full text: 162 Vail Meadows Cres., Bowmanville, Ont.
CLARINGTON Asking price: $629,900 (April, 2023) Selling price: $785,555 (May, 2023) Previous selling prices: $420,000 (January, 2017); $281,000 (June, 2014); $174,000 (September, 2008); $167,000 (August, 2003); $135,992 (September, 1992) Taxes: $3,368 (2022) Days on the market: Seven Listing agent: Jenelle Cameron, Re/Max Hallmark Realty Ltd.
THE ACTION During a short period this spring, agent Jenelle Cameron saw multiple offers for properties everywhere from bustling Toronto neighbourhoods to a quiet suburb more than 75 kilometres east. That suburb is where this three-bedroom, two-storey townhouse, listed for $629,900, brought in 23 bids on offer night.
“Our timing was perfect because there was a little window where things were heating up fast and there wasn’t much inventory,” Ms. Cameron said. “I had a lot of local buyers, but also people coming through from far away, too, because Bowmanville is less expensive than other areas. So, we were talking to people coming from Brampton and Burlington.”
WHAT THEY GOT This roughly 60year-old end unit had recent improvements, including new flooring and appliances.
“It’s amazing how minor renovations, staging and good photography makes all the difference in how someone perceives the property,” Ms. Cameron said. “By spending $20,000 to $30,000, [the sellers] probably got $100,000 more than if they left it as is.”
More casual entertaining areas can be found upstairs, above the garage and down in the basement.
For socializing outdoors, a flagstone patio and backyard fill out the 25- by 107-foot lot.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It has a nice layout because it has a family room on the second level,” Ms. Cameron said. “Bowmanville is a pretty small place, but it has a lot of shops and services now, so it’s easier to be central in town because you can walk to everything if you want to.”

Full text: 516670 7th Line, Blue Mountain, Ont.
BLUE MOUNTAIN Asking price: $1,998,000 (May, 2023) Previous asking price: $2,190,000 (April, 2023) Selling price: $1,998,000 (June, 2023) Previous selling price: $835,000 (April, 2019); $540,000 (September, 2006) Taxes: $3,813 (2023) Property days on market: 39 Listing agent: Belinda Lelli, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
THE ACTION In the Georgian Bay countryside surrounding the Blue Mountain ski resort, properties can spend two months on the market without selling. But after five weeks with no serious offers, agent Belinda Lelli decided to slash the asking price on this fivebedroom bungalow by $192,000.
Within two days, her clients had a firm deal for $1.998-million, including furnishings, linens and dishes.
“My clients were over the moon, because some local agents said we could get $1.7-million or $1.75-million max,” Ms. Lelli said.
“As soon as we got that offer, don’t I get another full asking offer … but by then, it was too late.”
WHAT THEY GOT This ranch-style bungalow on a roughly one-acre lot was extensively redesigned in 2019, inside and out.
It has about 2,500 square feet of living space and three sets of sliding doors to a wraparound deck, hot tub, firepit and gardens.
There are custom Italian finishes in the kitchen and a gas fireplace in the living room. Plus, there are four bathrooms, a sauna and a car charger in the garage.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “You’re very close to all the hills, Craigleigh [Provincial Park], golf courses, and private resorts, in addition to Blue Mountain, so you have a lot of amenities at your doorstep,” Ms. Lelli said.
“We had end users in addition to families who wanted to rent it out for the ski season because it has a high ROI [return on investment]. I leased their property last year for $40,000 for less than three months, plus utilities.”
This property’s size was also a draw. “Two families could go up there and not run into one another,” said Ms. Lelli.
“[And] that whimsical, tile pattern in the kitchen just makes it very different, so it has a very Euro look.”

Full text: Montreal’s biggest public transit project in more than half a century is about to open – a monumental moment for its financier and builder, the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.
Now, the pension fund giant will have to prove it can continue to lure people out of their cars if it wants a crack at winning future projects.
The first 17-kilometre branch of the Caisse’s Réseau express métropolitain (REM) light rail line will welcome dignitaries and media Friday and its first paying customers Monday, ferrying them between Montreal’s south-shore suburbs and central station at a speed three times faster than by automobile.
Two other sections are slated to carry their first passengers by the end of next year, while the final leg to Trudeau International Airport is expected to open in 2027.
Not since Montreal’s rubber-wheeled metro system launched 57 years ago has Quebec seen a transit project of this size and novelty: a network spanning 67-kilometres in length, all electric and driverless, operating 20 hours a day, every day. With a price tag well above $7-billion, it will be, as Caisse chief executive Charles Emond has proudly touted, among the longest automated light rail lines in the world.
“This is a historic project,” Mr. Emond said in April on popular talk show Tout le monde en parle. “It’s going to change the city and the relationship we have with the city,” he said, acting as a catalyst for economic and real estate development.
FROM B1 For Montreal, a town plagued by chronic transportation issues, the REM can’t come soon enough.
Aside from the metro, which generally works well, aging infrastructure on major highways and bridges causes traffic snarls. In addition, commuter rail lines have to share tracks with freight rail and, unlike other major cities globally, there’s no reliable transit link between the city core and the airport.
Senior leaders of the Caisse recognized that Canada’s second biggest city was in danger of falling badly behind on infrastructure development if nothing was done. In 2015, then Caisse CEO Michael Sabia persuaded the Quebec government that the Montreal-based pension fund manager could build and operate a new light rail network.
The idea was an innovative one in theory. The Quebec government could get a new transit system without assuming public liability for cost overruns that often come with such projects, while the pension fund gets a stable return and develops expertise it can then pitch to other governments for future work. A deal was struck soon after and construction started in 2018.
Under the pact, the Caisse’s infrastructure arm is assuming $3.5billion of the project’s $6.9-billion construction cost while Quebec is committing $1.28-billion and the Canada Infrastructure Bank is providing a $1.28-billion loan. The balance consists of a $295-million payment from Hydro-Québec for the line’s electrification, while the Autorité régionale de transport métropolitain, the transit authority for the Montreal region, is pledging $512-million.
When the Caisse announced the start of construction on the REM, it pegged the project cost at $6.3-billion, an amount that has since climbed and now tops the latest official $6.9-billion projection. It has promised to update the financial information in the days to come.
Provincial and local governments will provide continuing operating subsidies for the REM to make sure the Caisse earns its required return on the project, currently pegged at 8 per cent to 9 per cent. The pension fund manager will get 72 cents for each passenger-kilometre travelled on the light rail system. Without such a subsidy, fares would climb to a level few passengers could afford.
That the first piece of the REM is opening now, five years after construction started, is a victory of sorts for the Caisse and its partners – even if it comes roughly two years late. There have been a myriad of issues to deal with for those working on the project, including an unexpected detonation of century-old explosives inside the Mount Royal Tunnel, new worker protocols caused by the pandemic and the rapid rise in inflation.
Other transit projects around the world have been scrapped in recent months over concerns about ballooning costs such as plans for a rail link connecting New York City’s subway and commuter rail systems to LaGuardia Airport. But the REM is forging ahead in its own imperfect way, drawing both hope for its economic and environmental benefit, and criticism for how the project has been conceived and handled.
“What annoys me is that there was almost an arrogance when this process started by the Caisse that ‘We know what we’re doing, we’re going to be better than others, we’re going to do it on time and on budget.’ Today it’s clear that’s not the case,” said Jacques Roy, a transportation specialist at Montreal’s HEC business school.
“We could see another project like this again but I’m not sure we should,” referring to the Caisse’s leadership.
That the REM is seeing the light of day is due in no small part to the wide berth the Quebec government offered to the Caisse, including expropriation rights and political backing despite a negative assessment of the project from the province’s environmental review board, Mr. Roy said. The transit line was also launched without worrying too much about how it will connect with the rest of the public transport network, he said.
Nathalie Drouin, a professor who studies project management at the University of Quebec at Montreal, said giving the Caisse a mandate for the REM wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. But the pension fund manager could have, and should have, done things differently in engaging stakeholders and stickhandling the project as an asset for the public good, she said.
Montrealers living near the REM tracks are voicing concerns that the trains – which have been undergoing testing for months – are too loud. And the design of the infrastructure itself, featuring massive concrete columns erected to support the elevated tracks, leaves much to be desired, Ms. Drouin said.
“Could we have done better?
Yes,” she said.
In sum, the Caisse handled the financial and technical risks for the project well but mishandled the social risk, Ms. Drouin said.
“By using the REM, people might come to appreciate it. But the question is would I hire the Caisse again to do another similar project? … I don’t know.”
The federal government might soon face that choice. Ottawa last week released a short list of private-sector bidders to build a high-frequency passenger rail line between Quebec City and Toronto, and a consortium including the Caisse is one of three finalists for what would be one of the largest infrastructure projects in Canadian history.
The federal government is paying close attention to the lessons learned from the REM as it pursues its own project, said Ehren Cory, CEO of the Canada Infrastructure Bank. Other cities are keeping tabs on the REM as well as they think about the long-term economic value of transit and the value it creates, he said.
The REM alone has contributed to $5-billion worth of real estate development on Montreal’s south shore over the past three years, three times the pace the Caisse had predicted. Mr. Emond calls it “a spinal cord” anchoring the region’s suburbs.
“Hopefully when we get to the light at the end of this tunnel and people see a train and a system running, it is an example for other municipalities, provinces, to see how we can get more infrastructure built,” Mr. Cory said in an interview.
“We’ve got to get more built faster than we are. And the reason we’re not isn’t for lack of effort. It’s partly because we can’t afford it all unless we think differently about how we pay for stuff,” he said.
The Caisse has said it wants to expand its infrastructure arm and build more projects like the REM from scratch, eking out a reputation as a go-to partner for governments. But as it opens the next arms of the transit line, it will have to overcome another hurdle: unknowns related to ridership.
The pandemic has changed the habits of Montreal’s white-collar professionals, who continue to work from home in great numbers. Although workers are slowly coming back, nearly one in three told the city’s chamber of commerce in recent polling that they do not want to come downtown to work, a desertion of the city centre that could yet wreak havoc on REM revenues.
The Transportation Research at McGill group has been studying the impacts of the REM on mobility, health and equity. Among its key findings from surveys in a report published in June, it says people’s stated intentions to use the REM fell by 7 per cent between 2019 and 2022. In terms of travel behaviour, car-use frequency increased by 59 per cent over the same time, its research found.
“Any transit system construction right now is good because you want people to be using it,” said Hisham Negm, a doctoral student working on the research.
“But is it the right time to be building a system that should be carrying 60,000 or 80,000 people a day and you’re not sure whether you’re going to get this ridership or not? It’s questionable.”
Mr. Emond says the system will prove its worth. And he says additional testing of the Alstom SAmade Metropolis trains over the past winter in Montreal, where it was exposed to freezing rain and -40 C cold, should ensure the system doesn’t experience the frequent breakdowns seen in other places like Ottawa.
“This is Metropolis on steroids,” Mr. Emond said. “There’s never been a train run like this in a rigorous climate with such temperature extremes. We’re confident it’ll react well.”

Full text: When Gordon Reid set up his first discount store in downtown Ottawa in 1961, he named it Giant Tiger after a small chain he admired in Cleveland, Ohio. Always a penny-pincher, the 27-year-old Mr. Reid didn’t initially want to pay for a logo so he found a drawing of a roaring lion, removed the mane and used it as an unusual symbol of his fledgling business.
As sales improved, Mr. Reid approached Ben Babelowsky, a local artist working as promotions director at the Ottawa Citizen to come up with a new design. Mr. Babelowsky created a jaunty yellow and black cartoon character that was named Friendly. According to Mr. Babelowsky, who died in 2019, Mr. Reid paid him $50 for his work.
Friendly is still in use today.
For Mr. Reid, who died on July 8 at the age of 89, frugality was the foundation of his business, a core value that paid off over six decades as Giant Tiger grew from a single store to a chain of 268 outlets in eight provinces, a privately owned Canadian success story in a sharply competitive business. Frugality meant buying ends of lines in the early days and locating stores in distressed locations, many of which had been vacant for years.
Bruce Winder, a retail analyst, said that Mr. Reid was able to develop “a brilliant niche between Walmart and the dollar stores, at a price point that’s just in between.” Mr. Winder saw Mr. Reid’s frugality firsthand about 25 years ago when he was working as a buyer for Canadian Tire in Toronto. A headhunter called to see if he was interested in a job at Giant Tiger. Instead of flying him in for an interview, the Giant Tiger executive suggested that Mr. Winder drive halfway to Ottawa for a meeting. He didn’t take the job in the end, but the experience was eye-opening. “Most companies would put you on a big plane and have you stay in a hotel. I realized these guys are run differently from other retailers. They were practising massive frugality.”
As Mr. Reid told an interviewer in 1991, who wondered why the owner of a thriving business was still working out of an office with paper-thin carpets, cheap panelling and an Arborite-covered desk, “You keep it simple, you keep it spartan and you pay your bills,” bragging that Giant Tiger was selling socks at $2.22 a pair when competitors were asking $4.00.
“He had a deep understanding of the customer,” said Gino DiGioacchino, appointed late last year as Giant Tiger’s interim president and chief executive officer.
“He understood the Canadian psyche and consumer.”
Gordon Reid was born on Aug. 23, 1933, in Vancouver, the only child of Noble Greenway Reid and May (née Slaney) Reid.
When Gordon was 13, he and his mother moved to Montreal, where they lived in the working-class suburb of Verdun and he began a part-time job at Simpson’s department store. At 16, he was expelled from high school “for misbehaving, setting a bad example, something that was quite small,” he recalled later. He began working fulltime in the men’s wear department at Simpson’s.
Mr. Reid later finished high school and took courses at Sir George Williams College in Montreal (the forerunner of Concordia University) and at Wayne State University in Detroit but he never got a degree. It was at Sir George Williams that he met Leatrice Sibales, who became his first wife.
Anxious to get ahead, Mr. Reid left Simpson’s and began working as a travelling salesman, eventually based in Windsor, Ont., selling sporting goods in the U.S. from a warehouse in Detroit. It was there that he was introduced to the concept of discount stores.
Returning to Canada, he moved to Ottawa and decided to become a discounter. He found a location in the ByWard Market, just around the corner from the city’s big department stores. To save money on rent, he leased an old printing plant that had belonged to the newspaper Le Droit. The initial investment was $15,000 but early profits were non-existent so the family depended on his wife’s salary as a teacher to survive.
The initial concept emphasized men’s wear and hardware products. It was a bust.
After 18 months Giant Tiger appeared to be finished, but the closing sale was so successful that it generated enough cash flow to keep the store open. After a split from his initial partner, Mr. Reid began adding stores in small towns in the region. But expansion was slow.
When an opportunity opened for a new outlet in Maniwaki, Que., Mr. Reid approached Jean-Guy Desjardins to run it as a franchisee, who would manage the store day to day and share in the profits. It was a success.
“The Maniwaki store made money and I didn’t have to do anything,” Mr. Reid recalled. “Jean-Guy did the advertising. He found the location. He merchandised it to suit his customers. He did everything. And I thought, by golly, this is a good system.” It’s a system that still exists today as the chain moved from its regional roots in eastern Ontario and western Quebec to become a national chain.
“[Mr. Reid] taught me everything I know about retail,” said Jeffrey York, who was hired in 1989 by Giant Tiger for his accounting knowledge and ended up serving as president and chief operating officer. “It was way better than an MBA because you’re dealing with franchisees, people, problems, everything. He created a culture of employee ownership.” Mr. York worked for 20 years at Giant Tiger, leaving in 2009 to head up Farm Boy, the growing Ontario supermarket chain that was sold in 2018 to Empire Co., the parent of Sobeys.
Under the franchise system, Giant Tiger would search for the right person to run a store, often a manager with experience at Woolworth’s, K-Mart or later Walmart, who chafed under the centralized control of a big retailer. Giant Tiger would find the store location, renovate it and train the franchisee-manager. Mr. York said the franchisee was responsible for running the store day to day while Giant Tiger would do “everything else and we’d split the profits.” Unlike elsewhere, franchisees were given considerable leeway in choosing the merchandise.
A key to the Giant Tiger formula was low rent. The chain kept away from high-priced malls and costly locations. “We were in old bowling alleys, old garages, old factories.
We’d take anything. We were the kings of vacant real estate. If a K-Mart closed, we’d take half of it,” Mr. York said. As for merchandise, in the early days the company bought production overruns, “bad colours and bad sizes” to keep prices low although that changed over time, Mr. York said.
When Walmart entered Canada in the 1990s, it forced Giant Tiger to adapt. The company opened buying offices in China and Bangladesh, began selling groceries to increase traffic and moved into big-city neighbourhoods. “We matched Walmart penny for penny on every price,” Mr. York said.
“Gordon was adamant that items in Walmart would be the exact same price at Giant Tiger. We were in their stores every day checking their prices.” To control shipping costs, a separate trucking subsidiary was launched. But not every new venture succeeded. An effort to expand into the U.S. failed and a separate construction subsidiary was also dropped.
Despite his innate frugality, Mr. Reid also believed in investing if it would improve profits, so the company built a massive automated warehouse in eastern Ontario that opened in 2018.
Mr. Reid was constantly in touch with his franchisees getting the pulse of the business, Mr. York said. “He was a telephone guy. He’d be on the phone, talking to the owners all the time. What’s selling? How are you displaying it? He was like an oldtime merchant, talking about selling stuff and selling a lot of it,” Mr. York said.
And he remained personally modest.
“He’d buy a $9.99 shirt and brag about wearing it,” Mr. York said. “He wasn’t about showing how much money he had because he didn’t have to.”
The company remains family-owned.
Mr. Reid’s eldest son, Scott, is the Reid most active in the company although his main occupation is as a Conservative MP.
Like many founders, Gordon Reid found it difficult to retire. In 2010, he stepped down as chief executive officer but four years later, at 81, he returned to the role after contemplating the sale of the company but deciding against it. He finally retired in 2020 and took on the title of chairman emeritus, when Scott became chairman. In the intervening years, the company had several presidents.
Even though Gordon Reid stopped going into the office in recent years, he would participate in board meetings and call “out of the blue” to discuss business issues. Just six weeks ago, Mr. DiGioacchino said Mr. Reid called with a suggestion of how to compete with a particular retailer. “I was blown away. It was a brilliant idea.”
Mr. Reid was an active member of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives (now the Business Council of Canada) and was awarded the Retail Council of Canada’s Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010.
He leaves his wife of 39 years, Nancy Reid; sons, Scott and Blake; daughter, Jacqueline; stepchildren, Daryl, Laurie and Kevin; six grandchildren and one greatgrandchild. His first marriage ended in divorce.

Full text: After decades of helping low-income Canadians get into homes, Habitat for Humanity is witnessing a profound change in who it is assisting.
The charity is increasingly backstopping mortgage loans for higher-income households, including those earning about $100,000 a year, in yet another sign of how unaffordable Canada has become.
The typical price of a home in the country is more than $760,000, with properties in Vancouver and Toronto well above $1million. Homes in other parts of Southern Ontario are perilously close to that level, pushing an increasingly larger swath of the population out of the housing market.
Habitat, a charity that has provided lower-income families with no-interest loans to buy a home for nearly four decades, has seen its client base shift to a higher income bracket as the typical home price in the country has jumped 40 per cent in five years.
“We have seen that the housing market has changed a lot in the last few years, and it’s left many more people and families having trouble finding homeownership who are in ranges of income we would have never expected to be problematic,” said Julia Deans, president of Habitat for Humanity Canada, which oversees 46 local organizations across the country. “People that we might traditionally have thought of as being middle-income earners are now also struggling to afford homeownership,” she said.
Nowhere is that shift more pronounced than in the Toronto region, the country’s second-priciest real estate market.
In the Toronto region, the typical home price is up 53 per cent – to $1,171,300 – from five years ago, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association.
Because home prices have increased so much, the income required to qualify for one of Habitat’s no-interest loans has risen dramatically. The Habitat loan effectively acts as a down payment for the Habitat client, allowing them to qualify for a mortgage from a bank or credit union.
And like any other borrower, they must have employment income that can cover the monthly payments.
The average household income required to qualify for Habitat aid in the Toronto region was $85,352 last year, compared with $53,508 in 2018. The minimum income for 2022 was $67,266 and maximum was $102,609.60, according to data provided by the charity.
Habitat typically serves families with children under the age of 16. Residents must be Canadian citizens or permanent residents and must have a job with enough employment income to make mortgage payments and maintain the home, which includes paying property taxes and insurance.
“We’re serving families that look like they’re doing so much better,” said Ene Underwood, the chief executive with Habitat for the Toronto region. But, Ms. Underwood said, in reality they are struggling.
One of Habitat’s tenets is that their clients will not pay more than 30 per cent of their gross income on housing costs, including mortgage payments and other expenses associated with homeownership.
Ms. Underwood said Habitat used to help clients in the services sector such as those working in retail. Now the charity is serving residents with higher-paying jobs such as in the medical field and government.
The size of the Habitat loan and bank mortgage in the Toronto region has risen in tandem with the spike in home prices.
The average mortgage was $809,363 last year compared with $437,959 in 2018, according to the charity.
“This shows you just how strained our system is,” said Heather Tremain, chief executive officer with Options For Homes, a non-profit developer that provides shared-equity mortgages for low-income earners so they can buy a home.
Ms. Tremain has observed the same phenomena with the homes that her organization develops. An average household income of $56,000 was required for a unit in an Option for Homes condo building that was completed in 2018. That compares to an average household income of $86,000 for a unit in a similar Options condo project that is due to be completed this year.
Recent data from Statistics Canada show how rising living expenses has destroyed savings for middle and lower-income households. They are spending more than they can save as their daily expenses rise at a much faster clip than their wages.
In the first quarter of this year, the bottom fifth – or bottom quintile – of all earners spent an average of $8,289 more than they earned in the first quarter of this year, up from $6,638 in the same quarter in 2020. Middle-income earners, defined as those that fall in the middle quintile of all earners, spent an average of $1,306 more than they earned in the first quarter of this year, an increase from $319 in the same quarter in 2020.
The fourth-highest income quintile managed to save money but saved less.
In contrast, the top income earners saw their savings grow. Households in the highest income quintile had average net savings of $13,040 in the first quarter of 2023 compared with $11,753 in the same quarter in 2020, according to Statistics Canada data.
“We’re seeing stress in every part of the market, from mortgage rates to rental costs to interest rates and construction costs. And this is all coming at a time when incomes are stagnant and we’re experiencing record inflation. It’s unlike anything I’ve seen before,” said Ms. Tremain.
Even in Edmonton, a city where home prices are below $400,000, residents are finding it difficult to break into the housing market. The typical price of a home in Edmonton was $376,800 in June. That is slightly higher than the typical price of $353,000 in the summer of 2018, according to data from the Canadian Real Estate Association.
Habitat Edmonton CEO Ann-Marie Reddy said five years ago families could probably have saved enough for a down payment, but that is no longer the case given the sharp rise in prices for food and other necessities. “It’s just not happening for them,” she said.
Across the country, every Habitat affiliate has a version of the no-interest loan program. When the client decides to move, Habitat gets first dibs on whether it will buy back the property. Otherwise, the home will be sold on the open market and fetch market prices.
The client will receive all the funding they paid into the mortgage. The appreciation or deprecation on the home is split between the charity and client using a predetermined formula. For example, at the Toronto Habitat, there is a prescribed shared-equity agreement that allows the client to earn a set amount.
Since Habitat provided its first no-interest loan in Winkler, Man., in 1985, the charity has helped 4,512 families buy a home in Canada. Organizations such as Habitat and Options For Homes have been critical in aiding households secure safe, affordable housing. But their aid only goes so far.
Habitat’s Ms. Deans said when people don’t have an affordable and safe place to call home, they don’t have that security, stability and savings that they need to reach their full potential and contribute as much they can to their community and to the country.
“It’s quite frightening to think of that loss of stability and what it means to society as well,” she said, noting every city across the country is dealing with ramifications of unaffordable housing.

Full text: As Pickering’s modest suburban homes give way to an expanse of farms north of Highway 401, roadside signs still tell drivers they are entering the Duffins Rouge Agricultural Preserve, “part of the Greenbelt.”
But these 1,900 hectares, which include some of the highest-grade agricultural soil in the country, are not in Ontario’s Greenbelt any more – even though they had been designated to remain farmland forever.
More than six months ago, the Duffins Rouge became the centrepiece of Premier Doug Ford’s promise-breaking move to allow housing on 3,000 hectares of the protected Greenbelt, which arcs around the Greater Toronto Area and was set up in 2005 to keep ecologically sensitive land offlimits to developers.
The land in Pickering represents nearly two-thirds of the real estate Mr. Ford removed from the Greenbelt map, something he says is necessary as the province battles a housing shortage amid booming immigration. Developers aim to build 30,000 homes on the former preserve, the bulk of the 50,000 the Premier has promised would result from his Greenbelt carve-outs.
But the plan in Pickering faces potential hurdles. The clock is ticking on the government’s selfimposed tight deadlines for developers to produce housing. Local municipal officials say the needed pipes and roads will take years and cost millions. And the federal Environment Minister has warned he could block development that harms endangered species or the adjacent Rouge National Urban Park.
Victor Doyle, the former senior Ontario planner who oversaw the creation of the 800,000-hectare Greenbelt, says the problems unveil the “deceit” in the current government’s claims that all of the removed land could be quickly and easily made ready for housing.
“These issues are not bumps in the road but major roadblocks demonstrating why these lands should never have been removed,” said Mr. Doyle, who along with other expert planners and environmentalists has said there is enough land already earmarked to meet Ontario’s housing targets without touching the Greenbelt.
The Greenbelt removals have fuelled questions about whether developers – many of whom are also donors to Mr. Ford’s Progressive Conservatives – knew in advance of the government’s decision, which has since prompted investigations by Ontario’s Auditor-General and its Integrity Commissioner. The Premier and his Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Steve Clark, have denied tipping off developers.
The Ontario government has vowed to return land to the Greenbelt if there isn’t “significant progress on approvals and implementation” by the end of this year and if construction does not begin by 2025.
Confidential talks on the Duffins Rouge area have been under way since January between the developers, the local governments of Pickering and Durham Region and the office of the province’s land and development facilitator, an arm of the Municipal Affairs and Housing ministry that the province calls in to mediate land-use disputes. At issue are the developers’ plans for the area – and who will pay for all of the required infrastructure.
The largest landowners in the former agricultural preserve are companies linked to prominent Toronto-area developer Silvio De Gasperis, who, according to a Globe analysis, has seen his holdings here shoot up in value by hundreds of millions of dollars now that they are outside the Greenbelt.
Officials in Durham Region say the preserve isn’t in their current 10-year infrastructure plan, since it was supposed to be left as agricultural land “in perpetuity.”
In an interview, chief administrative officer Elaine Baxter-Trahair said the region had yet to be assured its taxpayers would not have to cover any part of the added infrastructure bill – despite the province’s repeated statements that developers would “fully fund necessary infrastructure up front.”
With the looming deadlines, developers are focusing on a first phase of what they now call Cherrywood, taken from the name of a local village. This first phase could be accommodated with existing infrastructure, but includes only 1,200 homes – a fraction of the 30,000 contemplated for the entire former preserve.
Meanwhile, federal Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault has said he could use his powers under endangered species legislation to block development not just in the Duffins Rouge area, but in other lands removed from the Greenbelt. The federal government has previously taken similar action: It blocked a subdivision in La Prairie, Que., that threatened the habitat of the western chorus frog.
Mr. Guilbeault has already asked the federal government’s Impact Assessment Agency to launch a study of the potential effects of development in the Duffins Rouge lands on the neighbouring Rouge National Urban Park, a collection of farms and wooded areas around the Rouge River.
The Duffins Rouge land, a triangle on the park’s eastern flank, is dotted with a handful of hamlets and farmhouses. Many sport lawn signs urging the government to save the Greenbelt or stop sprawl.
Since the government announced its plans, locals have noticed an upswing in activity by work crews, including surveying and brush clearing, said Don Harvey, a lawyer who lives in the area.
He said some of the workers have used equipment bearing the TACC logo, a group of companies owned by Mr. De Gasperis and his family.
“It’s really, really unique in the sense of where it is – it’s right on the edge of the city and virtually untouched in 100 years,” Mr. Harvey said of the preserve. “And it can’t ever be replaced.”
Mr. De Gasperis, a major Progressive Conservative Party donor, has been at the centre of the battle over the Duffins Rouge lands for much of the past 20 years. Back when the Greenbelt was created, he launched losing legal fights and waged a public campaign to try to get the protected farmland he purchased opened for development, land largely leased to tenant farmers.
The area was part of a larger expropriation by the province for
development back in the early 1970s, along with property taken by the federal government to the north and reserved for a future airport that has not materialized.
Most of the area west of Duffins Creek has been set aside for farmland by provincial governments of different stripes for decades.
In 1999, the province’s real estate agency, under the PC government of Mike Harris, started selling the land back to the original landowners or tenant farmers.
A memorandum of understanding signed by Ontario, Durham Region and the City of Pickering deemed that the sales would be subject to local easements that required the land to remain agricultural “in perpetuity.” The amounts paid were a fraction of the prices that would have been the going rate had the land not been frozen for farming.
But developers, including companies linked to Mr. De Gasperis, began to buy up plots at those bargain prices and lobby to open them up for development.
The Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty then included the land in its new Greenbelt, which was proposed in 2004 and passed in 2005. Just a month later, Pickering, with the support of Durham, reneged on its deal and lifted some of the easements.
In response, the Liberals then passed additional legislation restoring the easements and requiring the province’s minister of natural resources to approve any move by Pickering to lift them again – a law Mr. Ford just scrapped.
According to property and corporate records analyzed by The Globe and Mail, Mr. De Gasperis owns 28 plots of land totalling 725 hectares in the former agricultural preserve through companies he controls with members of his family. The companies bought 24 of the properties in 2003 and 2004, paying between roughly $11,000 and $19,000 a hectare.
More recently, one of Mr. De Gasperis’s companies bought two more pieces of land in 2016 for about $87,000 a hectare.
And in 2020, his companies purchased two additional properties for approximately $185,000 a hectare.
Even that higher price was still a bargain compared with land where development could be allowed. A 160-hectare plot outside the protected area was purchased in 2016 by a group of developers, including one of Mr. De Gasperis’s companies, for $160-million – or $1-million a hectare. Used as a rough comparison, it suggests Mr. De Gasperis’s 725 hectares could now be worth as much as $725-million – vastly more than the total $21.5-million property records show his companies paid for the land.
Phil Pothen, Ontario environment program manager at the advocacy group Environmental Defence, said the rise in value amounts to a windfall at the expense of taxpayers.
“The owners of this land paid a pittance for it because it could never be used for anything other than agriculture,” he said. “Now they’re being handed vastly valuable development rights that they never paid for.”
In an e-mailed statement, Alana De Gasperis, the director of planning and corporate affairs for Mr. De Gasperis’s TACC Developments, said the majority of the company’s holdings in the area were purchased “several years before” the Greenbelt and the Duffins Rouge Agricultural Preserve Act were enacted. However, property records show most of the land was bought up in 2003 and 2004, after easements had been imposed meant to restrict the area to farming.
Ms. De Gasperis also pointed to the conclusions of Pickering’s 2004 growth management study that concluded part of the area was “better suited for urban development than for long term agricultural protection,” because of its proximity to existing development and infrastructure.
(According to a report from Pickering’s director of planning at the time, the study was funded by $620,000 from the “landowners in the study area.”) Ms. De Gasperis said her company always believed the land would be freed up for housing, given its proximity to existing communities and rising population. She pledged that “any infrastructure required to support community development in the Cherrywood area will be paid for by the developers, so the taxpayers do not pay.” Ms. De Gasperis also said the developers will provide “land for health care and educational facilities, parks, trails and community food gardens.”
Meanwhile, Mr. De Gasperis has filed a court application to try to get out of a summons ordering him to provide information to Ontario’s Auditor-General, Bonnie Lysyk, who is conducting a probe of the Greenbelt changes, as has another developer with interests in former Greenbelt land, Michael Rice.
Victoria Podbielski, a spokesperson for the Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister, said in an e-mail that the government is enforcing “firm conditions” on developers to ensure “major public infrastructure and community benefits – like roads, water and sewer infrastructure, community centres, schools and health-care facilities – will be built and paid for by the proponents.” She also said it is the province’s “expectation” that 10 per cent of these homes will be “affordable,” although she did not provide details.
Ms. Podbielski also pointed to Pickering’s long-standing previous position that the land should be developed, a case its previous and current mayors made in letters to her minister last fall. But Pickering’s newly elected council – including Mayor Kevin Ashe – subsequently voted in December to scrap a staff recommendation approving development on the Greenbelt, after a public outcry.
Farm advocacy groups are among those against developing the land. The Ontario Farmland Trust has warned that this and other recent changes in Ontario that threaten to accelerate the loss of prime farmland are putting the province’s food supply at risk.
Clayton Reesor, 25, works for his family’s Sweet Ridge Farms, which both owns and rents farmland in the preserve and rents more land in the neighbouring Rouge Urban National Park. The business is well known in the area for its sweet corn, but also grows tomatoes, watermelons and other produce.
He says paving high-quality Ontario farmland and relying on imported food is a mistake. The business has already lost some of the fields it rents in the preserve.
And while his family could sell its own land there and benefit from the coming development boom, Mr. Reesor says he prefers to keep farming, as Reesors have since the early 1800s.
“It’s in the blood,” he said.
“We’ve done it for so many generations.”

Full text: 102 Dixon Ave., Toronto THE BEACHES Asking price: $2,598,000 (May, 2023) Previous asking price: $2,698,000 (April, 2023) Selling price: $2.5-million (May, 2023) Previous selling prices: $459,054 (February, 2012); $280,000 (August, 1992) Taxes: $7,804 (2022) Days on the market: 15 Property days on the market: 50 Listing agent: Anna Kemp, Re/Max Hallmark Realty Ltd.
THE ACTION This four-bedroom house saw a steady flow of prospective buyers in April, but their common complaint was it had three kitchens. To remedy that issue, the price was reduced to $2,598,000 from $2,698,000 and one kitchen was ripped out. Dozens examined the updated space, and one buyer trimmed off another $98,000 for a final deal at $2.5-million.
“When we first listed the property, it had a kitchen on the third floor – my seller used to rent that out sometimes or use it for guests, so it was like an in-law suite – but the feedback was most buyers were looking for a single-family home,” agent Anna Kemp said.
“We removed the kitchen, and once that was done, it sold really quickly.”
WHAT THEY GOT This detached house was erected on a 25by-100-foot lot more than 100 years ago. In recent years, it was drastically improved with modern mechanics and appointments throughout, plus an updated back deck.
Each level has a contemporary bathroom, and the primary kitchen and dining area features an island, stainless-steel appliances, hardwood floors and pot lights.
There is a living room with a gas fireplace, and a family room on the second floor.
The basement suite has one bedroom and open recreation and cooking quarters.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “My client was a designer, so she was meticulous with her home, and picked gorgeous, high-end finishes,” Ms. Kemp said.
“Another unique feature was an extra-wide driveway, which isn’t that common in the Beaches.”
Local amenities are also easy to reach on foot or by car. “It’s close to Queen Street and the beach, but slightly more on the west end side of the Beaches, so that made commuting downtown and getting in and out of the Beaches easy,” Ms. Kemp said.

Modern log cabin an homage to wood: Couple finds a slice of heaven in small-town Ontario, just minutes from Highway 401

Full text: 971 Naphan Rd.
ROSLIN, ONT.
Asking Price: $859,000 Taxes: $3,531 (2022) Lot Size: 150 by 300 feet Listing agent: Manson Slik, Gordon’s Downsizing & Estate Services Ltd.
THE BACKSTORY When Canadians are polled on the question “do you want to own cottage or cabin?” they tend to respond with a resounding “Yes” by healthy majorities, no matter the age group. Whether you can actually afford your own place in the woods is often a separate consideration. Patrick Johnston and Ron Menchetti found their slice of heaven in the small town of Roslin, Ont., after realizing that even back in 2005 it was getting too expensive to buy a place in the popular Prince Edward County area.
“We weren’t going to be able to find something in the County we really liked. So we broadened the search, that’s how we found this place,” said Mr. Johnston, who worked in provincial governments and in charitable fundraising throughout a long career. “We were some of first expats to move out to this area.”
What they found is a handmade log cabin on a very quiet road north of Belleville and south of Tweed that’s still only 15 minutes away from Prince Edward County and less than that to the 401. “If there’s four cars that go by in an hour, it’s rush hour,” Mr. Menchetti said.
Over the first eight years, it went from the weekend spot to the long weekend house, and then the half-the-week house until they decided to give up their place in Toronto and move full-time to the rustic community in 2013.
“To be honest with you, we were a little worried – we’re two guys of a certain age – whether we’d be accepted or welcome? I have to say we’ve never had any negative incidents here. We were welcomed by everybody in the neighbourhood,” said Mr. Johnston.
Mr. Menchetti was a city boy through and through, but after he retired early it didn’t take him long to discover the best place to make friends in the country: the bonspiel.
“I never in my life would have thought about taking up curling, but I love it … I curl in Napanee,” he said. “I was very surprised how social it is. It’s a great experience for anybody who moves to a rural area.”
THE HOUSE TODAY The house is bounded by solid forest on both sides with a large sward of front lawn. Down the gravel driveway past the garage is a car courtyard that can fit more than five vehicles.
The courtyard is flanked by a 50-foot-long dry-stone wall. Huge flat boulders serve as paving stones in a walkway to the formal front entrance, though there is a more informal entrance around the corner to a back hallway.
Many of these stones were identified, gathered and placed by Mr. Menchetti, who according to Mr. Johnston: “Has a real rock fetish.”
“I’d go out and collect rocks,” Mr. Menchetti said. “It’s odd: I’m not a huge person and I’m not young, but I’d pick up rocks, throw them in the back of the truck. And after I’d collect 10 or 12, sometimes I couldn’t pick them up back at home.”
The wall took a couple of summers to build. The perennial garden full of Ontario-native species was more trial and error and continues to evolve today (they even have Ontario’s only indigenous cactus plant, the prickly pear that looks like it deflates and dies in the winter but actually comes back to life in the summer).
Stepping in the front door, your eyes are drawn to weathered and gnarled beams and posts that suggest this could easily be some pioneer’s frontier croft or a carefully preserved hunting lodge from the turn of the last century. In reality, it’s neither.
Beginning around 1991, a local man named Don Goodwin started building 971 Naphan Rd., spending close to a decade handmaking the log cabin as a kind of grand hobby.
Every one of the windows was hand-built by him and the locally-milled white pine logs are joined without any nails. Much of the structure was built with very few helping hands.
Unfortunately, Mr. Goodwin never completed his opus to woodworking. Local property developer Dave Robertson bought the unfinished house in 2002 and filled the interior with antique beams and boards, adding decades or centuries of character in a stroke.
There are posts and beams and white-oak flooring in the dining and living rooms salvaged from an old barn, and the old growth Ganaraska red-pine flooring on the second floor came from an old factory.
From left to right, the rooms on the main floor almost seem to travel in time to the present: The living room/den has a massive fieldstone hearth and barnboard walls; the dining room is filled with tiger-stripe oak antiques and glass-globed brass lighting fixtures; and the kitchen evokes modern farmhouse with a huge granite-topped island over a playful turquoise lower cabinet, grey upper and pantry millwork and stainless steel appliances under a white-washed oak ceiling.
Along the back of the house is a hallway that connects the dining room, powder room and kitchen and has three exterior doors to the stone patio and side driveway and backyard. The stairs to the full-height basement (another rarity in a country home) are back here as well.
That was one of the big projects the couple undertook – finishing the full basement to add two bedrooms (currently a convertible office and an artist studio), a large living room and TV room with a bar and a wall of storage lining the hallway.
There are three more bedrooms on the top floor, and plenty of skylights to bring light into another lodge-like level filled with wood. A large landing at the top of the stairs branches off to a shared bathroom, two smaller bedrooms and the primary bedroom with a four-piece ensuite bathroom that was recently updated.
LOGGING OFF The couple is hoping to downsize to Kingston but are going to really miss the feeling of a log home.
“It’s a house that just feels incredibly solid is how I would describe it,” said Mr. Johnston “There’s no insulation on the inside, just logs, but it’s incredibly warm and cozy.”
Indeed, other than looking great, the log walls provide a lot of energy-saving value.
“We found in the winter that when the heat is on the logs absorb the heat. We are lucky the power hasn’t gone out much” – perhaps two or three times in almost 20 years – “but when the power did go out the house remained warm for hours and hours,” said Mr. Menchetti.
The same works in the summer where the thick walls keep the house cool: “So far, most summers we’ve had [air conditioning] on a handful of times, mostly to cool upstairs because there’s five skylights.”
But whether you’re hot or cold on logs, don’t call the location remote (which one potential buyer griped): “I told her Baffin Island is remote. We’re only minutes from the 401,” Mr. Johnston said.

Laurentian Bank shares rise as markets anticipate bidder interest

Full text: Laurentian Bank of Canada shares soared 27 per cent Wednesday as investors weighed whether the bank’s sale process will yield an attractive bid for the beleaguered lender, which is in the midst of a major overhaul.
Montreal-based Laurentian Bank confirmed in a press release Tuesday, after a report by The Globe and Mail that the country’s ninth-largest lender is exploring a sale, that it is “conducting a review of strategic options.”
The move came as a surprise to analysts because Laurentian is halfway through a three-year strategic turnaround under chief executive officer Rania Llewellyn, who stepped into the top job in 2020 after its stock price underperformed its peers for years.
“We believed [Laurentian Bank’s] board was committed to a multiyear turnaround effort under CEO Rania Llewellyn,” National Bank of Canada analyst Gabriel Dechaine said in a note to clients. “Nonetheless, a challenging growth outlook for Canadian banks and a stock price that has consistently hovered below book value (and an unsolicited bid) may have forced the Board’s hand.”
Mr. Dechaine said he expects the deal to be valued at $2.6-billion – Laurentian’s book value – which amounts to an 80-percent premium to Tuesday’s closing share price.
Laurentian has been discussing the possibility of a deal with several suitors since late June, sources familiar with the matter told The Globe. The bank has hired JPMorgan Chase & Co. and law firm Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP as its advisers. Laurentian is also believed to have received a bid from an undisclosed rival bank.
A takeover of Laurentian Bank would provide a lender with expansion opportunities in Quebec and Ontario, as well as in the southern United States, where it has a commercial equipment-financing business.
Laurentian has 57 branches and $51-billion of assets, focusing largely on commercial loans – a key area of growth for many of its larger rivals.
While any of the banks could be a potential buyer, some are likelier suitors than others. Bank of Nova Scotia has previously said it is looking to bolster its presence in Quebec and British Columbia.
Scotiabank has also recognized that its reliance on its international division and costlier wholesale funding has weighed on its share price. By folding Laurentian into its domestic business, the earnings contribution from Scotiabank’s Latin America business would fall to 26 per cent from 28 per cent, according to Mr. Dechaine.
Toronto-Dominion Bank is sitting on billions of dollars in excess capital after its deal to acquire Tennessee-based First Horizon Corp. fell through. In its home market, the country’s second-largest lender is targeting significant organic growth in its personal and commercial business. At its investor day in June, it set medium-term targets to boost its residential lending book by 40 per cent and business loans by 35 per cent.
Meanwhile, Royal Bank of Canada is tied up with its pending acquisition of HSBC Canada, while Bank of Montreal is aiming to integrate its takeover of California-based Bank of the West by September. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has said it is focused on building its existing business and its lower capital reserves, and National Bank of Canada is focused on expanding outside of its stronghold in Quebec.
A key stakeholder with an interest in the outcome is the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, which owned an 8.1-percent stake in Laurentian as of Dec. 31, according to filings. Unlike other large pension funds, it invests with a dual mandate that includes contributing to Quebec’s economic development. Spokesperson Kate Monfette said Caisse could not comment on the potential sale, but that it “will be following the process closely.”
While Canadian bank deals are rare, this is the third opportunity in the past year for a major lender to expand its domestic reach through a significant acquisition. In November, RBC unveiled its $13.5-billion deal to scoop up HSBC Canada, which would expand its lead over rivals by tens of billions of dollars in loans and deposits.
The same month, billionaire financier Stephen Smith struck a $1.7-billion deal to acquire alternative mortgage lender Home Capital Group Inc.
“Canadian banking assets do not come up for sale often, although that seems to have changed more recently,” CIBC analyst Paul Holden said in a note. “We expect there will be interest from the large Canadian banks given that domestic transactions offer relatively low risk financial accretion.”
But Laurentian has yet to remedy key issues in its business. Its return on equity – an industry metric that measures profitability – has hovered below 10 per cent, significantly lower than its rivals. That could weigh on the bank’s valuation and provide a bidder with an opportunity to buy the bank at a discount.
“The bank’s ROE and relative valuation continue to lag the broader group, but have improved from trough levels under the previous management team,” Scotiabank analyst Meny Grauman said in a note. “Current CEO Rania Llewellyn has been on the job for just three years, and we would characterize her tenure as constructive.”
In 2020, after an abrupt leadership change and years of disappointing results at Laurentian, Ms. Llewellyn became CEO, the first female chief executive to head a major Canadian-owned bank. After a yearlong review, she launched a turnaround plan that focused on niche specializations and rejigging its digital platforms through partnerships outside the bank, including its mobile banking app launched in late 2021.
In the current phase of its overhaul, Laurentian has been focused on growing its weaker core deposit base, which is a cheaper source of funding for banks – especially at a time when slowing loan demand and rising costs are squeezing profits across the industry. While commercial lending accounts form about half of Laurentian’s total loan portfolio, 26 per cent of that portion is in commercial real estate. That’s more than double the average 11 per cent of its Big Six bank peers.
Waning demand for office space has sparked concerns over stability in that loan segment, especially as interest rates spike.
Many of the big banks have been setting aside more provisions for credit losses – money reserved for potentially bad loans – as risk rises in office lending books. Many of the big banks have been setting aside more provisions for credit losses – money reserved for potentially bad loans – as risk rises in office lending books.
“We believe [Laurentian Bank’s] CRE exposure and potential impact on credit would be top of mind for a potential suitor,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Scott Chan said in a note.
Quebec struck a cautious tone Wednesday when asked about its position on the potential change of control at Laurentian.
“We’re following the situation closely but we’ll make no comment on the process under way,” said Claudia Loupret, spokeswoman for Quebec Finance Minister Eric Girard. The province has not hesitated to act in the past when confronted with a potential change of control for homegrown companies it considers strategic to its economy, including Rona Inc. in 2012 and Transat A.T. Inc. in 2019.
This time, while government officials could work behind the scenes to make sure Quebec financial players give Laurentian a good look, the province might be more reticent to push for a local takeover of the bank. In part, that’s because Laurentian is a highly Montreal-centric lender with limited emotional connection to Quebeckers outside the city, says Louis Hébert, a specialist in mergers and acquisitions at Montreal’s HEC business school.
“This is not Bombardier or Desjardins Group or even the Cirque [du Soleil],” said Mr. Hébert. “Go 50 kilometres outside the island of Montreal and most people won’t even know Laurentian.”

Full text: Rooftop solar panels spanning the equivalent of seven football fields are set to be installed this fall in phase one of a 3.3-million-square-foot industrial park in Milton, Ont.
The $825-million James Snow Business Park, developed and designed by Oxford Properties, puts sustainability at its core, including LED high bay lighting fixtures, electric-vehicle charging stalls and parks and connections to local walking trails. The solar installation is Oxford’s largest yet.
The development highlights growing interest by property owners in solar power as a financially feasible option to address rising electricity costs, help reduce the carbon footprint of buildings – a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions – and attract preferred tenants.
At the James Snow project, the rooftop solar panels will generate power for tenants at a predictable price without them necessarily relying on the provincial grid.
“[Solar] is increasingly important as [tenants] look to reach and meet their own ESG [environmental, social and governance] goals for their companies,” says Jeff Miller, Oxford’s head of industrial. “We see this as a differentiator. There is not a lot of solar on buildings in the Toronto market.”
What accounts for solar’s raised profile?
Plenty, says John Staneko, president and chief executive officer of Green Integrations Inc., Toronto-based provider of turnkey renewable energy and cleantech projects.
He cites technical improvements and declining costs of solar equipment, rising electricity prices and the federal government carbon tax. Meanwhile, a new federal clean technology investment tax credit equal to 30 per cent of eligible equipment, including renewable energy and storage, combined with other rebates, could cut the payback period on solar panels to between five and seven years, he estimates.
“[Solar power] is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities in commercial real estate in the next decade,” he says. “It is because these buildings are owned by commercial real estate companies and commercial landlords, and are the ideal properties for housing the energy infrastructure of the future.”
Still, barriers remain.
“The lack of affordable and efficient storage technology – that is a big headwind,” says Tonya Lagrasta, head of ESG for Colliers Real Estate Management Services in Canada.
“Existing electricity grids might not be able to handle the input of solar energy, which could create some technical challenges.”
Meanwhile, companies are still trying to respond to federal greenhouse gas emission targets for 2030 and 2050. “How are we going to get there is the multibillion-dollar existential challenge that people are faced with now,” she says. “So, on-site solar is one of the options.”
Another barrier is lack of knowledge, says Curtis Craig, president of Inferno Solar, an Edmonton-based turnkey provider of solar installations. Solar panels generally have a life expectancy of up to 25 years, but clients know little about their durability.
With rising electricity rates in Alberta, he says, businesses now see solar power as a cheaper alternative to the supply from the provincial grid.
“The pitch to tenants is that their electricity costs will either stay the same or go down,” Mr. Craig says.
As developers incorporate solar in projects, understanding tenant energy needs is crucial.
Dream Industrial REIT, which set a company-wide target of netzero emissions by 2035, has so far put rooftop solar on 16 buildings in Canada, with seven installed in 2022-2023 at a cost of $4.5-million.
Rooftop solar power helps landlords supply electricity to tenants at a lower, more dependable price than the provincial grid, says Bonnie Crews, director of sustainability and portfolio management at Dream. “It makes economic sense, it enables us to build stronger relations with tenants and gives us a competitive edge,” she says.
The company has about 1.3 million square feet in the pipeline in Canada and Europe “where we are exploring future solar opportunities,” she says.
“We are committed to continuing the pace going forward.”
In Calgary, Hopewell Development first included solar in its commercial building designs in 2021, vice-president of construction Derek Fox says, with five solar-included projects currently under construction. For tenants, he says, “providing them something that will offset their ongoing expenses is going to be beneficial in the long run and allows them to tie that to their own ESG metrics.”
As companies set carbon reduction targets, some are rethinking how to get there.
For example, Vicwest Building Products, headquartered in Burlington, Ont., previously relied on carbon offsets to reach its targets.
But since 2020, the company has looked in-house to achieve its carbon-cutting goals, with solar one part of the solution.
“Rather than investing in carbon offsets, we put the money into an opportunity that will solve the problem, not just mask it,” says Bernard Lewis, Vicwest’s vice-president of operations. By 2030, the company aims to have 60 per cent of its energy requirements powered by direct renewable energy, generated from rooftop solar and Hydro-Quebec’s hydroelectric grid.
This year, at its Stratford, Ont., facility, Vicwest installed 1,206 rooftop solar panels expected to produce 86 per cent of its power.
By 2030, the company expects to install solar panels in all its wholly owned facilities.
“Solar is our number one opportunity for reducing carbon emissions across the country,” Mr. Lewis says.
A new rooftop installation at Rabba Fine Foods in Mississauga illustrates the evolution in thinking about solar.
Several years ago, the familyowned company hired Mr. Staneko’s firm, Green Integrations, to install LED lighting. After several years of discussions with Mr. Staneko, Rabba executives concluded they could save on energy costs with solar.
With solar panels currently being installed on the roofs of two Rabba distribution warehouses, company president Rick Rabba says, “we are generating enough solar-backed electricity without importing it from the grid,” save for some exceptions in winter.
He views his company’s $2million solar project as “futureproofing against risks such as electricity rate hikes.” For companies expecting to stay in their buildings for decades, he adds, solar is “a no-brainer.”

Postmedia and Nordstar abandon merger discussions: Newspaper chains cite lack of agreement on terms, regulatory and financial uncertainty in decision

Full text: The country’s largest newspaper chains called off merger plans on Monday, with the owner of the Toronto Star citing “financial uncertainty” that came with a proposed marriage to debt-heavy partner Postmedia Network Canada Corp.
Postmedia and Nordstar Capital LP, parent to the Toronto Star, said they were unable to reach agreement on terms of a deal, two weeks after they announced detailed plans to combine the two businesses. The potential transaction would have required approval from the federal Competition Bureau.
In a press release on Monday, Postmedia and Nordstar said the lack of agreement on terms, and “the added backdrop of regulatory and financial uncertainty led them to make the decision to end their negotiations.”
Nordstar executives were concerned with Postmedia’s debt structure, even though Postmedia’s lenders were planning to swap the majority of the company’s loans for equity, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. The Globe and Mail agreed not to name the source because they are not permitted to discuss the transaction.
“These are challenging times for media companies, but we intend to keep working hard to give Canadians the news they need to stay informed,” said Jordan Bitove, owner of Nordstar and publisher of the Toronto Star, in a press release.
In late June, Postmedia and Nordstar said combining forces would help the companies deal with the “existential threat” they face from tech platforms such as Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Inc.
and Google owner Alphabet Inc., which are winning an increasing amount of revenues from advertisers.
The two tech giants have threatened to drop Canadian news content from their platforms because of a dispute with the federal government over Bill C-18, which will require them to pay news organizations for posting or linking to their work.
Postmedia owns 130 media properties, including daily broadsheet and tabloid newspapers in most major cities, while Nordstar has 70 titles.
Postmedia has $288-million in debt, and lost $36.7-million in the first six months of the year, after losing $26.5-million in the same period a year ago. In announcing negotiations with Nordstar last month, Postmedia said the merger “contemplates a significant reduction in overall debt through a conversion of a portion of the outstanding debt to equity.”
On Monday, Postmedia chief executive officer Andrew MacLeod said: “The need for creative solutions and foundational transformation in our industry remains.”
In an interview last week, prior to the end of talks, Postmedia investor and Florida-based hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman said: “Consolidation is the only solution to this industry’s problems. Big synergies are likely to come out of a deal.”
Postmedia’s $316-million acquisition of the Sun Media newspaper chain, completed in 2015, was also pitched as a crucial move to compete with tech platforms for ad spending while providing quality journalism to local communities. The transaction created the largest newspaper chain in Canada but also sparked fears about job losses and newsroom closings. While management vowed to keep operating competing titles in the same markets, Postmedia cut 90 jobs and merged newsrooms in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa less than a year later.
Between 2017 and 2022, Postmedia shed more than 1,200 fulltime employees while revenue fell 39 per cent to $458-million. In 2020, Postmedia shut down 15 community newspapers in Manitoba and Ontario, and earlier this year shifted a dozen Alberta titles to a digital-only format. Management also announced cuts to 11 per cent of the company’s 650 editorial employees.
All of the cost-cutting has affected the amount and variety of original reporting in Postmedia papers. “We had much better content in the past, but we had to let a lot of it go because of what we are,” former Postmedia chair Paul Godfrey said on a recent podcast for the Canadian Jewish News. “We’re not The New York Times.”
The parent company of the Toronto Star has similarly slimmed down over the years. The firm sold its Harlequin book publishing division in 2014, spent millions on an unsuccessful tablet app, outsourced printing operations, sold real estate, and shut down a number of newspapers.
The company struck a deal with Postmedia in 2017 to swap 41 newspapers only for both publishers to shutter most of them in a cost-savings gambit. The Competition Bureau investigated the transaction but closed its probe in 2021 without taking further action.
Headcount has fallen, too. The number of unionized employees at the Toronto Star dropped from 610 in 2009 to 178 last year, while the Hamilton Spectator has gone from 261 to 86 employees, according to Unifor, the largest media union in Canada.
Mr. Bitove and former business partner Paul Rivett purchased Nordstar for $60-million in 2020, by which time its stock had fallen 99 per cent from a peak more than a decade prior.
The new owners diversified into parcel delivery and online gaming, but the pair soon had an acrimonious falling out. Mr. Bitove took ownership of the Toronto Star and the Metroland chain of community titles after an arbitration process late last year.
Under the terms of the nowcancelled merger, existing Postmedia shareholders were to own a 56-per-cent economic interest in the combined companies, with Nordstar holding a 44-percent stake. Mr. Bitove was to retain a 65-per-cent stake in the Toronto Star, which would become a separate company. Mr. Bitove was to be chairman of the combined companies while Mr. MacLeod was CEO.
Postmedia owns the Vancouver Sun and Province newspapers, Edmonton Journal, Calgary Herald and Montreal Gazette. Nordstar’s portfolio includes the Hamilton Spectator and the Waterloo Region Record.

History lives in Niagara-area Regency-style home: Renovation that added modern conveniences done by builder who specialized in older houses

Full text: 376 Nelles Rd. North GRIMSBY, ONT.
Asking Price: $1,846,000 Taxes: $7,112.00 (2023) Lot Size: 0.8 acres Agent: Martinus Geleynse, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada THE BACKSTORY In 1986, Mary and James Volk set off on a one-day art tour of the Niagara region.
The Toronto couple had purchased a work by one of the artists in the past so they made sure that they fit in a stop at his address in Grimsby.
The Volks arrived to a remarkable old house that remained nearly unchanged as it was handed down through the generations of one family.
After the death of the last descendant, the artist stayed there for a time while the heirs decided what to do with the historic home.
He showed the Volks around the unaltered rooms, pointing out the original staircase, heavy draperies and a wood-burning fireplace which was still used for cooking in the kitchen.
“It was in its original form,” recalls Ms. Volk of the building furnished with family heirlooms dating to the 19th century.
The couple purchased an oil painting of the garden that the artist created while looking through the dining room window.
Two years later, they bought the house.
In time the Volks learned much more about the local landmark and the Nelles family that features prominently in the history of Grimsby.
As one of the area’s founding families, the Nelleses have been memorialized throughout the town. Street signs, a public school, a park and a local museum all bear the family name.
Long before their arrival, the land was part of the rich history of the First Nations such as the Hatiwendaronk, Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabe, including the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation.
Three Nelles brothers were United Empire Loyalists who crossed the Niagara River into Canada in the late 1700s around the time of the American Revolutionary War. Each brother received a land grant at the edge of Lake Ontario, on the fertile ground below the Niagara Escarpment.
Perhaps the most well-known of the brothers was Colonel Robert Nelles, who became a mill owner, politician and commander of the local militia in the War of 1812. Today his house is the Nelles Manor Museum, where the grounds have been designated as an official 1812 battle site.
Incursions took place on many parts of the family’s land and three generations of Nelleses joined in protecting the Niagara frontier, according to the museum’s records.
The colonel’s brother, William, divided his own estate between his sons, with one parcel going to John Adolphus Nelles in the mid-1800s.
It was John Adolphus who built the house that currently stands at 376 Nelles Rd. North.
At the time, John Adolphus was a widower with four children.
He married Helen Sumner and, in 1846, completed the house he called Lake Lawn because the pasture stretched all the way to the shore. The home remained in the family, passed down through the generations.
The last descendant to live in the home, Mary Burnham, died in the 1980s.
The exterior of the two-storey, red-brick house, built in the Regency style, was designated under the Ontario Heritage Act in 1986.
THE HOUSE TODAY After their visit to the artist, the Volks didn’t think about the house again until two years later when they once again toured Niagara studios. The artist had moved on but he mentioned that the property was for sale.
They booked an appointment to view the home and bought it four days later.
In the two years since they had visited, a builder who specialized in restoring old houses had added modern conveniences, including new heating, plumbing and electrical systems.
He also pulled down heavy, flocked wallpaper, stripped paint from the 18-inch baseboards and refurbished the wide plank floors.
Many of the home’s unique elements remain, including the names the Nelles children etched into the window panes. Flora, Eliza, John and William are some of the names that appear in the wavy glass.
The original hardware – with keys weighing as much as a pound – remains on many of the doors.
Today the house has approximately 3,500 square feet of living space with four bedrooms and 11/2 bathrooms.
On the main floor, a large living room has a decorative fireplace, wide plank floors and tall windows with views of the manicured grounds.
The two spend much of their time in the library at the front of the house. After the original furniture was removed, Mr. Volk built new cabinets with bookshelves above.
The original kitchen was likely in a separate building, Mr. Volk says, but at some point an addition was built on the back of the house.
Today a modern white kitchen has been installed under oak beams. The servants’ staircase has been opened up and its timeworn treads preserved. The fireplace holds a cast-iron pot suspended on the original crane, and heritage records say John Adolphus is believed to have built the wooden surround himself.
Mr. Volk delved into old-fashioned cooking methods in order to put the kitchen fireplace to use.
It took several pounds of wood to make a stew, he learned, and other dishes were often fried in skillets on the hearth. He added a spit for roasting meat over the embers.
“You can barbecue as easily on it as you can outside,” Mr. Volk says.
A large dining room at the centre of the home accommodates dinner parties. Over the years, the Volks have raised funds for the Grimsby Museum and other local organizations by auctioning off the opportunity to spend an evening at Lake Lawn.
Mr. Volk cooks dinner for the guests over the flame in the kitchen and a group of 10 or so gather around the large table in the dining room.
Upstairs, the house has three bedrooms and a study. The former servants’ quarters now serve as the TV room.
The Volks renovated the primary bathroom to include a stand-alone tub and a walk-in shower.
The Nelleses’ household goods were sold at auction before the house was renovated, so the couple has travelled to many places in the United States and Canada to seek out furniture that fits the home. A china cabinet, for example, was salvaged from a post office in Nova Scotia, and the long dining room table comes from Buffalo.
Today the painting of orange day lilies the couple purchased during their first visit to the home hangs in the powder room.
The Volks hope the third family to become custodians of the 177year-old home will appreciate and maintain its heritage.
“I hope they will respect its history and enjoy living in it because it’s going to be there after they’re gone,” Ms. Volk says. “These houses do appeal to a very unique, small set of people.”
Grimsby offers the opportunity to visit many wineries and orchards. The beach that once belonged to Lake Lawn is now the public Nelles Beach Park . Hikes in the area offer panoramic views from the many lookouts along the Bruce Trail and Niagara Escarpment.
“It’s a nice town. It’s a town that has an appreciation for culture as well,” Ms. Volk says.
THE BEST FEATURE The grounds of Lake Lawn measure nearly one acre, about a block from Lake Ontario.
Some of the oak, chestnut, maple, pine and spruce trees on the property are more than 100 years old, while pear, plum, sour cherry, magnolia and redbud trees blossom in the spring.
Herb and perennial gardens surround the house.
Mr. Volk, who took up stone work, laid the walkways and patio. He had 100 tons of stone brought in to build the fence that lines the perimeter.
At times, hundreds of monarch butterflies have stopped over to roost in the trees during migration.
Each summer, the front porch is the setting for a recital performed by Ms. Volk on her harp.
“It’s a really inviting place,” Ms. Volk says of the porch that stretches the width of the house.
“It’s like a room we use all the time.”

Full text: When Meg Graham, a partner at the Toronto architecture studio Superkül, was an eighties teenager in Mississauga, she’d spend lazy afternoons watching the light change in her bedroom. “I was a dreamer,” she says. “I’d lie on the floor listening to Kate Bush or Siouxsie and the Banshees and track the sun as it moved across the ceiling.” She noticed how light (or its absence) can alter interior space – compressing it at noon, elongating it at dusk, obliterating it at night. “Architecture is static,” she says, “but when you use light to fill the volume, it becomes dynamic. You feel that you’re part of a larger environment.”
These thoughts were on her mind when, in 2017, Superkül got commissioned to design a lakeside cottage in the Kawartha region of Ontario. The owners – Monica Shin, a senior manager at BMO Capital Markets, and her partner, a senior manager at TD Securities – had fallen in love with the property at first sight.
“It has a perfect location,” Ms. Shin says. “It’s a peninsula with over 600 feet of shoreline. Most Ontario properties have 50 to 100 feet at most.”
In their design, Ms. Graham and the team rejected the clichés of Ontario cottage architecture – the wraparound decks, the chunky trusswork, the interior cladding of knotty pine. They opted, instead, for a cleaner, more sophisticated abode, but one that still feels rooted in place. The structure – called “The Birdhouse,” and inspired by the many simple birdhouses that adorn the property – is basically an elongated barn with a metal gable. It has roughly 3,000 feet of floorspace, and it runs lengthwise, linking the woodland side of the peninsula to the coastline.
This journey from shadowiness to light is the central concept around which the architecture is based. The building, clad in charred cedar, is so dark it almost disappears into the landscape. “Boaters will sometimes come right up to the dock just to get a look at the house,” Ms. Shin says. If you come correctly, though – by car, that is, as an invited guest, not surreptitiously by boat – you’ll arrive on the woodland side and enter through a covered walkway, which runs lengthwise along the house and is separated from the outdoors by slatted cedar. This pathway then delivers you into the centre of the home – a cozy vestibule, clad in white oak panels, with guest bedrooms on one side and a principal bedroom on the other.
Suddenly, constriction gives way to expansiveness. From the vestibule, an open-tread stairwell carries you down – following the topography of the landscape – to the great room on the lower floor, where wraparound windows offer panoramic views onto the lake. Sliding doors open in two directions, making the space feel more like a covered terrace than a living room. The surrounding coastline is so steep it erases the perceived middle distance between the house and the water.
That sense of proximity to the lake is perhaps the best thing about the birdhouse: it may not be a standard Kawartha vacation home, but it is as firmly situated in its environment as any place could be. True, the materials – polished concrete on the floors, blackened steel on the fireplace – aren’t typically associated with Southern Ontario cottages, but perhaps they should be. Concrete is made of stony aggregate, not too different from the granite bedrock on which Ontario sits. As for steel? It may be the most local material imaginable.
There have been steel mills in the Great Lakes region longer than there have been jet skis or motorboats.
The simple materials give the building a sense of gravitas, says Ms. Graham, in a region where vacation homes are often indecorous and loud. “We wanted to create a house that felt demure,” she explains, “because of the silence of the site. There’s a sense of majesty to the building, but it’s a quiet majesty.”
In the absence of noise, there’s still light. Ms. Shin has noticed how the morning sun entices guests to the breakfast table near the eastern windows, and then southward in the afternoon, into the main part of the living room. In the evening, the light draws out the shadows beneath the stairway risers, and it lands on the steel fireplace, lighting it up in iridescent colours.
“No matter where you’re looking, you can still feel the western sunset,” Ms. Shin says, “because it bounces off the surfaces of the home.”
“It pushes you toward the fireplaces,” Ms. Graham adds, “where you find a different kind of warmth.”

Full text: There are hundreds of thousands of rented homes that do not turn a profit for their owners, but if you’re a landlord looking to the Canadian Revenue Agency for a tax break on those losses you can expect to have to answer some tough questions on your investment.
Realtor Brian Keller has been a landlord for 23 years and after reporting losses on his 2021 tax returns relating to his rental business he received no updates until almost a year later when a sixpage questionnaire arrived in the mail.
“Provide a detailed projection of how you intend to develop your rental operation into a profitable enterprise,” the letter from CRA reads, among other things.
“I can’t believe the audacity of Revenue Canada to ask me for a business plan,” Mr. Keller said.
“And they want it in 20 days. This is almost an act of intimidation.
“I understand audit and ‘Hey, show us your expenses’ … but I’ve never had a letter from the government saying ‘provide a detailed projection.’ ” Mr. Keller has owned multiple residential rental properties in Ontario since 2000, starting with a couple of houses in the Barrie, Ont., area. While most years were profitable, from time to time he has reported and claimed losses on his taxes related to management of his rentals.
This is the first year he has received a letter of this kind.
“Those letters have been around for years and years, that’s nothing new,” said George E.
Dube, CPA, CA, who specializes in real estate taxes at the BDO Canada accounting company.
“For the most part, Revenue Canada is pretty reasonable with the rules for real estate investors.
[For example,] they will allow us to deduct the costs of interest on mortgage payments.”
According to Mr. Dube, the CRA’s main goal in asking questions like those posed to Mr. Keller is to assess what kind of business the person is actually in.
“Were you really in the business to generate rental income, or were you in the business of buying these [rentals] to sell them down the road? Did you buy the apple tree to pick the apple and sell the apple or did you buy it to cut it down for logs?” Mr. Dube said.
In other words, if your investment is a condominium where rents and expenses don’t cover your carrying costs but you are hoping for windfall profits when you sell the asset, then, from CRA’s perspective, you are a property speculator with a side hustle as a landlord.
Mr. Keller says his losses come from non-paying tenants and long delays at Ontario’s Landlord and Tenant Board that have resulted in more than $12,000 in unpaid rent.
In 2023, Statistics Canada reported that data from tax filings showed 1.35 million Canadian households reported income from rentals in 2020 and 76.3 per cent said their operations were profitable. That leaves about 320,000 individuals with rental income in the red.
A recent report from market research firm Urbanation and CIBC showed that even newly completed condominiums in the Toronto region were often unprofitable. The survey looked at 6,378 new condominiums completed in 2022 that were then rented on the local Multiple Listings Service. Of all the new units with a mortgage, only 48 per cent were making enough money to cover the costs of ownership.
About 39 per cent of the condos in the Toronto region are owned by investors who rent them out, according to Urbanation. The report says that while rental rates soared in 2022, so did mortgage rates, particularly affecting those who borrowed with a variable rate loan.
“The distribution of newly completed condo rentals by cash flow position shows that the highest concentration (14 per cent) of investors was losing $1,000 or more each month, with a one-third share of investors experiencing negative cash flow of $400 or more,” the report reads.
Mr. Dube said the CRA will often demand answers from landlords claiming losses who are also renting to a relative (on the suspicion that the losses stem from below-market rents.) But in most other cases, if a landlord can’t show they have any plans to make their units profitable, the losses will be denied.
“Why should the government of Canada or the taxpayers fund your lifestyle?,” said Mr. Dube.
He warns that it is better to avoid filing claims that are likely to later be denied.
“This starts to become a bit punitive: maybe we’re five years down the road and you’re paying back those taxes, plus some interest to Revenue Canada and other penalties.”

Multiple-unit investors are juicing the condo market: Buyers with ‘10, 20, 30 or 200 properties in their portfolio’ still eager to add more: marketer

Full text: Marketer Jacky Chan says the 60-storey luxury condo Curv tower – which begins construction in 2024 in downtown Vancouver – has been a magnet for Canada’s small but powerful contingent of multipleunit buyers.
One buyer paid a record $4,400 per square foot for one of the top-floor units, which, Mr. Chan says, is the sort of price that could revitalize the city’s downtown luxury market overall. These aren’t just any investors, he adds, but people who acquire multiple properties as part of their growing portfolios.
Curv’s starting 500-squarefoot unit is priced at $1-million.
Its 7,500-square-foot penthouse is a whopping $60-million. The penthouse works out to $8,000 per square foot.
Mr. Chan was speaking on the phone from Markham, Ont.
where Curv’s developer, Brivia Group, is also building that city’s tallest tower.
Mr. Chan, who is the chief executive officer of BakerWest Real Estate, declined to say how many of the 358 units he had sold, but he did say the number is in the triple-digits.
To put the $4,400 per square foot in perspective, within the past 12 months, new downtown condos priced more than $5-million averaged $2,390 per square foot.
Curv is being built to the energy-efficient Passive House construction standard, which is more costly that standard construction techniques. Curv’s marketers claim it will be the world’s tallest Passive House structure.
The site has undergone a series of flips, driving up the land value. Under new zoning for substantial new density, the existing two old apartment blocks were purchased by Wall Financial Corp. in 2013 for a reported $16.8million, with a plan to develop a tower. They then sold the site in January, 2016, for $60-million, a share sale to a consortium of wealthy Chinese immigrant buyers, as reported by the South China Morning Post at the time.
One month after buying it, the consortium then flipped it for $68-million. In 2021, Montreal’s Brivia Group purchased the site for an undisclosed amount.
Many of the current unit buyers are diehard investors, not just owners of a couple of properties, but seasoned investors and holders of large portfolios of properties, Mr. Chan says.
He says the federal ban on foreign buying hasn’t been the deterrent once expected. Many of Curv’s buyers hold Canadian passports.
“We have a lot of international interest and a lot of international registrations. But we thought the foreign buyer ban would be somewhat of a detriment to us.
… However, it hasn’t had much of a negative effect. We wish it wasn’t there, but then it hasn’t affected us because the local adoption has been phenomenal.”
The first round of buyers a few months ago were “friends and family,” or VIPs. In its first month on the market sales have been in the “hundreds of millions” of dollars.
Mr. Chan said a lot of other developers, and those in the real estate industry, have purchased in the building, as well as those in the tech industry.
“All these buyers that we are attracting are people that have extensive experience of owning and buying real estate … and they have maybe 10, 20, 30 or 200 properties in their portfolio,” he says.
“These are super-informed billionaires, multihundred millionaires, people that have 30 years of experience of buying and selling real estate, and not just in Canada, but globally.
“We have numerous buyers at Curv right now who have bought multiple units, so one for themselves, and another for the kids and grandkids, to buy as a family collection.”
In line with city policy, the tower includes 49 rental units and 102 below-market units. The tower will replace two older three-storey walk-up apartment buildings on Nelson Street near Thurlow Street, which are mostly vacant. The remaining tenants will be treated “very well,” Mr. Chan says. The city’s tenant relocation and protection policy means they can move into one of the new rental units that will be built, or they could take monetary compensation.
In Metro Vancouver, 15.5 per cent, or 42,155 units, out of all condos are held by portfolio investors who hold at least three properties. Of all investment condos in the region, 45.5 per cent were owned by this sort of investor, according to Statistics Canada data released last week.
Surprisingly, those high-volume condo investors are quite active in Abbotsford, B.C., a one-hour drive east from Vancouver, where 24.1 per cent, or 10,140, of all condos, are owned by portfolio investors. Out of all the investment condos in that city, 69.9 per cent are part of a portfolio that has three or more investment properties.
“While some Canadians are struggling with a housing famine, others are feasting,” says Andy Yan, director of Simon Fraser University’s City Program.
Regulators, however, are getting uneasy with the financing behind these personal portfolio properties. Long-time mortgage broker Ron Butler, based in Toronto, says the party will be ending for those old-fashioned investors who followed the longtime BRRRR practice of buy-renovate-rent-refinance-repeat. Unless they have cash to keep buying, the federal regulator has been shifting away from allowing someone to own multiple mortgaged investment properties.
“It’s something that’s been going on for the better part of a year, this narrowing down of how many rental properties that anyone can own,” he says. “The issue now is, what is the maximum? And today the philosophy from the regulator is: you can own your own home, a vacation property and five rentals through federally regulated institutions, and then that’s it. You can’t own any more,” Mr. Butler says.
“There was a policy by which you could have, theoretically, as many rentals and mortgages as your income and capacity could handle. Then the regulator said, ‘we don’t want to do this anymore,’ ” Mr. Butler says. ” ‘We don’t want a couple or one person or a family owning 25 rental properties. We aren’t comfortable with it,’ and for obvious reasons.”
Of course, an investor can still go to a private lender for financing, or get commercial financing, or they can pay with cash, he adds. Cash is still king.
“But BRRRR is going to die,” Mr. Butler says. “In Canada, it’s just going to become unmanageable because you’re not going to be able to get bank mortgages for any more than a smaller number,” he says.
BRRRR, he adds, had already been on life support owing to higher interest rates, so the new policy isn’t solely to blame.
There is more to come, he says. Regulators are now having discussions with banks about tightening mortgage rules around total lending versus income.
“That would infiltrate these rental scenarios,” he says.
John Pasalis, president of Realosophy Realty brokerage in Toronto says he is in favour of a policy that caps the number of mortgaged residential investment properties. Mr. Pasalis is a real estate analyst who’s also a frequent media commentator.
“If you want to accumulate a portfolio of houses, I mean I don’t know why you should be getting residential financing,” he says. “It is a business. I guess they are probably setting up mini REITs [Real Estate Investment Trusts] basically, right.
Most people who have 20 properties are probably not doing it in their personal names.”
Fuelling demand is the fact that prices have gone up 10 to 15 per cent since the start of the year. A lot of Ontario homeowners don’t sell their homes when they move. They simply rent them out, he says.
“Everyone sees what’s going on and how much money people are making,” he says of lucrative real estate investments. “That’s basically what is driving a lot of desire to hold real estate.
“When we think about, why aren’t there many homes for sale, well part of it is because people just don’t want to sell them. Why would you, when you’re making such a good return?” But investors are skewing the market, he says. They put pressure on prices, they affect the size of units that get built, and they also affect renters. And while some argue investors provide secondary rental, Mr. Pasalis points out that if there were more affordable homes to purchase, fewer people would need to rent. But investors drive up prices and make housing less accessible to first-time buyers.
“When you have investors competing with first-time buyers who walk in with a couple of [baby] strollers, typically the investor is going to win,” Mr. Pasalis says. “They are well capitalized. They can pay a higher price.
And this is why our home ownership rate is declining, because more and more homes are actually going into the hands of investors who rent them out, and amplifying home and amplifying condo prices. We are seeing that.”

Full text: 2662 Bloor St., W., No. 804, Toronto KINGS WAY SOUTH Asking price: $2,295,000 (March, 2023) Selling price: $2.2-million (April, 2023) Previous selling prices: $1,809,000 (January, 2018); $630,000 (February, 2004); $523,271 (November, 2002) Taxes: $6,395 (2023) Days on the market: 17 Listing agent: Motria Dzulynsky, Re/Max Professionals Inc.
THE ACTION This 1,626-square-foot corner unit with a 527-squarefoot terrace has more space inside and out than the average condominium suite around Old Mill, a historic landmark on the Humber River. Local buyers made up most of the people through on house tours and a couple with ties to the community made a $2.2-million offer to buy it.
“Those units are in high demand because there aren’t a lot of them with nice terraces and bigger units in good locations,” said agent Motria Dzulynsky, “so the buyers jumped on it.”
“There were some units in other buildings, but nothing exactly like this. Only a few come up every year with that kind of outdoor space.”
WHAT THEY GOT This two-bedroom-plus-den unit in a 20-yearold mid-rise building abutting the Old Mill subway station has an eat-in kitchen, a separate dining area, and a living room with a gas fireplace and sliding doors to a terrace with water lines.
There is an enclosed den with a balcony, and a primary bedroom with a walk-in closet and six-piece ensuite.
The unit comes with a storage locker and tandem parking spots. Monthly fees of $1,755 cover utilities, cable, 24-hour concierge and use of the indoor pool and rooftop deck.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s a nicer, luxury boutique building in the area,” Ms. Dzulynsky said. “And it’s right next to the subway, so it’s easy to get downtown.” The unit’s size was its strength. “It has a nice layout, and you can fit your furniture if you were coming from a house,” Ms. Dzulynsky said.
“It has a nice size terrace and it’s square, which is unusual because units usually have smaller balconies… so it’s like a back yard with a view.”

Mr. Chan, who is the chief executive officer of BakerWest Real Estate, declined to say how many of the 358 units he had sold, but he did say the number is in the triple-digits.
To put the $4,400 per square foot in perspective, within the past 12 months, new downtown condos priced more than $5-million averaged $2,390 per square foot.
Curv is being built to the energy-efficient Passive House construction standard, which is more costly that standard construction techniques. Curv’s marketers claim it will be the world’s tallest Passive House structure.
The site has undergone a series of flips, driving up the land value. Under new zoning for substantial new density, the existing two old apartment blocks were purchased by Wall Financial Corp. in 2013 for a reported $16.8million, with a plan to develop a tower. They then sold the site in January, 2016, for $60-million, a share sale to a consortium of wealthy Chinese immigrant buyers, as reported by the South China Morning Post at the time.
One month after buying it, the consortium then flipped it for $68-million. In 2021, Montreal’s Brivia Group purchased the site for an undisclosed amount.
Many of the current unit buyers are diehard investors, not just owners of a couple of properties, but seasoned investors and holders of large portfolios of properties, Mr. Chan says.
He says the federal ban on foreign buying hasn’t been the deterrent once expected. Many of Curv’s buyers hold Canadian passports.
“We have a lot of international interest and a lot of international registrations. But we thought the foreign buyer ban would be somewhat of a detriment to us.
… However, it hasn’t had much of a negative effect. We wish it wasn’t there, but then it hasn’t affected us because the local adoption has been phenomenal.”
The first round of buyers a few months ago were “friends and family,” or VIPs. In its first month on the market sales have been in the “hundreds of millions” of dollars.
Mr. Chan said a lot of other developers, and those in the real estate industry, have purchased in the building, as well as those in the tech industry.
“All these buyers that we are attracting are people that have extensive experience of owning and buying real estate … and they have maybe 10, 20, 30 or 200 properties in their portfolio,” he says.
“These are super-informed billionaires, multihundred millionaires, people that have 30 years of experience of buying and selling real estate, and not just in Canada, but globally.
“We have numerous buyers at Curv right now who have bought multiple units, so one for themselves, and another for the kids and grandkids, to buy as a family collection.”
In line with city policy, the tower includes 49 rental units and 102 below-market units. The tower will replace two older three-storey walk-up apartment buildings on Nelson Street near Thurlow Street, which are mostly vacant. The remaining tenants will be treated “very well,” Mr. Chan says. The city’s tenant relocation and protection policy means they can move into one of the new rental units that will be built, or they could take monetary compensation.
In Metro Vancouver, 15.5 per cent, or 42,155 units, out of all condos are held by portfolio investors who hold at least three properties. Of all investment condos in the region, 45.5 per cent were owned by this sort of investor, according to Statistics Canada data released last week.
Surprisingly, those high-volume condo investors are quite active in Abbotsford, B.C., a one-hour drive east from Vancouver, where 24.1 per cent, or 10,140, of all condos, are owned by portfolio investors. Out of all the investment condos in that city, 69.9 per cent are part of a portfolio that has three or more investment properties.
“While some Canadians are struggling with a housing famine, others are feasting,” says Andy Yan, director of Simon Fraser University’s City Program.
Regulators, however, are getting uneasy with the financing behind these personal portfolio properties. Long-time mortgage broker Ron Butler, based in Toronto, says the party will be ending for those old-fashioned investors who followed the longtime BRRRR practice of buy-renovate-rent-refinance-repeat. Unless they have cash to keep buying, the federal regulator has been shifting away from allowing someone to own multiple mortgaged investment properties.
“It’s something that’s been going on for the better part of a year, this narrowing down of how many rental properties that anyone can own,” he says. “The issue now is, what is the maximum? And today the philosophy from the regulator is: you can own your own home, a vacation property and five rentals through federally regulated institutions, and then that’s it. You can’t own any more,” Mr. Butler says.
“There was a policy by which you could have, theoretically, as many rentals and mortgages as your income and capacity could handle. Then the regulator said, ‘we don’t want to do this anymore,’ ” Mr. Butler says. ” ‘We don’t want a couple or one person or a family owning 25 rental properties. We aren’t comfortable with it,’ and for obvious reasons.”
Of course, an investor can still go to a private lender for financing, or get commercial financing, or they can pay with cash, he adds. Cash is still king.
“But BRRRR is going to die,” Mr. Butler says. “In Canada, it’s just going to become unmanageable because you’re not going to be able to get bank mortgages for any more than a smaller number,” he says.
BRRRR, he adds, had already been on life support owing to higher interest rates, so the new policy isn’t solely to blame.
There is more to come, he says. Regulators are now having discussions with banks about tightening mortgage rules around total lending versus income.
“That would infiltrate these rental scenarios,” he says.
John Pasalis, president of Realosophy Realty brokerage in Toronto says he is in favour of a policy that caps the number of mortgaged residential investment properties. Mr. Pasalis is a real estate analyst who’s also a frequent media commentator.
“If you want to accumulate a portfolio of houses, I mean I don’t know why you should be getting residential financing,” he says. “It is a business. I guess they are probably setting up mini REITs [Real Estate Investment Trusts] basically, right.
Most people who have 20 properties are probably not doing it in their personal names.”
Fuelling demand is the fact that prices have gone up 10 to 15 per cent since the start of the year. A lot of Ontario homeowners don’t sell their homes when they move. They simply rent them out, he says.
“Everyone sees what’s going on and how much money people are making,” he says of lucrative real estate investments. “That’s basically what is driving a lot of desire to hold real estate.
“When we think about, why aren’t there many homes for sale, well part of it is because people just don’t want to sell them. Why would you, when you’re making such a good return?” But investors are skewing the market, he says. They put pressure on prices, they affect the size of units that get built, and they also affect renters. And while some argue investors provide secondary rental, Mr. Pasalis points out that if there were more affordable homes to purchase, fewer people would need to rent. But investors drive up prices and make housing less accessible to first-time buyers.
“When you have investors competing with first-time buyers who walk in with a couple of [baby] strollers, typically the investor is going to win,” Mr. Pasalis says. “They are well capitalized. They can pay a higher price.
And this is why our home ownership rate is declining, because more and more homes are actually going into the hands of investors who rent them out, and amplifying home and amplifying condo prices. We are seeing that.”

Full text: Controversial self-appointed spiritual leader John de Ruiter and his wife, Leigh Ann, have put their million-dollar Edmonton home up for sale, amid mounting sexual assault allegations against the couple, and the continuing migration of Mr. de Ruiter’s dedicated followers to an isolated rural area in northern Alberta.
The house was listed last week for $1,175,000.
“The owner lovingly rebuilt this picturesque European designed bungalow from the ground up, investing over $700,000 in upgrades,” reads the listing. It describes the house as a “charming & elegant, hidden gem” that is “placed in an idyllic sanctuary-like setting” in Glenora, a tony neighbourhood along Edmonton’s river valley.
The property, which was purchased for $649,900 in 2006, is registered to Leigh Ann de Ruiter. Both Mr. and Ms. de Ruiter’s bail conditions require them to live at the Glenora property unless a new residence is approved by their bail supervisor.
The couple’s next court date is slated for July 12.
Mr. de Ruiter, 63, is currently facing seven charges of sexual assault dating back to 2012 for alleged assaults on adult women who were among his followers. Ms. de Ruiter, who is also known as Leigh Ann Angermann, is facing five charges of sexual assault in relation to the same allegations.
A former orthopedic shoemaker, Mr. de Ruiter is the core of what is sometimes known as the College of Integrated Philosophy, or the Oasis group. Billed as “the living embodiment of truth,” Mr. de Ruiter is considered by his followers to be a guru, a teacher, even a god.
A spokesperson said last year that Mr. de Ruiter has several hundred followers in Alberta, and 3,000 to 4,000 more around the world. The community around Mr. de Ruiter dates back to the early 1990s.
The group has been described as a cult. A frequently asked questions page on Mr. de Ruiter’s website denies it is.
Previously, Mr. de Ruiter’s community gathered at the Oasis Centre, a luxe venue built especially for him in west Edmonton. That property was sold to the Aga Khan Foundation for $6.7-million in late 2021.
A Globe and Mail investigation earlier this year documented the quiet relocation of Mr. de Ruiter’s followers and inner circle to the hamlet of Fort Assiniboine, around 1½ hours northwest of Edmonton.
The influx of Mr. de Ruiter’s followers from around the world buying up houses and subdividing properties has been the source of tension with some locals, who question why Mr. de Ruiter and his followers are moving into the remote area, and are concerned about the sexual assault allegations against him.
The sexual assault charges have also caused a deep rift within Mr. de Ruiter’s community of followers, with some people leaving him after years, and even decades, of devotion.
But land title documents show people from Mr. de Ruiter’s community are continuing to sell their properties in Edmonton, and buying up property in and around Fort Assiniboine.
Mr. de Ruiter’s defence lawyer, Dino Bottos, would not comment on whether Mr. de Ruiter will now be residing full-time in Fort Assiniboine.
Real estate photographs for Mr. de Ruiter’s Edmonton property note “spectacularly designed landscaping,” “top of the line appliances,” “a dreamy ensuite w/ white carrera marble + clawfoot tub,” a “stunning deck with custom-built cedar & glass privacy screen & pergola,” and an “expansive basement” with two bedrooms, “one w/ a luxury ensuite jacuzzi bath.”
The house is listed by Ayaaz Kassam, a former vegan restaurant owner who has described Mr. de Ruiter on social media as “my teacher,” and has hosted events with him. Land title documents show Mr. Kassam is among those who have purchased property in the Fort Assiniboine area.
The average price of a single detached home in Edmonton is $425,000.

Investigators focus on collapsed condo’s inception: U.S. federal probe finds building north of Miami Beach suffered from potentially catastrophic flaws from the start

Full text: Two years after the deadly collapse of a Canadian-built condominium near Miami, a U.S. federal government investigation into the cause has zeroed in on the building’s original slipshod design and construction.
While the exact role of the Toronto-based development consortium in the problems at Champlain Towers South is unclear, the probe has discovered that the condo suffered from potentially catastrophic flaws from the start.
At least one other nearby building built by the same developers, meanwhile, has had to be shored up after engineers found issues in its design and construction, too.
Champlain South, a 12-storey, L-shaped building in the town of Surfside north of Miami Beach, partly imploded at 1:22 a.m. on June 24, 2021. Ninety-eight people, including four Canadians, were killed, and dozens more left homeless.
Previously, The Globe and Mail revealed that Nathan Reiber, the late head of the Canadian consortium, had a lengthy history of fraud accusations, while both Champlain South’s architect and engineer had previously engaged in shoddy building practices.
An investigation by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has found that plans for the condo complex did not meet building code standards at the time it was built, between 1979 and 1981. In places, the concrete slab under the building’s outdoor pool deck was designed to be only half as strong as codes required at the time. Rebar in the slab was installed deeper into the concrete than it was meant to be.
This could have led to “punching shear,” in which the concrete and steel failed where the columns met the slab, causing the slab to come crashing down. According to video and eyewitness accounts, the pool deck was the first part of Champlain South to collapse, followed a few minutes later by most of the tower.
“Even absent any sudden overload or obvious initiator of a failure on that tragic night of the collapse, the condition that existed in the pool deck slab at that time represented a serious safety concern for the building,” Glenn Bell, the associate lead investigator, said in a presentation at NIST’s Washington-area headquarters this month.
A separate investigation for the town of Surfside has found evidence that construction of Champlain did not always follow plans the developers filed. Concrete slabs, for instance, appear to have sometimes been formed differently than the drawings show and some support columns seem to have been put in different places.
“There were portions of the building to be built with concrete in certain areas that weren’t built that way. There were places where some of the reinforcing steel, depending on how you read the drawings, might not have been exactly where it was supposed to be,” Allyn Kilsheimer, the engineer hired to lead the probe investigation, said in an interview.
Mr. Kilsheimer said he is still trying to determine how significant any of this was and is also looking for a proximate cause that initiated the collapse. He said he had “95 per cent” ruled out problems with the building’s foundation, an early hypothesis.
“It sat there for 40 years. So what was the trigger? That’s what we’re searching for,” he said.
One NIST investigator, Jack Moehle, said there was no evidence so far of an explosion or a car crashing into a column in the building’s parkade, two possible explanations.
A Globe report into Champlain South’s developers in 2021 showed that Mr. Reiber had repeatedly been accused of shady business practices, including defrauding partners and funnelling money out of a project before it declared bankruptcy, during a 50year real estate career in Ontario and Florida.
Champlain South’s architect, William Friedman, was accused in 1965 of failing to meet code in his design of three buildings that were damaged in a hurricane. His licence was temporarily suspended for “gross incompetence” in relation to one building. He also faced allegations of “plan stamping,” in which an architect signs off on a developer’s plans without ensuring they are sound.
The building’s engineer, Sergio Breiterman, also oversaw a potentially deadly design flaw in a parkade in Coral Gables, Fla. According to a 1976 Miami Herald article, the building’s parapet wall showed signs of failure just months after opening because it contained only half the amount of rebar it was supposed to.
Mr. Reiber and his partners, as well as Mr. Friedman and Mr. Breiterman, have all since died.
The Globe found 19 buildings in the Miami area, Toronto and London, Ont., that were built by Mr. Reiber or other Champlain South partners.
In one of these, Champlain Towers North, Mr. Kilsheimer said he uncovered problems that had to be fixed. Mr. Friedman and Mr. Breiterman worked on that building, too.
“There were some things we found in the original design and construction that needed to have remediations done to bring them up to the current code. Column locations were different than in the drawings,” he said.
Mr. Kilsheimer declined to specify what exactly had to be done at the building, which was completed a year after Champlain South and looks almost identical.
Last year, the local CBS affiliate reported that Champlain North had installed steel braces to shore up columns on several floors, including the parkade.
Whether the problems at either building can be directly traced to the Canadian consortium may never be known. NIST spokeswoman Jennifer Huergo said her agency is only investigating the “technical cause of the collapse” and “it is not in our jurisdiction to determine who might have been at fault.”
At the time Champlain South was constructed, Mr. Kilsheimer said, the process usually involved developers negotiating a price they would pay their contractors, who then made decisions on specific details.
“I don’t think any of us will know how that happened on this job with the developers,” he said.
“They’re all gone and there are no paper records we can find that talk about any of that.”

Street smart: With a mix of fresh hope, affordable rent and creative gusto, Toronto’s Dupont strip is buzzing with style while keeping a local flavour, writes Josh Greenblatt

Full text: When Erin Stump closed her gallery on Dupont Street in Toronto’s Junction Triangle neighbourhood in November, 2022, she sought a replacement tenant who was equally committed to using the space to unite the local artistic community. It turned out her friend Lee Dekel, an Israeliborn fashion designer who owns the boutique 100% Silk, was looking to expand from her tiny storefront on Queen Street West, a neighbourhood known for its bustling retail atmosphere.
It was important for Stump – who has been at the forefront of the Junction Triangle’s thriving art scene for the past decade – to find a creative and independent business to take over the space. 100% Silk, which carries the work of global, independent designers making the kind of handmade, textile-driven clothes that appeal to the city’s more creative residents, fit the bill.
The storefront also seemed destined for Dekel: It used to be tailoring shop run by a Jewish family, and she could use the bigger space as a studio.
By supporting independent businesses, locals-turned-landlords such as Erin Stump help maintain the community feel of a neighbourhood in flux. Despite the surrounding development, the Junction Triangle has remained dedicated to serving its diverse swath of residents.
The 500-metre strip of Dupont Street between Symington Avenue and the West Toronto Railpath is the main thoroughfare of the Junction Triangle neighbourhood, a residential region about 25-minutes drive northwest of downtown and bound by railways on three sides, hence its geometric moniker.
About a decade ago, the gentrification around Bloor Street and Lansdowne Avenue trickled northward to the Dupont strip, where a thriving art scene developed as artists and gallerists were priced out of downtown cultural hubs like West Queen West.
Slowly, independent art galleries, coffee shops and local restaurants began popping up. Sterling Road just south of Bloor Street was redeveloped to include the new Museum of Contemporary Art. Condo and housing developments were built, drawing in young families and professionals.
“Businesses looking for more affordable rents started moving to that Dupont strip early and this really helped motivate buyers to move into that area,” says John Pasalis, the president of Toronto brokerage Realosophy.
Real estate trends and insights generally group in the Junction Triangle with its wealthier and more developed next-door neighbour, the Junction. It’s clear, though, that both residential and commercial rents have skyrocketed in the past decade – like everywhere else in Toronto.
Despite these shifts, 100% Silk is one of several independent shops and restaurants that have set up shop on the Dupont strip within the past year, joining neighbourhood mainstays including Mattachioni, Farmhouse Tavern, and Cafe Con Leche, helping foster a bustling high street and local community.
Residents and business owners are determined to keep this strip for locals, by locals, in hope to maintain the perfect balance of community, affordability and artistry. It’s a balance that neighbourhoods like West Queen West haven’t been able to maintain. That downtown street once boasted the highest concentration of art galleries in North America, earning it the designation of the city’s Arts + Design District. But nine years since Vogue named West Queen West the second coolest street in the world, only a quarter of the galleries are still standing.
In the Dupont Strip of the Junction Triangle, however, treasured neighbourhood establishments are still thriving. Dotty’s is one. Chef and owner Jay Carter and his business partner Susan Beckett opened the walk-in only restaurant in August, 2022, and it immediately became a local favourite largely through word-of-mouth.
Carter and Beckett decided to open up Dotty’s after closing the beloved Dandylion on Queen Street West in 2021, a stone’s throw away from 100% Silk’s original location. After seven years with Dandylion, Carter realized his vision for an elegant dining experience may not jive on a street that needs to be power-washed every Sunday morning. “I wanted an adult restaurant in a neighbourhood that was frequented in the evening by kids having a great time,” he says, referencing the party scene of Queen Street West.
But Carter and Beckett cite another reason for closing Dandylion that’s all too common in Toronto: a hulking new development across the street would not only shutter their favourite coffee shop but block all the sunlight that once streamed through the restaurant’s dramatic factorystyle windows.
It’s not just the accessible street parking and quieter evenings that drew them northward to the Junction Triangle. Queen West became unrecognizable, and the independent institutions that once defined the neighbourhood’s spirit were changing.
The Gladstone was bought by a new group; the Drake was expanding. “Everything felt like it was shifting,” says Beckett.
Next year, Beckett and Carter are opening up a second restaurant two minutes away from Dotty’s. Their business partners, Jay Fernandes and Dan Armstrong, befriended Beckett and Carter as customers at Dandylion. They live across the street from Dotty’s. “We were seeing too much gentrification happen in certain areas of the city,” says Fernandes of chain restaurants replacing local haunts in historically diverse neighbourhoods such as Parkdale. He hopes that ensuring the survival of independent businesses will attract the kinds of residents who value them.
Shawn Micallef, the co-founder of Spacing magazine, agrees. “Right now, when you walk along that street, it is everything I love about the city,” he says. “You don’t know what you’re going to get. Maybe you’ll get a Domino’s chain, but you might get all these kinds of indie businesses, or you might get these really old businesses, or an old ethnic social club and it all kind of exists in the same spot, and that’s sort of, like, the magic of cities.”
Inez Genereux, 100% Silk’s manager, says the Dupont strip reminds her of the community feel of the store’s original location where local business owners were friendly with each other. She remembers the owner of a nearby convenience store bringing gifts to the opening party on Queen West. “Then I think, like, six months later, the convenience store got torn down and this awful condo went up,” she says, referring to the building that blocked Dandylion’s light. The Junction Triangle gives her hope. “The plaza here, it gives me so much love and life just being like, yay, maybe someone from there will come and check out the store.”
In said plaza is ALMA+GIL, a self-funded, tiny cafe and take-away counter with a side patio hawking tasty breakfast sandwiches. Chef Gerry Quintero and his longtime partner Mandy Sou opened their permanent location last year after opening pop-ups around the city. “It’s developing to be, like, a foodie hub kind of area,” Quintero says of the Junction Triangle. Quintero also says there’s a convivial vibe with neighbours, including Souvlaki Emporium and Stay Home, the vintage furniture shop.
Micallef says that there hasn’t been an overwhelming amount of condo development in the immediate area pushing small businesses out. He also has nuanced views about how development contributes to gentrification. Condos don’t always spell death for small businesses; after all, people need places to live in the city. But big buildings do often draw big retailers, banks and fast-food chains that can afford the larger, more expensive spaces that condos offer, shuttering the sandwich shop or clothing boutique.
A balance of businesses that serve all residents of a neighbourhood – not just a socioeconomic slice – keeps a city equitable and interesting. “Can everyone in the neighbourhood find something for them on that strip?” Micallef asks. “These early moments of a neighbourhood changing, when there’s that mix of everything, are the ideal if we could freeze it.” For more on Canada’s coolest neighbourhoods, visit tgam.ca/hiphoods

Full text: Despite being a little unsteady on his feet in his 93rd year, retired architect Stan Heinonen rises periodically from his chair to pick a photograph from the pile for closer examination. And just as many times his daughter, former landscape architect Sara Heinonen, quietly urges him to sit back down.
But Mr. Heinonen’s passion for the work he produced for 40-plus years is palpable, and soon our little group is standing and sifting, oohing and aahing, and sharing favourites. Many of the photographs that strike this writer come from Mr. Heinonen’s early years with Gordon S. Adamson & Associates, a firm that switched to the International Style in the 1940s – Mr. Adamson (1904-1986) designed the 1944 Hobbs “Sun House” in Rosedale, which was recently demolished – and eagerly employed the Eric Arthurtrained modernists coming out of the University of Toronto in the immediate postwar years.
Mr. Heinonen graduated with honours in 1954 (Raymond Moriyama was a classmate) and, after a few months with Irving Boigon (a 1951 graduate), went to work at Adamson, where he would remain until 1959.
By the baby booming late-1950s, and just like competitors John B. Parkin Associates and Peter Dickinson Associates, Adamson was racking up commissions for schools, churches, hospitals and community centres. After working on a few boxyyet-modern industrial buildings (one being the 1957 Honeywell complex at 740 Ellesmere Rd., now demolished), young Stan got to flex his creative muscles at University Settlement Community Centre (23 Grange Rd.). Even more than 60 years later, the crisp, white geometry of the main building and the bold, folded plate concrete roof over the pool stand in stark contrast to the greenery of Grange Park. But, at two storeys, the complex doesn’t lord over or overwhelm park visitors.
“The roof wasn’t just a stunt,” Mr. Heinonen explains. “Being a swimming pool, if you use any kind of steel there’s corrosion, and this [also] did away with columns; Peter Dickinson had just done that down at the Exhibition [with the Queen Elizabeth Building].” Inside, ceiling lights that Mr. Heinonen designed – made with waterproof porcelain enamel – fold snugly into each bend.
The work didn’t change much when Mr. Heinonen moved to again join the very active Irving Boigon (in the 1970s Boigon served as president of the Ontario Association of Architects and the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada). During his 13 years there he’d fully or partially work on 13 institutional/commercial buildings, 26 schools and 12 large-scale housing projects.
Described as a “ground-breaking” public housing commission on the City of Toronto’s website, the Robert J. Smith Apartments in Etobicoke were being finished around the same time the firm changed its name to Boigon and Heinonen Architects. The complex represented “a shift in thinking” as it no longer regarded seniors as fringe members of society and incorporated communal dining rooms and recreation areas. Even its architecture was lively: the trio of buildings dance around the verdant site, the round building taking the lead by facing Kendleton Drive; balconies thrust forward rhythmically; and wide, clever sunshades swirl over a sunken courtyard. And other than blue balcony railings on one building, it all looks just as good today as it did then.
Smaller projects, such as the Aurora Public Library (1963, demolished 2018) or the Simcoe County Museum (1962, still standing but altered) show Mr. Heinonen’s mastery of warm, domestic-scale modernism. Structure is expressed – emphasized even – on the outside of each building, allowing opaque walls of fieldstone or brick to ‘float,’ while fully glazed walls practically disappear. The Aurora building featured a semi-sheltered courtyard that gave library patrons a view of plants and trees. Both call to mind Mies van der Rohe’s Farnsworth House, although Mr. Heinonen says the Manhattanbased Ieoh Ming Pei was more of an influence.
Moving to a much larger scale, Mr. Heinonen is justifiably proud of his work on the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) headquarters, which the firm began planning in 1966 (it opened in 1971). The new suburban campus at 4905 Dufferin St. would contain offices, warehousing facilities, classrooms, a lecture theatre, cafeteria and, of course, scientific facilities such as observation domes and a wind tunnel.
“They actually released weather balloons for a while but that didn’t last long,” Mr. Heinonen says.
Today known as Environment Canada, most Torontonians use Ron Baird’s 33.5-metre high metal sculpture – one of the tallest metal sculptures in North America – as the local wayfinding tool.
A short drive south is the North York Centennial Centre (opened 1966, now Herbert H.
Carnegie Centennial Centre), a rakish, debonair, undulating, four-sided building that’s handsome from any angle – even the shipping/receiving side is stepped like the front façade and just as crisply detailed. “The whole idea was that it was multipurpose, and it could have a stage, and I think right after it was built they held the Miss Canada pageant.”
Before Mr. Heinonen ended his relationship with Boigon to become the Ontario regional architect at Public Works Canada, he designed Scarborough’s towering and Brutalist Adanac Aparments (opened in 1972, Adanac is Canada backwards). Despite 16-storeys of concrete, lightness is achieved by breaking the building into two ‘separate’ structures joined by a recessed, glazed middle section.
At Public Works, where the Toronto-born Mr. Heinonen would spend 22 years, an architectural cornucopia was on offer. “We did all kinds of things,” he remembers. “I didn’t do very many buildings on my own, but I did some, we did most of [the work] with consultants.” For instance, he remembers asking fellow U of T grad Jerome Markson to design three different sizes of post office while Mr. Heinonen and his team developed standards for their interiors. And, based on his experiences with Environment Canada, he designed a smaller facility for them “out in the bush” near Egbert, Ont. in the 1980s.
Most of the pile sorted through – and apologies there isn’t room to cover all of it here – and with Mr. Heinonen’s voice hoarse from this writer’s barrage of questions, one peculiar late-1980s document catches the eye: “Tempo,” an internal publication for Public Works Employees, and an article titled “Stan Heinonen ties one.”
In it, the unnamed author describes the architect’s penchant for neckwear, from bowties to colourful Marimekko numbers picked up in the swingin’ sixties.
And while the piece goes on to mention that Mr. Heinonen was instrumental getting computer aided design (CAD) into Public Works – “the first to use CAD computers in the city” – Mr. Heinonen interrupts the conversation to bring us over to his closet.
There, the collection of ties still hangs proudly. Some worn around the edges from being favourites, some almost pristine.
Some conservative, some bold and brash. And a few good ones, sadly, just a memory.
Just like Mr. Heinonen’s wonderful buildings.

Rate-hike uncertainty muddies real estate market outlook: The Bank of Canada’s recent 25-basis-point bump may be small, but it is having a psychological effect

Full text: Listings for houses for sale are trickling into Toronto-area neighbourhoods as real estate prices recover, but an air of restraint is settling over the market.
Andre Kutyan, broker with Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd., has noticed a hesitation among buyers since the Bank of Canada raised a key interest rate in early June.
While the rate hike of 25 basis points is small, the psychological effect is greater than the financial impact, he says.
Some potential buyers are also waiting to see if the central bank will tack on another increase at the next meeting of policy makers in July.
“I think buyers anticipate another rate hike will soften prices more.”
On the day the policy makers were scheduled to meet, no buyers scheduled appointments to view his new listing for a detached house in Bedford Park until late afternoon.
“There was not a single showing Wednesday morning when everyone was glued to their TV or their phone to see what’s going on,” he says.
Mr. Kutyan listed the house with an attention-grabbing price of $1.995-million. He set a date for reviewing offers and expected the property to sell above asking because the neighbourhood has highly ranked schools that draw families.
Three buyers submitted bids for the three-bedroom house at 87 Glengarry Ave., which sold for $2.41-million.
While the sellers sold for a premium, Mr. Kutyan says the action was less intense compared with previous weeks.
“All of a sudden, there’s a change,” he says of the current mood.
Photographers, stagers and home inspectors are less busy, he says, as buyers tread carefully.
“They’ll wait and see what happens with the rates,” he says.
Some homeowners were encouraged to list in late May and early June by tales of improving prices, he says, with a rush of new properties coming on after the Victoria Day weekend.
But he points out that sellers who were holding out for a rebound in prices may not be further ahead if they need to purchase another property because it’s likely that will have risen as well.
Mr. Kutyan says the spring market was sluggish to begin with and he expected that late start to keep momentum going through the summer.
“Now I’m second-guessing that.”
The recovery in house prices in Canada will likely continue for the rest of 2023, although the gains may come at a slower clip, predicts Olivia Cross, assistant economist at Capital Economics.
Ms. Cross expects higher interest rates and economic weakness to weigh on real estate, but the drop that pulled the composite house price index of the Canadian Real Estate Association down 15 per cent from peak to trough is likely in the past, she says.
The turnaround in the housing market is a big concern for the Bank of Canada, Ms. Cross says, because rising house prices feed directly into shelter prices and will quickly put upward pressure on inflation.
Capital Economics is forecasting that the Bank of Canada will hike its benchmark rate by 25 basis points in July, which would bring the policy rate to 5 per cent.
Ms. Cross doesn’t expect another increase to stamp out the recovery in house prices. Most buyers taking out a mortgage will likely opt for a fixed rate, and the rise may be more moderate than the increase in variable rates, she adds.
On a national level, home sales in May jumped 5.1 per cent from April, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association. Sales rose in about 70 per cent of local markets, CREA says, including the Greater Toronto Area, Montreal, Greater Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa.
The laggards included Hamilton; Guelph, Ont.; and Windsor, Ont.
Compared with May, 2022, national sales edged up 1.4 per cent.
While the increase was tiny, it marks the first time since June, 2021, that sales increased on a year-over-year basis, CREA notes.
CREA senior economist Shaun Cathcart points out that one puzzle in the market this year has been the reluctance amongst existing homeowners to take advantage of the slower market to make a move to a different property. Mr. Cathcart says many owners don’t want to mess with the ultra-low mortgage rates they locked in during the pandemic.
New supply was still running at historically low levels in May, he says, and that in turn is likely pushing up prices more quickly than expected.
The national average home price stood at $729,000 in May to mark a 3.2-per-cent rise from May, 2022, and the first year-over-year gain in 12 months.
Bank of Nova Scotia economist Farah Omran says the magnitude and speed of the recovery in national sales points to resiliency and strong household finances, but it also poses additional challenges for the Bank of Canada as it tries to slow down the economy and bring inflation back to its 2per-cent target.
The continued strength in May suggests real estate may stop being the drag on growth it had been for much of the past year, she adds. The May data may have contributed to the central bank’s latest decision to hike but the impact of that move will take time to show up in the numbers, she adds.
Ms. Omran says the central bank’s hike lifted borrowing costs directly for those with variablerate mortgages but also indirectly for those taking out mortgages with fixed rates because those were also pushed higher by the bond market after the announcement.
The central bank also signalled that its pause in increasing rates may be over, which in turn may thwart speculative buying by people who have been counting on rates stabilizing and declining sooner than is currently the case, she says.
The combination will help slow down the reheating in the housing market, which the economist believes is necessary.
“The bank can ill afford to have the most rate-sensitive part of the economy roar back,” she says, pointing out its aim of slowing growth and bringing inflation back to target.

Full text: An uninhabited Nova Scotia island remains for sale with an asking price of $13.49million after failing to find a buyer in live bidding at Sotheby’s New York auction house.
Vollebak Island is an unusual offering in luxury real estate.
The 11-acre property off the coast of West Jeddore described as “a forest, six coves and a local eagle,” according to its current owners, also comes with “a visionary concept for the future of habitation.”
The island, officially known as Leeder Island to local recordkeepers, provides seclusion and raw natural beauty but no buildings.
Included in the sale are plans for dwellings and supporting structures designed by the Danish starchitect Bjarke Ingels of Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG).
Twin brothers and entrepreneurs Nick and Steve Tidball purchased the island in April, 2021, through London-based Vollebak, the company they founded in 2015.
The clothing brand that started with relaxation hoodies and moved into planning for life on Mars markets the concept of a compound on the island as “radical, utopian and visionary.”
The plans envision a self-sufficient and carbon-neutral cluster of shelters and buildings such as a greenhouse for growing the island’s food and a bathhouse carved from rock.
The idea is to eventually scale the concept to villages, towns, cities, countries or the entire planet, the founders say.
Bidding for the property opened online with Sotheby’s Concierge Auctions on June 8, then culminated with a live auction in New York on June 14.
Sotheby’s has not disclosed whether any registered bidders submitted bids online or in person.
Scott Bryant, regional director in the Atlantic provinces for Sotheby’s International Realty Canada, says the property has received considerable interest from prospective buyers, but the reserve has not yet been met.
It remains listed for sale with Mr. Bryant and broker Angie Bryant of SIRC.

A home so special they’re selling tickets to get a glimpse: Arthur Erickson’s Smith House II in West Vancouver said to be at the epicentre of contemporary architectural thinking

Full text: When $500 tickets went on sale to get a rare glimpse inside Arthur Erickson’s Smith House II in West Vancouver, they were snapped up so quickly that the organizers had to add extra tours. Those tickets have also been snapped up, part of a fundraiser for the Arthur Erickson Foundation.
Erickson, who died in 2009, is Canada’s most-famous architect, the designer of Vancouver’s Museum of Anthropology, Simon Fraser University, the Roy Thomson Hall in Toronto, the San Diego Convention Center and other international landmarks. But early on in his career, the Vancouver architect designed many homes, too, including Smith House II, the second home he designed for celebrated artist Gordon Smith and his artist wife, Marion, in 1964. Mr. Smith died three years ago, at 100, but the prolific artist had continued to paint in his studio building on the property almost until the end.
The event this weekend is one of the rare times that some of the public will get to see inside the home, which recently underwent a sensitive restoration by Vancouver architect Clinton Cuddington, an Arthur Erickson Foundation board member.
“It’s a special chance to get a glimpse of this building, because it’s the epicentre of a lot of contemporary thought for architects, and an essential house that communicates the importance of the blur between a building and nature,” Mr. Cuddington says, standing at the entrance to the house one drizzly morning last week, while doing a dry run of the tour.
Artist and author Douglas Coupland, who lives nearby, and was a long-time friend of Mr. Smith’s, has offered up a side tour of his own Ron Thom house as part of the fundraiser.
“Erickson is a national and international architect and this building proves his residential propositions were no way local provincialism,” says Mr. Cuddington, who worked on the project with architect Piers Cunnington.
“They were serious propositions to help feed the world in the same way that [Richard] Neutra did, or Frank Lloyd Wright. This house is the pinnacle.”
The desire to see inside the house is strong. At another fundraising event for the separate Gordon and Marion Smith Foundation, which offers youth programs in the arts, someone bid $12,000 for a private tour of the home.
“It just shows there is a demand to see the house,” says former Vancouver Art Gallery chief curator Daina Augaitis, who, along with partner Andy Sylvester, Equinox Galleries owner, became stewards of the house after Mr. Smith left it to them. Gordon and Marion, a textile artist, never had children and Ms. Augaitis and Mr. Sylvester were close friends.
Because Mr. Smith died during COVID, and didn’t have a funeral, these fundraisers act like a celebration of life for the popular West Vancouver resident, she says.
The house is off Marine Drive, near Lighthouse Park, on an acre of land, with a view of the ocean through a mature forest. The new owners have only lived in the house for a year, after they spent the previous year doing needed repairs to the roof, the floors and some updates to the kitchen and laundry room. Ms. Augaitis declined to say how much they’ve spent.
Mr. Cuddington knows it’s a formidable task, doing updates to one of Erickson’s most-famous houses.
He was, he says, “absolutely terrified” at the undertaking.
But technology has advanced, and building systems have improved. To continue to use outmoded techniques would be a disservice to the building, which is a home – not a museum, he says.
And Mr. Smith did adjustments to the house to suit his needs over the years. Mr. Erickson had designed an art studio inside the house with beautiful, but impractical, white floors, which didn’t make sense for a painter. So Mr. Smith installed brown tiles instead. (Later, he had a separate studio building built by the driveway).
But when he painted the cedarclad house a deep forest green, Mr. Erickson was so upset that he didn’t speak to him for a couple of years. To this day, Erickson purists are irritated by the change. The house has substantial exposed wood beams and trims throughout its interior, but the exterior wood took constant work to preserve. As he got older, Mr. Smith simply didn’t want to deal with it.
Neither do the new owners, and Mr. Cuddington respects that.
They’ve also kept the grab rails that were placed around the house, a practical homage to Mr. Smith.
“To lock it in time is undermining these buildings,” Mr. Cuddington says. “Everything needs to carry on. We can’t let things sit as hollow monuments.” Ms. Augaitis concurs. She didn’t want to become a “slave to the house,” especially if she’s living in it. While it’s still filled with Mr. Smith’s furniture and collectibles, eventually they will introduce more of their own pieces, she says. Being a curator, she’s carefully curated the house to fit the context, including an Indigenous artwork near the entrance and a large piece by Mr. Smith in the corridor.
“If people don’t live in them then the leaks will come and nobody will notice it for two weeks and then the damage really starts happening,” she says, standing in the living room, which still has Mr. Smith’s worn leather couch. “So you have to live, and you have to live in the 21st century, and what accommodations do you make for that?” That said, she went to some trouble to find the right burlap to match the walls, which are covered throughout in burlap that has been painted white. The lightly renovated kitchen is only slightly larger, and the grey counters and green cabinets are in keeping with the overall mood.
They barely touched the large white tiled bathroom, except to paint the cabinets. As for the garden, she’s cleared out the overgrown laurels and overhauled it, with the help of architect Liana Sipelis. Mr. Smith, who was in a wheelchair in his last years, wasn’t able to keep on top of the landscaping.
The house is a series of flatroofed pavilions stacked on a rocky outcropping, positioned around a courtyard, with a nod to Japanese minimalism. It’s a small house, about 2,300 square feet, but because of the extensive glazing throughout, and the landscape that surrounds it, it feels large.
The pond used to be filled with koi fish until sea otters kept feeding on them. But Ms. Augaitis has seen a bear come by for a drink.
The Erickson-designed landscape is as much a part of the design as the house, which was the guiding principle for mid-century modern houses especially on the West Coast.
West Vancouver was a draw for architects of that era for a reason: land was still affordable and offered up nature at its most idyllic.
The hills and rocky outcroppings just pushed them to get more creative with their designs. It was common for artists such as the Smiths to commission architect friends to design their homes.
Sadly, a lot of the houses have been lost because of redevelopment, and nobody knows the number of Ericksons that have come down.
The Smith House is surviving because the owners understand its provenance, Mr. Cuddington says. Without that understanding, there’d be little chance of survival because homebuyers tend to value square footage over design and landscape.
Three years ago, one of Mr. Erickson’s very first house designs, the Filberg House in Comox, on Vancouver Island, sold for around $2.75-million. Surprisingly, the house, originally one bedroom but later expanded to four, with spectacular waterfront views has survived, but fans have concerns about its future. Like a lot of the Erickson homes, it’s small.
But small was the idea, and it’s something that needs to be celebrated again, Mr. Cuddington says. Mr. Erickson himself lived in a 500-square-foot home, he says.
“There’s a lot to learn here about how to make small,” says Mr. Cuddington, who says he takes lessons from unique projects and applies them to smaller scale projects on the east side of Vancouver.
“I’m working on projects where we’re trying to figure out how to break a single site into three sites to put in 2,000-squarefoot-and-under duplexes, so we can keep people living in their communities and not in cars commuting to work. We are looking at the lessons of these places,” he says.
“I’ve never been one to think of these houses as curiosities that are separate from the way people live their daily lives. Our firm is built on the idea of working with cost-per-square-foot bandwidth.”
Adds Ms. Augaitis: “I’m glad you talk about the duplex you’re working on in East Vancouver because these houses weren’t built for the wealthy.
“These were middle-class people, and they were able to use fundamental, rudimentary local materials to build these houses for not an extraordinary amount of money. They have a modesty about them.”

Full text: Canada’s housing market continued to heat up in May, as both sales and the number of new listings rose in many cities.
National home sales climbed 5.1 per cent from April to May, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA). The national home price index rose 2.1 per cent to $736,000 – the third consecutive monthly increase this year, but still down 8.7 per cent from May, 2022.
“The rebound has been evident for a number of months at this point, but May really drove the point home with year-overyear comparisons for both national sales activity and national average home price back in positive territory,” CREA chair Larry Cerqua said in a statement. “That being said, the degree to which a recovery will be able to play out on the sales side as opposed to the price side will come down to supply, which remains quite low.”
The number of new properties on the market rose 6.8 per cent month-over-month, but supply remains historically low.
Buyers rushed to the market this spring after the Bank of Canada paused rate hikes in January, sparking hopes of lower mortgage costs. However, the central bank resumed its campaign to tighten monetary policy by raising the policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.75 per cent last week.
Sales were up in 70 per cent of local markets, including the Greater Toronto Area, Montreal, Greater Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa, according to a statement released Thursday by CREA.
Ontario cities led the increase in home prices in May. In the Kitchener-Waterloo region, the index rose 3.6 per cent. In Mississauga it was up 3.3 per cent and climbed 3.1 per cent in the GTA. Meanwhile, in British Columbia, the index climbed 1.4 per cent in Greater Vancouver, 0.7 per cent in Victoria and 1.1 per cent on Vancouver Island.
The sales-to-listings ratio in May was 67.9 per cent, down slightly from 69 per cent in April.
A higher ratio indicates a seller’s market, and CREA said the longterm average is 55 per cent.
“The 2023 housing puzzle piece that was less obvious was the reluctance of existing owners to take advantage of a slower market to make a move because they don’t want to mess with the ultralow fixed rates they locked in during the COVID-19 pandemic,” CREA senior economist Shaun Cathcart said in the release. “Without existing owners supplying the market with new listings, this housing demand rebound may play out more acutely than might have been expected on the price side this year.”
Toni Martins, a realtor serving clients in the GTA, said that while business returned to normal in March, with homes getting multiple offers, he thinks the recent interest-rate hike by the Bank of Canada will push homebuyers to the sidelines again.
“We were getting around 50 to 60 showings in a well-priced property. Right now we’re getting 30,” he said. “On the other hand, we still have those people in the market that have the [mortgage] preapproval for 120 days … those people are still buying.”
Mr. Martins said many of the first-time homebuyers he’s been working with have household incomes between $180,000 and $240,000.
Bank of Montreal senior economist Robert Kavcic said in a note that, just as the market picked up in March after the central bank’s rate pause, he expects activity to slow after last week’s decision.
“It stands to reason that the bank’s latest 25 basis-point rate hike will again dampen market psychology somewhat and take some steam out of recent activity,” he said.
Mr. Kavcic told The Globe and Mail that he thinks the housing market “really did play a factor in them actually raising rates at the last meeting.
“And if we continue to see this momentum, they will probably move again.”

A sleek modern home that cozies up to nature: House set well back from the road designed for owners who love being outdoors

Full text: 662 Harvest Rd.
H A M I LTO N Asking price: $2,999,000 Taxes: $5,072.65 (2022) Lot size: 82 by 482 feet Listing agent: Stella McCollum, Broker, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada THE BACKSTORY If the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Hamilton is smokestacks, steelworks or maybe a giant bridge that flies over the harbour, think again.
As locals know, Hamilton has many faces: the historic downtown core, the beginnings of urban intensifying on the waterfront, McMaster’s leafy campus and surrounding suburbs, the stunning views of “The Mountain,” and if you’re outdoorsy you might know about the many hiking trails near Mineral Springs, Canterbury Falls, Dundas Valley Conservation Area and the Christie Lake Conservation Area.
The latter is the Hamilton that Joanne Kennedy and Bruce Squires got to know when they moved with their three children to Steeltown in 2019. When Mr. Squires took on a new role as president of the McMaster Children’s Hospital, the couple decided to rent for a year to figure out where they wanted to live long term.
“We couldn’t find what we wanted,” said Ms. Kennedy, who was in charge of the house hunt.
“Bruce is the type of guy who’d live out of a cardboard box and be happy, he’s an easy to please guy.”
As the COVID pandemic gripped the city the family spent more and more time outdoors, the pieces began to fall into place.
“I fell in love with this area near Christie Lake,” said Ms. Kennedy, and it got her thinking about the renovations they did at their previous home in Ottawa. “Some people get very stressed – but I actually really enjoyed it! It’s almost a hobby. This piece of land came up for sale, and I said, maybe we should just build something?” They brought in architect Joel Tanner and his firm SMPL Design Studio, which has made a name for itself building “gnarly” (his own words) modernist homes in the region. The couple had one focus – they wanted a home that felt like they were living in nature.
Mr. Squires turned the vision for the house over to Ms. Kennedy, who was on site at least once a week during the 12-month build, but he had one additional ask.
“I really wanted to have a great garage,” he said. And no, it’s not because the health care leader is a secret grease monkey or woodworking enthusiast. He’s just outdoorsy. “I wanted something easy to keep nice and clean and not feel cluttered. They set the garage up with a nice clean blue epoxy floor with custom overhead shelving, nice high-end custom tool cabinets, track-based hanging for tools and equipment.”
There’s even a special area built to store kayaks.
The adjoining mud room is also designed to support the mission of outdoor adventures with deep shelving and cubbies for winter wear and other gear; something they became acutely aware of the need for in their old house in downtown Ottawa where kid’s stuff was scattered around the house.
THE HOUSE TODAY Sitting 300 feet back from the main road you’d be forgiven for thinking it was an industrial building with its dark exterior and deceptively simple rectilinear profile. A blank brick wall of the garage (the door for which is on the side closest to the main entrance) practically shouts “nothing to see here.”
The only hint that an open and light-filled home hides behind that dark exterior is the twostorey glass atrium for the floating staircase that’s next to the front door (tucked behind the garage).
Stepping into the house you’re welcomed by an open flame fire feature set into a square passthrough that looks into the kitchen and living room. Glass railed stairs head down to your immediate right, and entrance to the mud room/pantry that connects to the garage and main-floor powder room is on your left.
This space is filled with elements that play off each other: The wide-plank oak floors have a warm nutty stain that transition to slightly darker walnut cabinets under the countertops in the kitchen. The slab/ledge of the floating fireplace is black as is the fridge-concealing cabinet and the range hood and the black extends around the room in the trim of the window wall that covers twothirds of the combined kitchen and living room space. Otherwise, walls and ceiling are plain white with some more walnut accents in the living room furnishings and outdoor panelling on covered portions of the rear patio (accessible by a huge floor-toceiling sliding wall behind living room). The eat-in kitchen is lightcoloured where the built-in banquet connects to the walls but is balanced by a chunky black table and chairs.
“I wanted a really big kitchen with a long island where everyone can gather and I can cook,” said Ms. Kennedy. Best of all, the adjoining pantry with more walnut shelving allows this functioning kitchen to need no upper cabinets and makes it easy to keep this open space clean and uncluttered when they have guests over.
“We can tuck everything away, put all the dishes away and shut the door.”
The walls of windows perform two functions: draw nature in and provide sightlines to important elements of the home.
“No matter where you are in the house you can always feel you’re on top of the escarpment in this really natural environment,” said Mr. Squires. And in terms of safety with three kids at home, the kitchen looks down a hill to the pool. “I wanted to make sure when we built it, I could see the pool from everywhere in the kitchen,” Ms. Kennedy said.
The mud room – a gorgeous space with curving slats of walnut panelling – and whimsical goldfish-themed powder room are also accessible from the pantry.
Upstairs the oak planks continue and there are more floor-toceiling windows with black trim, but there’s also a bit more colour on walls: one child’s room in a rich green, a light lavender in the other, some greenish tile and brass fittings in the Jack-and-Jill ensuite between the two. The primary suite remains white walled with some dark textured tiles in ensuite shower-surround with matte black fittings and hardware. The primary suite also has walkout to a large balcony overlooking the rear of the property.
The fourth bedroom is in the basement, which is well lit thanks to deep window wells. This level also features a den/recreation room next to a glassed-in gym and yoga studio and a full bath with dramatic black subway tile.
THE GREAT OUTDOORS Behind the kitchen is a very handsome outdoor patio eating space and barbecue area, but off the side of the house and down the hill – the long staircase has plenty of broad landings to break up the trek – is the new heated pool.
The pool has black railings on the sides facing the house and a wooden wall on the sides facing the escarpment and neighbours and is surrounded by trees. Perhaps the most dramatic view of the house is also found from the pool deck: look up you can see all those windows and the light flooding out. Unlike the view from the street this side of the house says “Look at me!”
The one unfinished job? Turning the pool shed into a full-on cabana. It’s wired and plumbed for electricity, water and gas and the couple had grand plans for an outdoor bar and lounge. Other opportunities beckon though, and this professional couple hopes to be on the move again soon so the next owner can make the call on adding a cabana or guest house to this woodsy oasis.

Redevelopment of Birch Cliff Quarry offers contrast to Toronto’s push for higher density: Housing advocates say the project is a missed opportunity for affordability through higher density

Full text: THE LISTING Anew development on formerly city-owned land in Toronto offers a stark contrast to the local government’s evolving approach to affordability, amid a push for density and a mayoral by-election in which housing remains a top issue.
The city’s CreateTO housing agency put out a request for proposal in 2017 to develop a 20hectare former quarry and landfill in Scarborough, which came with zoning that called for 270 condominium units, a big-box retail outlet, a park and 30 units of Habitat for Humanity affordable-ownership housing.
Developers DiamondCorp and Kilmer Group worked together on a proposal for the former Birch Cliff Quarry site. Diamond Kilmer Developments won the bid in 2018 but immediately sought a rezoning order to shrink the retail element and create more than a thousand new homes, which the city approved in 2021.
The developer is now marketing the first phase of project, now known as Birchley Park, which will include 868 marketrate condominiums (a mix of townhouses and apartments in mid-rise buildings). Approximately 10 per cent of the housing on the site will be affordable, including 58 Habitat for Humanity ownership townhouses and approximately 62 affordable rental apartments (half of a 124-unit building the city intends to build on quarry land Diamond Kilmer is conveying back to the city as part of the new deal).
“This site really does achieve a tremendous amount of city building objectives,” said Ty Diamond, president of Diamond Kilmer, which purchased the land from the city in 2020. “When this thing was started, there were no affordable rental units in the plan.”
However, housing advocates view the development as a lost opportunity.
“We’re living with the sins of the past: the way the city used to deal with its surplus lands, until 2019, was not about optimizing affordable housing outcomes, it was about getting the land developed and not upsetting the neighbours too much,” said Mark Richardson, a member of the volunteer group HousingNowTO.
HousingNowTO has pressed the city’s planning and development arms to match the lofty rhetoric of previous election campaigns that promised thousands of affordable housing units.
“In summer of 2018 and more seriously in summer 2020, the city had a serious ‘Come to Jesus’ moment on their affordable housing methodology,” Mr. Richardson said. “Prior to those dates, it was a nice to have. Now it is a more core part of their expectation when it comes to city lands.”
Former mayor John Tory won a second term in office in 2018 after a campaign in which he promised to get 40,000 affordable rental units built over 12 years through deals with privatesector builders on city-owned land. This pledge eventually became the Housing Now program.
At the time, Mr. Tory’s main rival was former city planning head Jennifer Keesmaat, who promised 100,000 homes in 10 years.
In the campaign ahead of the June 26 by-election to replace Mr. Tory, Olivia Chow, who has been leading public-opinion polls since entering the race, is pledging to have the city do the development work itself to build 25,000 new rental homes in the next eight years.
When Housing Now launched in early 2019 with 11 city sites, it had plans to start building as soon as 2020, but the real-world record has been less impressive.
There are now 21 sites in the Housing Now pipeline, with close to 3,700 affordable rental apartments planned, but not a single site has begun construction.
Toronto also has no timeline on when it will build the rental building on quarry land. Planning for the 124-unit rental project won’t begin until 2024. “Details are still being finalized, but once complete, the city will issue a request for proposals to award the contract to a developer, after which the city will establish project timelines,” city spokesperson Jessamine Luck said in a statement.
The first two phases of Birchley Park’s condos are expected to arrive in 2026 and work is underway now on the geothermal heating and cooling system that will service the project.
“Almost the entirety of that project is under $1-million,” Mr. Diamond says of the expected sale prices. With suite sizes ranging from 374 to 950 square feet – selling for “high 11-hundreds” per square foot, according to Mr. Diamond – the price point for apartments in the first two midrise buildings and could range between just under $500,000 to about $1.13-million. While those prices aren’t exactly affordable, they are a discount from what you’d find closer to the city’s core.
Mr. Diamond also said the majority of Birchley’s units will be on the larger side. “We’re a little bit bigger than you’d find in a conventional downtown highrise, a bit more family friendly.”
Next door is a smaller plot of privately owned quarry land where the Conservatory Group has applied to build a 32-storey building with 367 units. The timeline for that project is up in the air owing to a court-ordered dissolution and sale of the group of companies, which has dragged on into its second year with little sign of progress. The court order is part of an acrimonious lawsuit between four brothers who owned the company together.
Mr. Richardson argues that building up the entire quarry site along the lines of the Housing Now proposal would add much more affordable housing to the overall mix.
“If the City of Toronto had a time machine and was starting over on 19 hectares of surplus city land in 2020, rather than 2017, there’d be a very different expectation on this site,” Mr. Richardson said.

Michael Andlauer-led group reaches agreement to buy Ottawa Senators for $950-million

Full text: Toronto-based businessman Michael Andlauer began his career trucking goods around the country, before expanding into merchant banking, pro sports, and health care. He would be wise to tap into all of his logistical know-how, given how many balls will be in the air after announcing his successful US$950-million bid for the Ottawa Senators on Tuesday.
Among the challenges: securing the approval of the National Hockey League’s board of governors, selling the 10-per-cent stake he holds in the Montreal Canadiens, navigating the unique federal and municipal obstacle course of Ottawa to secure a new downtown arena, juggling the demands of an ownership group of more than 20 parties and convincing skeptical locals that he, a little-known billionaire from a city that is home to the Senators’ provincial rival, is the right man for the job instead of the shiny parade of celebrities such as Ryan Reynolds who flirted with the idea of team ownership.
And, oh yes, helping to revive the fortunes of a team that most recently finished 20th in the regular season standings, hasn’t made the NHL playoffs in six years and has never won the Stanley Cup.
Under the deal, a group of investors led by Mr. Andlauer will own 90 per cent of team, with the remaining 10 per cent retained by the two daughters of the club’s late former owner, Eugene Melnyk.
Mr. Andlauer has been a front-runner to buy the team since the daughters, Anna and Olivia, put the Senators on the block last November.
Even though the team attracted a starstudded list of potential suitors, including Snoop Dogg and The Weeknd, Mr. Andlauer’s existing ties to the NHL gave him the edge.
He has a good relationship with league commissioner Gary Bettman, and has been a minority owner of the Montreal Canadiens, controlling 10 per cent since 2009 and serving as the team’s alternate governor.
The former beer-league goalie’s involvement with hockey team ownership dates back to 2003, when he bought the American Hockey League’s Hamilton Bulldogs.
After selling that team in 2015, he purchased the Ontario Hockey League’s Belleville Bulls, moved the team to Hamilton and called it the Bulldogs.
Mr. Andlauer’s move up the hockey league food chain has grown with the success of Andlauer Healthcare Group Inc., the transportation company he launched in the early 1990s that today serves the medical industry.
The company went public in 2019 and since then has more than doubled in value.
In a statement announcing the purchase, Mr. Andlauer described the future of the Senators as “bright” and said the team’s fan base “is one of the most passionate in the league and I’m excited to take the franchise’s success both on and off the ice to the next level.”
Mr. Andlauer did not respond to requests for an interview.
However a source close to Mr. Andlauer, who The Globe and Mail is not identifying because they are not authorized to speak publicly, said the trucking entrepreneur views the Senators purchase as a key part of his legacy and is buying the team with an eye to winning the Stanley Cup. The source said financing for the transaction has been in place since the sale process began, and that it involves very little debt.
The deal was handled by Mr. Andlauer’s merchant bank, Bulldog Capital Partners, with legal advice from Goodmans, the source said.
The new ownership group also includes Ottawa business executive Jeff York, as well as Ottawa’s Malhotra family, owners of Claridge Homes, among others.
The source said that other local business people may be added to the club’s ownership base over time as the team tries to strengthen ties with the city’s business community.
Before the purchase can receive final approval from the NHL’s board of governors, Mr. Andlauer must sell his minority position in the Canadiens. That will kick off another sales process that the source close to Mr. Andlauer, pointing to Forbes’ most recent analysis of NHL teams, which valued the Canadiens at US$1.85-billion, said could establish a new high watermark for team valuations.
If those figures seem eye-watering, experts say they make a very specific kind of economic sense.
“There are very few investments outside of professional sports that limit economic competition,” said Kevin Mongeon, an associate professor of sport management at the University of Ottawa.
“The socialism of professional sports protects all of the members,” said Rick Burton, a professor in sport management at Syracuse University in New York and co-author of the recently published book Business the NHL Way.
In North American sport, he noted, “there is no relegation” to lower-tier leagues. As well, “you can take losses on the ice and losses on paper in the short term, but you can watch the asset appreciate by really comfortable rates, as long as you hold the property.”
While the NHL signed lucrative broadcasting deals in 2013 with Rogers Communications Inc. and in 2021 with ESPN and TNT in the United States that saw sharply higher valuations than previous agreements, observers have suggested that sports media rights may be overinflated and due for an adjustment.
Still, predictions of a bursting bubble have yet to come to fruition.
“Well, experts like myself continue to say that there should be a market correction, and experts like myself continue to be proven wrong,” noted Mr. Burton.
He added that the NHL is popular in territories outside of North America such as Scandinavia and northern Germany.
Furthermore, he suggested, the Russia-based Kontinental Hockey League – seen as the secondbest professional hockey league in the world – may be under increasing pressure because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“There are a number of factors that make the NHL a pretty stable bet,” he said.
Still, Mr. Andlauer will want to move the team downtown to improve its attendance, something Mr. Melnyk tried and failed to do for years. Last June, the team announced it had entered into a memorandum of understanding with the National Capital Commission (NCC) to pursue a development in the LeBreton Flats neighbourhood.
The development was expected to include a mix of retail, office space and residential buildings.
On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the NCC suggested Mr. Andlauer’s purchase would not alter those plans. “We look forward to working with Mr. Andlauer and his partners on a lease agreement for a future major events centre at LeBreton Flats, building on our existing Memorandum of Understanding,” said Valérie Dufour.
But the source close to Mr. Andlauer said LeBreton is just one potential option for a new arena and redevelopment project.

Full text: Scott Strickland spent his childhood on the water with his grandfather, looking back toward a craggy shore built up with colourful homes and fishing stages in Channel-Port aux Basques, N.L. Laundry flapped in the wind. Porch lights glowed in the fog.
But now, eight months after post-tropical storm Fiona slammed into the historic fishing community founded in the late 19th century, the area of town where Mr. Strickland used to live with his wife, Andrea, is just a chunk of barren rock.
“Everything is totally dark downtown, right on the coastline,” said the 52-year-old real estate agent. “It’s just this very eerie feeling, especially if you grew up in that area and go and travel down these coastal streets.
Everything is gone.”
More than $37-million in government money has flowed in recently to the hundreds of residents of the southwestern Newfoundland town who lost their homes in last September’s epic storm. Now the decision to stay and rebuild or leave is on the minds of many. Inflation has driven up the cost of building new homes. A lingering nervousness erupts whenever the weather turns. And it’s all shrouded in a wistfulness for a bygone way of life.
“You want to go back to the way it was, but you know it’s not going to happen,” said Mr. Strickland, who has been living with his wife at their cottage in the woods, a one-bedroom prefab bungalow about a 20-minute drive from the town. For the first time in his life, he no longer hears the moan of the foghorn or breathes the salty air. “It’s the end of an era.”
The costliest storm in Atlantic Canadian history washed away about 20 homes in the town, leaving behind rubble and debris, houses missing walls and roofs. Like more than 100 others in the town, the Stricklands’ home was condemned, lost to a monstrous storm surge that left seaweed strewn in their secondstorey bedroom.
Their home, part of it more than a century old, overlooked Channel Head Island, where Mr. Strickland’s grandfather and great-grandfather worked as lighthouse keepers in the light tower, built in 1875. As a child he picked blueberries and beach peas on the island. Now it’s a mound of bare rock, scoured of its sod. The government wharf, the town’s de facto town square, is gone. So is the boardwalk. And to some, the warm feeling of home.
Arlene Clarke, a retired teacher, realized it was time to go after the devastation of Fiona. She felt the pull to be near her children and grandchildren in St. John’s.
And the town no longer felt familiar. “People were withdrawn and wary,” said Ms. Clarke, who lived there with her husband for 40 years. “The sense of loss was overwhelming. There’s a quiet and stillness surrounding the area. People are saddened by the loss, and you can feel it.”
The power of the Atlantic has long been a source of trauma and loss for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. But after Fiona, in the face of rising sea levels, warming ocean temperatures and predictions that climate change will yield ever more ferocious and frequent storms in the future, even townspeople who for generations lived and worked on the ocean are scared.
Ms. Strickland, a 46-year-old employment counsellor, spoke with a shaky voice as she described a new fear of the ocean that overwhelms her when she travels into the town. “The ocean certainly always gave us a sense of peace and calm, but now that’s changed,” her husband added.
There are many, however, who are not giving up on Port aux Basques. There is a prevailing desire among politicians and business owners to turn the page and look to the future – the impetus behind a recent trade show organized by the local chamber of commerce.
Provincial Minister of Industry, Energy and Technology Andrew Parsons, who is from the town, spoke about the bright future in mining and wind-powered hydrogen production for the area at the event last month.
“I think there’s more to look forward to than there has been for some time,” Mr. Parsons said during an interview, referring to the potential to produce “green hydrogen” by harnessing wind energy, a proposed wind-hydrogen project to export the fuel to Europe by 2025 and a growing number of mineral exploration applications. “I think there’s going to be economic opportunity that our kids and our grandkids are going to benefit from.”
Housing poses a challenge, as it does everywhere in the country, but especially so in a town of 4,000 where 100 homes have been lost. “That has a huge effect on the area,” Mr. Parsons said.
“That’s the biggest issue we’re facing right now. … When you throw in the cost of living and inflationary measures, again it’s having an impact on the rebuild.”
The province says it has offered 99 settlement packages to residents in six communities, averaging about $405,000 each. All but a few have been processed.
Some still haven’t decided where they will live. Others are waiting to see if the province decides to demolish more homes.
Meanwhile, the small cove where Mr. Strickland and his family lived for generations has gone dark. At night the constellation of porch lights and the glimmer of TVs is gone. During the day, the screeches of gulls and hubbub on the wharf have been replaced by jackhammers and rumbling dump trucks carting off people’s lives, and a way of life, one load at a time. For now, or as of this writing, Mr. Strickland’s home was the last one standing – soon to be demolished like the others in the old part of town.

Nova Scotia island goes on the auction block: Sotheby’s New York will hold a live bidding for property and plan to create a compound

Full text: Just off the Nova Scotia shore, an undeveloped island with deep forest, six coves and seals bobbing along the shore will soon be up for auction in New York.
With just less than 11 acres of deep forest and a rocky shoreline, Vollebak Island is currently listed for sale by Sotheby’s International Realty Canada (SIRC) with an asking price of $13.49-million.
On June 8, online bidding for the property will open with Sotheby’s Concierge Auctions, then culminate on June 14 with live bidding at Sotheby’s New York auction house.
The strategy, says Scott Bryant, regional director in the Atlantic provinces for SIRC, is to expose the island and the offering to the highest net worth people on the planet.
The successful bidder will possess not only the secluded haven, but plans for an ingenious and sustainable compound created by renowned architect Bjarke Ingels of Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG).
The buyer will own exclusive rights to the design, along with planning permission, for the collaboration between Mr. Ingels and the founders of the Vollebak clothing brand.
“We propose to gently lift the topography of the island and create a village-like cluster under the man-made hill. The new architecture will become part of the island, and the island itself will be a house for adventure,” BIG says.
Looking to a more distant horizon, the design is a master plan for the entire planet, the founders say, pointing to the plans to harness the power of the wind, sun and earth.
The vision includes a cluster of dwellings with thatched roofs, a bathhouse with tubs carved from the rock and a greenhouse for growing the island’s food.
Leader Island, as the property is formally known in Nova Scotia’s land registry, sits in an inlet near the lobster fishing community of West Jeddore. The region about 50 minutes east of Halifax is “very, very typical coastal Nova Scotia”, Mr. Bryant says, with a more traditional culture than the province’s well-known South Shore, says Mr. Bryant.
Informally, the property has been known as Vollebak Island since April, 2021, when it was purchased by the British clothing label that makes futuristic clothing and gear.
Twins Nick and Steve Tidball are the founders of Vollebak and the visionaries who sought to create an island where they and their customers could spend time in a remote location, away from the ‘prison of technology’ and surrounded by nature.
Vollebak purchased the undeveloped island in April, 2021.
Included in the listing is an easement for the parking of two vehicles on the mainland and another easement for a dock nearby.
Mr. Bryant estimates the package may sell for between US$5million and US$10-million, but he is frank in acknowledging the challenge in determining a price for an offering unlike any other.
“We’re so typically dealing with land and structures,” says the agent, who was born and raised in the province.
Vacant islands currently listed for sale in the area have asking prices between $150,000 and $800,000.
Mr. Bryant has consulted with local builders in an effort to estimate how much a buyer would need to invest to complete the project as envisioned by BIG and the Tidballs.
Cost estimates can vary dramatically when it comes to assembling buildings from seaweed, forming a stargazing room in a concrete shell or 3-D printing the foundation walls for a primary bedroom.
The 3-D printer, Mr. Bryant figures, would need to be transported to the island by barge.
“It’s just so state-of-the art and forward-looking,” he says of the concepts. “It’s a vision of the future.”
Mr. Bryant says members of the local lobster fishing and boating trades are intrigued by the project and many have offered support.
“It’s a very typical, downhome, caring community,” he says, adding “it’s a different climate yet absolutely stunning and beautiful.” Mr. Bryant stands ready to arrange showings for buyers who would like to walk the land before bidding.
The agent has secured the services of a helicopter pilot who can whisk visitors from Halifax Stanfield International Airport to a landing spot in Jeddore in 15 minutes. From there, he’s lined up boat owners with a variety of craft who can transport an individual or an entire entourage.
Mr. Bryant says prospective buyers will need to do their due diligence to understand zoning, local tides and the extent of the services offered by BIG. He has detailed plans at the ready.
He’s not able to say why the brothers did not move ahead with the project, but he hopes the ultimate buyer will bring the plan to life.
“It feels good to be happening in our own backyard,” he says.
“It’s almost overdue. I can’t wait to see how it will evolve and end.”

Real estate investors are heading out West: Multiresidential assets are becoming a hot commodity in Alberta’s biggest city

Full text: One year after the launch of the Alberta is Calling promotional campaign, Calgary is reaping the benefits – and investors are taking notice.
According to City of Calgary estimates, over the past year the city’s household formation rate jumped from 10.4 to 15.6. Because household formation is a key indicator of housing demand, the long-battered multiresidential market in Alberta’s largest city is on a sure way to recovery.
“Investors are finally able to somewhat break even now, as it was almost impossible to sell or rent in 2018-2020,” said Amanda Ku, a Calgary realtor, in an e-mail.
“Investors were sitting on either a loss for a vacant unit or a loss for cash flow.”
Indeed, in mid-May, Susana Campos sold her centrally-located two-bedroom, two-bathroom condo, a property she acquired in 2015 but had been unable to sell at a profit – until now.
“I considered selling it last year,” Ms. Campos says. “But then I looked at the market and that was not the right time to do it.”
But as Calgary’s condo market started showing signs of recovery earlier this spring, Ms. Campos seized the opportunity to exit the market without taking a loss. In April, the Calgary Real Estate Board reported a benchmark price of $299,400, an amount just shy from the 2014 peak.
“My husband and I moved out to B.C.,” she says. “Starting a family and moving provinces was just too much. I didn’t want to spend money on the property [and] this was the right time to do it.”
After two weeks in the market, Ms. Campos’s 900-square-foot condo sold for $305,000 – $3,000 more than what she paid in 2015.
As the pressure caused by population growth intensifies in Calgary – so does the interest of outof-province investors, signalling a shift away from a market dominated by ‘makeshift’ investors such as Ms. Campos.
With a rental vacancy rate below 1 per cent, and regulations that favour landlords, Calgary’s condo market is quickly becoming a hot spot for out-of-province investors, says Natasha Phipps, an investment specialist and realtor in Calgary.
“From an investor’s perspective, if the local legislation in the area is putting their investment at risk because they can’t evict a tenant that’s not paying rent, that’s putting them at risk from their asset protection standpoint.”
Moreover, Calgary’s diversifying economy is adding to its attractiveness, Ms. Phipps says. “Investors in residential real estate will always follow where the people go, because those are our tenants.”
But the interest of investors is growing beyond condos in the resale market. In May, Zonda Urban reported that roughly 60 per cent of the units launched in the first quarter of this year in Calgary are selling to Ontario investors.
According to Jordon Scrinko, founder and managing partner of Precondo, a Toronto-based preconstruction condo brokerage, preconstruction units are “flying” to Toronto investors because Calgary properties offer a more attractive rent-to-price income ratio.
“You can still cash-flow neutral in an investment,” Mr. Scrinko says about Calgary. “Whereas if you buy a one-bedroom in Toronto, you know that your rent isn’t going to cover your mortgage, maintenance fees and property taxes.”
Moreover, multiunit properties, including low-rise apartment buildings located in upand-coming neighbourhoods such as Bankview and Bowness, are ripe for investment.
“In the multifamily space there’s a lot of outside investment coming from mom-andpop investors buying their small multiunit building, [and] all the way up to REITs and funds and larger groups that are picking up the larger real estate,” Ms. Phipps says, adding that the ability of landlords to raise rents in underperforming assets is one of the reasons these investors are interested in Alberta properties.
Unlike provinces where rent increases are capped, in Alberta the only limit to rent increases is that they take place once per year – an important consideration for investors.
“In other provinces, if you buy an underperforming building, you could spend years and years trying to get it to current market rates,” Ms. Phipps says.
In addition, because transactions involving larger properties are characterized as commercial, buyers can access financing incentives unavailable in the residential mortgage market, she says, pointing at CMHC insured mortgages.
“Investors who are good at their numbers are seeing the [opportunity] to jump into that commercial space.”
The growing interest in Calgary multiresidential properties is reflected by Altus Group data, which shows that despite a decreased sales volume and higher cap rates, transactions in Calgary’s multiresidential market almost doubled in 2022, relative to the year prior, reaching more than $450-million.
According to Ray Wong, vicepresident of data solutions delivery at Altus Group, investor demand for multifamily residential in the past two quarters has remained strong because it represents a consistent return.
“Multiresidential is the most stable asset not just in Calgary but across Canada and North America,” Mr. Wong says. “Everybody needs a place to live.”

Michael Sabia leaving federal Finance, set to lead Hydro-Québec

Full text: The Quebec government is set to tap senior federal bureaucrat and veteran business leader Michael Sabia as the next chief executive officer of Hydro-Québec, a critical appointment that will set the direction of the Crown corporation at a time of dwindling power surpluses.
Mr. Sabia, one of the federal government’s most trusted economic advisers, is leaving his position as deputy minister of finance and finalizing arrangements to lead the utility, according to two senior government officials. The Globe and Mail is not identifying the officials because they were not authorized to comment on the appointment, which has not been publicly announced.
A central figure in federal policy since the 2015 election of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Mr. Sabia first served on an economic advisory council to the government, then as chair of the Canada Infrastructure Bank, before his December, 2020, appointment to the Finance Department.
Talks between Mr. Sabia and the Quebec government began in April after the release of the federal budget in late March, according to one official.
Mr. Sabia, 69, is one of the country’s most senior corporate leaders. He has navigated between the top echelons of business and government for decades, a path that will serve him well in a position that requires both political savvy and managerial rigour.
In 2019, he stepped down as CEO of pension fund giant Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec after a decade at the helm.
Through four changes of government in Quebec, he navigated the politically sensitive waters by defending the fund’s decisionmaking independence while boosting investments in local companies and real estate. He left an institution once marred by crisis on a stable footing when he took the job to lead the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy.
The Legault government was caught off guard in January when Hydro-Québec’s former CEO, Sophie Brochu, announced that she was quitting three years into a five-year term. Ms. Brochu was the first woman to hold the top job at Hydro-Québec, a pillar of the province’s social and economic identity.
The government is again putting its confidence in Mr. Sabia at a pivotal time for Hydro-Québec, which is grappling with booming demand from industry for its renewable energy just as the province readies a transition away from fossil fuels by increasing electrification to meet climate targets.
Most of the province’s power supply is generated by HydroQuébec’s network of dams and hydroelectric stations in the north, built decades ago. The utility is predicting an end to its electricity surpluses by 2026 and says it will need at least 100 terawatt hours (TWh) of additional power – more than half of its current annual generating capacity – if it wants to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
The utility reported $4.6-billion in profit for 2022 as soaring prices in export markets contributed to an increase of almost $1billion in net income. The performance yielded a $3.4-billion dividend for the province, the largest in its history.
Quebec has long espoused a strategy of using its vast hydroelectric resources to lure investment. Today it is home to several energy-intensive industries such as aluminum production and mining, which pay among the cheapest electricity rates in North America.
Adding more industrial customers could require building new hydroelectric or wind projects at three or four times the cost of existing dams. HydroQuébec’s incoming CEO will have to balance adding new power production and better utilizing existing resources.
“It’s a surprising choice,” said Pierre-Olivier Pineau, an energy expert at Montreal’s HEC business school. “Mr. Sabia is not known for his decarbonization credentials, nor for his ability to sell reforms to the public. He is not known as a communicator with stakeholders as diverse as First Nations, industrial users and the population at large.
“It’s therefore hard to see what the reasons are for selecting him.
He is a respected business leader – but HQ needs an energy-transition leader,” Mr. Pineau said.
Mr. Sabia’s departure from government is well-timed as it relates to the federal budget cycle.
Summer is when Finance Department officials largely begin the process of preparing the fall economic update and the next federal budget, which is normally tabled between February and April.
The March 28, 2023, budget announced the federal government’s intention to take a more activist role in electricity policy, which is normally an area of provincial jurisdiction.
The budget unveiled a new 15per-cent refundable electricity credit that will be available to non-taxable entities such as Crown corporations, public utilities and Indigenous-owned corporations.
The exact timing of Mr. Sabia’s departure has not been confirmed. One source said he and Hydro-Québec are still working out the final contractual details of the role.
As deputy minister of finance during the peak of the pandemic, Mr. Sabia was a central decisionmaker as the government crafted multibillion-dollar programs on the fly to quickly support individuals and businesses.
A 2022 Auditor-General’s report that looked back at the more than $200-billion in emergency support programs concluded that they succeeded in preventing a spike in poverty.
But the report criticized the government for doing a poor job of identifying individuals and businesses that should pay back funds.
Robert Asselin, senior vicepresident of policy at the Business Council of Canada and a former policy adviser to the Trudeau government, said Mr. Sabia is leaving behind some significant unfinished business.
Recent budgets have announced several ambitious new programs that have been slow to fully launch.
These include initiatives worth billions of dollars for a Canada Digital Adoption Program, a Canada Growth Fund and a new Canada Innovation Corporation.
“A lot of measures announced in the last budgets are still very tentative,” said Mr. Asselin, who worked on federal budgets in the early years of the Trudeau government.
Elliot Hughes, a former economic adviser to the Liberal government who is now a public-affairs adviser with Summa Strategies, said Mr. Sabia’s departure is a “blow” to the government in light of the fact that Canada faces a potential recession.
Mr. Hughes noted that Mr. Sabia brought private-sector experience to a position that is often held by a career public servant.
“A replacement for Sabia will be hard to find as the role of Finance deputy minister is unique,” he said. “It requires someone who understands how policy and politics interact at the highest levels. Not to mention the individual needs to get along with both the Finance Minister and Prime Minister.”

K AWA RT H A L A K ES Asking price: $1,199,900 (January, 2023) Previous asking prices: $1,249,900 (December, 2022); $1,275,000 (November, 2022) Selling price: $1,175,000 (March, 2023) Previous selling prices: $469,500 (May, 2016); $351,617 (May, 2009) Taxes: $4,482 (2022) Property days on market: 105 Listing agent: Alaina Malcolm, Coldwell Banker R.M.R. Real Estate THE ACTION As soon as the owners of this three-bedroom bungalow decided to sell, agent Alaina Malcolm rushed to photograph the saltwater pool, hot tub and lush gardens before winter set in.
The images helped reel in two dozen visitors as the snows began, but after two open houses, requests for tours tapered off, and the price was trimmed back twice. Finally, in March, a buyer came forward with an offer of $1.175-million, which was accepted.
“Being outside Durham Region, the time of year, and [interest] rate changes were all factors in people not wanting to move,” Ms. Malcolm said. “So we did adjust the price slightly to make it a little more attractive.
“There were a lot of people coming from the city, but the buyer did end up being someone local.” WHAT THEY GOT This 14-year-old bungalow is across the street from older homes that back directly onto the lake. It has 1,900 square feet of living space, two front entrances and an attached triple garage.
There are separate living and dining areas, and a kitchen with double doors to a wide deck.
The basement is arranged with a recreation area, an office and two guest rooms, plus roughed-in plumbing for a third bathroom.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s in an estate subdivision community, and most of the homes in that area are on the water and aren’t quite as new,” Ms. Malcolm said. “There are a lot of heritage homes.”
“It’s a great family home inside and out, wonderful for entertaining,” Ms. Malcolm said.
“Probably 50 per cent of the lots in the community are about that size, but what’s unique about this property is it was a corner lot and the sellers had done quite extensive landscaping work, so there were a variety of trees, hedges and shrubs that made the property more appealing.”

Minimal form, elevated experience: A contemporary Nova Scotia house by MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects sits on a peninsula jutting into the sea, writes

Full text: In the historic village of Chester, N.S., opportunities to build a new house are rare.
Geography limits the available land on a peninsula jutting into the sea; heritage conservation rules preserve the traditional Maritime streetscape.
Architect Brian MacKay-Lyons accepted a singular challenge when a new client purchased a parcel of land carved out from behind one of the area’s long-standing homes.
Clare Morris grew up in Nova Scotia’s Annapolis Valley, but she was working in Seattle when she began to make plans to return to the province. During her time on the West Coast, she developed an appreciation for contemporary architecture and a minimalist aesthetic.
Ms. Morris interviewed several architects and found MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects of Halifax best understood her desire for a modest and functional house that would provide places for peaceful contemplation in nature.
While the firm has won many international awards for cultural, academic and residential projects in locations around the globe, Mr. MacKay has long been fascinated with the vernacular building traditions of his home province.
“You see the power in the ordinary, the everyday, the unpretentious,” he says. “I’ve always been interested in the democratic idea that architecture is not just for the rich.”
In Chester, Mr. MacKay-Lyons and the team designed an archetypal gable-roofed building, drawing inspiration from the funky sheds built by local fishermen.
The base is clad with two-inch matchbook cedar shiplap – a construction technique used for centuries to build Nova Scotian boats.
The upper story is a weathered steel sleeve that appears to slide over its wooden base.
Residents and guests arrive to an entryway created by removing a bite from the corner of the building and enclosing the space in glass to create a reverse porch.
Inside the 1,350-square-foot structure, the bedrooms are on the ground floor with the living areas above.
A staircase of black perforated steel leads to the second floor and the open twostorey space for lounging and dining. A fireplace at one end of the room serves as a gathering spot. Panoramic glass on the other walls draws in the view of surrounding treetops.
The kitchen, a washroom and a covered balcony stand around the perimeter of the main space.
One creative addition is a movable wall ladder that leads to two lofts hidden in the gables.
On the lower level, two bedrooms provide refuge and privacy. The primary suite includes built-in cupboards and a a desk next to a window facing the greenery.
Throughout the home, wood and concrete, combined with white walls and cabinets, keep the palette simple and monochromatic. The materials are also relatively affordable and easy to maintain.
A cedar porch provides an outdoor living space for enjoying the serenity of the wooded lot, which sits down a slope from the main street with a brook flowing nearby.
The completed building doesn’t blend in with the heritage homes nearby so much as dissolve into the landscape itself.
For Mr. MacKay-Lyons, the project became part of the firm’s long experimentation into creating buildings that offer an elevated experience with minimal form, material and cost.
The design is both simple and sophisticated in the minimally detailed eaves, corners and openings, he says.
During more than 30 years as a professor at Dalhousie University, Mr. MacKay-Lyons explored practices that make architecture durable and accessible.
“In the Maritimes we have this cultural ethic about outward modesty.”
He points to the firm’s Enough House, which stands in a valley on Mr. MacKayLyons’s Shobac Farm overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. With a simple form and minimal details, that 700-square-foot dwelling is a prototype for Chester House.
Ms. Morris drove across the United States from Seattle to Chester in January, 2021, just as the builders were finishing up.
The town was quiet in the midst of the pandemic, she recalls.
“Arriving in winter and just seeing the seasons pass from those big windows was amazing,” she says.
Construction was done over about four years, she says. By building in stages, she was able to complete the project with a budget between $650,000 and $750,000.
Now that she has spent some time living in the house, what strikes Ms. Morris the most is how the architects were able to fulfill her desire for a home that feels cozy and secure.
She also loves the way the light and shadows move through the interior throughout the day.
The heated concrete floors are warm for the residents and stand up to the wear and tear of people and dogs.
She plans to keep the interior as uncluttered as possible.
“I don’t have a lot of art on the walls – I almost feel like it doesn’t need it.”
In mild weather, when the windows are open, Ms. Morris can hear the sounds of water flowing and trout running in the brook.
The house looks its best to her when the rusted steel contrasts against a robin’s egg blue sky and the wood of the exterior blends in with the forest, she says.
The home’s fairly isolated location means the exterior did not need to conform to the style of historic buildings clad in shingles and clapboard. Occasionally people in the village greet Ms. Morris as “the rusty house lady,” but many people she meets don’t even know it’s there.
“You can’t even see the house from the road when the leaves are full in the summer,” she says. “Even in the fall and winter, it’s difficult to see this house.”
For Mr. MacKay-Lyons, the home is the pinnacle of minimal and modest design that works within the cultural context.
A valued opinion came to him a few years ago, he adds, from the architectural historian and critic Kenneth Frampton, who described MacKay-Lyons buildings as “banal.”
“When you achieve the banal, it looks like the building might have always been there. The work looks inevitable.”

Toronto sees a boom in upscale rental

Full text: Anew breed of high-end rental apartments is entering Toronto’s housing market in volumes never seen before, just as there are warning signs that new rental starts are slowing again.
According to real estate analysis company Urbanation Inc., there are almost as many purpose-built rental apartments under construction in the Toronto area in the first quarter of 2023 (20,270) than were completed in the region during the two-decade period between 1980 and 1999 (20,514). But these new apartments are for the most part nothing like the city’s existing stock of high-density rental towers that were built mainly between the 1960s and 70s, and they charge some of the highest rents in the region.
“It’s an upgraded rental living experience compared to a typical condo rental,” said Shaun Hildebrand, president of Urbanation.
“They are bigger and there’s more attention paid to a unit.”
In recent decades almost all the new rental units built in Toronto were condominium apartments that individual investors and owners rented out to tenants.
And while the aging purposebuilt rental stock in the city can no longer compete in terms of amenities, those who manage the new purpose-built rentals would prefer if no one referred to their buildings as “condo-like.”
“A lot of folks think an apartment building is a condo building that’s rented. That’s not the case,” said Rob Martin, senior vice-president at Rhapsody Property Management Services. Rhapsody is a U.S.-based property management company that entered the Canadian market in 2014 and now manages 20 rental complexes with about 7,000 apartments. For Mr. Martin, a Canadian who worked in the U.S. for years before returning home, it’s been a process for Canadian condo developers to relearn how to design dedicated rental buildings.
“We have a long list of stuff we give our partners when we first meet; the 75-80 things we tell them to look for,” Mr. Martin said.
The list includes everything from how to locate plumbing (drains near washing machines in every unit to help avert floods, not to mention easy-to-access shut-off valves) to what shape the apartments should be.
“One of the first things I tell a developer? The dens. Just remove them all. Their head’s almost blow off because as you know, in Toronto ”dens” are – and I’m using the word very loosely here – ‘dens’ are everywhere,” Mr. Martin said. The request requires a mental shift because semifunctional extra space is desirable to investors who see surplus square footage as an increase to the value of their investment. But renters are different: They don’t want to pay more for a half-room that is neither office space, a bedroom nor useful storage.
One of Rhapsody’s latest leaseup efforts is underway for the newly completed Residences at The Well, part of a massive redevelopment on the western edge of the downtown core. Mr. Martin offers a tour of the building that highlights some of the ways the building differs from a condominium. For example, the hallways are wider than a typical condo, sacrificing a few inches in each unit for better turning axes when bringing in furniture.
Inside apartments that have two bathrooms, the bathtub is never in the ensuite, unlike with most condos. The tub is in a separate bathroom to be family friendly: whether it’s for kids or dogs. Rhapsody finds people don’t always want to do bathtime in their primary bedroom.
Electrical outlets do not feature condo-common built-in tech connections like USB, partly because tech infrastructure can be hard to future proof. “You never want to do too much of that in an apartment,” said Mr. Martin, because when a major tech company like Apple switches to USB-C (as it recently has) suddenly every outlet with boring old USB is in need of a costly upgrade.
Where possible, Rhapsody likes to add a wine fridge to the kitchen. “We’re messaging that they have the ability to socialize because we want a very social community,” Mr. Martin said. “We think it speaks to the relaxed nature of coming home after a long day and opening a bottle of wine with friends.”
Rhapsody encourages social programming in the building with things like guided exercise programs and boot camps residents can sign up for through local fitness provider Benchmark Group. All of this communication comes by way of an app the company makes accessible to residents that helps them manage everything from food deliveries to maintenance requests. For instance, they have a policy that if you need something hung on a wall, one of their staff will come do it (not least because they know where it’s safe to drill holes in the walls).
This attention to detail doesn’t come cheap, but Rhapsody’s website for The Well also provides detailed pricing and floorplan options, so there’s no guesswork about what’s available. The monthly rental cost for a studio apartment might start at $2,400 for a 479-square-foot unit; some apartments with a separated single bedroom start at $2,600 a month for 517 square feet; twobedroom apartments with two baths start at $3,300 a month for about 750 square feet; and very large three-bedroom apartments start under $5,000 but can rise as high as $7,800 a month on sizes between 1,200 and 1,460 square feet.
According to Urbanation’s figures, new purpose-built rental apartments are renting at a premium to newly built condo apartments – as much as a $300 a month average difference so far this year. The average condo rent in the city is now at about $3.81 a square foot and The Well building is likely to grab rents between $4 and $5 a square foot.
According to data collected by Rentals.ca, in April the average monthly rent landlords obtained for a one-bedroom apartment in Toronto climbed 20.5 per cent from April, 2022, to reach $2,526.
A two-bedroom apartment is fetching $3,290 on average – that’s up 18 per cent year-overyear.
But just as he doesn’t like “condo-like,” Mr. Martin also doesn’t like to describe these apartments as “luxury,” despite them renting near the top end of the market.
“It’s not a word we like to use because it implies that it somehow it’s not attainable for everybody,” he said.
“Condos are increasingly occupied by students. Newer purposebuilt rentals are catering to higher earning professionals,” Mr. Hildebrand said.
However, Mr. Hildebrand’s tracking shows that as interest rates began to climb in spring 2022, new purpose-built rental starts were cut in half from about 7,800 starts a quarter to less than 3,000 in the last two quarters. He calculates there’s still close to 115,000 planned units in the purpose-built pipeline, but when or if they might arrive is unknown.

Overnight sensation: Barbecue stands in an industrial Chinese city become an unlikely tourist hot spot

Full text: Fame has been both a blessing and a burden for Zibo.
Home to about 4.7 million people, the city in China’s eastern Shandong province was once best known, if it was known at all, as a manufacturing hub, close to the port of Qingdao, on the Yellow Sea. After work, many locals would grab a snack – scallion pancakes and meat skewers cooked over charcoal – at the thousands of small outdoor barbecue stands that dot Zibo.
This year, seemingly overnight, those barbecue stands became an online sensation, making Zibo one of the most famous cities in China. In March, the city received 4.8 million visitors. Hotel bookings went up 800 per cent, and tickets for the twohour train ride from Beijing sold out minutes after going on sale. Even more guests arrived during the five-day May Day vacation, and so far the city’s popularity shows no signs of waning.
Steven Cao, a 33-year-old real estate agent from Weihai, a small city up the coast from Qingdao, made the six-hourplus drive to Zibo for the holiday.
“I took my parents with me. They’d seen an ocean of Zibo content on social media and lobbied me every day about how much they’d love to go there,” he told The Globe and Mail.
Despite growing up in Shandong, Mr. Cao said he’d never really heard of the city until now but was happy to join the craze and experience a new place after years of pandemic lockdowns and isolation.
But when all of China decides to go somewhere at once, there can be issues.
Mr. Cao said he and his parents arrived in Zibo at about 10 p.m. and tried to grab some food at a barbecue stand near their hotel – not one of the famous ones blowing up social media, he was quick to note.
They were told it had stopped handing out queue tickets two hours earlier and there were still “at least 50 to 60 people lined up.”
The family ended up ordering takeout in their room.
The following day, Mr. Cao researched a stand that didn’t seem to have many reviews online, suggesting it wasn’t too popular. It opened at 4 p.m., so he and his parents arrived an hour earlier, only to find dozens of people waiting in line.
“I waited for two hours, and at 5 p.m. we finally got a table,” he said.
“I sent my parents back to the hotel to rest and killed time swiping TikTok.”
Others have complained of similar experiences. Zibo barbecue stalls are tiny, typically only serving a handful of customers at a time, and many have been overwhelmed by the sudden demand.
A video that went viral this month showed a vendor on his knees, explaining that he can only serve 200 people a day and begging an angry customer – number 201 – for forgiveness.
Another stand was swamped after someone posted a photo of its owner taking a break during a slow period: People figured that if he had time to rest then the wait time probably wasn’t too long.
For days afterward, the stand had queues outside starting at 6:30 a.m.
Local banks have even offered low-interest “barbecue loans” to vendors of as much as one million yuan ($194,000) to help them expand, though some analysts have warned the craze may be passing and could leave both lenders and borrowers on the hook.
Not everyone has been impressed by the hype. In a widely shared (and controversial) essay, Liu Yadong, a professor of journalism at Tianjin’s Nankai University, said the Zibo craze was indicative of the flattening of culture caused by social media, with people all flocking to the same thing simply because it is trending online.
“Similar to the intensity of a desert storm, the attention span of a desolate society is also brief, and the pace of the attention economy is fast,” he wrote.
For all the complaints, however, stands in Zibo remained packed this weekend, months after the craze began, with photos online showing packed streets and queues starting early in the morning.
As for the food itself, Mr. Cao said it wasn’t that special. “What you’re eating is more a sentiment, a feeling,” he said. “I’m sure that in future I’ll find it ridiculous to have driven half a day just to eat barbecue.”
But as a Shandong native, he was happy to see the city doing well and the celebration of street food, which has often been maligned as “uncivilized” and cracked down upon in other parts of China.
“It’s good that Zibo is improving the image of the whole province and that officials understand what people truly want,” he said.
“The enthusiasm for Zibo isn’t fake – you feel it when you go there. Even though the experience itself can be good or bad, I’d hope to see this type of atmosphere all across the country.”

Full text: 420 Bloomfield Main PRINCEED WARD COUNTY, ONT.
Asking Price: $1,642,000 Taxes: $4,900.06 (2023) Lot Size: 126 by 164 feet Agents: Faye Moxam, Rachel McGinn, Chestnut Park Real Estate THE BACKSTORY Peter Mooney and Sarah Power would describe their lifestyle as slightly nomadic before the pandemic hit. The actors were born in Manitoba and Newfoundland, respectively, but were living and working in Los Angeles when the world came to a standstill.
Unable to work from home, a captive Ms. Power got on her computer to do some online shopping – for a house more than 4,000 kilometres away in Prince Edward County, Ont.
“I fell in love with the fireplace,” Ms. Power says. The house, built in 1868, features three fireplaces, none of which were in working condition when they bought the house in 2020.
The stately, Victorian house had been neglected, she says, and she wanted to restore it to its former glory.
The mouldings and wide pine plank floors were incredible, the couple say, but the bathrooms and kitchen were at odds with the rest of the house. All of the cabinetry was out of date and run down, the main kitchen had linoleum floors, and the primary bath had green, midcentury-style fixtures.
THE HOUSE TODAY “Peter is very modern,” Ms. Power says, “he likes things to be white and wood.” But if she had her way, she says each room would look like it was designed by Wes Anderson, the director whose films embody an aesthetic that is vintage but vibrant, and whimsical without being wacky.
However, the couple didn’t want the house to feel like a filmset – their workplace – but to feel comfortable and lived in. “We set out to make it cozy, but also have that grand Victorian feeling,” Ms. Power says.
The clawfoot bathtub in the top floor bathroom was found online, along with almost everything else in the house, they say.
The renovation took place during the peak of the pandemic. Mr. Mooney describes making 3-D models of each room, calculating which room would get light at what time. There’s a thematic flow from one room to the next, playing on the original details of the house but with an updated palette. The attention to each room meant that even the laundry room, where the most mundane of tasks is performed, is wrapped in floral wallpaper.
The house is 4,000 square feet, has four bedrooms and three bathrooms. The dining room features the original arched cast iron fireplace grate, with a refurbished gold cover.
The red-brick fireplace in the summer kitchen that Ms. Power originally fell in love with came with the original cast iron pot and hook. Once a new flue was installed by a retired local contractor, it became a focal point for the family who would cook smores and the occasional chili around the hearth.
“I’m from Newfoundland originally, and we are big on kitchen parties,” she says, and was able to host friends and family at Christmas and Thanksgiving. The caribou wallpaper in one of the guest bedrooms is another nod to Ms. Power’s home province, designed by Kate Golding for her Newfoundland collection.
The main kitchen required a total reconfiguration of the footprint in order to rectify an “awkward” layout and accommodate a new Devol kitchen, with green cabinets and gold hardware. The doors are new as well, meant to optimize the natural light and mirror the ones in the library.
The most difficult room was the primary bath, for which the couple enlisted the help of a local craftsman named Rusty, the only person in the county who knew how to install the “tricky” tile.
“We wanted it to feel like a grand, old, New York hotel,” Mr. Mooney says.
This is perhaps where the couple’s differing aesthetic meet. The square, emerald tiles, gold fixtures, and rounded mirrors evoke old luxury that is still modern and eclectic.
“So much of the house, for us, was about finding these contrasts,” Mr. Mooney says, “and making each room a story.” Every single room in the house was altered in some way, even if it was just a fresh coat of paint.
THE BEST FEATURE The couple will miss Prince Edward County and the community in Bloomfield. “It’s such a great place to entertain,” Ms. Power says. “The first summer we lived there, in 2021, we had friends and family stay every single weekend for the entire summer.”
While the summers “felt like a party,” filled with guests and beach days, the winters were quiet and peaceful, taking their daughter for long walks in the field behind their home.
For Mr. Mooney, the best parts of the house are the places he would begin and end his days. In the mornings, the self-described early riser would sit in front of the bay window in the living room, “the most incredible place” to have a coffee and witness the sunrise.
At night, he’d relax in the green library room, make a cocktail and watch a show. The dark wash of paint on the wall, ceiling, and shelves blankets the room without overpowering the original mouldings on the walls and ceiling.
For Ms. Power, however, her favourite room is her daughter’s bedroom with the blue bird wallpaper. The room has windows that face the east, “it just gets the most beautiful light.”
It’s a room that will be tough to recreate as they complete their move back to Los Angeles. “Other than our home, our daughter’s lived in seven Airbnb’s,” says Ms. Power, a reflection of the working actors’ need to pick up and go to any filming location.
For a brief moment, Ms. Power and Mr. Mooney relished in the opportunity to be in one place, especially one as beautiful as this.

Sorry, homeowners: Entrepreneurs need relief: It’s time for more lending to businesses. Our economic prosperity demands it

Full text: Policy professor at the University of British Columbia and founder of Generation Squeeze, Canada’s leading voice for generational fairness. You can follow Gen Squeeze on Twitter, Facebook and subscribe to the Hard Truths podcast.
Canada’s addiction to high and rising home prices has made our country lazy when it comes to planning for economic growth.
This has hurt the finances of younger Canadians and newcomers, while ballooning the wealth of older homeowners.
Our country badly needs a new strategy to promote economic prosperity through a shift in lending and borrowing from mortgage loans to business loans. This is crucial regardless of whether you care about generational fairness, or just plainold economic prosperity.
The largest part of the Canadian economy is driven by real estate, rental and leasing, which includes mortgage lending and borrowing in owner-occupied homes, sales by real estate agents, revenue from rental fees and more. At 13 per cent of our national gross domestic product (GDP), this industrial sector is bigger than manufacturing; bigger than mining, oil and gas; bigger than construction, health care, financial services, and all other industries.
Given that average home prices in Canada have increased by more than 300 per cent since 2000, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that real estate has grown as a share of GDP in all provinces over the past two decades, and often has been the fastest growing part of provincial economies.
This is especially true in British Columbia, where real estate now represents 19 per cent of the economy.
Anchoring our economic prosperity on real estate, rental and leasing would be a fine economic development strategy if Canada was also generating a large portion of its employment in this same industrial sector. But we don’t. Fewer than 2 per cent of Canadians make their living in the real estate sector.
No other industrial sector has such a big gap between its share of GDP and share of employment. This gap highlights a major economic weakness – one that contributes substantially to Canada suffering very slow improvements to GDP per person compared with other large economies.
The gap reveals that Canada has been growing our economy by increasing the major cost of living, without generating jobs in that industrial sector at a rate that ensures local earnings keep pace, especially in urban centres. Instead, small numbers of Canadians (notably realtors) enjoy very large incomes.
Meanwhile, homeowners like me gain equity in a way that drives worrisome wealth inequalities between owners and renters, and between older and younger residents. All the while, younger people and newcomers struggle to earn enough from full-time work to pay for their primary cost of living – housing. In 1976, it took five years of full-time work to save a 20-per-cent down payment. Now, it takes 17 years, and rents have been steadily rising as well.
So we must revisit the place of real estate in our economic strategies. It doesn’t make sense for our governments to claim they are good economic managers because GDP grows as a result of dramatic increases to our primary cost of living. Instead, it is time for an economic course correction that prioritizes reconnecting housing costs to local earnings in order to support employment and productivity in other industries.
This gives yet another reason to revisit the Home Ownership Tax Shelter. Policy that shelters housing wealth from taxation accelerates inefficient investment in real estate at the expense of capital investment in more productive sectors, including those that generate more employment.
It also means we must incentivize a shift in lending and borrowing away from mortgage toward business loans. Governments could collaborate with financial institutions to loosen lending terms for business in part by focusing on groups that face systematically more restrictive borrowing conditions, including women and people of colour.
Policies that work to reduce such biases may encourage business lending to marginalized groups without dramatically increasing credit risk for lenders. Expanding government support for initiatives like the Canada Small Business Financing Program, the Business Development Bank and peer-to-peer lending via the Lending Loop could advance this goal. Yes, we must still channel enough private investment to build the new housing required by population growth.
But we ultimately need to divert some mortgage lending toward business investment – especially mortgage lending that results in bidding up the price of alreadybuilt homes.
Lobby groups for manufacturing specifically, and business more generally, can play an important role. We need them to join forces to critique Canada’s overreliance on mortgage lending to fuel economic growth so that our country builds momentum to loosen lending terms for business loans that are more likely to fuel productivity and prosperity.
Over the short term, the shift from mortgage to business lending may coincide with slower GDP growth while we wait for investments in industries beyond real estate to spark productivity. That’s okay, as urged by the “beyond GDP” movement led by groups like the Canadian Wellbeing Knowledges Network, and even the Government of Canada’s own Quality of Life Framework – Measuring What Matters.
Canadian voters must become increasingly agnostic about GDP growth, because it’s been bad for younger Canadians and newcomers when it’s been powered by real estate.
There is little reason to fret over lower GDP growth when it is caused by policy changes that purposefully increase wellbeing by slowing down home prices so that earnings from full-time work have a chance to reconnect.

Full text: Dreams of industrial glory are alive again in Bécancour, Que.
On the tidy main streets and busy eateries in this countryside city of 15,000 people, a hopeful buzz is in the air over a wave of new cutting-edge factories set to push up from the ground that could cement the area’s future for decades. An electric-vehicle battery boom is nigh.
This is a collection of six villages across the St. Lawrence River from Trois Rivières, grouped together into one municipality for administrative convenience.
Each has its own church and local history, and if you’re in the area, Bécancour’s tourism board suggests a hunt for “gnome homes” scattered among historical sites and a circuit of poutine restaurants to satisfy your culinary cravings.
Urban pockets quickly give way to fields, the entirety of it measuring a whopping 494 square kilometres. A massive arrowheadshaped industrial park pierces eastward from the river as far as the eye can see.
Alcoa Corp. and Rio Tinto Group run a 1980s-era aluminum plant here. France’s Air Liquide SA has a facility producing hydrogen. Chemical makers Arkema Canada Inc., Cepsa Chimie Bécancour and Olin Canada ULC are all present, and TC Energy Corp. has a natural-gas-powered cogeneration plant.
But many companies have decamped. Others said they would come but never did, their projects living more as fanciful mirages on the business pages of local newspapers. Norway’s Norsk Hydro ASA set up a magnesium facility but dismantled the plant around 2008. Hydro-Québec shut down the Gentilly-2 nuclear power station in 2012.
Bécancour has been searching for higher purpose for half a century – a critical mass of big business with a common raison d’être to finally put itself on the global map. Now, it might have found it: making battery materials for EVs in the global energy transition.
What happens next could change this quiet corner of Canada in ways its inhabitants might never have imagined. After years of repeated disappointment, they’re getting ready for their close-up.
“You have to be an archaeologist to remember that we used to make cars in the late 1990s in Quebec,” says Pierre Fitzgibbon, the province’s Minister of Energy and Economy, alluding to General Motors Co.’s muscle car plant in Boisbriand and Hyundai Motor Co.’s short-lived manufacturing fling with Bromont.
“I think Bécancour is going to become – maybe I’m too optimistic – a true centre of battery materials for North America,” says Mr. Fitzgibbon, a chartered accountant and former investment banker. “I look at it from a capital investment perspective, and this is du jamais vu.” (Meaning it’s unheard of.)
The desire by Western automakers to cut their dependence on China and map out new EV supply chains in Europe and North America has triggered a reset of their global footprints.
Companies are scrambling to secure lithium, nickel and other minerals needed for battery production. And they’re forging alliances with new partners, plotting new factories to feed their dealer showrooms. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime shift that’s being fuelled by government backing on an unprecedented scale.
Countries are competing with each other for these high-tech facilities and Canada’s political leaders want many in Ontario and Quebec. The Trudeau government has agreed to provide subsidies that could reach $13-billion over a decade for a new Volkswagen AG battery plant in St. Thomas, Ont. That’s a shocking sum of corporate aid the government insists is justified by the economic spinoffs it will create.
Stellantis NV and LG Energy Solution are planning their own factory in Windsor, Ont., that will also be financed with help from Ottawa.
This is just the beginning. As society moves toward greater EV adoption, billions more are likely to be spent, by governments and the private sector. The governments of Canada, Quebec and Ontario have put up big taxpayer dollars to help the country win its share of manufacturing investment as automobile and battery makers shop their factories to the highest bidder.
Now, politicians have to sell that decision to a somewhat skeptical citizenry. As Quebec business commentator Pierre-Yves McSween cheekily put it: “We’re buying our place in paradise.”
Quebec has many of the minerals the auto industry needs as it goes electric. And it has something equally valuable: cheap, green hydropower – the kind needed for the energy-intensive task of pulling those minerals out of the ground to create cathodes and anodes, the basic components for EV batteries.
The province wants to make the guts of EVs. Behind the scenes, it has been selling itself hard as a viable place to do that. Bécancour is close to major highways, railways and shipping lanes. And its industrial park is easily one of Canada’s biggest at 70 square kilometres, offering ready-to-build land for factories that take up a mind-boggling amount of space.
All of that, topped with government financial incentives, has drawn the attention of several big-league multinationals, including GM, Germany’s BASF SE and Brazilian mining giant Vale SA.
Construction on Volkswagen’s planned plant, the size of 210 soccer fields, is expected to start next year. But in Bécancour, Canada’s all-in wager on EV battery manufacturing has taken root. Companies are making commitments and spending money to buy land, and concrete is being poured on site for new factory foundations.
Here, negotiations between companies and governments have already started giving way to cranes and construction mixers.
Mr. Fitzgibbon estimates the value of projects announced and in the cards for Bécancour at $4billion, with a possible doubling of that number if companies move forward with expansion projects on their properties. Quebec hasn’t seen private sector industrial spending of that size since Bombardier Inc. launched development of the C-Series airliner in 2008. The minister has said the government could invest as much as $3-billion to support EV battery projects in the city.
And this time, the momentum seems unstoppable.
Bécancour was a thriving farming community in the 1960s when the Quebec government of then premier Jean Lesage designated it for a new vocation as a steelmaking centre, at a time nationalist sentiment was growing and state involvement in industrial development was growing with it.
Buoyed by its success bringing hydroelectric production under state control, Quebec also took a stake in a shipyard in Sorel and created an assembly plant cranking out French-designed Peugeot and Renault cars in Saint-Brunode-Montarville.
In short order, Bécancour families who had spent generations growing vegetables or raising cows were forced to sell their properties and move further afield to make way for an industrial outpost set to pump out hotrolled sheet metal. It was to be one of the province’s most ambitious society-building schemes to date, a megaproject for the masses that would reduce Quebec’s reliance on Ontario metal.
But it never happened. Quebec-owned steel maker Sidbec, now part of ArcelorMittal SA, decided to locate new steelworks 100 kilometres downriver at Contrecoeur instead after it merged with Dominion Steel and Coal Corp. As the years went by, Bécancour was left with vast lands parcelled off for heavy industry, bolstered by deep-water port facilities, that have remained decidedly underused.
Today, the city is coming alive with new purpose under a new government vision. And people are asking again whether it will fly or flop.
“There is still skepticism” among the local population, says Donald Olivier, the head of the provincial Crown corporation overseeing Bécancour’s industrial park. “People are saying ‘Okay, these announcements are nice and everything, but will it be like the past and they never amount to anything?’ ” Doubt is fading, however. Several global giants are building footprints in Bécancour. A wave of smaller suppliers is expected to join them as they firm up plans and secure financing.
The most advanced project is a partnership between GM and South Korean battery materials maker Posco Chemical Co. Ltd., where construction workers are now laying down foundations and putting up steel framing for a new $500-million factory.
GM and Posco announced last year that the plant will produce so-called “cathode active material” for batteries that will power GM’s Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck and GMC Hummer EV, among other vehicles. It’s the first of what is expected to be several subsequent projects by the automaker on the property.
“Canada offers tremendous opportunity to be a major new part of the critical minerals sourcing, processing, and recycling that we will need as we manage the rapid transformation to an allelectric future,” GM Canada president Marissa West said in an emailed statement. GM wants to have the capacity to crank out one million electric vehicles in North America by the end of 2025.
Others are betting on Bécancour, too. BASF, the world’s largest chemical maker, has locked up a big parcel of land in the industrial park as it readies its own project. It hasn’t yet bought the property, so can’t start building, but the land has been cleared.
Mining titan Vale has announced it will supply batterygrade nickel sulfate to GM from Vale’s proposed plant at Bécancour. And Ford Motor Co. signed a letter of intent with EcoPro BM Co., South Korea’s leading battery material producer, as well as EV cell maker SK On Co. to jointly invest US$704-million for a new cathode factory in Bécancour, The Korea Economic Daily reported. The project location has not been officially confirmed.
The Pallinghurst Group, a European private equity investor, sees Quebec becoming a dependable pillar for battery materials supply in North America. London-based Pallinghurst has invested more than US$500-million to date in two key mining and materials processing projects in the province, with plans for more.
The company scooped up mining company Nemaska Lithium Inc. out of bankruptcy protection in a partnership with the Quebec government’s investment arm, and it’s built up a 15per-cent position in another supplier, Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. Nemaska controls the Whabouchi mine in Quebec’s northern James Bay region, one of the world’s richest deposits of spodumene – a mineral source for lithium, the sought-after, silverywhite metal used in consumer electronics and EVs. Nouveau Monde specializes in battery anode material. Both companies have staked out spots in Bécancour.
“We remain all-in on Quebec,” Pallinghurst’s co-managing partner, Arne Frandsen, told The Globe and Mail. “You have the combination of world class natural resources and the political willingness to think big.”
“In addition, you have the system in place that allows you to invest in a sensible and very transparent manner. On top of this, Quebec has Investissement Québec, which is a blue chip and most supportive investment partner.
To me, this unique cocktail is what it’s really about,” he said.
Quebec has long espoused a strategy of using its vast hydropower resources, the bulk of which are produced by dams in the north built decades ago, to lure investment. It is home to several energy-intensive industries, such as aluminum production and mining, that pay among the cheapest electricity rates in North America.
The Legault government is keen on expanding that strategy to woo more investment and drive growth, particularly by attracting companies that can help
build an industrial base centred on electric propulsion systems.
The goal is to play host to companies working on various links along the battery supply chain, from extracting minerals to recycling batteries. And while the province doesn’t have any automakers assembling cars and SUVs, it does have manufacturers of electric buses and power sports vehicles.
Quebec’s investment arm is leading the charge in commercial negotiations with EV players, taking ownership positions in some projects and dangling loans for promoters on attractive terms they could never get from banks.
For its part, Ottawa has earmarked $80-billion in tax credits in its spring budget for clean technology over the next decade.
The two levels of government are working together on Quebec’s electric aspirations. But whether they’re successful in their plans for Bécancour hinges in part on how prospective investors weigh competing jurisdictions, chiefly the United States.
The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act contains an estimated US$500-billion in new spending and tax breaks aimed in part at boosting clean energy. The sheer scale of that spending threatens to leave Canada’s behind in the EV race if it can’t keep pace.
Ottawa and Quebec City are striving to win one particular battery manufacturing investment at the moment that pits Bécancour against one or more unnamed U.S. sites. Government officials have a detailed side-by-side financial analysis of the project plan comparing U.S. and Canadian financing – and there’s a gap the Canadians are struggling to match, Mr. Fitzgibbon says. He declined to name the companies involved.
Mr. Fitzgibbon remembers the light-bulb moment that Quebec’s EV potential began to crystallize in his mind. In late spring 2019, he was in Hannover, Germany, visiting Volkswagen. When he walked into one meeting, a petite woman was sitting at a table with a map of Quebec spread out in front of her highlighting all the lithium claims in the province, he recalls.
“She knew more about lithium than I did at the time. This is when I realized there’s something going on here.”
Today, the minister is making deals left and right. The government is so intent on making sure EV battery manufacturers and suppliers have what they need from the moment they land on site that it’s spending $350-million on new infrastructure in Bécancour’s industrial park. Over the past year, crews began building new access roads and laying water, electrical and fibre-optic systems underground – all before the ink is dry on most investment agreements. Power will flow from two Hydro-Québec substations.
The province is working with local authorities and real estate developers to erect new housing in the city. And it’s rallying local colleges and educational institutions to develop a pool of workers who are industry-ready, though much of the top talent in the hub’s initial phase is expected to come from outside the country.
Much of the machinery will be imported too. Ships will dock at Bécancour’s port and equipment ready-made for the factory floor from South Korea will roll straight off the boats onto trucks for the roughly 10-minute drive to the new cathode plants, Mr. Olivier says.
South Korea has developed deep experience in the industry and battery specialists from that country will also come to Bécancour as work progresses. Mr. Olivier sees the city taking on a decidedly Korean flavour in the years ahead.
Mr. Olivier is Quebec’s man on the ground here, the guy in charge of reassuring prospective investors they’ll have what they need on site. The wavy-maned executive, who led the shutdown of the Gentilly-2 nuclear plant, is a thoughtful, relaxed kind of leader. No fancy shoes, no tie. These days, he’s got his hands full.
“This is a race against the clock,” for automakers trying to comply with government mandates on EV production as they phase out gasoline-powered vehicles from their lineups, Mr. Olivier says. Canada is banning the sale of fuel-burning new cars and trucks as of 2035 as it tries to reach netzero emissions.
To meet the regulations, carmakers are bringing industrial expertise close to where they sell their vehicles, including this continent. “There is a strong will to develop a North American supply chain,” he says. “That runs through Canada and it runs through Quebec.”
Traditional construction timelines have been thrown out the window amid the urgency. GMPosco became owners of their plot on Dec. 19 last year and launched construction of the factory barely two weeks later, in the dead of winter. “In January it was lights on at 6:30 in the morning until 8:30 at night,” Mr. Olivier says. “Other investors will probably do the same thing.”
The pressure is on for Mr. Olivier’s team as well. If closing a nuclear plant had technical challenges, the obstacles here are more deadline-driven, he says.
Roughly $100-million of his $350million infrastructure kitty has either been spent or committed through contract awards, and roughly three-quarters of it will be used by the end of the year.
Major work remains to be done, including building a new section of rail line and rebuilding a water treatment plant. All of it has to be completed in time for manufacturers to start operations in the summer of 2025.
Down the street at Bécancour city hall, Mayor Lucie Allard strikes an optimistic tone about what lies ahead for her municipality, even as change is coming fast. She’s been mayor for about 18 months and when she campaigned, nobody was talking about a rapid expansion of the EV battery industry. In fact, nobody was talking about batteries period. “It wasn’t at all in the cards,” she says.
Now, after an assortment of corporate citizens over several years, automotive and battery heavyweights have come knocking. The mayor says it’s very welcome. “People are rallying around the idea that this development is coming and they feel that they’re part of it, that they have a stake in its success,” Ms. Allard says.
Still, she says, there is already enormous pressure to make it work. Hundreds and potentially thousands of newcomers employed by the battery companies will need housing. If they settle in Bécancour, they will need schools and daycares. A new elementary school is currently being built, but the city has no high school.
Finding experienced labour could also be challenge, particularly in an economy near full employment. The battery industry will surely attract workers from Trois-Rivières and other nearby towns. But businesses with existing operations in the industrial park are already fretting privately about their employees jumping to the EV manufacturers, Mr. Olivier says.
Many private-sector companies are hungry to take advantage of the potential windfall that comes with an economic development strategy sponsored by government. Real estate promoters are jostling for land and permits in Bécancour, and one local company, Groupe Fournelle, is setting up a plant to make home construction modules (think walls, floors, roofs) so it can complete its housing projects faster.
The city’s phones are ringing nonstop with calls from people with project plans seeking meetings with urban planning staff, the mayor says.
City officials estimate that within five years, Bécancour’s population will swell by one-third to 20,000 people. That threatens to put a significant strain on municipal infrastructure and services, which will need to be expanded. Ms. Allard says the goal is sustainable development that maintains the quality of life of residents.
“We know there’s collateral damage in all of this,” she says.
“It’s not just smokestacks that we want in Bécancour. We want people to come live here, raise their families, be close to their workplace.”
How this will all shake out remains to be seen. As major EV and battery manufacturers cement their plans for North America, Bécancour seems set to receive a growing piece of the action. Other major companies will come. And more suppliers will set up in their midst.
But there’s a limit to how far political leaders will roll out the red carpet here and elsewhere.
And much of that, in Quebec at least, depends on how much electricity is available.
“Quebec has never had the opportunity to build such a cluster and I want to be cautious,” Mr. Fitzgibbon says. The province is currently dealing with requests from sponsors of “decent projects” in all industries (not just automotive and batteries) that would soak up about 10,000 megawatts of power if they were all approved, he says. And there’s not enough electricity for that.
Mr. Fitzgibbon says the government wants to get the battery materials making cluster as robust as it can in Bécancour, but that the city can absorb a maximum of two additional major cathode projects for the foreseeable future.
“It’s enough. At one point, I’m equally concerned about execution, talent, housing,” he says.
“You have to be careful. You don’t want to go too far.”
The minister already has his sights on other EV projects in other parts of Quebec. The Montreal area could accommodate an EV battery cell manufacturer, he says, which is the next step in the supply chain after materials processing.
And he says he’s working on developing “another Bécancour” somewhere else, because the province has enough minerals for multiple cathode material producers and they can’t all be located in one place. He says the Saguenay region, known for its aluminum smelters, is one possibility.
There are striking similarities between Quebec’s EV battery opportunity and its experience with the aluminum industry, says Erik Richer La Flèche, an energy and mergers and acquisitions specialist at law firm Stikeman Elliott LLP who recently retired.
The province has nurtured and assisted the aluminum industry for decades to the point it is now its number one export. But while Quebec is a powerhouse in primary aluminum production, it is much weaker in transforming the metal and has almost no local ownership in the industry. It has to solve that piece of the puzzle this time to create more wealth, he says.
“If Quebec can improve upon what has happened for the last 40 years in the aluminum sector, then the battery EV file will be beneficial,” says Mr. La Flèche.
That means “more Quebec ownership, less component and more finished goods production, and a clear understanding of the electricity needs of the sector over the medium and long term.”

Full text: 260 Deer Ridge Dr., No. 35, Kitchener, Ont.
KITCHENER Asking price: $1,599,900 (February, 2023) Selling price: $1,850,000 (February, 2023) Previous selling price: $432,289 (February, 2005) Taxes: $9,071 (2022) Days on the market: Seven Listing agent: Faisal Susiwala, Re/Max Twin City Faisal Susiwala Realty THE ACTION Many agents in the Waterloo Region have abandoned the common practice of underpricing properties to drive up the number of potential buyers, offers and payout. But Faisal Susiwala embraced the strategy for this bungalow townhouse abutting the Deer Ridge Golf Club and was rewarded with two generous offers and a sale price $250,100 over list.
“I’ve had about 15 homes sold this year that all sold for significantly over asking just by using that strategy,” Mr. Susiwala said.
“After reaching the peak of the market in February of 2022 there was a steady decline due to higher interest rates.
“[So] for many months, people sat on the sidelines waiting for something drastic to occur. The Bank of Canada’s two consecutive pauses have led to an uptick in the marketplace.”
Other factors helped convince a local downsizer to seal the deal on this house.
“We haven’t seen a lot of inventory in three years, and this is a niche location in an exclusive little neighbourhood with only a few of these retirement-style, bungalow condo townhomes backing onto the golf course,” Mr. Susiwala said.
“About 95 per cent of that neighbourhood are detached, two-storey, single-family homes.” WHAT THEY GOT This roughly 20year-old house has an attached double garage and 2,264 square feet of living space, including three bedrooms, an eat-in kitchen and a dining area with ninefoot ceilings.
An upper deck and covered patio lie outside two entertaining areas. The one downstairs also has a wet bar, gas fireplace, wine cellar and one of three updated bathrooms.
Monthly fees are $550.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It was a perfectly well-maintained and decorated home,” Mr. Susiwala said.
“There are places of worship, schools, restaurants and entertainment, so it’s a great community to live in, and yet we’re only an hour away from Toronto if the boss tells you to come in once or twice a week.”

Full text: VANCOUVER Dan Freeman was living in Surrey, B.C. and hating his job when he figured out a way to work remotely. That key piece made the move out of the Lower Mainland possible, says the 36-year-old, who writes proposals for the development industry.
His parents were building a home near Penticton, B.C., and he was visiting them a lot. Last August, he sold off his Surrey condo and moved there as well.
“I was tired of the traffic and the weather, and not feeling connected to the community,” he recalls. “Every time I would visit I felt so peaceful. My nervous system would settle, cruising country roads, driving by the lakes.
When I would come home, I would say to myself, ‘why am I here?’ “Although he didn’t think of it that way at the time, Mr. Freeman was part of a pandemic trend that saw people re-evaluating their lives and opting for more gratifying work and easier lifestyle. Others are downsizing from busy careers in expensive urban markets, cashing out and getting more bang for their buck.
As a result, the low-lying Okanagan city of Penticton, in the heart of wine and mountain biking country, is seeing a mini boom that it hasn’t experienced in decades.
It has meant a near 10-percent growth spike in a five-year stretch for the 37,000-resident community according to the most recent census stats, says Penticton’s general manager of community services and economic development, Anthony Haddad. That’s not bad for a small city that saw most of its development from the 1950s to the 70s, and has only seen population increases of around 0.8 per cent in previous years.
The city has responded with a plan to densify a large commercial area that has some single-family housing, with new developments of around six to eight storeys, although 14 to 15 storeys are allowed in other areas. Heights are limited by geotech and air-space constraints owing to the airport, as well a desire to keep the character of the surrounding hillside, he says.
The city is also making use of city-owned land and entering into partnerships to develop hotels and work-force housing needed for the local hospitality industries, which are a key economic driver.
“Use of city land is one of the many options to increase supply over coming years,” he says.
And the slow but substantial growth means they can plan for density and infrastructure accordingly, Mr. Haddad says.
“We’ve been growing relatively quickly in much more of a compact, more sustainable manner and investors are certainly taking advantage of different opportunities Penticton has to offer,” he says.
The city is putting the word out that it’s open to development, particularly in the North Gateway Plan district, which will go from around 350 residential units to more than 2,250 once built out, Mr. Haddad says. The plan is to densify with apartments, townhouses, work-force housing, hotel rooms and 30,000 square feet of commercial space.
Penticton does not have the speculation and vacancy tax like nearby Kelowna. However it is conducting a review of the effects of short-term rental, which generate high revenues and turn condo units into vacation businesses.
“We have a lot of people up from the coast with bigger property values bringing that here, and we have seen property values increase in Penticton. But with that we have seen new talent move here with business opportunities and development opportunities coming from larger urban centres as well.
“[Growth] does have its challenges, because it’s an attractive place to invest, and want to relocate to, but the supply of housing hasn’t been able to keep up with demand, like many communities across the province.”
Rachael and Paul Cabrera chose to move to Penticton because they were ready to semi-retire. After a couple of years spent looking around on Vancouver Island and Nelson, and even Nova Scotia, Ms. Cabrera says they settled on the Okanagan city for the lifestyle, the wine and the fact it had urban amenities such as a big hospital and international airport in Kelowna. So they sold their Squamish home a couple of years ago for $1.45-million before fees and bought a new 3,600-sq.ft. Penticton house for $1.4-million in a new subdivision, including taxes and custom improvements.
Ms. Cabrera does some HR consulting and for fun, she works at a winery in the summer. She and her husband Paul, both in their 50s, have always been food and wine people, and the Penticton region is the equivalent of California’s Napa Valley, semi-arid wine country with about 88 wineries in the region.
The house includes a 700-squarefoot two-bedroom suite, which means they have options for a revenue stream. But competition was fierce when they bought in January, 2022.
“We put in offers above asking and people still beat us. It was a crazy time, for sure,” Ms. Cabrera says. “We have way more house than what we could have gotten in Squamish.
“Price wise, it’s not like a Nova Scotia price or even Nelson. But you definitely get way more than what you could get in the Lower Mainland.”
Owing to the market softening, there have been some more recent price adjustments of $50,000 to $100,000, but overall, they’ve done well in terms of an investment, she says.
A neighbour in their cul de sac has a comparable house listed for $2.5-million, which is more like a Vancouver house price.
“I don’t know how these young people afford it,” she says.
The Cabreras, who’d lived in Yaletown before moving to Squamish, had always planned to move, but their plan was accelerated by a couple of years because of the pandemic, Ms. Cabrera says.
But remote work also looks different than a few years back. It used to mean someone living in Penticton and flying to Alberta for work, but now it means working on a laptop at the dining room table, Mr. Haddad says.
“We’ve seen home based business licences increase on an annual basis, suggesting an influx of remote workers,” he says. “And demand for co-working spaces has increased as well, with another couple under construction.”
Mr. Freeman is working in a shared office space, where he’s met most of his new network of friends of all ages. As a result, he’s now discovered pickle ball and improve theatre, things he wouldn’t have done back home in Surrey.
Mr. Freeman sold his condo in Surrey and he’s living in a cottage on his parent’s property but he has plans to buy his own place.
He’s watching the price increases coincide with the growth spurt, and although he has concerns it could grow too fast, he welcomes new development.
“Most of my friends are transplants, from Alberta, Saskatchewan, the Island, the Lower Mainland, back east. A Brit. It’s a wide demographic.
“I was hesitant to even be a part of this story because I don’t want people to know about here,” he adds, laughing. “Selfishly, I’d rather it not grow, but people have to live in affordable homes. I like the fact that there is condos going in, and condo towers over all. I’m hoping that it helps home prices. I don’t have too much faith it will. House prices are high. It’s not as high as Vancouver, but it’s still high.”
Kelowna marketer Shane Styles, president of Epic Real Estate, sees pent-up demand in that market for multifamily condos, such as Kerkhoff Construction’s 234-unit, six-storey Sokana project. Kerkhoff is one of the largest developers in the region and it’s their first project for Penticton, although they built a luxury lakeshore project in nearby Summerland. Sokana is replacing an old motel site near the lakeshore.
Penticton has a lot of 1950s motels, built when car culture and road trips were popular.
Mr. Styles says interest is from all demographics, including endusers and investors, first-time buyers and downsizers.
“Usually in the beginning of a project like this, there’s quite a bit of investor interest, and investor interest comes in different shapes and forms. They want to get into the real estate market and this may be that home that they use in the future, or not, but they want to ride the wave of appreciation.”
He couldn’t yet disclose prices, but said that newer condos in the area generally would sell in the low- to mid-$300,000 range up to just less than $1-million.

Full text: She was a writer with a freeflowing imagination who could spin a complex tale out of a minuscule scrap of information. Captivated by the magic of fiction from a young age, Joan Clark was a sharp observer of the nooks and crannies of human character, able to write with equal success for both children and grown-ups.
Of her 17 books, 10 were written for children and seven for adults, and she was nominated for or won prizes in both categories. Her bestselling title for young readers, according to her literary agent Dean Cooke, was The Hand of Robin Squires (1977), about a search for buried treasure on Oak Island in Nova Scotia; it sold more than 100,000 copies. Of adult titles, Latitudes of Melt (published in 2000) proved most enduring with about 30,000 copies sold – a high number in Canada’s small market. Her books were also translated into French, German, Swedish and Danish.
“She was a huge part of Canadian fiction,” said Ross Leckie, now a retired literature professor from the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton, where Ms. Clark was a writer-in-residence in 2015. “She is one of the great underrated Canadian novelists.”
Ms. Clark died on April 11 in a Calgary care home, aged 88. She had been struggling with Alzheimer’s disease since her early 80s.
She was born Oct. 12, 1934, as Florence Joan MacDonald, in Liverpool, N.S., the second of two daughters of William MacDonald and Sara MacDonald (nee Dodge). Her father worked variously as a coal distributor, a manufacturer and a real-estate agent; her mother was a nurse before having children.
In an interview, Ms. Clark’s sister, Gail Crawford, recalled that “Joan had her nose in a book all the time” when they were growing up.
The future author’s childhood memories included the outbreak of the Second World War and the Battle of the Atlantic – some of which was visible or audible from her seaside town. “It was 18 months of fighting while the Germans tried to sink our boats,” Ms. Crawford said. Of the brave young sailors billeted in her parents’ home or invited for Sunday supper, many would not survive.
Ms. Clark later recalled this tense period in War Stories, included in her 1990 short-story collection Swimming Toward the Light.
The MacDonald family moved to Sussex, N.B., and Joan enrolled at Acadia University, taking a degree in English drama. Both sisters loved the theatre.
At Acadia one day she and Jack Clark accidentally collided while rushing to their classes, sending books and papers flying. He was an outstanding athlete (track, basketball, rugby) working on his bachelor of science, the first step toward becoming a civil engineer.
Back in her dorm, Joan told a friend that she had just met her future husband.
They married in 1958 and moved to Winisk, a small Cree community on the shore of Hudson Bay, where Mr. Clark worked setting up a station of the Distant Early Warning Line, Canada’s northern defence system. She found a garden shed beside a priest’s house, and it was to there she retreated to teach herself to write, setting down her observations about the community and the land. She kept these notes for almost three decades until, in the spring of 1986, Winisk was washed away in a flood with considerable loss of life, and the remaining residents were forced to move.
By then Ms. Clark, who was no longer living in the community, was well known as a children’s author. The old notes provided the basis for her first novel for adults, The Victory of Geraldine Gull (1988), with the flood providing the story’s climax. The title character is a hard-drinking Cree woman whose anti-social behaviour masks the pain of having lost her beloved artist son.
The book was a finalist for a Governor-General’s Literary Award for fiction, and won the fiction prize given by the Canadian Authors Association. In 1991 she received the Marian Engel award for a woman writer in mid-career.
After leaving Winisk, the Clarks settled in Edmonton, where Ms. Clark earned a master’s degree in education and taught high school for a time. They left for Calgary in the mid 1960s, where their sons, Tim and Tony, and daughter, Sara, were born.
While the children napped, Ms. Clark wrote longhand at the kitchen table. Her first book for young readers, Girl of the Rockies, was published in 1968 and told the story of a girl who cares for an orphaned bear cub, then lets it go.
Eventually, her children’s books were honoured with a Vicky Metcalf award, and a Geoffrey Bilson prize for children’s literature.
In Calgary she was welcomed into a group of local authors who encouraged one another. In 1965, with poet and short-story writer Edna Alford, she co-founded Dandelion, Alberta’s only literary magazine at the time, which continued to publish until 2011. She was also a founding member of the Writers’ Guild of Alberta in 1980, and became the organization’s second president, after Rudy Wiebe.
“Joan quickly became a member of a writing community wherever she resided. If there wasn’t one, she set about forming one, attracting other women writers,” recalled her friend Bob Oxley.
“She had a deep belief in community. She cared about others. The writer community gave her support and the chance to support others.”
Meanwhile, Mr. Clark’s reputation as a scientist and engineer grew; he became the country’s leading expert on permafrost and resource extraction in cold places.
In 1984, when Memorial University in St. John’s appointed him president and chief executive officer of its new Centre for Cold Ocean Resources Engineering (CCORE), the Clarks decided to return to their home region.
The next 30 years were highly productive for Ms. Clark, giving rise to her most ambitious work.
This included two short-story collections, the Viking-themed historical novel Eiriksdottir, An Audience of Chairs, which was made into a movie, and the haunting Latitudes of Melt (the title refers to the latitudes where icebergs floating down from the Arctic begin to dissolve).
Latitudes has an enchanting heroine, Aurora, who was found by fishermen as a baby floating in a basket in 1912 shortly after the Titanic went down. The book traces Aurora’s life in Newfoundland till her death in 1985, when the wreck of the infamous ocean liner is finally located on the sea bottom and the mystery of Aurora’s parentage is solved. The sea and its dangers are artfully baked into the novel.
Ms. Clark’s last novel, The Birthday Lunch, published when she was 80, is the lightly fictionalized story of her mother’s death in Sussex, N.B., when Sara MacDonald was hit by a truck in front of a popular ice cream parlour. “The truck had a teenage driver and he was never charged,” recalled Ms. Clark’s sister. “We were angry and bitter about that.”
Ms. Clark received many latein-life honours, including honourary degrees from her alma mater Acadia in 1999 and Sir Wilfred Grenfell College in Cornerbrook, N.L., in 1998. At her death, Memorial University flew its flag at half mast.
True to form, Ms. Clark was also a founding member of the Writers’ Alliance of Newfoundland and Labrador, and twice won the province’s Winterset prize for her books.
Both she and her husband were inducted into the Order of Canada, one of the rare married couples to both receive this award.
“Joan and Jack, Jack and Joan, it was hard to think of one without the other. They were a power couple, not in the flashy sense but quietly,” Mr. Oxley said.
Jack Clark died of kidney failure in 2010. Ms Clark herself nursed him in his last years. She lived alone for a time, before moving to Calgary in 2017 to be closer to her family.
Joan Clark was predeceased by her husband of 52 years, Jack Clark, and leaves her sister, Gail Crawford; daughter, Sara; sons, Tim and Tony; and five grandchildren.

Full text: Commercial bankers are chasing a boom in demand for business activity that is defying concerns that the sector would retrench this year amid market turmoil.
Bank of Nova Scotia head of Canadian banking Dan Rees says the lender’s commercial lending division presents one of its biggest growth opportunities as record levels of newcomers to Canada spur spending and businesses launch expansion plans that were put on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic.
As the bank prepares to launch a rejigged companywide strategy, Mr. Rees has set his sights on low-double-digit growth in the commercial unit this year, with plans to hire hundreds of employees. In the bank’s first quarter ended Jan.
31, Scotiabank posted a 22-per-cent jump in business lending in Canada from a year earlier in a broad effort to renew its focus on the segment.
“The sector is far more healthy than some people think,” Mr. Rees said in an interview.
“There’s just so much GDP that hasn’t fully kicked in based on the immigration in the last year.”
Scotiabank isn’t the only lender chasing market share among medium-sized businesses served by its commercial segment, with Royal Bank of Canada also forecasting significant growth in its unit. The shift in strategy comes as interest rate hikes slow mortgage lending. Some banks have pointed to the boost from commercial activity as a key source to offset a slowdown in borrowing from homeowners.
Scotiabank’s commercial unit is on the smaller side among its peers, but it plans to cross-sell business products to customers in its larger wealth management division, aiming to hold more of a client’s overall portfolio and grow its deposit base to fund more loans. The lender is also moving further into underpenetrated markets in British Columbia and Quebec, with more commercial bankers that specialize in local industries.
But the broad business outlook for the banks is caught in a paradox. On one hand, the supply chain issues and labour shortages that wreaked havoc in 2021 are easing and Ottawa’s aggressive immigration targets are boosting demand for products and services.
On the other, economists are warning that high borrowing costs and a funding shortage wrought by three U.S. bank failures could prompt a credit crunch – a drop in lending as banks tighten their borrowing standards, making it more challenging even for creditworthy borrowers to get approved for loans. That could put a leash on the banks’ growth prospects.
So far, Canadian banks are bucking the concerns plaguing U.S. lenders. RBC has also refurbished its commercial banking teams to grab more market share. Last year, Canada’s largest lender created a new team with senior commercial bankers focused on growing demand from middle-market business with $10-million to $25-million in revenue.
Neil McLaughlin, RBC’s head of personal and commercial banking, said that competition has been fierce as businesses have come out of a pandemicinduced standstill. The bank is targeting significant growth in the division, fuelled by entrepreneurs who are embarking on expansion plans that were paused in recent years over concerns of supply chain blockages and labour shortages.
But even though those pressures are easing, companies are striking a cautious tone. Business owners anticipate slowing sales growth this year, with inflation expected to remain elevated until at least 2025, according to the Bank of Canada’s quarterly business survey.
“It really does create a dichotomy in terms of the signals that entrepreneurs are getting,” Mr. McLaughlin said. “They’re saying that there are still headwinds, but I can’t wait any longer – it’s imperative that I move my business forward.”
Signs of a credit crunch in the United States have started to appear since fear of contagion after Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse accelerated a trend of shrinking deposits at regional banks. In recent first-quarter earnings, regional lenders saw deposits slip away and loan growth shrink.
Meanwhile, large U.S. banks benefited from a boost in deposits as customers pulled cash from smaller institutions – a shift known as a flight to quality.
But loan growth has continued to edge lower across U.S.
banks this quarter, with commercial segments seeing the biggest slowdowns among bank divisions, according to regulatory filings as of April 12.
“The slowdown that you’re seeing is a reflection of the slowdown in the U.S. economy, but there are so many cross currents going on right now,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy said in an interview ahead of a CFA Montreal event Wednesday.
“It’s an unusually conflicted market.”
In Canada’s highly concentrated banking sector with diversified business segments, sticky deposits and a more conservative regulator than in the U.S., the banks here avoided a run on deposits and ensuing funding issues. While the Big Six may not have to tighten borrowing standards, Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem has warned that strain in the U.S. financial system could affect the Canadian economy as less business lending south of the boarder could lead to lower demand for exports.
The domestic economic picture is expected to worsen as well. The Bank of Canada forecasts near-zero growth over the first three quarters of this year as its rapid interest rate hiking campaign takes effect. Although so far, the Canadian economy has withstood the Bank of Canada’s battle to temper inflation. Recent GDP data have come in higher than the central bank or analysts expected.
Mr. Rees says that Scotiabank has become more amenable to adjusting payment terms for clients struggling with rate shocks, but it has not tightened its lending standards.
The complicating factor going forward, he says, is whether the Bank of Canada continues to raise rates. The central bank has said that it takes 18 to 24 months for rate hikes to fully affect the economy, meaning that the total blow of higher costs has yet to hit customers.
“The reality of that hasn’t hit everybody,” Mr. Rees said.
Some banks still anticipate growth in the commercial segments, but the pace is expected to slow. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce told analysts during its first-quarter earnings call that growth in its commercial loan book has eased as entrepreneurs become more tentative. The bank said it will be more selective when lending to businesses and it expects loan growth to land in the mid-singledigit range.
Bank of Montreal also expects growth to moderate slightly as the economic environment prompts more discerning decision-making on lending. But Nadim Hirji, the bank’s head of commercial banking in North America, sees pockets of opportunities as businesses deploy cash reserves built up during the pandemic, especially in high-demand industries such as agriculture, manufacturing and seniors housing.
“The volumes have come down, but we’re doing deals,” Mr. Hirji said. “We’ve got clients that have cash on the balance sheet.
Now they’re starting to use it instead of borrowing, and that’s probably the appropriate and the right thing to do for those for customers.”
BMO is also integrating its acquisition of California-based Bank of the West – the largestever purchase of a U.S. bank by a Canadian lender – which focuses on consumer and commercial banking. When BMO announced the deal in late 2021, it said that commercial loans make up 60 per cent of Bank of the West’s loan portfolio.
The bleakest area of concern is a downturn in commercial real estate. Across the Big Six banks, commercial real estate comprises 10 per cent of total loans on average, according to research from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
The lagging office and retail segments make up the smallest portions of loan books at the large banks. On average, those two segments combined account for a quarter of commercial real estate lending, with the remainder in surging industrial and housing real estate.
“There’s such big growth in the Canadian population that the demand for housing continues, and there’s been lots of activity in multiresidential,” National Bank of Canada incoming head of commercial and private banking Michael Denham said.
Toronto-Dominion Bank says that even as businesses are being cautious with their growth plans, clients have been drawing money from their operating lines of credit, pushing balances back up toward prepandemic levels.
Similar to the other large Canadian banks, TD says that it does not adjust its credit criteria depending on the economic cycle, maintaining its conservative risk appetite even when times are good. This provides the bank with the opportunity to grow its share of commercial business as some institutions restrict lending when market conditions turn sour, according to head of Canadian business banking Barbara Hooper.
“Other folks who may have relaxed their criteria during a frothy point in the cycle may need to put their foot on the break,” Ms. Hooper said. “That may give us an opportunity to win more than our fair share of deals during a downturn.”

Documents reveal hospital proposal on Greenbelt: Records show talks with developer began before he bought property in protected lands, shortly before Ford government reversed its promise

Full text: A proposal to donate part of a sprawling property in Ontario’s protected Greenbelt for a new hospital followed talks that spanned nine months and involved a developer, local mayor and hospital executives, documents show.
Internal records obtained by The Globe and Mail through freedom-of-information requests shed light on the timeline of developer Michael Rice’s interest in Southlake Regional Health Centre’s expansion, revealing he began discussions with hospital officials before buying a property largely located in the Greenbelt, an arc of protected farmland, forests and wetlands encircling the Greater Toronto Area. The documents also show Mr. Rice’s company purchased $15,000 in event sponsorships at the request of a local mayor.
Mr. Rice’s $80-million purchase of the property, a portion of which is being considered for the new hospital, closed less than two months before Premier Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservative government reversed its longstanding promise not to touch the Greenbelt by unveiling plans in November to allow the construction of at least 50,000 homes on 15 areas of protected land. Mr. Rice’s property in the township of King is among the land freed up for development.
King Township’s mayor had previously confirmed that he, Mr. Rice and officials from Southlake met to discuss the property three days before the government’s Greenbelt announcement, but the records reveal Mr. Rice began talks with the hospital about its expansion plans in January, 2022.
The documents do not detail what land was discussed at the January meeting. It is not clear when Mr. Rice, who owns other property in the area, became interested in purchasing the land in King, an affluent area north of Toronto known for its horse stables.
The Globe and other media outlets reported that Mr. Rice and several of the other landowners whose properties were removed from the Greenbelt have ties to the PC Party. A donor named Michael Rice has contributed more than $13,000 to the PC Party since 2018, provincial records show, and Mr. Rice’s development company hired a former Ontario PC cabinet minister to lobby the government between 2019 and 2020.
Both the province’s Integrity Commissioner and Auditor-General are investigating the Greenbelt decision amid accusations from opposition parties and environmental advocates that the government tipped developers off about its plans, which Mr. Ford and Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark have denied.
Mr. Rice, president and CEO of the Rice Group, a retail, industrial and infrastructure development company, did not respond to emails seeking comment.
The terms of Mr. Rice’s proposed land donation for Southlake’s expansion have not been made public and were not detailed in dozens of documents disclosed by Southlake and King Township.
At a meeting with Southlake and King Township officials on Nov. 1 – three days before the government’s Greenbelt announcement – Mr. Rice committed to providing a portion of his land for the new hospital for “a nominal fee – $2, $5, whatever,” King Mayor Steve Pellegrini said in an interview with The Globe.
Mr. Pellegrini said he had no advance knowledge of the government’s plans and said there were “never any deals” to support removing Mr. Rice’s land from the Greenbelt if he agreed to donate part of the property for a hospital. (Mr. Pellegrini says the government could have located a hospital in the Greenbelt through a legislative amendment or ministerial zoning order.)
Southlake requires a second hospital on up to 40 hectares of land to relieve overcrowding at its current Newmarket facility.
The province provided $5-million for expansion planning a year ago.
Officials are “evaluating all opportunities as part of our site selection process,” including Mr. Rice’s land, Southlake spokeswoman Lindsey Furlanic said in a statement. Potential locations are being assessed based on several criteria, including proximity and “financial considerations,” she said.
Mr. Rice’s property is a total of 278 hectares, or 2.78 square kilometres, and borders Newmarket.
The documents from the FOI requests indicate that Mr. Rice’s company approached Southlake and King Township for meetings last year.
Jordan Holt, the Rice Group’s manager of acquisitions and finance, asked for a meeting about the hospital’s expansion plans in early 2022, telling John Marshman, Southlake’s vice-president of capital, facilities and business development, in an e-mail that he would “prepare a preliminary overview of our company/land holdings that may be of interest to you.”
After the Jan. 26, 2022, meeting, which Mr. Rice attended, Mr. Holt thanked Mr. Marshman, writing: “We look forward to staying close to this project and I’d like to reiterate Michael’s statement that we’re here to help in any capacity.”
In April, a real estate firm promoted the large Greenbelt property in King on Facebook as “a prime land banking opportunity,” the practice of holding undeveloped land for future development.
Realtor John Dunlap declined to say when he began representing the former owners, who were members of the Schickedanz family, prominent developers with ties to the racehorse industry, but said he was the second agent they worked with. The family did not respond to a request for comment.
In June, John McGovern, the Rice Group’s senior vice-president of policy and planning, contacted King Township’s chief administrative officer, Daniel Kostopoulos, to ask for a meeting. He noted that Mr. Rice had recently run into Mr. Kostopoulos and discussed “the lands we have under contract in King.”
Over lunch on Aug. 10, Mr. Pellegrini met Mr. Rice for the first time and asked if he would consider donating part of his property for Southlake’s expansion.
“He said, ‘Absolutely,’ ” the Mayor recalled, adding that a hospital would make the rest of Mr. Rice’s land ”very appealing” for other developments.
A few weeks later, Mr. Pellegrini’s executive assistant Teresa Barresi e-mailed Mr. Rice to invite him to the mayor’s cultural gala in September, attaching sponsorship information. The company purchased a $5,000 “gold” sponsorship, which included four tickets and an ad in the program.
Mr. Pellegrini said his staff routinely asks business people to sponsor events that support local initiatives. “I’m very transparent and very clear. I do not touch money. I do not ask. It goes through the township,” he said.
King Township staff later organized a meeting for Mr. Rice with Southlake officials on Nov. 1.
A draft six-slide presentation the Rice Group prepared ahead of the meeting described the company’s services – including planning, construction and project management – and featured a draft concept site plan. (The Township of King withheld two slides about the site plan from disclosure on the grounds they contain third-party information.)
The Rice Group subsequently sent Mr. Kostopoulos a revised presentation that did not include the draft concept site plan, asking him to delete the previous e-mail.
The Nov. 1 meeting with Southlake was attended by Mr. Rice, Mr. Pellegrini and Arden Krystal, Southlake’s president and CEO, along with other officials. Neither Southlake nor King Township provided any records detailing what took place at the meeting.
On Nov. 4, the Ford government revealed it was opening up the Greenbelt, which protects more than 800,000 hectares of countryside, by removing 3,000 hectares of land for housing development. The province also added 3,800 hectares to the Greenbelt elsewhere.
Two days later, on the following Sunday, Mr. Pellegrini’s executive assistant, Ms. Barresi, emailed Mr. Rice, saying Mr. Pellegrini had asked her “to reach out to you regarding your purchase” of a $10,000 “diamond” sponsorship of the mayor’s Nov. 29 business development breakfast.
(King Township spokeswoman Donna Kell said Ms. Barresi contacted seven potential sponsors that day.)
A Rice Group official paid for the sponsorship the next morning. Later that day, Mr. Pellegrini introduced a motion at a King Township council meeting calling on the provincial government to fast-track approval of the new Southlake site on Mr. Rice’s land.
Mr. Pellegrini, who says he opposes the decision to open up the Greenbelt, said he worked on the resolution after hearing about the government’s announcement.
“It’s like, if you’re going to serve me up lemons, I’m gonna make lemonade out of this,” he said. “I want my hospital.”
Before introducing his motion at the Nov. 7 council meeting, Mr. Pellegrini sent the text of the resolution to Ms. Krystal, Southlake’s CEO.
In her response, Ms. Krystal thanked Mr. Pellegrini for his support and asked him to make minor changes to make the motion “less controversial,” e-mails show. Mr. Pellegrini made the edits, which included adding that the lands satisfy King’s “understanding” of the criteria for the new hospital site.
Ms. Krystal said in a statement she requested the tweaks because the Greenbelt plans “were still subject to provincial consultation and would need to be reviewed as part of our site selection process.” (The land removals became official in December.)
In the hours before the council meeting, Mr. Rice sent maps of his property to Mr. Kostopoulos, King’s chief administrative officer, and asked for a phone call so he could “pass some comments on.” That same day, Southlake’s Mr. Marshman e-mailed Mr. Rice to arrange a follow-up meeting.
Mr. Rice agreed, writing: “We are ready to review concepts.”
In late January of this year, Mr. Marshman sent the Rice Group’s Mr. Holt a list of information required by the hospital’s architects, including “current concept plans for the broader development illustrating streets and blocks” – the first hint of a larger vision for the land in the records disclosed to The Globe.
Mr. Marshman also asked if the Rice Group had contacted officials in King Township and Newmarket about sewer and water main connections.
Municipalities are wrestling with providing sewage and other services for lands freed from the Greenbelt, though the province has said it chose areas that were “on or near readily serviceable land.”
Mr. Pellegrini said figuring out how the land will be serviced is an open question. “I can barely service the lands I have now, so who’s servicing this land?”

Full text: Healing Farm packs a wallop of diversity into a small space. Half of the sevenhectare property, located just a 15-minute drive from downtown Victoria, is a magical remnant of old growth forest, fed by natural springs and populated by barred owls. The other half, on a gentle southeast-facing slope, is given over for organic food production, including almost 200 varieties of fruit and nut trees.
More than a century ago, this was a cattle ranch, but the property was overtaken by brambles when Mike and Sharyn Romaine purchased it almost 20 years ago.
The Romaines planted orchards, installed bee hives and built a free-range pen for 400 Miller Brown hens. The 135-yearold barn is packed with modern processing equipment for all the products made on site. In one section, eggs are cleaned, graded and packed. In another, any lessthan-perfect fruit is turned into juice, jam and dehydrated chips.
A nearby shack is reserved for making maple syrup tapped from the bigleaf maples in the forest.
This land, given its proximity to the city, would have been gobbled up for housing long ago, but for a policy decision made 50 years ago.
British Columbia’s small portion of arable land – the verdant valley bottoms and deltas – was being converted to housing and shopping malls at a rate of 6,000 hectares each year when Dave Barrett’s New Democratic Party government came to power in 1972.
That government did what no other province was willing to do then, or since. It passed a law in April of 1973 to preserve the province’s capacity to produce food through the creation of the Agricultural Land Reserve.
The reserve, which limits use of the land for agriculture, applies to the almost 5 per cent of the province that is deemed to be capable of being farmed productively.
Mr. Romaine was a bureaucrat who helped map out the ALR, and after a career in land stewardship, he wanted to forge his own connection with the soil in retirement.
Without the ALR, “all of this would be gone,” he says, waving a worn hand at fruit tree blossoms that were buzzing with bees on a warm spring afternoon.
While controversy swirls around the Ontario government’s plan to turn over some of the Toronto Greenbelt for housing – a potential windfall for the wealthy developer friends of Premier Doug Ford – B.C.’s armslength Agricultural Land Commission built a wall between politics and land speculators, and still serves as a bulwark against urban sprawl. It’s a barrier, however, that’s constantly tested under the pressure for new development.
“There are those among us who tend to assume that British Columbia is a land of boundless resources to be freely exploited under the guise of ‘progress,’” Agriculture Minister David Stupich wrote in 1972, announcing the intent to protect farmland.
Armed with the newly-produced Canada Land Inventory, B.C. had scientific evidence of the limits of the province’s ability to produce food. “It is essential that every effort be made to ensure that such land be preserved, not only in the interests of our agricultural industry itself, but for the common good as well.”
Mary Rawson was one of the first commissioners who helped set the boundaries of the ALR.
“We came in to yells and screams,” she recalled.
Landowners who found their lands frozen for agricultural purposes were not happy, and the commission was flooded with angry calls and letters.
Successive governments have sought to curb the land commission’s authority, but the institution has proved durable.
“Despite being battered and bruised and attacked and ignored by governments of every stripe, somehow, miraculously, it is still here,” said Joan Sawicki, who was one the commission’s original staff. Ms. Sawicki later quit her cabinet post in protest when the NDP government of the 1990s attempted to overrule the commission in favour of development.
B.C.’s agriculture sector makes up less than one per cent of the province’s gross domestic product, so as an industry, it carries little clout in government.
It’s cheaper to import a pear from Australia or a tomato from Mexico than it is to buy local.
And that, Ms. Sawicki said, is because the province has not maintained the promised aid to farmers that was supposed to accompany the land reserve in order to make them economically viable.
“We have fallen down on supporting farmers and protecting the farm community,” says Ms. Sawicki.
There is a value to local farming, however, that is not measured in pure dollars. A 2020 Metro Vancouver report estimates that B.C only produces one-third of its own food, making it vulnerable to disruptions in the supply chain.
While the province has industrial-scale farms producing supply-managed dairy, poultry and eggs, there are also thousands of small farms that cut the distance between grower and consumer.
The importance of local food production became apparent in the spring of 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic prompted border closures that disrupted international supply chains. In November of 2021, the flow of imports and exports were stalled again when extreme weather cut off all rail and highway routes between Vancouver and the B.C. Interior – isolating Canada’s biggest port for more than a week.
Without ALR, says dairy farmer Jennifer Dyson, the province’s food insecurity would be much worse. “There would be no agriculture today on Vancouver Island, in the lower mainland, in the Okanagan,” says Ms. Dyson, who raises water buffalo in the Alberni Valley, and is the current chair of the Agricultural Land Commission.
Despite the commission’s value to the region, as it marks its 50th birthday, it still faces a barrage of applications for exclusions – each asking for a small nibble of the whole. “It would be death by guppy bites,” she said.
The insatiable demand for real estate is only growing more acute. A 2016 Globe and Mail investigation tracked how investors and speculators exploit loopholes to build mega mansions and other unintended development on protected farmland, driving up land prices. Today, realtors routinely promote ALR properties for developing luxury estates with low farm taxes.
“We never can take our foot off the gas,” Ms. Dyson said.
Although the ALR saved farmland near the cities, the commission watches as farmers disappear from that land, due to lack of financial support.
On the first sunny day in April, Bryce Rashleigh was organizing a small fleet of John Deere tractors to prepare the fields where he will be planting barley to supply a brewery in Victoria, just 18 kilometres away.
The Rashleigh family has been farming on Vancouver Island for more than a century, but Mr. Rashleigh sold the main family property years ago, and Saanichton Farms is now a little more than two hectares. The small farm is a keystone for agriculture in the community: With all the tractors, grain silos and milling equipment onsite, Mr. Rashleigh is caretaker for about 90 properties whose farmers have retired or sold out.
“The first moments of tillage of 2023,” he pronounced with satisfaction as he watched his crew – most of them over the age of 75 – plough tidy lines in the soil.
There isn’t a lot of money in farming, he said, “but I get to live my dream.”
He recalls his father railing against the Barrett government for creating the ALR. Today, Mr. Rashleigh sees the need for land protection. But his fellow farmers are disappearing and the future is uncertain. “The ALR saved the farmland. But it didn’t save the farmer.”

Full text: The New Earth Jess Row (HarperCollins, March) In his previous books, including the brilliant Your Face in Mine, Jess Row forayed into the welltrod territory of race and identity, but in a way that felt thrillingly provocative rather than buttonpushing. He continues that bent (even takes it up a notch, with an Israel-Palestine side narrative) in his ambitious latest, dubbed “magisterial” by one prominent outlet, about an unhappy Jewish family from New York’s Upper West Side beset by issues of what and how to be.
White Cat, Black Dog Kelly Link (Random House, March) The Pulitzer finalist’s new collection is a series of wonderfully strange and funny retellings of classic fairy tales and lore. Borges meets Succession in the first, in which a young man enlists the help of a green-eyed white cat who runs a rural cannabis operation to fulfill a series of increasingly capricious requests from his billionaire father as the latter grapples with choosing an heir from among his three sons.
The Colony of Good Hope Kim Leine (Pan MacMillan, April) First published in Danish in 2019, now in an English translation that impressively captures its polyphonic narrative, Kim Leine’s historical novel takes us to early 18th-century Greenland, where Denmark’s King Frederik IV has dispatched an expedition to discover the fate of a colony he established there some years previously. It’s not a pretty picture.
The colonizers are plagued by the usual stuff – scurvy, smallpox, consumption – but also by Aappaluttoq, a local shaman who claims, through his timetravelling powers, to have seen Jesus nailed to the cross, and who unnerves the interlopers by predicting the death of their monarch.
The Covenant of Water Abraham Verghese (Grove, May) The Addis Ababa-born American doctor’s second novel is even heftier than his substantial, bestselling first, Cutting for Stone (2009).
As in the latter, surgery features prominently in this multigenerational story that begins in 1900, on India’s Malabar Coast, where a 12-year-old girl has been promised in marriage to a 40-year-old widower with a young son whose family has been disproportionately afflicted by drownings.
Counterintuitively, she’s being sent there by boat.
The Postcard Anne Berest (Europa, May) Anne Berest’s sweeping autofictional family saga, which traces threads of antisemitism in France from the Holocaust to the present day, has been a sensation in that country, scooping up a basketful of prizes, and being made a finalist for the prestigious Goncourt.
Berest herself has an intriguing pedigree: On top of being a Chanel ambassador and actress, she’s the great-granddaughter of avant-garde artist Francis Picabia and French Resistance fighter Gabriele Buffet-Picabia, Marcel Duchamp’s one-time lover and muse.
August Blue Deborah Levy (Hamish Hamilton, June) A new novel by Deborah Levy is always cause for celebration. This one, the first on the heels of her critically lauded “living autobiography,” is about a classical pianist who tries to buy – as one does – some mechanical dancing horses at an Athens flea market, only to be scooped by a woman who may (or may not) be her doppelganger. A chase, real and existential, across Europe ensues.
Dreaming Home Lucian Childs (Biblioasis, June) This queer coming-of-age, told as a series of interlinked stories from six points of view over a 40year period, is based in part on the author’s experiences in AIDSera San Francisco. Americanborn, Toronto-based Lucian Childs, as you’ll glean from that last detail, came of age some time ago, but is still embracing new rites of passage: Though his stories have appeared in literary journals since the early aughts, he’s making his book-publishing debut at the tender age of 74.
Let It Destroy You Harriet Alida Lye (M&S, June) Agent Orange, leaded gas, the internet – to the long list of well-intended inventions gone wrong you can add the cobalt bomb, which the Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard developed in the 1950s with the aim of curing his daughter’s cancer, but which (counterproductively) turned out to be capable of destroying the entire world. Inspired by the letters Szilard wrote to his wife, Trude Weiss, over two decades, Harriet Alida Lye’s novel begins with a Szilard-based character awaiting trial at the International War Crimes Court in The Hague before taking readers back to the origins of his infernal creation.
The Whispers Ashley Audrain (Penguin, June) In her first novel, a buzzy psychological thriller titled The Push, the former publicity director of Penguin Canada took some wellaimed swings at the temple of white middle-class motherhood.
She continues that desecration in her second, which opens with picture-perfect suburban barbecue, where a mom publicly loses her cool and subjects her child to a potty-mouthed tirade. Bad enough, but later that night he falls from his bedroom window and ends up hospitalized.
Outsider Brett Popplewell (HarperCollins, April) Brett Popplewell dubs his enigmatic subject, Dag Aabye – who overcame an ignominious start after his unwed mother left him at an orphanage in Nazi-occupied Norway to forge a career as a Hollywood stunt double and extreme skier – “the last of the Ubermensch.” Aabye would later give it all up to live as a virtual recluse in a school bus on the side of a mountain in B.C.’s Okanagan Valley, where today, at 81, he runs ridiculous distances day and night, and is one of the oldest known ultramarathoners.
Pathogenesis: A History of the World in Eight Plagues Jonathan Kennedy (M&S/Signal, April) We may be done with plagues, but plagues aren’t done with us, if history is anything to go by – and it generally is. The author, a British sociologist, looks at the form plagues have taken from paleolithic through industrial times, and at how various “great men” – Charlemagne, Martin Luther, George Washington among them – have taken advantage of the political opportunities epidemics sometimes create. During COVID, people used the term “unprecedented” a lot; they won’t after reading this book.
The Ugly History of Beautiful Things: Essays on Desire and Consumption Katy Kelleher (Simon & Schuster, April) A lifelong interest in the attraction-repulsion dynamic, which she relates to her struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts, led Katy Kelleher to write this elegantly written compendium of aesthetically pleasing things and the unpleasing reality that lurks beneath them. A case in point are perfumes, some of which rely on the chemical compounds found in feces and decaying corpses as well the anal-gland secretions of purposefully terrified civets for their heavenly scents.
Unearthing: A Story of Tangled Love and Family Secrets Kyo Maclear (Knopf, April) When Kyo Maclear decided to do a DNA test following the 2018 death of her father, it wasn’t out of any sense of “fetishistic wonder” about her mixed-race origins (her Japanese mother, Mariko, was an art student when she met the Canadian journalist Michael Maclear while the latter was on assignment in Tokyo in the late 1960s). Maclear’s subsequent discovery that Michael wasn’t her biological father – and that her mother knew this – was the spark for this book, which relates the award-winning children’s author’s ensuing journey in contemplative fragments.
Enter Ghost Isabella Hammad (Grove, April) The young Palestinian writer’s new novel, after the stellar The Parisian, is centred around a performance of Hamlet, not in the West End, but in the West Bank, after the main character, an actor named Sonia, comes from London to visit her sister in Haifa. The book is about the sometimes uncomfortable intersection between art and life, but the tension is there right on the book’s opening page, with Sonia getting stripsearched upon her arrival in Israel.
Grimmish Michael Winkler (Coach House, April) Michael Winkler’s novel was a cult sensation in his native Australia, where it was the first selfpublished book in history to be shortlisted for the country’s most prestigious prize, the Miles Franklin Award (one publisher rejected it as “repellent”). A fictionalized account of the life of the Rasputin-like Italian-American boxer Joe Grim (b. 1881), who went from Australia’s national boxing circuit to a mental asylum in Perth, the novel has amassed some stellar blurbs, including from Helen Garner “meets a need I didn’t know I had” and J.M. Coetzee: “The strangest book you are likely to read this year.” Places Like These Lauren Carter (Book*hug, April) A first collection of stories by the novelist and poet whose last book, This Has Nothing to Do With You, won the Margaret Laurence Award for Fiction at the Manitoba Book Awards (where she was also declared the province’s most promising writer). Despite some far-flung locales – Argentina, Hawaii, Ecuador, San Francisco – the focus of these tales is on the inside of their characters’ minds, and the seemingly inconclusive moments that make up their lives.
Snow Road Station Elizabeth Hay (Knopf, April) The 2008 financial crash provides a background score for the Gillerwinner’s quiet new novel about Lulu, a sexagenarian actress who, after flubbing her lines while performing Beckett in Ottawa (“Can’t you make it up? Who would know?” asks an ex-lover on behalf of all of us), beats it to the home of her old friend Nan, who’s been living a decidedly unBeckettian existence in the Northern Ontario town of the title.
The Berry Pickers Amanda Peters (HarperCollins, April) Amanda Peters’s 1962-set debut was inspired by her Mi’kmaq father’s stories about crossing the border from Nova Scotia into Maine each summer to pick berries with other Indigenous labourers. From that setup emerges a tale that moves between past and present to show the reverberations for a Mi’kmaq family whose four-year-old daughter is stolen during berry-picking season and raised by a local white family.
This Is Not Miami Fernanda Melchor (New Directions, April) Many of the stories in this collection by an author hailed as the next big thing in Latin American literature are written in a genre known as cronica, a blend of reportage and interpretation that has no obvious equivalent in English. Set in and around Veracruz, Fernanda Melchor’s hometown, each is spare and grippingly devastating in its own way, as with the tale of a glitzy carnival queen who, in 1989, murdered her two young boys and buried their remains in planter pots on her balcony.
A Grandmother Begins the Story Michelle Porter (Viking, May) A kind of novel-in-the-round told from the viewpoints of five Métis women from different generations (at least one of whom isn’t alive). Salty, irreverent humour abounds, even in ostensibly serious situations; to wit: a woman’s estranged grandmother calls and asks for help killing herself, then acts put out when she refuses: “Like I said, I never met her before she dropped this on me. And she didn’t have the guts to ask in person.” Landscapes Christine Lai (Doubleday, May) After her English country estate is brought to the edge ruin by a series of ecological disasters, a woman sets about creating an archive of its books and art before its scheduled demolition and the arrival of her partner’s brother, at whose hands she suffered violence two decades previously.
Written in the form of a diary, this first novel by the Vancouverbased, British-educated Christine Lai was shortlisted for the inaugural Novel Prize, offered by New Directions Publishing, Fitzcarraldo Editions and Giramondo Publishing.
The Adult Bronwyn Fischer (Random House, May) In this coming-of-age-and-out first novel, Natalie, an 18-year-old freshman, arrives at U of T from Northern Ontario and almost immediately gets drawn into a relationship with Nora, a divorced grant writer who lives off-campus, prompting a grappling with innocence and identity: “When Nora spoke,” muses Natalie, “it felt like a trick.”

Full text: 228 26 Ave. S.W., No. 502, Calgary MISSION Asking price: $2,294,990 (March, 2023) Previous asking price: $2,394,990 (February, 2023) Selling price: $2.125-million (March, 2023) Taxes: $8,751 (2022) Property days on market: 27 Listing agent: Christina Hagerty, Re/Max Realty Professionals THE ACTION The Grandview is a well-known high-rise on the Elbow River, and some locals keep a sharp eye out for units to free up.
When this 2,517-square-foot suite with views to the north, south and west hit the market there was immediate interest, even though many of its target buyers were still in their wintertime southern residences.
“We had two potential buyers immediately, but both families weren’t ready. But normally, this is a building that people wait to get in,” agent Christina Hagerty said.
“It’s on the river pathway system, steps from grocery stores, a wine store, parks, restaurants, etc. So many residents who downsized from their large family homes in Mount Royal, Elbow Park and Rideau – and belong to the Glencoe Club – love the Grandview.”
Despite its merits, price was a stumbling block. Over three weeks, 50 visitors toured the unit before the asking price was trimmed by $100,000. Within 48 hours, a bid came in at $2.125-million – a further $169,900 reduction from the revised asking price – that was accepted by the seller.
“We set a new high price per square foot for a unit that needed renovation,” Ms. Hagerty said.
“It sure feels like 2008 with the rest of the country going through corrections, whilst Calgary’s condo market may see a resurgence of 10- to 15-per-cent increase before the end of the year.”
WHAT THEY GOT The property is actually two units purchased 16 years ago and combined into one large corner suite. There are three balconies and three bedrooms, all with walk-in closets and full bathrooms.
There is a large kitchen, open dining area and a living room with a fireplace.
The unit comes with two parking spots. Monthly fees of $2,292 cover water and heating.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “Less than 5 per cent of condos in the city of Calgary are over 2,000 square feet, so there is a very limited amount of units with larger square footages,” Ms. Hagerty said.

As author James E. Barfield trots up the steps of Macon, Ga.’s 1842 Inn, he points to a corner window.
“I used to live there in the 1970s,” he says, adding that, before the antebellum house was converted into a hotel, it contained rental apartments. These days, he lives in a grand home just down the road, and knows more about historic Macon than most people after having penned a number of books on its architecture.
To hear Mr. Barfield talk, one gets the sense that, despite the Georgia city’s renewed commitment to tourism, new restaurants, and downtown loft conversions, it still boasts small town qualities; it continues to be a place where the buildings and places that mark the different decades of one’s life still stand.
And the same applies with the city’s small yet impactful grouping of mid-century modern buildings, which happens to be the topic of Mr. Barfield’s new book (which features the expert photography of Walter G. Elliott), Mid-Century Macon 1945-1969: they’re all still here, albeit some in better shape than others. And because buildings that are (usually) more than 100 years old outnumber them a 100 to one, they also seem to cluster together for protection.
Mr. Barfield begins our architour, fittingly, near the Ocmulgee River and the industrial part of town. Here, floating above its parking lot, is the former 100room Town Pavilion Motel (1960), a swoopy concrete affair designed by New Orleans-born Bernard Webb (1915-2000), who worked for Macon’s Ellamae E.
League (more on her later) from 1936 to 1941 and then, after the war, returned to Macon to set up his own shop in 1946.
Just down the road is the vacant-since-2013 headquarters of the Macon Telegraph (1961, Hall & Ferguson). “And I’m going take the time for you, because you’re crazy about terrazzo, to let you go and peer through that glass into the lobby.” I’m glad he does, because the curved staircase is spectacular. A report from June, 2021, suggests the building’s future might be less-spectacular storage units.
Our second destination takes us across the river to the winding and deeply wooded streets of the Shirley Hills Historic District to see a cluster of spectacular MCM homes. Developed by an employee of Frederick Law Olmsted in 1921 on a former estate, we stop in first on a friend of Mr. Barfield’s. Interestingly, she lives in a house not designed by the small cadre of Macon modernists, but rather by Harry (Bo) McEwen, who usually designed in the “classic” style but obliged his clients with a somewhat safe, sprawling ranch style with hints of Frank Lloyd Wright.
“I think he did very well for somebody who is not known for his mid-century modern,” Mr. Barfield says. “Bo McEwen did a lot of good architecture, but then he had opportunities in Tampa and he moved there and became very well known in the late 20th century.”
We next pull over to admire the house Joe and Mary Jane League had built in 1950. While only a carport and row of clerestories are visible from the road, the little house, designed by Joe’s sister, Jean League Newton (their mom was Ellamae League), is important for being celebrated in Progressive Architecture magazine in 1953 and, more recently, for being the first modernist house in Macon to be individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Ellamae League’s own house, from 1941, is next. Born in 1899, League came from a line of architects – all men – but didn’t see why she couldn’t join the profession, so, in 1922, the single mother of two began apprenticing at Dunwody and Oliphant; and since she was something of a novelty, she made regular appearances in the local newspapers.
While the home is “pre-midcentury modern” and certainly looks more like a Laurel Canyon/ bohemian cabin in the woods, Mr. Barfield invites us to peek in the window (it’s okay, the home is now owned by the Historic Macon Foundation) to see the contrast. And what a contrast: crisp clean trim and flooring, a mirrored wall over the sleek fireplace, a pair of Brno chairs and a large, gridded window.
From Ms. League to Cher and Andy Warhol: well, a 1964 house on the opposite end of Shirley Hills that once played host to legendary parties by Capricorn Records founder Phil Walden when he owned it in the 1970s.
Designed by Macon-born Jackson (Jack) Riley Holliday (19222003), it’s striking for its zoomy butterfly-shaped carport in front, and its three-storey tall window in the rear.
“Unfortunately I was not invited to any of the Capricorn Records parties here,” says Mr. Barfield, a former history teacher, with a laugh. “Although I met, and was with, Gregg Allman a few times.”
Back over the river, we tour the Ingleside neighbourhood, which contains the “most midcentury modern street in town,” North and South Hillandale Circle, but stop first at 373 Vista Circle to see Jack Holliday’s own 1959 house. Described by Mr. Barfield in the book as the “epitome of mid-century modern,” it’s a low-slung, post-and-beam stunner on that boasts warm brick on the outside and a floating terrazzo stair on the inside. “The Cherokee Brick and Tile Co. [in Macon] kept a special supply of this brick for Jack Holliday because he used it on a number of houses,” he says.
We next cruise N. and S. Hillandale to see many of the houses featured in the book; while many are relatively conservative on the outside, particularly striking is a 1959 Jack Holliday with a tall post-and-beam gable, and one by architect Bill Thompson, which features a lush, interior courtyard.
We end our architour, fittingly, by visiting Mr. Barfield’s friend – and the book’s photographer – Walter Elliott at his home nearby.
Lower than the street, the 1951 Bernard Webb-designed home presents itself as a dramatic series of flat-roofed pavilions. After asking our opinion on some new flooring, Mr. Elliott gives us the grand tour; notable is the massive brick fireplace and the sliding doors that are still adorned with New Yorker magazine covers applied by the home’s first owner, Vera Heck. Since Mr. Elliott purchased from the Heck family, even the colour scheme of chartreuse and Chinese red remains.
“When I was four years old, my mother and I were driving by here – the house had just been built – and I said ‘Mom, look at this house, isn’t it neat?’ and she said ‘Well, everyone to their own tastes said the old lady as she kissed the cow.’ I said ‘You don’t like it do you?’ and she said ‘It’s too moderne.’” A building that marked Mr. Elliott’s early life, now his to treasure and protect.

Full text: VANCOUVER The new 242-acre park proposed for Bowen Island may include some of the most treasured coastline in B.C., but it is also the culmination of two decades of controversy involving a battle over new density and the threat to sensitive forest and coastal bluff.
“It got really ugly,” says islander Marian Bantjes, who’s lived on Bowen for 22 years. The island, part of Metro Vancouver, is a 20minute ferry ride from West Vancouver, about the size of Manhattan Island but with a population of 4,256 and has a mayor and municipal council.
The fate of the park could be decided any day now, and for island residents, it will come down to a question of single-family houses versus a park with campsites.
It all started in 2004 when a family sold off 618 acres of stunning forest it had owned for decades, along the island’s southwest coastline, previously called Cape Roger Curtis, now known as The Cape. Don Ho, a Vancouverbased developer, along with fellow developer Edwin Lee, purchased the property for $16-million.
For decades, residents had treated the land as a highly prized, publicly accessible quasiconservation area. Plans to develop the land, adding significant density – much more than the 224 allowed under the Official Community Plan – along with park and coastline protection, drew an angry response from residents.
Bowen Island is largely a bedroom community, accessible by a small ferry. It is sorely lacking in infrastructure and residents fear development will overtax those assets.
A scaled down development plan was also rejected and the developers moved to convert the property into 59 partially cleared 10-acre lots, with driveways, water wells and electrical. Some areas were logged and large docks were built for a few of the priciest waterfront estates.
“I used to go in there before it happened, and it was a thick dense forest with areas that were prehistoric with six-foot-high ferns, like a jungle,” says Marian Bantjes, who’s lived on Bowen for 22 years. “I live on the route. Eight logging trucks would go by in the morning and afternoon. It was horrible.”
In 2014, Mr. Ho said he planned to sell off the remaining lots. “In any case, this property is now being showcased to a global market,” he told the local news outlet, the Bowen Island Undercurrent. However, a buyer wasn’t found and Mr. Ho’s daughter, Candy Ho, helped the owners sell two dozen lots over the years. A few big houses sprang up, with the owners putting strict environmental covenants in place.
Ms. Ho says she turned down one buyer who wanted to install a pool. Many lots remained empty.
Today one of the houses is on the market for $18.6-million.
In 2019, Ms. Ho was made the chief executive officer of The Cape on Bowen Community Development Ltd., the investor group spearheading the development plan. Ms. Ho was tasked with not only finding new investors to purchase the remaining acreage, but to “heal the wounds” on both sides.
Two years ago, she tried for another rezoning of the 32 remaining lots. She worked to regain the community’s trust, engaging with the residents and sharing her plan to create a new subdivision for close to 400 units, including assisted living and rental units. There’d be a regenerative farm and eco-spiritual leadership retreat. However, it would require considerable disruption of the land and more burden on the infrastructure. It didn’t go over well.
In 2020 an anonymous buyer offered to buy three of the development group’s best waterfront lots and donate the 32 acres to the community as park land, to be run by a conservancy. After some negotiation, Ms. Ho sold the lots for a reported $8.8-million.
Ms. Ho took this as a sign that conservation, not necessarily development, was the right path forward. It became economically viable, and it also fit with her growing appreciation for the land. She asked shareholders within the development group to hold off on selling the remaining coastline lots to give her time to find another conservancy-minded group who might buy the land at a price close to market value and protect it.
Ms. Ho set out to find such a buyer.
“The conservancy set a new precedent at market value … that made it possible. This is not pie in the sky anymore,” she remembers thinking.
Ms. Ho said that the intention had always been to preserve the area as a park. As to why the land set aside for park was subdivided into single-family lots, Ms. Ho says shareholders wanted to protect themselves from any unexpected down zoning.
She already sensed that she should cancel the rezoning application. A survey that showed only 39 per cent of residents were in favour of her master plan confirmed her decision.
“In the past I didn’t have the ability to listen or feel the land, but I spent so much time there, it was actually the land that guided me to close the master plan rezoning,” Ms. Ho said.
Last year, a conditional agreement was reached with Metro Vancouver to purchase 24 lots for about $40-million. However, the proposal still has to go through the island’s rezoning process, and residents have mounted a petition against a proposed campsite because the ferry service is already stretched. Others are thrilled with the idea of it being protected in perpetuity as park.
Metro’s annual parks budget is $27-million, so it isn’t a decision that’s being made lightly, says Michael Wiebe, Metro’s former vicechair on the regional parks committee, who championed the park proposal. He’s sympathetic with island residents because of a constrained timeline, but he says it’s a huge opportunity to recover land and rewild it.
“Fifty years from now, you won’t be able to buy properties of this size. You don’t get a lot of opportunities like this, to take developable land, these 10-acre parcels, and put them in public lands.”
For islanders, after years of vitriol, the future of the Cape comes down to a question of campsites versus single-family homes. Ms. Bantjes says she is not a fan of allowing the construction of more houses for the rich, but she believes they’d be less impactful to the island than a busy campsite.
“It’s a weird situation for myself to be against a park, but it comes at the cost of our community. If they could get people in there without coming through the ferry system, I’d be all for it.”
Resident David Hocking says the land is a valuable public resource for the Lower Mainland.
Mr. Hocking was a Bowen Island councillor and Metro Vancouver director until last fall.
“For the most part it’s still in wonderful condition. … There are about 15 plants that are endangered or rare. So there is a lot that is worth protecting. It’s not as if it’s in pristine condition, but it’s in pretty great shape,” he says.
“There is a lot of ecological value there, and 700 metres of waterfront. It’s a coastal dry bluff ecosystem that is rare in B.C.”
The alternative to the park, he says, is more big houses. He points out that if the remaining lots get built out as homes, the ferries will be used to transport construction materials for several years. A big house can take two or three years to build.
“We need affordable housing, and we certainly don’t get that with really giant homes on 10acre lots. … I’d rather see that land as park, as much as possible.”

Full text: VANCOUVER British Columbia Premier David Eby’s new housing plan calls for more missing middle housing – a new term for a throwback type of housing when families lived in bungalow courts and fourplexes, and enjoyed an affordable lifestyle surrounded by gardens and play areas.
In California, bungalow courts proliferated in the 1920s and 1930s, often situated within single-family neighbourhoods or as a transition into higher-density apartments. The housing type consisted of small bungalows in a U-shape around a courtyard.
They co-existed with other housing types such as stacked triplexes, courtyard buildings, fourplexes and rowhouses.
Vancouver has a few such examples that remain from the period, in Strathcona, Mount Pleasant and Kitsilano. In Los Angeles, much of these types of housing disappeared by the 1940s because of parking requirements, says Aaron van Schaik, founder and principal of Los-Angeles based architecture and development firm SuperLA.
It’s one thing to add supply, but it’s another to create well-designed, sustainable housing that people want to live in for the long-term. Inspired by the bungalow courts of yesteryear, Mr. van Schaik has designed a “SuperBungalow” that takes the idea of a bungalow court and structures it vertically, while maintaining the original high livability concept of abundant garden space and exterior entry ways.
And there are no shared walls, which give the units a detached house feel. He’s updated the concept with a high degree of sustainability, using prefabricated Canadian mass-timber panels, as well as a quicker construction timeline to keep costs manageable.
“[Bungalow courts] were a great product, and they were a ‘set product’ most of the time and repeated [design] across multiple projects,” says the Australian born designer and builder. “They quickly got pushed out when parking requirements came in, and now you can’t build them anymore based on that.”
Mr. van Schaik worked on development projects in Australia before working for a dozen years in Brooklyn on multifamily and industrial projects. He moved to Los Angeles to realize his vision for a low-density, walkable building type that goes against development industry convention.
New York buildings were too dense to redevelop, but in Los Angeles, he says, he could easily find single-family house lots to densify with his SuperBungalow.
Mr. van Schaik’s company does every aspect of development, from acquisition through to design, construction and management of the rental building.
They completed their nine-unit Marathon Street project in August, and later this year they get started on their 15-unit Hyperion Avenue project, which will include two affordable units for very low incomes, mandated by the city. The affordable units will be identical to the market-rate units, with no physical division between them. They’ve also included required parking spaces.
Both buildings are in the walkable Silver Lake neighbourhood, and both sites were formerly single-family houses that were already zoned multifamily.
Late last year, his designs trended for a few days on Twitter.
“The mayor’s office has reached out to us after hearing about our projects,” Mr. van Schaik says. “We have been talking to different groups. It’s definitely a focus of Los Angeles and pro housing groups, to create a walkable neighbourhood.”
Single-family zoning has become a controversial topic in recent years in major cities in the U.S. and Canada. Oregon made single-family zoning illegal in cities of more than 10,000 people.
California adopted a controversial law that allows up to four units on a single-family lot. In Los Angeles, 74 per cent of residential land is zoned for singlefamily housing, according to University of California, Berkeley.
In Vancouver, about half of the city is zoned ‘single family,’ which is a misnomer because for several years the city has allowed secondary suites and laneway houses. Premier Eby’s four-point housing plan includes allowing three or four units on a singlefamily lot. Once passed, the new legislation will mean that if a multiunit project meets setback and size rules, the local council must pass it. The premier said condominium units aren’t always as suitable for families, and neighbourhoods need more small-scale multiunit projects.
In its quest to find missing middle housing types, Vancouver developers could look to SuperLA’s efficiencies through standardized, prefabricated design, rather than one-off customized designs and traditional construction methods that take a lot of time to go through permitting.
The irony is that mass timber panels are readily available in B.C. However, the local industry generally takes a traditional approach that’s served it well, and that usually means concrete towers, which are criticized for their lack of sustainability and lack of livability compared to groundoriented housing. The 30-year Broadway Plan includes a significant number of 18- to 40-storey towers but without requirements to build with mass timber, which can go to 12-storeys. Instead, there are vague policies to make it easier to build with low-carbon materials.
Architect Alan Boniface, who works on master-planned communities with large developers, argues that the concrete tower is the best way to add density, which is urgently needed in a region that added an estimated 55,000 new immigrants last year.
“To be honest, the concrete tower is pretty efficient. It goes up quickly,” Mr. Boniface says. “A floor gets poured every six days or so, because the industry here knows how to build that quickly.
And that isn’t where the expense is – other than the construction and labour [costs] going up. We have to build taller in Vancouver, based on land costs.”
Land costs, he says are exacerbated by development levies and community amenity contributions, which can be considerable.
As well, there is the inflated cost of a land assembly when homeowners are paid a premium for their properties.
Mr. van Schaik hopes to scale his business model so that he can bring it to other North American cities, maybe even Vancouver one day. He wants to revolutionize the development industry so that instead of cranking out square footage, there’s more focus on bright and airy spaces and health and wellness.
SuperLA units incorporate exposed timber throughout and use solar power and heat pumps, filtered air and water, rainwater capture and low VOC-emitting materials. Importing mass timber panels from Quebec isn’t ideal for reducing carbon, he admits, but these are early days and Quebec’s Nordic Structures manufactures a particularly strong black spruce cross-laminated timber which results in a finely grained, blonde wood, beautiful for exposed applications.
In the spirit of the old bungalow court, they are developing their one- and two-bedroom projects as standardized designs intended for prefabricated reproduction, as opposed to the oneoff customized design. Their onebedroom and one-bathroom unit is 660 square feet. with a 150-sq.-ft. terrace. The two-bedroom unit is 1,320 sq. ft. with a 250-sq.-ft. terrace.
“We have two set home types that we are repeating across all of our projects. And the efficiencies we gain from that is, from a design standpoint, we don’t need to spend hundreds of man-hours designing every single feature of that building.
“We take our home type and we copy it across to the next project and then backfill around the units themselves with circulation and egress,” he says, referring to the breezeway passages between the units, the large terraces, the void spaces to allow trees and the external staircases at each end of the complex.
“So the design timeline for us means we can really design a full building in a couple of weeks as opposed to six to eight months.”
The schedule for framing the five-storey Hyperion is four weeks, using panels that have been prerouted to allow for mechanical, electrical and plumbing. SuperLA has their own small manufacturing facility for doing millwork and some prefabrication. The majority of the design for Hyperion had already been used on their first project, so they’re moving through the permitting process quicker. That process will get faster once they’ve nailed down the design and standardized the model.
“And long term, we want to work with the city of L.A. and other jurisdictions to approve our homes.
“L.A. has a standard plan program for additional dwelling units so if you want to add an additional dwelling in your backyard you can use one of the L.A.D.B.S. (Los Angeles Department of Building & Safety) approved standard plans. So we want to be the first to basically take that standard plan model and apply it to a multifamily product type, and that would allow us to skip most of the permitting on our homes as well, in the long run.”

The ups and downs of high-rise elevators: A push for increased density has led to taller buildings, but residents struggle with elevator wait times

Full text: Mridul Sharma, a 27-yearold political analyst, lives with a roommate in a condo near the top of a 45-storey tower in City Place. Their unit is next to one of the four elevators, so they’ve worked out a life hack to deal with the wait times. One will run out, push the button, and then go back to the apartment to finish getting ready to leave.
Sometimes, the wait can run up to 10 minutes if they’re leaving during a morning or evening rush.
Mr. Sharma says he’s basically adjusted his habits so as to avoid the vertical traffic jams. “You’re not even thinking about it, but you know you’re doing it,” he observes, noting the crowds that gather in the lobby to board the tower’s four lifts, at least one of which is usually out of service. “There’s literally a line-up most of the day.”
Nor is waiting the only problem. In theory, residents can use the stairs, but for security reasons, they can only exit on their own floors (with a key fob) or at the ground level, which means even getting to the party room or the fitness room requires a trip on the elevator. And if you’re high up, as Mr. Mridul is, climbing the stairs is pretty much out of the question.
The pandemic and social distancing requirements revealed the problems with high-rise elevators, yet residents of Greater Toronto’s increasingly tall towers have long known about the chronic maintenance issues, delays and other headaches, like getting trapped for almost an hour, as happened to Mr. Mridul on his way to work earlier this week.
“I think the issue of the dependency of residents in very tall buildings on the elevator system is a very important one with respect to quality of life, safety and health,” says University of Toronto engineering professor Eric Miller, an expert on regional transportation planning. He adds that the “non-trivial” waits likely add to the amount of time it takes apartment dwellers to reach their destinations, a key metric in transportation planning.
Now, as the City of Toronto moves to approve an entirely new generation of so-called “supertalls,” the issue of elevator adequacy is likely to, well, rise to the surface of the planning debate.
For example, the provincial government last week unveiled a much higher density plan for midtown, which allows developers to add an additional 700 storeys on projects planned for the Yonge and Eglinton area. Another major application, at Yonge and Steeles, calls for several towers up to 50 storeys. And many of the point towers in the development pipeline downtown will rise to 70 storeys or higher; one planned for Balmuto and Bloor will be 94 floors.
“I don’t think people talk enough about the elevator situation,” says lawyer April Engelberg, who ran for council last fall in Fort York-Spadina and canvassed in dozens of tall buildings. “But it’s definitely a deterrent for people to live in the super high rises.”
On tight development sites with small floor plates, the question of elevator capacity often comes down to a zero-sum game: more elevator shafts, which are common area conveniences, mean less saleable floor space.
High-rise architect Richard Witt, a principal at BDP Quadrangle who is active on the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, points out that technologically advanced elevators, which move at high speeds – 20 metres a second – and are optimized using smart dispatch systems, have become increasingly common. Modern office buildings can be fitted out with doubledecker elevators or elevators that can shift horizontally between shafts using mag-lev technology.
These systems have been created by the handful of global elevator giants – firms like Otis, Thyssen Elevator, KONE and Schindler.
The industry generates tens of billions of dollars in sales every year, with most of the largest players also earning hefty maintenance fees.
While such brands are extremely common in condo point towers, those systems tend to be more basic. In a tower with only 10 to 12 units a floor, the economics of an expensive or state-of-the-art system, like those found in new office towers, tend not to work.
There are some design tweaks that can ameliorate elevator headaches. Mr. Witt, for instance, is working on a Cortel Group project, the 60-storey CG Tower in Vaughan, Ont., which is constructed in four increasingly narrow segments. To make the servicing more efficient, his design creates separate lifts for the parking, situates the amenity rooms half way up and provides elevator service to dedicated sets of floors, as is done in many office towers.
Strangely, there are no standards that determine the minimum elevator capacity in a tower of any height, beyond a building code requirement that there must be one service elevator. Mr. Witt says the industry used to work with an informal rule of thumb – one elevator per 10 floors. Now, he adds, the calculus is “more complicated” and tends to be outsourced to specialists. (One of the leading local practitioners, Jonathan Soberman, declined an interview.)
The question of standards has come up before. In 2018, Ontario’s Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA) released a 78page “elevator availability” report (see sidebar) written by Justice Douglas Cunningham as part of a legislative effort to address concerns about service and reliability.
Among his recommendations: that all new buildings be fitted out with enough elevators to serve peak period traffic, with those figures based on a transparent standard developed by an organization like the Canadian Standards Association.
He also called for the use of traffic studies for elevators serving high-rises, not unlike those required by municipal planners as part of their due diligence on development applications. “A standard approach to traffic analyses will ensure appropriate elevator capacity at the time of construction,” Justice Cunningham wrote.
(The report’s recommendations, which responded in part to a private member’s bill, didn’t turn into policy.)
Phil Staite, who heads the Canadian Elevator Contractors Association and runs one of Greater Toronto’s long-established firms, Markham-based Quality Allied Elevator, says that Justice Cunningham’s proposal for elevator traffic studies is long overdue.
“You can have a great building with a great view, but it’s under elevated.”
The maintenance problems that afflict many high-rises, he explains, are due to inadequate upkeep, increasingly complex technology that breaks down and the high level of usage in very tall buildings with hundreds of units but only a handful of lifts. “The elevators are overloaded,” Mr. Staite says. He adds a warning: “If you’re talking about all these buildings going [up] and you put them in without enough elevators, then you’ve got a problem.”
For his part, Mr. Sharma would like to see more buildings emulate what was done at One Bloor East, the city’s first super-tall, and the home of some friends. It has about twice the number of elevators as his own building, and they each serve banks of floors instead of the entire tower. “It just manages the crowd well,” he says. “On my experience, I’ve realized that it’s way smoother.”

Facing mandatory upgrades, care homes opt to close instead: Property sell-offs to housing developers impede Ontario’s vow to ease the nursing-home crunch

Full text: For-profit nursing homes in Canada’s largest city are vacating the sector rather than undertaking mandatory upgrades, creating a property sell-off that hinders the Ontario government’s promise of 60,000 new and upgraded beds by 2028.
The problem stems from two colliding forces: Toronto’s red-hot real estate market and a looming deadline for outdated homes to comply with design standards requiring single- or double-occupancy rooms. Faced with a choice between significant construction costs or selling their properties to housing developers, many nursing-home owners are opting for the latter, a Globe and Mail investigation has found.
Although this is an issue across the province – 20 for-profit homes in Ontario whose licences will expire in June, 2025, are not planning to modernize their buildings, according to a Globe analysis – it is particularly acute in Toronto, where six of the facilities are located and where demand for beds is four times higher than the provincial average.
Those six homes account for more than 9 per cent of the city’s long-term care beds. The owners of three of those homes have either closed or are closing their facilities and have sold the land to developers: Cedarvale Terrace for $32-million, Vermont Square for $11-million and Garden Court Nursing Home for $5.5-million. The other three have not submitted plans to update their facilities and face an uncertain future, with one of them operating under a temporary licence.
Elder-care advocates anticipate that more homes will close their doors, underscoring the risks of private, for-profit ownership in Ontario’s long-term care sector.
FROM A1 They expect the owners of some outdated homes will ask the government to simply terminate their licences when they expire.
For-profit companies own almost 60 per cent of the province’s 626 nursing homes, the highest share in Canada. The provincial government has little ability to provide nursing-home care in certain locations when it doesn’t own the assets or the operating licences, said Samir Sinha, the head of geriatrics at Sinai Health System in Toronto.
“It’s a huge vulnerability for the province,” Dr. Sinha said.
“There’s a danger that actually providing care in these homes is a side business to the real business, which is actually property plays and making money.”
A 2017 report by the Toronto Central Local Health Integration Network warned that operators of eight of the region’s 36 nursing homes intended to leave the city and another six were at risk of leaving. The report did not name the homes. (Such regional health authorities, known as LHINs, now operate under the name Home and Community Care Support Services.)
Toronto urgently needs new beds. Even as the government embarks on the most ambitious expansion of long-term care in a generation, it is playing catch-up: Almost 18,000 people are waiting for one of the 9,000 spots at facilities in the former Toronto Central and Central LHINs, areas that include the city centre and sections of North Toronto, Etobicoke and York Region. But rising real estate and construction costs, along with municipal zoning delays, have stalled many projects.
“The problem is there is nowhere for people to go other than very expensive retirement homes,” said Natalie Mehra, executive director of the Ontario Health Coalition. “There’s a crunch coming, and no one has a plan for it at all.”
Jake Roseman, a spokesperson for Long-Term Care Minister Paul Calandra, said Toronto has been “acutely affected by construction challenges.” He said the government has issued enhanced minister’s zoning orders, allowing it to override municipal site plans and fast-track the development of two facilities in the city: a 320-bed nursing home on land owned by Humber River Hospital and a 348bed facility to be built on a vacant site in the West Don Lands.
Elsewhere in the province, 44 projects comprising a total of 2,866 new beds and 4,056 upgraded ones have been completed or are under construction, according to a list of capital development projects the Ministry of Long-Term Care provided to The Globe.
Any facilities set to close “will not shut their doors until every resident has transferred to a new home that meets their care needs,” Mr. Roseman said.
This is the fate awaiting the 132 residents of Cedarvale Terrace in Toronto’s tony Forest Hill neighbourhood on Walmer Road. A large sign posted outside their nursing home says its new owner is seeking the go-ahead to tear it down and build a 19-storey condominium.
Residential real estate developer Stafford Homes Ltd. applied to the City of Toronto to rezone the property shortly after purchasing it last June. The same day Stafford Homes bought Cedarvale Terrace, it also purchased Vermont Square in Seaton Village, west of the downtown, property records show. Vermont Square closed in September, 2021, and Stafford has applied to build a 10-storey condo on the site.
Nate Pace, Stafford’s vice-president of acquisitions and development, said in an e-mail that the company “had no role in the decision to close either facility.” Both sites were marketed as residential mixed-used development opportunities after the previous owner decided to close the “antiquated facilities,” he said.
The former owner of the two homes is concealed behind numbered companies and limited-liability partnerships. Michael Fraser, the chief financial officer of All Seniors Care Living Centres, a national chain of retirement homes, is the sole director of the numbered companies for both homes as well as the general partnerships that sold them.
“I’m just a name on there, so to speak,” Mr. Fraser said during a brief phone call before referring questions to Responsive Group Inc., the company that managed Vermont Square before it closed and still manages Cedarvale Terrace. “Both properties have been sold, and so I have little involvement with them now,” he said in a follow-up e-mail.
Nicola Major, a spokesperson for Responsive Group, declined to identify the homes’ previous owner. Speaking on its behalf, she said complying with the ministry’s design standards “was not possible on the existing sites because of inadequate lot size and zoning restrictions.”
All residents of Vermont Square were transferred to another home of their choice, Ms. Major said. The ministry has also approved a closure plan for Cedarvale Terrace, she said.
Both those homes and Garden Court Nursing Home were sold without any public notification.
Nursing homes typically change hands through the transfer of their operating licences, a process that involves the LongTerm Care Ministry posting a notice on its public consultation registry. If the homes sell the shares in the corporate entity that holds the licence, however – which is how the Cedarvale Terrace, Vermont Square and Garden Court transactions were executed – no such notice is required.
Jane Meadus, a lawyer at the Advocacy Centre for the Elderly in Toronto, said all changes in ownership of a nursing home should be disclosed. With transactions done behind closed doors, she said, the public has no idea what criteria the ministry used to approve them.
“There is a real question as to how this is being done,” Ms. Meadus said. “Why would you allow someone to take it over if they have no interest in actually running the home?” Barbara Chernin, who lives across the street from Cedarvale Terrace, has written to politicians at every level of government, saying it is “shameful” that seniors are getting pushed out of their homes.
“This is a terribly harsh way to treat the vulnerable in our society,” Ms. Chernin said during a Zoom meeting in February hosted by Toronto Councillor Josh Matlow’s office.
Mr. Matlow, who is running for mayor, told The Globe he is also not happy to see seniors displaced. But he said the city has no jurisdiction over nursing homes.
“There’s no tool that’s been granted by the province for the city to say, ‘You must retain a long-term care home,’ ” he said.
“That is not what the city is allowed to do.”

Full text: At 8:45 a.m. on a Tuesday morning, the newly renovated lobby at Manulife Financial Corp.’s head office in Toronto is bustling with employees ordering freshly brewed espresso shots and frothy vanilla lattes from the company’s in-house barista.
Groups of colleagues are gathered around informal meeting areas with sleek modern couches and lush green plants covering the walls.
The transformation is part of Manulife’s plan to woo employees back to the office during a time when many Canadian companies continue to see resistance from workers who wish to stay home. Manulife’s chief executive Roy Gori says a complete overhaul of the company’s nearly 100-year-old office building, as well as pro-actively listening to employee feedback on their hybrid arrangement, has already paid off.
“We’re not seeing any decrease in productivity,” Mr. Gori says over lunch in the company’s renovated second floor cafeteria. “If anything, I think we’re going to see – and probably already are seeing – productivity improve because people are now being more purposeful with their time.”
Last year, the company announced that employees would be required to return to the office three days a week: Mondays, Wednesdays and one flexible day. But after hearing employees wanted a more gradual hybrid arrangement, Mr. Gori dropped it down to two mandatory days.
Now, every Tuesday and Wednesday, Mr. Gori sees about 91 per cent of his Toronto staff who worked in-office prepandemic have returned.
The company’s U.S. headquarters in Boston, which has a similar requirement, is operating at about 90 per cent, while the Asian operations have already hit their prepandemic level of 95-per-cent inoffice attendance.
What is surprising, Mr. Gori says, is that on certain non-mandatory days the company has also seen a boost in attendance. For example, in Canada, Monday is the third most popular day of the week for attendance, with about 70 per cent of employees in-office.
The numbers stand out for a company operating in Toronto – a city that has fallen behind the average occupancy achieved in major U.S. cities, with an average weekly attendance rate of 43 per cent in downtown office buildings, according to recent data by Strategic Regional Research Alliance. The U.S. is closer to 50 per cent, while Europe and the Middle East have seen office attendance return to 70 per cent to 90 per cent, according to research by Jones Lang Lasalle, a global commercial real estate company. In Asia, that number jumps to around 80 per cent to 110 per cent – meaning some workers are spending more time in office than they did before the pandemic.
Three years after the majority of companies sent employees home for a temporary lockdown, the vast majority of them want to see people back in the office. But executives at large organizations have different ideas about how to best do that – whether it’s making the return voluntary, mandated, or somewhere in between. Tactics also include adding new perks to office life, and redesigning office space.
Earlier this month, RBC chief executive Dave McKay became the first major bank leader to mandate a stricter policy, calling on his employees to return to the office three to four days a week starting May 1. During an analyst call, Mr. McKay blamed the lack of office attendance for a drop in productivity and innovation at his company.
The reason behind Manulife’s success in Canada, Mr. Gori says, is that it has transformed the office into an “inviting space,” rather than a place workers are being forced to return to. But it also involves his decision to combine mandatory days with work from home – rather than provide an entirely flexible work arrangement. Despite some hesitation at first from workers, the company has seen a jump in employee satisfaction scores in recent surveys – above prepandemic levels.
“Other companies are not choosing the [mandatory] route, but we think the combination of hybrid and compulsory days is going to be a part of what makes our culture better in the long run,” Mr. Gori says, sitting in a booth in Manulife’s second-floor cafeteria. “I have no worries that some of my competitors have got a very different philosophy. It’s a competitive advantage that we will see take three years to pan out entirely.”
But to start, Mr. Gori knew he had to “earn the commute.”
A complete overhaul of the office has reopened the iconic double-door entrance off 200 Bloor St. E., which now leads into a lobby of sprawling open social space.
As well, the company eliminated overly large executive offices, revived the company cafeteria and upgraded its wellness and fitness centre. Like many office towers today, the building has upgraded its technology capabilities for hybrid conferences and meetings.
In addition to a ground-floor barista, the cafeteria – a 21,000square-foot open-concept food hall – offers multiple meal and snack options, as well as foosball tables. The company provides a 25-per-cent discount on food and beverages, with kiosks that serve both Tim Hortons and Starbucks.
A separate food station sits at the entrance of the cafeteria, offering different menu items every week, such as southeast Asian curries, Italian fare and tacos.
“People wanted variety,” Mr. Gori says. “We used to have terrible junk food and we are a company that promotes wellness and healthy living so we needed to change our menu.”
In order to drive the masses through the doors, employers need to create value for workers, says Heather Haslam, vice-president of marketing at payroll processor ADP Canada.
“Companies need to create purposeful reasons for people to want to come back,” Ms. Haslam said in an interview. “The idea of having one day where the whole team is face to face brings value, because if I come in and sit at my desk on Zoom all day, there is zero value for me to pay for that commute, for parking or dry cleaning. It is not worth the cost of my time.”
Something as simple as a daily snack cart has sparked social interactions at ADP. Filled with a variety of cookies, candy, chips, as well as several kinds of fruit and sugar-free items, employees take turns pushing the cart along the corridors at the company’s office in Toronto.
“This is about connections,” Ms. Haslam adds. “I love free food, but it isn’t actually about the food. It’s about a group of people taking a quick break, chatting with each other and building psychological safety at work. That requires trust, and trust comes in the workplace when you have that human connection.”
About 83 per cent of companies across the country are making efforts to entice employees to work more frequently in the office, including offering office perks, according to research by Robert Half Canada Inc., a global human-resource consulting firm.
These can include free meals, commuter benefits, enhanced workplace setups such as small conference rooms, offering greater engagement opportunities with leadership, or scheduling social events.
As well, almost 40 per cent of employees in Canada say a search for better office perks and benefits are among the top reasons they are actively looking to leave their current job, according to Robert Half Canada.
Online retailer Rakuten has been adding to its employee incentives throughout the entire pandemic. It currently requires its employees to be in the office three days a week. However, only Tuesdays and Thursdays are mandatory, known as “anchor days” among the staff, says Jennifer LaForge, general manager of Rakuten Canada.
To help ease the shift back into the office, the Toronto-based company provides a “light breakfast” and catered lunch three times a week for about 40 of its Canadian based employees. (Another 44 employees who report to the office are located outside the province and work remotely.)
“So far, this has been one of the greatest benefits to our culture because now we have a full kitchen, with all our tables occupied and everyone sitting together creating friendships, across business units, across departments and creating a stronger culture,” Ms. LaForge said.
With a smaller employee base, Rakuten is able to be more reactive with office perks that cater to employee needs. When the pandemic first hit, the company offered all staff access to care.com, a home-care provider service to help families with child care, tutoring or pet services.
Now, with transportation and commuting being one of the biggest roadblocks for employees to return, Rakuten has added a $100-a-month transportation allowance for those who come into the office. The money can be used for any commuting cost, such as parking, transit fares or taxi and Uber rides.
Most weeks, the company has social gatherings during “anchor days,” ordering beer kegs from a local brewery to celebrate holidays or milestones.
“I would love to see who figures out how to build a culture across a fully remote team that is as powerful as the one we have now,” Ms. LaForge said.
Sheila Botting, head of professional services for the Americas at real estate company Avison Young, has spent years advising companies on how to redesign their corporate space.
She says she’s noticed that the companies that are spending the time – and the money – to develop “high-performance dynamic work environments” are the ones attracting and retaining top talent.
“It’s a war for talent, especially for the digital talent across all generations. And that’s why leading companies are thinking about the programs and all of the extra things that they can do to inspire people.”
Fidelity Investments ULC Canada is among the companies that are fighting to get employees back in the office with personal baristas and renovated social spaces. When the company realized it was going to have an entirely empty office for an extended period of time, it began planning renovations to make larger open meeting areas and update the company lunchroom. As well, the renovation added a mothers’ room for pumping and storing breastmilk, a library and a prayer and meditation room.
“We wanted to create spaces where people would meet up and collaborate rather than spend their time coming in but remain at their desks all day,” says Diana Godfrey, senior vice-president of human resources and corporate affairs at Fidelity Canada. “It’s a different way of engaging people than we have done in the past.”
In the fall of 2022, the financial services company started to mandate employees return to the office between four to 12 days a month in a flexible work arrangement. While Fidelity had supplied hot beverages such as espresso and coffee in its kitchen prior to the pandemic, it now brings in an in-house barista four days a week to serve up free specialty beverages such as cappuccinos, iced coffees and London fogs. With staff spread across two adjacent towers, the company positioned the coffee bar on a floor with a connecting bridge to encourage employees to interact with colleagues they may not bump into regularly.
It’s become such a popular perk that the company is hiring a second barista for peak hours.
Located across the street from Toronto’s City Hall, Fidelity is well aware of the deteriorating public transit and congested traffic causing longer commute times. The company has been addressing those concerns with the local government, as well as advocating with the Toronto Transit Commission to reinstate a corporate discount program. It also reached out to Metrolinx, which operates the GO Transit services, to inquire about a similar discount.
“It’s about having conversations with the right people,” Ms. Godfrey said. “We know we aren’t going to solve all the transit issues in the city, but if enough companies advocate for change or ask the government to encourage discount programs, we can work together for change.”
While most executives agree that policy changes are necessary for today’s work force, they’ll have to make those decisions without knowing what the risks are in terms of retention.
At Manulife, there was a discussion around whether implementing compulsory work days would spark a number of employees to leave. But Mr. Gori says his attrition has been lower than the industry average with “not a lot of people exiting.”
“We knew that when we made the call for mandatory days, it was with the realization we could lose people but we have to have the conviction to stand for something,” he adds.
“I’m less stressed about the number of days we mandate and much more focused on whether people leave the office saying that was awesome, because once they see that it was worthwhile, they will come in on their own.
We already see that happening on Mondays.”

Developers propose taller towers for Midtown: Critics say infrastructure will struggle to keep pace after province’s override of height limits

Full text: Developers in Toronto’s Midtown area have applied to build about 700 more storeys than the city would have allowed in the almost four years since the province intervened to lift the city’s proposed height limits on highrise sites in the booming district.
Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark’s sweeping rewrite of Toronto’s proposed Midtown plan, unveiled in June, 2019, was among the first of a series of contentious moves that the Progressive Conservative government has made in the name of alleviating the province’s housing crisis. The measures have included issuing special orders to speed development, opening up parts of the protected Greenbelt and giving mayors new powers.
The area, which extends for 600 hectares and is centred on the busy, construction-clogged intersection of Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue, has long been a battleground between developers and residents’ associations over its mushrooming condo towers. Many complain that subway trains are already jammed, and school boards have long warned prospective residents that local schools are full.
Before Mr. Clark altered the city’s plan, developers would have faced 15-20-storey height limits on most Midtown sites. Mr. Clark more than doubled those in many instances.
According to numbers from the city, developers on 43 sites in Midtown have since submitted or resubmitted applications that now include 694 more storeys than Toronto’s original rules would have permitted. These figures are as of Sept. 1, 2022, the most recent date compiled figures were available. Assuming 10 units a storey, as is common in the area, it means at least 7,000 more potential housing units.
(The province also loosened rules in a similar plan for the city’s downtown).
When the changes to the plans were unveiled in 2019, Toronto’s then-mayor John Tory called Mr. Clark’s unilateral rewrite a “fiat,” complaining that the only headsup he received was a text from the minister the night before the move was first reported in The Globe and Mail.
Critics say the province’s revisions in Midtown gutted a city plan that still would have allowed for growth well in excess of the province’s minimum targets while aiming to ensure schools, daycares, parks and water and transit infrastructure could keep up. The province’s changes, they say, have left the city scrambling – while handing hundreds of millions of dollars in potential extra profits to developers.
The minister’s Midtown decision did more than lift the city’s proposed height limits for designated high-rise areas in the district. The extensive line-by-line rewrite – 194 changes in all – also removed or weakened various other provisions, such as requirements for specific setback distances for new buildings. And it deleted provisions aimed at ensuring local schools have room for new students.
The city has spent the past four years revising its infrastructure plans for water and sewer capacity, parks, recreation centres and child care to try to accommodate the province’s changes.
Toronto planners are also trying to mitigate some of the effects of the changes by including setback requirements, for example, in zoning bylaws instead.
Mr. Clark declined to be interviewed by The Globe. He has said that this and other policy changes are needed to defeat NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) politicians and residents and reach the government’s goal of getting 1.5 million new homes built over the next 10 years.
The changes in 2019 surprised even planners in Mr. Clark’s own ministry. According to a partly redacted report signed by the province’s planning staff and obtained by The Globe via a Freedom-of-Information request, provincial bureaucrats had “no concerns” with the city’s submitted plan.
However, internal e-mails obtained via a FOI request filed by York University urban geography professor Mark Winfield, who sits on the board of a local residents’ association, show the rewrites were e-mailed to the province’s bureaucrats by a senior adviser in Mr. Clark’s office and were not drafted by the province’s professional planners.
Victor Doyle, a retired senior planner with the Ontario government and a vocal critic of the PC government’s recent policies, said it is unprecedented for such detailed changes to be drafted by a minister’s political staff.
“Unquestionably, the level of detail in the minister-amended plan is beyond the capacity of anyone in the minister’s office to do,” Mr. Doyle said, suggesting only developers or their consultants would have the required expertise.
Asked who advised the government on the changes, Mr. Clark’s spokeswoman, Victoria Podbielski, replied with an email that did not address The Globe’s questions. She said the changes to Toronto’s plans were to “increase housing supply and leverage the significant investments in transit by intensifying development around major transit-station areas.”
The city’s original Midtown in Focus plan was passed by council after six years of study and consultations with residents and developers. It largely protected existing low-rise neighbourhoods, while allowing for high-rise growth in areas near transit and large intersections. But city council approved a watered-down version: Toronto’s planning department had originally recommended allowing new buildings on some high-rise sites as tall as 56 storeys.
Councillors on the city’s planning committee, at the behest of local Midtown councillors, directed staff to hold an extra meeting with local residents about the plan’s building heights. That resulted in the endorsement of the lower 15-20 storey limits. But even this modified plan would have increased density dramatically – and with the support of local residents’ associations.
“We had very prescriptive policies because we wanted to make the neighbourhood make sense, to have a complete neighbourhood,” local councillor Jaye Robinson said of the council-approved plan. “And they [the province] just loosened the valve completely.”
Developers had called both the city’s original plan and the altered version passed by council too restrictive. Leor Margulies, a real estate lawyer who is the secretary of the Building Industry and Land Development Association (BILD), a developer lobby group, said Ms. Robinson’s drive to slash the height limits at the 11th hour was an example of the city’s NIMBY politics.
“It was outrageous,” Mr. Margulies said in an interview.
“You’ve got the core of the subway and the LRT. … Look, if you’re not going to build here, where are you going to build?” The province’s changes went beyond restoring the heights first proposed by city planners. According to an analysis by the city, the rewrite will boost Midtown’s population to 156,000 people by 2051, up from 62,000 in 2016. The total is 20,000 more people than council’s approved plan would have allowed.
Density in Midtown’s designated “urban growth centre,” the area right around Yonge and Eglinton, could go from 575 people and jobs per hectare – already the highest density in the province and well over the provincial government’s minimum target of 400 – to 1,367 people and jobs per hectare. Both of city staff’s original version and the one council passed would have still put this number at more than 1,000, according to an analysis by provincial planners.
Measured over the entire wider district, much of which is covered by affluent neighbourhoods of detached single-family homes, the province’s plan is not that different. The city’s rules would have resulted in 240 people and jobs per hectare, compared with the province’s 248 – both up from the current 140.
Local councillor Josh Matlow, a mayoral candidate, said the “binary” rhetoric of NIMBY versus YIMBY (Yes In My Back Yard) has obscured the city’s original goals.
“If you are a young parent, you need affordable child care in the area. You want to know that there is a school space nearby.
Anyone of us needs a local park,” he said. “That’s what Midtown in Focus was about.”

Full text: 5841 Second Line SCHOMBERG , ONT.
Asking Price: $4,999,999 Taxes: $4,943.77 (2022) Land Size: 48 acres Agent: Gemma Leggett, Re/Max York Group Realty THE BACKSTORY In 2007, Penny Paul and Thad Griffin could not envision a day when they would own a 48-acre farm and equestrian facility.
The couple had never spent time around horses, so they left things to the experts when their six-year-old daughter asked if she could attend a summer camp for budding equestrians near their home in Aurora, Ont.
“We dropped her off and left,” Ms. Paul recalls.
Camp was followed by a series of lessons, where Ms. Paul stood on the sidelines and watched. Occasionally she would coax an obstinate pony into allowing her daughter to tack him up.
“I often intervened in the stalls, keeping them calm. I seemed to have a decent way with the horses,” she says.
Within a few months, Ms. Paul was on horseback for her first lesson.
“That was the downfall,” Mr. Griffin says wryly.
Ms. Paul and her daughter spent more and more time at equestrian facilities, learning skills from riding and first-aid to maintaining stalls and building paddocks.
Then a three-year-old Egyptian Arabian which had suffered abuse was brought to the farm where Ms. Paul was riding and helping out.
“He was terrified of everything,” she says. “You couldn’t touch his ears, you couldn’t bridle him.”
Ms. Paul was the one person who was able to win his trust.
“It was still just a lot of instinct and a natural intuition about the horses,” she says.
When the opportunity arose, she purchased the rescued horse.
The couple also bought a horse for their daughter, and later added a third.
As Ms. Paul became more integrated into the riding, boarding and training community, she joined with some like-minded friends to create Tanglewood Equestrian on a rented property.
In the summer of 2018, Ms. Paul learned of a property with a barn, arena and paddocks for sale near Schomberg, Ont.
After paying boarding fees for their horses for several years, she persuaded Mr. Griffin to have a look.
The large expanse of land appealed to Mr. Griffin, but looking after the horses and buildings did not.
“I said I would arrange the financing, but I would not really be involved in the farm at all,” he says.
The couple purchased the property in the fall of that year.
THE FARM TODAY Mr. Griffin estimates 5841 Second Line has been accommodating horses for the past 40 years or so.
A previous owner kept standardbreds, he adds.
The three-bedroom bungalow was built in 1976 and offers 2,900 square feet of living space on two levels. The lower level, which is partially above ground, provides two additional bedrooms.
The main floor has a family room with a wood-burning fireplace and views of the backyard.
There’s an eat-in kitchen, a dining room, a sunroom and a main floor office with views of the paddocks.
The primary bedroom has an ensuite bathroom, a sitting area and a large window overlooking the grounds.
Outside, the 8,020-square-foot barn of steel construction was originally built as a machine shop. Today it has 22 woodframed stalls for horses, a heated feed room and a loft for storage.
“That’s a big barn by any standard,” Mr. Griffin says.
Nearby, there are 11 paddocks on 20 acres where the horses are pastured and exercised.
Ms. Paul says that having paddocks of various sizes provides flexibility and allows regeneration in the areas that are not in use.
With 22 horses at times, a lot depends on “who gets along with who,” she adds.
There’s also an outdoor track and a jumping area where riders can work on their riding and jumping skills.
“The horses can be in the front paddock, watching and being safe.”
A portion of the property is rented to a local farmer who plants soybeans and other crops.
In turn, the owners qualify for a property tax reduction.
While Ms. Paul and the couple’s daughter spent time with the horses, Mr. Griffin decided to pursue his own goal of learning to fly a glider.
He found a gliding club about 10 minutes away from the farm.
The couple enjoys dining in Schomberg and nearby Tottenham. Big box stores are about 20 minutes away, and it’s a quick drive to Toronto Pearson International Airport, Mr. Griffin says.
THE BEST FEATURE The riding arena provides space for indoor activities.
Ms. Paul has made many improvements, including adding 25 tonnes of sand and LED lights.
Next to the main area is a heated viewing room that Ms. Paul calls the clubhouse.
While young students are taking lessons in dressage and other disciplines, parents can hang out and watch the action with coffee and snacks on hand.
A lovely mare named Kaya is the school horse who takes many young children on their first lessons, says Ms. Paul.
“She’s full of personality but she knows her job and she’s quite serious about it.”

Potential leaders of B.C. groups undergo Chinese ‘political review’: Beijing’s consulate has role in selection process, former executive president says in recording

Full text: China’s consulate in Vancouver conducts political screening on the potential leadership at influential community organizations that promote candidates for Canadian political office, according to a recording obtained by The Globe and Mail of remarks by a former executive of one of those groups.
Based in Richmond, B.C., the Canadian Community Service Association, or CCSA, regularly attracts Canadian political leaders and Chinese diplomats to its events, calling itself “the Chinese community’s spiritual home,” and a hub for trade and cultural exchange between the two countries.
The Canadian Alliance of Chinese Associations (CACA), meanwhile, is made up of 130 groups, and similarly dedicates itself to “encouraging mutual communications and interactions.”
Neither organization discloses formal ties with the Chinese government. The CCSA describes itself as a non-government organization that is apolitical.
But there are requirements for the associations’ leadership, and the Chinese consulate plays a role, according to comments made by Wang Yan in a recorded conversation in 2020. Ms. Wang previously served as the CCSA’s executive president, but resigned several years ago. She had been asked to consider a leadership role in CACA, she said in the recording.
“If you want to be the chairperson, you must not be a person with a Red Notice, or a supporter of Falun Gong, or Taiwan and Hong Kong independence,” she said. People who match that description “can never sit in the chairperson’s chair,” she said.
And, she said in the recording of a conversation that was made in 2020, “if we want to reach the chairman level, we must go through a political review.”
“We have to provide things to the Chinese consulate – everything must go through this political review process,” said Ms. Wang, who resigned from the CCSA several years ago.
A Red Notice is an Interpol tool that functions somewhat like an international arrest warrant, and has been frequently deployed by the Chinese government to seek the extradition of people it considers fugitives.
Beijing considers calls for independence in Hong Kong and Taiwan – the latter a selfruling democracy – to be threats to its sovereignty.
FROM A1 The Globe is not identifying the person who made the recording, who risks professional retribution for its disclosure.
Canadian cities are home to hundreds of Chinese societies, some organized by place of origin in China, others for humanitarian and other goals. The Globe has no evidence of direct links between Chinese diplomats and that broader array of associations.
The Globe played back Ms. Wang’s recorded comments to her. In response, she said she does not now understand the process for selecting leadership.
Before coming to Canada, Ms. Wang worked in shipping and real estate development in China, she said on the recording. She also spent time with the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the feared internal graft-busting arm of the Chinese Communist Party, she said.
In the interview, she said she is now working in the diamond business in Canada and has no interest in politics.
But both Chinese associations have openly advocated for individual candidates.
In 2018, the CCSA formed “election assistance teams” to support Peter Liu for Richmond city council and Jason Zhen Ning Li for the city’s school board; the association published on its website an image of a ballot with both men’s names circled. A document on the CCSA website lists 20 election team captains.
Neither candidate won, but Mr. Liu was among the candidates also recommended by the Canada Wenzhou Friendship Society, which was briefly investigated by police after offering a $20 transportation subsidy to those who voted.
The RCMP later said it had found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.
The CACA, meanwhile, says part of its primary mission is to organize and mobilize the participation of ethnically Chinese people in politics.
In the 2017 provincial election, the association’s chairman met with several Chinese candidates and promised to “mobilize volunteers and other organizations … to actively help solve some real difficulties.”
The association has supported Richmond Liberal candidate Steven Kou, Vancouver city council candidate Steven Low and Karen Wang. Ms. Wang was a Burnaby Liberal candidate who pulled out of a 2019 by-election after a message on WeChat in which she called herself “the only Chinese candidate in the riding,” while describing opponent and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh as being “of Indian descent.”
The Chinese embassy did not respond to questions. Neither did the two associations.
Any Chinese political screening of CCSA leadership amounts to “a direct relationship” between the association and China, said Margaret McCuaig-Johnston, a senior fellow with the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa.
“I would see it as a direct impact on our democracy by the Chinese government,” she said.
Formed in 2002, the CCSA said at a 20th-anniversary celebration last year that its membership now exceeds 30,000 people, with 260 corporate members.
It organizes lunar new year galas, a cultural-heritage festival and a water-splashing festival. Its events are often attended by local politicians and Chinese diplomats – including former consul-general Tong Xiaoling, who was described in a 2022 Canadian intelligence document as seeking to mobilize voters in favour of a specific candidate in last year’s Vancouver mayoral election. That candidate was not named.
Among those who attended the 20th-anniversary event were George Chow, a former Vancouver city councillor who is now a provincial MLA, and Han Dong, the Toronto-area MP who left the Liberal caucus in late March pledging to fight allegations about the contents of his February, 2021 conversation with Han Tao, China’s consul-general in Toronto.
There can be practical reasons for groups to maintain close relationships with Chinese diplomats, especially among people who may need to arrange travel visas, seek business opportunities or gain access to certain conferences, noted Jia Wang, interim director of the China Institute at the University of Alberta.
Organizations whose members tend to be more recent immigrants, or from mainland China, “tend to have more of an alignment with the perspectives of the Chinese authorities – and some of it is also genuine,” she said. “They just may see things differently.”
Still, political screening for leaders suggests the Chinese consulate is acting like a board of directors for certain groups, said Cheuk Kwan, co-chair of the Toronto Association for Democracy in China.
“This is direct evidence of China’s interference,” he said.
It raises particular questions for Canadian politicians who attend events hosted by those organizations, said Kenny Chiu, a former Conservative MP who believes he was targeted by a Chinese interference campaign in the past election.
“Elected officials must realize who these people are,” he said.

Toronto housing market shows signs of rebounding: Volume of sales rose by 44%, home price index rose by 2.5% from February to March

Full text: Toronto’s housing market is showing signs that it is on the rebound, with sales jumping and home prices rising in March for the second consecutive month.
The volume of sales rose by 44 per cent from February to March and the home price index rose by 2.5 per cent to $1,118,500 over the same period, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board.
The home price index excludes the highest-priced homes and is the industry’s preferred measure.
It climbed 1.15 per cent from January to February.
“We appear to have reached a bottom where the sales and price trends have flattened over the last few months and are starting to show signs of growth on a monthly basis,” said the board’s chief market analyst, Jason Mercer.
The Bank of Canada announced in January that it would hold its key interest rate steady.
That started to give prospective buyers confidence that borrowing costs would not rise.
Now that more buyers have resumed their search, competition is heating up again. That’s especially true for housing with relatively lower prices, such as condos, and in suburban areas such as the region of Durham to the east of the city.
“We are seeing the uptick in all aspects,” said Nicole Montgomery, realtor with Hinchey Homes Real Estate, which serves the Durham region.
Ms. Montgomery said more than 130 people came to one of her open houses over the past weekend. She said the last time she saw that level of interest was in June of last year.
Shawn Hinchey, the president of the brokerage, said the surge in showings is “definitely new behaviour” since the Bank of Canada launched its interest-rate-hiking campaign early last year. The key interest rate is now 4.5 per cent compared with 0.25 per cent at the start of 2022.
The higher mortgage rates triggered last year’s slowdown and sent home prices down by more than 20 per cent in some of the Toronto suburbs. Compared with last March, the home price index for the Toronto region is down 16.2 per cent.
Currently, Mr. Hinchey said properties are drawing multiple offers. Although the bids are not going well over the list price as they did during the pandemic’s real estate frenzy, he expects that may change if more homeowners do not put their properties up for sale.
Across the Toronto region, the number of new listings climbed from February to March but is below this time a year ago. Many buyers have responded to the higher mortgage rates by looking for cheaper properties.
Simeon Papailias, senior partner with real estate brokerage REC Canada, said demand has risen for properties that are priced under $700,000. “We are seeing anything under $700,000 fly off the shelf,” he said.
It was a similar situation in Vancouver, the priciest market in the country.
Sales and new property listings increased from February to March but were below the 10-year average, according to the local board.
That fuelled competition among prospective buyers and sent prices higher. The home price index for the Vancouver region rose 1.8 per cent to $1,143,900 from February to March, with values for detached homes rising the most. Year over year, the home price index is down by 9.5 per cent.

CENTRE STAGE: NEWFOUNDLAND’S TERRA BRUCE PRODUCTIONS HAS BIG PLANS TO FOSTER COMMERCIAL THEATRE IN CANADA. STEP ONE: A $50-MILLION BET ON BUILDING TORONTO’S REGENT THEATRE

Full text: Terra Bruce Productions, a commercial theatre company with national ambitions founded in Newfoundland and Labrador five years ago, is still terra incognito to most theatregoers in Canada.
But the growing enterprise is “aggressively” – to use chief operating officer (and Great Big Sea co-founder) Bob Hallett’s word – pursuing plans to put itself on the musical-theatre map in this country, many of which will become clear over the next 12 months.
Terra Bruce, a passion project and a start-up backed by retired Winnipegborn, Toronto-based and Newfoundland-loving businessman Walter Schroeder, is set to premiere three new musicals this year on an east-to-west circuit.
The shows, written around pre-existing songs, will play in St. John’s, Halifax and Toronto.
Additionally, Terra Bruce will open the Majestic Theatre in St. John’s this summer after an approximately $3million renovation transforms the downtown 1918 venue – which has spent stints as a warehouse, a dance club and most recently a derelict space – into a 350-seat theatre.
But the company’s most significant investment in terms of the future of truly homegrown commercial theatre in this country is coming in 2025 to midtown Toronto.
The Regent Theatre on Mount Pleasant Road was purchased by the company in 2020. Long known as a movie house, it also played a crucial role in the development of Canadian theatre when it operated as the Crest in the 1950s and 1960s.
Terra Bruce is working on an extensive rebuild, with an estimated budget of $50-million, that will preserve some heritage elements but centres on a state-ofthe-art auditorium with 600 seats. NORR Architects and Hariri Pontarini Architects, the firm behind the Stratford Festival’s new Tom Patterson Theatre, are both involved.
The space is crucial to the company’s business plan, which (for now) involves rehearsing and opening modestly budgeted new revue-sicals and jukebox musicals with eight to 12-actor casts in Newfoundland, where production costs are cheaper, before bringing them to the country’s biggest city, where they can attempt to earn their investment back.
But the redevelopment, the details of which Terra Bruce will be holding a public meeting about on April 13, would also open up a much-needed space for the creation or transfer of other shows that won’t have to be imported hits or international tours in order to turn a profit.
If Toronto’s commercial theatre scene is stunted and dominated by a single, big player (Mirvish Productions), it is partly the result of having few venues that are the size of the smaller Broadway and West End theatres, typically 500 to 800 seats.
This means producers and presenters often end up putting on shows in bigger houses here than in New York, despite smaller audiences. (An example is upstart More Entertainment’s production of Rock of Ages, currently playing at the 982-seat Winter Garden; the original Broadway production recouped at the 597seat Helen Hayes.)
“Our hope is that because of the size and because of the infrastructure we’re putting into it, we should be able to to make this an economical space for other companies and other entities to use too,” says Hallett, over the phone from St. John’s. “We’re not going to use it ourselves for 365 days.” The bulk of Toronto’s theatres are not-for-profit black boxes with 200 seats or less – too small to make money in. The rest are mostly 1,000 seats and up, making them useful as a road house or for the occasional Canadiancast production of an international hit, but too risky for new work. The main privately owned theatrical venue similar in size to the proposed Regent is the CAA Theatre, a 700-seat space whose years have been numbered since Mirvish Productions sold it to developers in 2015. (It’s where Terra Bruce made its Toronto debut with No Change in the Weather in the fall of 2021.)
To get the Regent Theatre off the ground, Terra Bruce has tapped Franco Boni, who saw the Theatre Centre to a permanent home on Queen Street West during his tenure as artistic and general manager of that not-forprofit company.
Boni, who first came on as a consultant in January, 2022, and is now executive and program director, gave The Globe and Mail an exclusive tour of the Regent in its current unheated and stripped state in March.
Built in 1927 as the Belsize, the venue’s live theatrical zenith was in the 1950s and 1960s when it was the Crest, a company formed by brothers Donald and Murray Davis and Barbara Chilcott, their sister.
Though the company lasted for only 13 years, it is seen as the beginning of a local, professional theatre scene in Toronto. The likes of Jackie Burroughs, Richard Monette, Kate Reid, Francis Hyland and Gordon Pinsent graced its productions.
Indeed, before he died, Pinsent – who met his wife, Charmion King, while acting in a 1961 production of The Madwoman of Chaillot there – revisited the theatre with Terra Bruce’s leaders and reminisced about its bad sightlines and basement dressing rooms.
While the intent is to save, restore or recreate certain elements, including the crumbling zodiac-themed ceiling in the lobby, Boni says the auditorium is irredeemable for live performance. The highlight of the new facility – which is planned at three storeys and to expand onto a parking lot – will be a new one with two balconies and an orchestra pit.
The 380-seat orchestra level will be equipped with high-tech and high-priced seating from Montreal’s Gala Systems that can collapse into the floor at the push of a button, turning the theatre into an event space. (The Regent, Boni says, will be the first venue in Ontario to have this type of seating.)
“We are recreating a brandnew theatre,” is how Boni puts it of the space, which he notes is already close to the Davisville subway station but will be just a six-minute walk from the new Eglinton Crosstown when the light-rail line opens. (Terra Bruce has filed Site Plan Approval and Committee of Adjustment applications with the city.)
While Terra Bruce’s theatrical operations are intended to be profitable, the cost of the Regent is not factored in. Boni describes the theatre as Schroeder’s “philanthropic gift” to Toronto.
Schroeder, who sold the debt ratings agency DBRS in 2014 to private equity firms for a reported US$500-million, declined an interview about Terra Bruce or its future theatres in St. John’s and Toronto. But it’s clear his involvement goes beyond being the money source.
No Change in the Weather, a musical based around Newfoundland contemporary and traditional songs that was the company’s first outing, initially credited Schroeder as co-writer when it opened at the Resource Centre for the Arts in St. John’s and then embarked on an eight-city tour in 2019.
That show concerned a family reuniting after the death of its matriarch and also went deep into the history of the Churchill Falls hydro development debacle – a subject of keen interest to Schroeder.
In a program note for the revised production that played in 2021, Schroeder – now listed as Terra Bruce’s executive producer – explained that he was impressed by the culture, resourcefulness and humour of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians “during 30-plus years that I was travelling to and involved with the credit rating of Newfoundland and Labrador” and outlined his vision of “building a company which could create a musical, one which could tell some of the true stories of Newfoundland.”
Early on-board with that vision was Hallett, who in recent years has branched out into theatre as the live-music industry has declined. He’s worked with American producers Junkyard Dog as the Newfoundland music consultant on Come From Away, as well as with Sheridan College and the Stratford Festival. “It was the right time, the right place for me,” he says of signing on in 2018 when Schroeder “now had the time to aggressively pursue this idea.”
While No Change in the Weather was not a money maker (and its critical reception was mixed), the experience of taking the show across the country and renting theatres led Schroeder and Hallett to the conclusion, as other producers have had before them, that the key to the theatre business is to own your own real estate.
“When the decision was made, okay, we’re going to become a real, functioning theatre company and we’re going to do seasons and multiple productions, obviously we needed a certain degree of infrastructure to support that,” Hallett says.
The plan is that, eventually, the Majestic in St John’s and the Regent in Toronto will have similar technological set-ups, so shows will be able to transfer from one to the other with just a little tinkering. “We’re creating software and operational systems that will operate both theatres, even though they there are in different cities 1,500 miles apart,” Hallett says.
At the moment, Terra Bruce has built up close to 20 full-time employees in St John’s to work on developing its musicals. Newfoundland and Labrador was perhaps primed to become a major centre for the art form given the international success of Come From Away – the hit Canadian musical that, though set in Gander and drawing on the sound of Atlantic Canada’s rich music scene, was created by a couple of come-from-aways based in Toronto, Irene Sankoff and David Hein.
“It’s not like musicals didn’t exist or original musicals didn’t exist here, but there’s certainly been a boom of that happening since Come From Away happened,” says Courtney Brown, artistic associate at Terra Bruce.
Most of the ideas for the company’s productions currently on tap are from concepts and ideas that Schroeder and Hallett came up with in their conversations, Brown says. “We take that and we try and spin it into a story, see what works, see what doesn’t work,” she explains.
First out of a seven-show inventory built up over the pandemic will be Let’s Dance! Featuring pop and rock ‘n’ roll songs of the early 1960s (think Petula Clark and the Seekers), the comedy is about a failed opera singer who becomes a high-school music teacher. It’s written by Victoria Wells-Smith and directed by Keith Pike, and premieres at Holy Heart Theatre in St. John’s in July, before heading to Halifax and then Toronto at the Winter Garden in August. (It was slated to be the CAA Theatre until a couple of weeks ago – driving home the venue crunch in Toronto.)
Then comes The Wild Rovers, featuring music by the Irish-Canadian band the Irish Rovers, who had a popular CBC variety show in the 1970s. It will christen the Majestic Theatre in St. John’s in August, and then have a run at the Winter Garden from Sept. 15 to Oct. 1. This fantasy about fictional counties at war has a script by Steve Cochrane and will be directed by Irish director Jason Byrne (who’s directed at the Shaw Festival and with the Company Theatre in Toronto).
Then, in January, 2024, Hymnal, a musical built around gospel and rock ‘n’ roll that finds a Catholic priest having a crisis of faith in the mid-1950s, is set for a production directed by Brown, the company’s artistic associate.
While Terra Bruce’s major impact on Toronto (and its potential profitability) may still be a couple years away, the effect the company and Schroeder are having on Newfoundland is already evident, Brown says. “It’s not something I could have never imagined in my home province ... getting to come to work every day to a resident company as an artistic leader.”

For resort town workers, housing scarcity is worsening: Restrictions on building in Jasper, and a lack of rent controls, has led to an affordability crisis

Full text: For more than seven decades, housing availability in the mountain town of Jasper, Alta., has been a challenge.
Although the total number of dwellings is slowly growing, in the past 10 years, the rental units in the primary market – units built specifically as rental – has declined as some units have transitioned into condo ownership. The shortfall in the number of dwellings needed to meet demand in Jasper has gone from 235 units in 2002 to roughly 700 in 2022.
“In Jasper, housing has always been in short supply,” says the town’s mayor, Richard Ireland.
“Over the years, efforts have been made to correct that, but the problem seems to just continue regardless of all the steps that have been taken.”
These steps have consisted in asking Parks Canada to release land for the construction of both market and non-market, or subsidized and co-op housing.
Located on a national park, Jasper’s town boundary is constrained by Parks Canada’s regulations to limit the townsite’s physical expansion and protect the environment.
To ensure the town’s population remains in balance with the 118,222 square metres of developable land allocated to Jasper, Parks Canada requires that only those who work or run a business are eligible to live there – and releases parcels as needed.
“We’ve been able to get housing that’s more affordable and stays that way,” Mr. Ireland says.
“But even with all the units that have been built, the pressure continues.”
In the face of skyrocketing visitor numbers, the need for more staff in Jasper is growing, and the availability of well-maintained, affordable housing for workers in Canada’s second most popular national park seems to be reaching a breaking point.
Since 2014, vacancy rates in Jasper’s primary rental market have remained close to zero, driving rents up by 30 per cent over the same period.
Christine Reyes (whose name has been changed to protect her identity) and her boyfriend share a one-bedroom apartment in Cavell Apartments, the town’s first purpose-built rental complex developed to provide staff accommodation in the 1970s.
Originally from the Philippines, Ms. Reyes moved to Cavell Apartments in the fall of 2021.
Since then, the couple’s rent has gone up by 20 per cent – from $1,075 to $1,270 – and further increases are expected in 2023.
“What we’re paying now is just enough for us to make [ends meet],” Ms. Reyes says, adding she pays an additional $185 a month in parking, storage and pet fees. “I have family back home that I’m sending money to. I don’t think I could send money if rent [goes] up.”
In February, some tenants of Cavell Apartments received a letter from property management, informing them rents would be rising by about 40 per cent this year. The notice cites inflation, interest rates, as well as supply and demand as the drivers of such an increase.
While the proposed hike for existing tenants has been reconsidered, a bachelor suite in the complex was listed in March for a monthly rent of $1,604.50 – a rate akin to downtown Vancouver’s average rent for the same type of unit.
The property management company did not respond to requests for comment.
In a town where a significant share of renters are employed in the tourism industry, and whose hourly wage averages $18.36 (roughly $1.80 less than in B.C.), spending more than $900 a month in rent isn’t a viable option.
For local businesses, this challenge means they have to step in and absorb some of the cost of housing on behalf of their staff.
To ensure she can hire fulltime staff year-round, Lynn Wannop, owner of Coco’s Café, has rented a two-bedroom unit in Cavell Apartments for nearly a decade. “That apartment makes it so that I can hold on to staff in the winter, when it’s really slow,” she explains.
Currently, she pays $1,225 a month in rent for the unit, and charges her staff $500 to live there. But in the face of the proposed increases, she wouldn’t have a choice but to continue to pay whatever rate the landlords ask. “As a business owner I have to suck it up and pay,” Ms. Wannop says. “I can’t operate my business without it.”
But spending more on staff housing costs means Ms. Wannop can’t raise wages either.
“I want my staff to be able to afford to live,” she says. “But I can’t afford to pay them any more.”
Moreover, Jasper’s housing shortfall doesn’t only drive rents up – it also creates challenges for tenants who end up living in sub-par accommodations for a lack of alternatives within their budget.
Since November, Max Martin and four friends have shared a five-bedroom, two-bathroom bungalow in the middle of town.
While the group pay what they consider a reasonable amount in rent, the condition of the home is precarious.
“We have mould that [the landlords] have refused to come help fix,” Mr. Martin says, adding that “we went without heating for almost seven weeks.”
According to recent inspection reports from Alberta Health Services and the Jasper Fire Department, the dwelling presents critical safety issues, including windows that don’t open, exterior doors that can’t be locked for a lack of keys, faulty heating, and no smoke alarms.
In Mr. Martin’s view, Jasper’s tight rental market allows landlords to take advantage of young workers who, like him, come from overseas attracted by the natural beauty of the Rocky Mountains.
“People should be held accountable for their actions and the choices they make,” Mr. Martin says. “Especially when it comes to other people’s lives. As a landlord you’re in a privileged position where you can have a house that provides you passive income to let live and do what you want.”
But more supply is on the way.
Last December, a new purpose-built rental complex finally received a development permit, six years after the project was first announced. However, a building permit application is yet to be received by Parks Canada (the developer has until Dec.
13 to apply for this permit).
Featuring 144,822 square feet of apartments spread between two buildings, this development is expected to make a dent on Jasper’s housing gap when completed – but it’s unlikely that new market units can support the affordability levels required by tourism and hospitality staff.
Because market housing is subject to speculation and financialization, providing rental housing at rates commensurate to the wages of workers isn’t always possible, as returns for shareholders take priority.
“This model prays on power imbalances and problems that were already in place,” says Laura Murphy, research co-ordinator at the University of Alberta’s Affordable Housing Solutions Lab. “Especially in Alberta, where tenants are really dependent on landlords … because we don’t have lot of protections for tenants.”
In Alberta there are no limits to how much landlords can hike rents, as long as they increase only once a year.
To address this, Ms. Murphy suggests governments invest in non-market housing, as this “has proven to work time and time and again.”
Currently, there are about 155 non-market units in Jasper, but only 21 of them are rentals – and the landlord’s agreement with the municipality to provide housing at below market rates in the latter ends in 2029.
Like anywhere else in Canada, to boost the supply of suitable housing that remains affordable in perpetuity, Jasper requires support from senior levels of government.
“[In] 2023, council has budgeted a $5-million debenture to assist housing, but we will need some other partners to do that,” Mr. Ireland says. “We now need matching funds from either the province or the feds. We’ve gone to the province and made that application, so we will see what comes of that.”
On March 22, the municipality announced it would receive $6.5million from the provincial and federal governments.
Combined with private investment, this new funding is expected to create 40 affordable units.

Full text: 97 Spruce Hill Rd., Toronto THE BEACHES Asking price: $2,649,999 (March, 2023) Selling price: $2,649,999 (March, 2023) Previous selling prices: $1,165,000 (June, 2012); $288,000 (July, 1988) Taxes: $7,905 (2022) Days on the market: One Listing agent: Shea Warrington, Royal LePage Estate Realty THE ACTION There were some properties in the Beaches this January that generated multiple offers, but none were as large as this four-bedroom house that sits less than one kilometre from Lake Ontario. One of two bidders met the $2,649,999 asking price within 24 hours.
“We thought about under-pricing it at under $2.5-million because I knew, with a lack of inventory for this type of house in the Balmy [Beach school] district, there would be a great demand for it,” agent Shea Warrington said.
“But I got a bit nervous about that price point and holding back offers, so I decided to list at $2,649,999 and I’m really glad I did.
“With 30 showings, it told me we have a lot of buyers out there.”
WHAT THEY GOT This nearly 100year-old house had a major renovation in 2019 with $350,000 in updates.
Exterior upgrades include new roofing, windows and decking, as well as upgraded fencing, lighting and artificial turf on the 30- by 120-foot lot.
Interior additions range from upgraded mechanics to a custom kitchen dressed in walnut and quartz finishes, and a primary bedroom and bathroom with heated flooring.
Fireplaces enhance two entertaining areas on the main floor.
Two more recreation areas are downstairs.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It was a very beachy house, but combined with a great reno, so the main floor was quite open and amazing for family life,” Ms. Warrington said.
“You could see the lake from the primary bedroom and the back yard.”
Two cars can also park off the laneway, which is a local hangout.
“It’s almost like living in the country at the back of the houses, you can learn to ride bikes there and have Easter egg hunts,” Ms. Warrington said.
“It’s also an ideal spot for a laneway/garden suite.”

A home close to four-season fun: This five-bedroom house on a ‘tree street’ is near the heart of the growing community of Collingwood, Ont.

Full text: REAL ESTATE REPORTER COLLINGWOOD, ONT.
312 Beech St.
COLLING WOOD, ONT.
Asking price: $1,799,000 Lot size: 66 by 158 feet Taxes: $4,786.30 (2023) Listing agent: Sherry Rioux, Broker, Clairwood Real Estate Corp.
THE HOUSE TODAY It can be great in life and real estate when you get what you want, but it’s even better when you what you wanted isn’t even the best part of what you got.
Wally Crowder wanted to live in Collingwood so he could be closer to skiing. He raised his five kids and ran his labelling business in Stouffville, Ont., in a big house but had started coming up to Collingwood in the mid-90s for hockey tournaments and invitations to ski at Blue Mountain.
“I knew the area, and I had friends that had moved up,” he said. “In 2007, I was getting close to retiring and we started looking, and my wife found this home: the guy who built it was also a skier.”
The former owner was apparently a homebuilder by trade and built the house on Beech Street in 2005. When it came up for sale, the house was also the right size for Mr. Crowder to entertain his children and 11 grandchildren.
But as luck and life would have it, Mr. Crowder’s dreams of skiing through retirement weren’t to be.
“We skied for a while, but then a few years ago I ended up with a knee replacement, and that took away the skiing,” he said.
Along the way though, Collingwood itself became the draw: a growing community with lots of amenities for locals and visitors. Even though the couple is downsizing again (their first home was even bigger than this house’s approximately 2,800 square feet if you include the finished basement) they are staying in Collingwood. “It’s probably one of the best four-seasons towns in Ontario,” Mr. Crowder asserts.
In Mr. Crowder’s view, he’s on one of the best “tree streets” in Collingwood. By way of explanation, the streets that extend west from the town’s main road Hurontario Street are in order: Pine, Maple, Beech, Birch, Oak, Cedar, Walnut, Hickory, Spruce and Elm.
Beech dead-ends at the Fifth Street (the streets that walk south from the waterfront are numbered, starting with First) so that limits through-traffic.
Businesses and restaurants are now beginning to expand from Hurontario onto the tree streets, so Beech is literally steps away from a lively downtown.
The street is filled with century-old homes, a style the original builder of Mr. Crowder’s home tried to emulate with coloured siding, scalloped shingles in the gables, tall farm-house style windows and a wraparound front porch with a cupola on the corner.
The front door opens directly into a formal sitting area, with a small office on the right. The kitchen is the heart of the floor plan, either through the sitting room or through a short hall with closets, and access to the garage. A large island with bar seating centres the kitchen and maple hardwood floors run through here and up a short flight of steps into the family room, which is open to the kitchen with cut-out in the wall.
The dining space occupies the left side of the family room, and the floor-to-ceiling stone mantle for the fireplace focusses the seating area. This room is tallest on the kitchen side, and slopes to the rear access to the large back porch with built-in pergola and stone patio and grassy yard beyond.
“I’ve got a good-sized lot that’s west facing, so the backyard gets lots of sun in the summer,” said Mr. Crowder. The grandkids still have a whale of a time on their visits, but they are getting a little too good at popping baseballs over the fences. “We’ve got good neighbours so they throw ‘em back or they come back in a basket next week: they know where they came from.”
There are four bedrooms on the second level, three that share a main bathroom and the primary suite with it’s own ensuite.
The fifth bedroom is currently in use as the office on the main floor.
HOMETOWN COMFORTS Sometimes folks from back in Stouffville over-estimate how far north Collingwood is, but Mr. Crowder swears he can get to Toronto in less than two hours when he needs to come south for business or pleasure. Though he is retired he still has a licence to provide apparel for the Matco Tools Inc., for whom he contracts out to supply the branded hats and shirts shoppers get as extras when buying from the company’s tool trucks. That said, he does prefer to stack up a couple appointments so he can limit his big city days.
More importantly, even though the community has been snowed in twice since he’s lived there – cut off from the rest of the province essentially – it’s actually a pretty good place to be stuck for a day or two when there are no day-trippers coming into the town’s many restaurants and bars.
“Downtown Collingwood, after 6 p.m. they shut their stores down but during the day there’s hardly a parking place to be had,” he said.
The pace of growth in the town has picked up in the past 40 years: Collingwood had fewer than 10,000 people for all of the 20th century until the early eighties, but just since 1996 has jumped from about 15,000 to almost 25,000 residents. Things have been growing so quickly the town council imposed a building moratorium on developments in 2021, though some infill developing continues apace.
In other words, right now they aren’t building any more Collingwood, which is just fine with most folks who live there now.

Full text: In downtown Calgary, where owners of office buildings must contend with North America’s highest vacancy rate – according to CBRE, one of every three offices is empty – a local landlord has welcomed a tenant with a growing business: indoor farming.
Aspen Properties has rented out three floors of an office building at its Calgary Tower Centre to vertical indoor farming startup Agriplay Ventures Inc.
So far, one of those floors has been outfitted with Agriplay’s custom, modular growth system, which, by mid-April, should be sprouting fruits and vegetables in quantities hundreds of times the volume of a same-size conventional farm. The company plans to fully convert all three floors to farms by the end of the year.
An innovative way to solve vacancy issues, Agriplay’s indoor farm is “exciting, interesting,” and “a welcome addition to our portfolio,” says Rob Blackwall, Aspen’s chief operating officer.
“[Contributing] to better food security for the surrounding area is very complementary to [our] ESG goals.”
Mr. Blackwell would not have handed over the fobs to just any indoor farmer: Agriplay convinced the landlord that his office space would be improved by growing large quantities of tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and more.
“We are no different than an office user, except our furniture grows food,” says Dan Houston, president of Calgary-based Agriplay. “But when we move out, we’ll leave a clean, base structure that has been upgraded with smart-building infrastructure.
That’s a net gain for a landlord.”
Mr. Houston, who worked for 17 years in commercial real estate before launching Agriplay in 2021, says the company’s lightweight, snap-in, snap-out growing system was designed specifically for easy installation into existing office real estate.
Unlike the handful of other indoor vertical farms around Calgary, “you don’t need industrial space – the market for which is tight across the country” – to grow Agriplay’s produce, he says.
“We were in the unique position to develop technology from the ground up, focusing on what an office landlord would require, to be comfortable plugging the system into an existing unused space,” says Mr. Houston, who plans to license Agriplay’s technology to global markets, with Western Canada and Illinois licences already acquired.
In fact, an office building provides a nearly ideal environment for growing food, Mr. Houston says. It’s already heated, air-conditioned and well ventilated.
Agriplay’s installation protocols involve sealing a base-building space for moisture control before assembling rows of Agriplay’s aeroponic-like precision rainfall growing systems. Sunlight, soil, pesticides are not required; only a small amount of water and a stable feed of nutrient solution delivered in an efficient, recyclable, closed-loop system.
At Agriplay’s futuristic research facility, located in northeast Calgary, advanced automation and artificial intelligence, driven by data from the world’s top agriculture and technology experts, program systems including lighting, climate and nutrient solution recipes to ensure maximum growth for up to 150 different crops – some offering 30 harvests a year.
“We made it really simple,” Mr. Houston says. “You don’t have to know a single thing about growing strawberries. Basically, you just tell the system, I want to grow strawberries.”
It can even print out purchasing orders for potential buying partners in 92 global markets.
In addition, Mr. Houston claims that with its “extremely efficient” 70-watt LED plant-lighting technology, Agriplay’s farms use as little as 10 per cent of the energy of traditional warehousebased vertical farms – a number of which have scaled back operations, citing skyrocketing energy costs. (This includes Germany’s Infarm, which recently closed its Calgary centre, opened in 2021.)
“The only reason Agriplay was able to use the space in our office building,” Mr. Blackwell says, “is because they are not nearly as power-intensive as other vertical farming technologies. From what I understand, they use just a little more power than a high-density office user.”
Invest Alberta has signed a memorandum of understanding with Agriplay Ventures to connect the company with agriinvestors. In the meantime, Agriplay’s subsidiary, Agriplay Farms, is negotiating offers on more than one million square feet of office space in Calgary, as well as 300,000 square feet of office space in Edmonton.
Agriplay’s cloud-connected technology costs about $800,000 for every 10,000 square per foot of vertical farm. Based on the company website’s revenue calculator, 10,000 square feet of tomatoes at a wholesale price (determined by Mr. Houston as 65 per cent of Walmart’s retail price) of $5.20 per pound, could gross annual revenue of $4.7-million; strawberries, at a wholesale price of $3.90 per pound, could reap $3.5-million.
The calculator indicates energy would cost $2,400 per month. Mr. Houston says, given three fulltime employees would be required to run a 10,000-squarefoot farm, the operating profit margin would be approximately 22 per cent.
Mr. Houston claims his “ultimate goal is to solve food security internationally,” by helping cities grow food in underutilized buildings.
“A lot of landlords love the idea. They’ve got very limited opportunities in terms of what they can do with a vacant building if they can’t find the people, which is kind of chronic in many places right now.”
Currently, an estimated twothirds of produce consumed in Canada is imported; a 2021 report by Canadian Chamber of Commerce recommends the federal government “work with the indoor farming sector to enhance local food production.”
Thom Mahler, Calgary’s director of downtown strategy, says Agriplay’s office-to-farm conversions align with the city’s urban initiatives. “The obvious reason is we have so much vacant office space. Our strategy is heavily focused on removing office space from the inventory because that helps to increase the value of all remaining properties.
“And I know from talking to Agriplay, their business plan is to become a major supplier to the local food industry. So, we’re very supportive of that as well. We will streamline permit application processes to get these kinds of developments happening.”
Kristi Peters, food systems planner at the City of Calgary, says that while indoor farms can’t replace the city’s dependency on imported food, Calgary’s indoor farm sector – also including warehouse-based Deepwater Farms and NuLeaf Farms as well as a soon-to-open 74,000-square-foot GoodLeaf Farms facility, can offer more predictable year-round yields.
“Last year, the supply of produce basically dried up in our grocery stores,” Ms. Peters recalls.
“Literally, there was nothing. And then, within a few days, suddenly all the indoor farm brands were filling up the shelves in Safeway, Sobeys, IGA. And they’ve stayed, which is a success story for them.
It’s a win-win for our local food system.”

Full text: Like in countless cities and towns across the country, a quiet crisis was playing out in Lethbridge.
For several years, there had been a revolving door of family doctors in the southern Alberta city. Some coming in, but more leaving. And before anyone seemed to grasp the severity of the situation, which was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 40,000 people found themselves without a dedicated physician in a city of just 100,000.
But in an unusual move, the municipal government in Lethbridge, which was rarely part of provincial recruiting efforts, formed a partnership with Alberta Health Services. The result: 17 family doctors were hired last year – more than triple the intake of 2021 and far beyond the four total hires in 2020 and 2019.
Now, other parts of the province are trying to replicate the Lethbridge model.
Dr. Aaron Low, medical director for the AHS South Zone, which covers the area south of Calgary and includes Lethbridge and Medicine Hat, said the pandemic effectively thwarted recruitment while a wave of physicians left or retired.
“We knew there were gaps, but we didn’t maybe understand how vulnerable we were,” he said. “All of a sudden we realized, and people started to say that we were short physicians.”
Lethbridge Mayor Blaine Hyggen remembers having a similar “aha” moment. While campaigning during the municipal election in late 2021, it was a topic that came up constantly as he knocked on doors. “I don’t have a doctor,” he recalls being told over and over.
A Globe and Mail analysis last fall found access to primary care is getting worse in many parts of Canada despite the country having more family doctors than ever before. The crumbling ecosystem has been linked to improper human-resources planning and the primary-care field becoming less attractive because of factors such as compensation. And foreign-trained doctors have to deal with restrictive contracts.
In Alberta, any physician paid a recruitment incentive is subject to these contracts, which place doctors in rural towns or regional centres for, on average, five years. Dr. Low said once these agreements lapse, many doctors move to urban areas, often to connect with the larger cultural and religious communities there. He suspects that was the reason some physicians left Lethbridge.
With no single group dedicated to attracting and keeping family doctors in the small city, a change was needed. AHS, in cooperation with the municipal government, launched a largescale recruitment drive.
Of the 17 new doctors hired last year, 16 are internationally trained. Dr. Low said AHS spent between $50,000 and $80,000 to sponsor each physician to come to Canada while also covering the costs of relocation and assessments required of internationally credentialed graduates through Alberta’s regulatory body.
Not only did AHS “quickly expedite” what is often a gruelingly slow process, Dr. Low said, but direct placement to Lethbridge ensured the physicians could begin seeing patients while completing their months-long assessments. The city also stepped up.
Carly Kleisinger, who until recently was chief of staff to Lethbridge’s city manager, helped create a physician shortage action plan, which was approved by council last May to recruit and retain family doctors. It included petitioning the provincial government to improve health facilities and connecting incoming family doctors with a range of experts, from real estate and child care to recreation and education.
The city also spent $25,000 in marketing, part of which went toward scenic advertisements that ran across Canada. “Here are the stats, we need you here.
Stat!” one read.
Alberta’s southernmost city underscored local attractions, such as hundreds of kilometres of hiking trails and 320 days of sunshine.
Dr. Genevieve Nwankwo, a graduate of Igbinedion University in Nigeria, is among the latest cluster of physicians arriving in Lethbridge. She was living in Edmonton during the height of the pandemic and finishing her assessments. At the time, she said, there were no openings in Alberta’s two largest cities and she was worried about interrupting her family life by moving to a small community.
She said Canadian-trained doctors take on big-city roles, leaving limited options for primary-care providers like herself.
“So, Lethbridge was a catch – a good catch,” Dr. Nwanko said.
It meant her husband could continue working in his field and her two boys, ages 6 and 9, could keep up with French immersion.
She took over another doctor’s practice late last year and has already seen about half of her 1,000 patients.
At least six doctors are already practising in Lethbridge and all 17 of the new physicians are expected to be active by December.
Lethbridge resident Sara Peters remembers scrolling through Instagram late one night and seeing a post about a new doctor joining a nearby clinic.
Having been without a family physician for more than a year, she thought this might be her shot. Early the next morning, she called to inquire and was soon invited for a meet-and-greet with one of the doctors from the latest wave of recruits.
“There was certainly a relief I felt that I didn’t even maybe realize I was carrying around,” Ms. Peters said.
The next challenge is ensuring that the newest group of physicians doesn’t end up going back through the revolving door like so many of their predecessors.
Armed with a kind of care package that highlights what Lethbridge has to offer, city officials are now connecting directly with doctors to pre-empt another string of departures. It may sound simple but conversations like this just weren’t taking place before, said Mr. Hyggen, the mayor.
The incoming doctors will shorten the wait list, with each taking on between 1,000 and 2,000 patients, but the problem isn’t solved. The Chinook Primary Care Network website, which allows people to search for clinics accepting new clients, showed only opioid dependency practices last week.
Taylor Wiebe, 25, has been without a physician for about four years after trying to make an appointment with her family doctor and being told that he had moved. Walk-in clinics have served as a substitute but often she has to weigh whether it’s worth the hours-long wait.
“Every once in a while, I’ll call a bunch of clinics and offices and stuff and hope,” she said.
But Mr. Hyggen is hopeful Lethbridge has made a good start.
“Is it enough?” he said. “We’d like to have 30 or 40, but I’d say that 17 is better than zero.”

Canadian bank stocks not as safe as we think: Investors would be wise to consider the prospect of a future in which the institutions don’t churn out market-beating results regularly

Full text: MARKET FORCES Canadians are used to thinking of bank stocks as a safe, nearly guaranteed way to bet the market. They may want to think again.
The international evidence suggests that banking is becoming riskier and less profitable.
While Canadian banks have been extraordinarily successful during the past two decades, it’s questionable how long they can continue to be an exception to the general malaise in the global financial sector.
Investors would be wise then to consider the prospect of a future in which Canadian banks no longer churn out market-beating results with clockwork regularity.
If this happens, it would mark a major change from the world many of us take for granted. From March, 2003, until today, the five largest Canadian banks rewarded their shareholders with total returns, including dividends, of between 9 and 11.7 per cent a year.
Those are eye-popping results.
What is even more remarkable is that every one of the Big Five managed to perform better than the broad Canadian stock market.
There were no failures, no disasters, no horrific underperformers.
An investor could have picked any Canadian bank stock and done just fine.
Why were Canadian banks so utterly and consistently wonderful during this two-decade stretch? It’s not entirely clear, but their sterling performance stands out from their international peers.
In the United States, Britain and the euro zone, investing in bank stocks was an exercise in masochism over the past 20 years. To be sure, a substantial part of this subpar international performance stemmed from the 2008 financial crisis, when seemingly solid institutions such as Bear Stearns and Wachovia in the United States and Anglo Irish Bank and Northern Rock in Europe blew up over the course of a few months. But international banks haven’t staged much of a bounceback even as the financial crisis has faded into history.
Major European banks such as HSBC Holdings PLC, Banco Santander SA, Barclays PLC and Deutsche Bank AG have staggered from one problem to another over the past decade while generating mediocre profits and little, if anything, in the way of share-price gains. The recent forced takeover of Credit Suisse in Switzerland suggests the problems at European financial institutions aren’t going away any time soon.
Meanwhile, big U.S. lenders such as Wells Fargo & Co. and Citigroup Inc. have inflicted serial disappointments on their shareholders. So have smaller U.S. regional banks. The collapse this month of Silicon Valley Bank in California and a couple of smaller lenders shows the strains on smaller U.S. banks may be growing.
The most plausible explanation for why Canadian banks have avoided such problems is laid out in a 2013 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The report attributes the stability of the Canadian system to its topheavy structure. A handful of big domestic banks dominate the Canadian market and carry out the bulk of all financial activity. A single strong regulator, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, oversees them.
This system is much easier to supervise than its counterpart over the border. In the U.S., thousands of banks compete for business. Multiple regulators hold sway. Many financial functions occur in lightly supervised nonbank financial institutions that may not have much in the way of backstops if something goes wrong.
The contrast between the simplicity of the highly concentrated Canadian system and the sprawling complexity of its U.S. equivalent offers a reasonable explanation for the relative stability of Canadian banks. The top-heavy, oligopolistic nature of Canadian banking may also help to explain why Canadian banks have been so consistently profitable.
But it doesn’t guarantee that Canadian banks will forever escape the forces that have dogged banks in other countries. One of the biggest problems facing lenders everywhere is the generally saturated market for financial services and the ease with which savers and borrowers can transfer their business from one institution to another. That creates a vicious level of competition, which is only exacerbated by tighter postcrisis regulation, threats from high-tech disruptors, volatile interest rates and a sputtering commercial real estate sector.
In Canada, you can add the more specific challenge of a deeply indebted household sector.
Some Canadian banks have sought out new frontiers with aggressive expansions into foreign markets. The problem there is that it isn’t clear why Canadian banks should be able to thrive in other countries when local banks aren’t.
Canadian banks remain highly rated, stable institutions that are unlikely to fail. However, their stocks seem quite vulnerable to a sustained period of lacklustre performance. In fact, that period may have already started: Over the past five years, the stocks of four out of five of Canada’s largest banks have lagged behind the broad stock market. Is that a temporary aberration? Maybe not.
